FT  05 OCT 93 / Survey of Distribution Services (8): EC legislation sets the
pace - Environmental issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER CARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC LEGISLATION is the main force behind the introduction of environmental
measures by companies, according to a survey of the logistics and
distribution industry by management consultants PE International.
Eighty-one per cent of respondents cite Brussels as a main source of
environmental pressure, with 44 per cent indicating UK legislation and 40
per cent saying the impetus comes from customers.
The survey, produced earlier this year, revealed that more than two thirds
of companies expect operating costs to increase as a result of addressing
environmental issues. However, it also found that nearly all improvements
implemented so far have had a significant element of cost reduction.
Most companies are likely to have taken the obvious steps such as more
efficient routing and fuel economy measures, explains Mr Jan Szymankiewicz,
managing director of P-E's logistics consulting arm. He says that they are
less willing to take initiatives that do not produce savings.
When compared to other companies involved in logistics in sectors such as
retailing, dedicated distribution companies feel under less pressure to
respond to environmental issues. Their main concern, according to the
survey, is to meet the needs of clients and environmental action follows
from contractual arrangements.
In total, the companies surveyed - all members of the Institute of Logistics
and Distribution management, now merged into the Institute of Logistics -
are responsible for 40,000 commercial vehicles, 32,000 company cars and
1,700 warehouses. But only 19 per cent have a specific
logistics-and-the-environment policy. Only 7 per cent have so far carried
out work in all of the areas surveyed, which included environmental auditing
and adoption of relevant training policies.
There are bright spots: nine out of 10 companies expect to adopt
environmentally aware policies within the next five years, and larger
companies are taking the lead in introducing policies and training.
Parcelforce, the UK's biggest carrier of parcels and packages, won the Motor
Transport Journal's prestigious environmental award this year. It was judged
to be the haulier with the biggest environmental commitment. Parcelforce has
a battery of environmental measures.
Rather than wait for full implementation of the EC directive on speed
limiters next year, it has already set them to 56mph. Many other large
companies are keeping them at 60mph for as long as possible, saying fuel
consumption will rise. 'Our experience is that we are saving 7 per cent on
our fuel bill,' says Mr Ken Mabbett, Parcelforce's head of transport.
Advanced driver training has also reduced fuel consumption: 'They use the
vehicle better; they use the gears properly,' says Mr Mabbett. Parcelforce
has also improved vehicle design. Parcels can be loaded onto both decks of
the new 13-metre 'double deck' trailer, providing 60 per cent greater
capacity. A reduction of 20 per cent in overall trailer numbers is expected.
Innovations such as this are helping to ease traffic congestion, one of the
biggest environmental issues facing the industry. The government says that
in the 1980s motorway traffic doubled, and forecasts that by 2025 all road
traffic will increase twofold. Overall, however, although freight vehicles
cover more than 60bn kilometres in the UK each year, this is less than a
fifth of car mileage. The government is mooting a toll of 4.5p a mile for
lorries in its green paper on motorway finance, but tolls at this level are
unlikely to impact significantly on the volume of road freight.
The government claims that its intermodal freight initiative, which involves
44-tonne lorries being allowed on UK roads from next year, could reduce the
number of lorries on the road by about 5,000 vehicles.
'This is just a back door way of allowing 44-tonne lorries,' says Mr Stephen
Joseph, executive director of campaigners group Transport 2000. He foresees
the limit being raised for all lorries and points out that because bigger
vehicles are more economic, greater numbers of heavy lorries will appear.
Under EC legislation, the UK must allow trucks of up to 40 tonnes by 1999.
If the Department of Transport continues its policy of imposing improved
road-friendly suspension for lorries, some environmental damage will be
avoided. Unfortunately, it is restricted in doing this by European
legislation for some categories of heavy goods vehicle.
Companies actually regard the disposal of waste and packaging as the most
important environmental problem facing them. Large volumes of packaging
waste can accumulate at stores and depots, and companies have started to
sort, bale and recycle it. Some businesses have also had their hands full
with registration requirements for waste transportation required under the
Environmental Protection Act of 1990, which define waste very widely.
The industry is awaiting implementation of the EC directive on packaging and
packaging waste with some apprehension.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Survey of Distribution Services (7): Opinion divided over
tunnel - Rail and intermodal services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE advent of the Channel tunnel and development of related intermodal
road-rail transport facilities could open up a range of new European
distribution services.
On the other hand, say some distribution industry sources, the tunnel could
fail to attract the freight volumes anticipated - and hopes for general
expansion of intermodal transport could be dashed by a lack of investment
and suitable facilities.
The Channel tunnel will provide the distribution industry with two transport
options. First, it will carry rail-based freight and passenger services
between the UK and continental Europe. Second, it will carry rubber-tyred
traffic - lorries, cars and coaches - on specially-designed shuttle wagons
which will move between Folkestone and Calais via a loop system.
The second option, for both freight and passenger, will be operated under
the brand name 'Le Shuttle'. On the freight side, specially-designed
shuttles will accept vehicles up to 44 tonnes total vehicle weight, 18.5
metres in length, 4.2 metres in height and 2.6 metres wide. Each freight
shuttle will be able to accommodate 28 heavy goods vehicles.
Supporters of the Channel tunnel envisage it becoming a vital link in a
planned Europe-wide high-speed rail system connecting centres as far north
as Edinburgh, Glasgow or Copenhagen with southern points such as Rome,
Lisbon and Seville.
British Rail subsidiary Railfreight Distribution (RfD) predicts that this
sort of development should help to treble railfreight traffic between the UK
and mainland Europe over the next seven years. At present, trainferry and
'lo-lo' (lift-on/lift-off) railfreight traffic in that market totals about
2m tonnes, says RfD. It forecasts that by the year 2000 the figure will be
about 6.5m tonnes.
For the moment, however, general UK distribution industry opinion on the
viability of the Channel tunnel is divided, with debate continuing between
those who see the project as a potential catalyst for a much wider
development of European rail and road-rail intermodal transport services and
those who see it as a vast waste of money and effort. At this year's UK
Institute of Logistics &amp; Distribution Management conference in Birmingham,
for example, Mr Brian Bolam, managing director of TNT Contract Logistics
Europe, commented that 'there is a very big chance that the tunnel will be
one of the biggest white elephants of all time'. However, Mrs Ivy Penman,
head of international planning for NFC distribution company Exel Logistics,
said her company welcomed the Channel tunnel as a 'major catalyst for future
efficiency and growth'. She said the two competitive offerings from the
tunnel - the road or 'Le Shuttle' option and the through-rail alternative -
would provide a 'real choice for all logistics users'.
Over the past few months, general UK distribution industry interest in the
Channel tunnel and intermodal road-rail transport has begun to pick up with
the emergence of a steady stream of more positive news concerning
tunnel-related freight developments.
Last month, for example, saw the opening by British Rail's Railfreight
Distribution (RfD) division of a new Pounds 18m European freight operating
centre in North London which will process all freight trains transiting the
tunnel. And in Scotland, the main structural work for a new Pounds 8.6m
'Eurocentral' railfreight terminal in Mossend, Lanarkshire, was formally
inaugurated.
A month earlier, construction of a Channel tunnel-linked railfreight
terminal to serve north-west England was completed. The new Pounds 11m
Euroterminal, located at Trafford Park, Manchester, is one of nine such
facilities being developed in Britain by RfD. It is equipped to handle as
many as 100,000 containers/swapbody units a year and is designed to complete
rail-to-road transfers in less than three minutes.
Individual distribution service companies are also pressing ahead with new
developments designed to help them make use of the tunnel. Freight forwarder
Davies Turner, for example, is developing a new Pounds 2.5m terminal next to
the Manchester Euroterminal and will shortly open a Pounds 5m terminal at
Dartford, Kent.
Mr Philip Stephenson, Davies Turner joint managing director, says the
company's new Manchester facility is a 'good example of the way the private
sector can invest in the opportunities presented by the tunnel'.
The Dartford terminal, he says, will be used both for intra-European traffic
and as a gateway for freight coming in from overseas and destined for onward
distribution by road or rail in continental Europe. The company anticipates
using the Channel tunnel for some of that traffic.
'We definitely believe the Channel tunnel will have a role to play in
distribution. In continental Europe, the urge to put goods on rail is
enormous, particularly in countries such as Switzerland and Austria,' adds
Mr Stephenson.
That 'urge' is being further stimulated by European Commission support for
plans to establish a network of intermodal transport 'corridors' between the
biggest European centres, with rail providing the linehaul and road
operations being used to handle collection and delivery activities at either
end. The Commission plans to introduce further legislation to make it easier
for new combined transport companies to access European rail networks.
Mr Michael Browne, BRS professor of transport at the University of
Westminster, believes one of the big influences on the future growth of
intermodal distribution will be road haulage costs.
He told a recent intermodal transport industry seminar that road transport
was viewed by many companies as a relatively cheap resource. And short-term
costs might fall. But longer term, road transport costs were likely to rise
in real terms because of increases in fuel taxes, traffic congestion, more
road tolls and commercial vehicle bans. As a result, combined transport
would become more attractive.
However, other distribution industry observers warn that immediate prospects
for greater use of railways in the UK for moving freight could be inhibited
by uncertainty arising from the planned privatisation of British Rail. That
development is, for example, raising new insurance issues for companies
planning to operate or use Channel tunnel freight services.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Survey of Distribution Services (6): More changes ahead -
The retail industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL distribution in the UK has undergone two big processes of change in
the past two decades. In the 1990s, it may undergo a third.
Retailers have led the way in centralising and contracting out distribution,
and have done much to make that the norm across many different industries.
The process began in the 1970s, when supermarkets started using their
growing financial muscle to wrest control of the supply chain away from
suppliers and manufacturers. They established their own warehouses which
suppliers were instructed to deliver to, instead of direct to the stores.
The impetus for the move was the development of larger and larger
supermarkets. Food retailers realised they had to maximise selling space and
cut down storage space in their shops in order to compete.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the situation changed again as
retailers began consolidating networks of small local warehouses into a
handful of much larger warehouses. Technology also advanced rapidly, with
computer systems linked to scanning technology giving retailers much greater
information about customers' buying patterns, and allowing them to control
the supply chain much more closely.
As retailers began to pour money into expanding their superstore chains,
however, they started to cut down their investment in distribution,
increasingly contracting out that function - and the associated investment -
to third party specialists.
At first, that was largely at the level of vehicle fleet hire, but
eventually third-party contractors began to provide everything from
transport and personnel to warehousing.
By the beginning of the 1990s, retail distribution in the UK was highly
centralised. The Institute of Grocery Distribution found that an average of
83 per cent of goods were distributed centrally by retail multiples in 1991.
Tesco had reached 97 per cent; Argyll, owner of Safeway, 93.5 per cent; and
J Sainsbury 92 per cent. At the same time, the average level of
contracted-out distribution has reached about 50 per cent.
Dr John Fernie, of Dundee Business School, editor of the International
Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, has conducted a recent survey
of third-party distribution and says Tesco contracts out 55 per cent of its
distribution; Safeway 35 per cent; Sainsbury 60 per cent; and Asda about 70
per cent.
The fruits of these changes are evident from a survey by the Institute of
Logistics and Distribution Management which showed that UK retailers have
cut spending on distribution from 12.3 per cent of total costs in 1983 to
4.7 per cent in 1992.
That makes their distribution costs considerably cheaper than those for many
retail chains in continental Europe, and is one reasons why they achieve
higher operating margins than overseas counterparts.
But in the 1990s, a third change may be on the way. Industry experts say the
buzzwords are 'efficient customer response'.
The principal aim in distribution is now to reduce the amount of stock held
at all points along the supply chain, to try to move ever closer to the
ideal, whereby goods are whisked onto the supermarket shelves almost as soon
as they come off the production lines.
Mr Ian Canadine, director-general of the Institute of Logistics, says
retailers have previously tried to shift as much as possible of the
stockholding and associated costs onto suppliers. Now, however, they are
realising that those costs will eventually be passed back to them in the
form of higher prices for products, and they would do better to examine how
to reduce costs along the whole supply chain, to everyone's mutual benefit.
To achieve that requires greater co-operation between retailers and
suppliers. Ideally, suppliers need to receive Epos (electronic point of
sale) information to allow them to plan their production according to
genuine sales data rather than retailers' forecasts. To achieve the greatest
efficiency, however, suppliers need to receive information from all their
main customers.
Perhaps the most important 1990s buzzword, therefore, is 'partnershipping'.
Mr Jim Young, business director at PA Consulting Group, who has headed
several retail distribution projects, says the benefits of partnershipping
can be considerable. One project where a retailer was encouraged to
co-operate with suppliers resulted in a 30 per cent reduction in
stockholding, from six weeks to four weeks.
The sticking points, he says, include the traditionally combative
relationship between retailers and suppliers, and nervousness among
retailers about revealing Epos information.
'The biggest question is how you split the benefit down between the
manufacturer and the supplier,' he adds.
Closer relationships are developing, however. Asda, the UK's fourth-largest
superstore operator, is leading the way in sharing Epos information with
suppliers.
If the tendency spreads, retailers' warehouses may be used less for storage
and more as trans-shipment centres. If that happens, Dr Fernie speculates
that retailers could find their heavy investment in large distribution
centres in the 1980s has left them with bigger facilities than they need in
the 1990s.
Another important trend in the industry is for expertise developed in the
food retailing sector to be transferred into the non-food area, which has
been slower to adopt centralised distribution. 'What all the sophisticated
composite distributors are looking at now is non-food,' says Mr Ronnie
Frost, executive chairman of Hays, the business services group.
The process is already starting. Laura Ashley, the UK fashion and
furnishings group, has brought in Federal Express Business Logistics on a
10-year contract worth at least Pounds 150m. Its mission is to sort out a
somewhat labyrinthine distribution system, halve the value of stock in the
supply chain to Pounds 30m, and cut logistics costs by up to 12.5 per cent.
Finally, an important challenge to distribution specialists is the
increasing internationalisation of retailing. The pace of cross-border
expansion, mergers and acquisitions has quickened in the past year, and the
advent of the single European market is likely to accelerate the trend for
supermarkets to join European buying groups.
As retailers expand beyond their national borders, demand will increase for
distribution and logistics specialists with European, and even global,
reach.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Survey of Distribution Services (5): Focus on communications
 -Information technology
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISTRIBUTION companies have been swift to recognise that the delivery of
information is integral to the process of delivering anything else. Knowing
where the consignment is, what's holding it up, and when it will be
delivered can do as much for business and the customer's goodwill as
delivering the actual goods.
This depends on speeding information down the line to wherever it is needed.
To make the process faster and more efficient for everyone, not least the
end customer, different carriers may soon collaborate and co-operate in
passing information.
The distribution industry should have more to gain than any other in the
dismantling of European trade barriers and the rise of EDI - electronic data
interchange.
Information technology is being pressed into service despite different data
formats, incompatible systems, nationally based telephone networks, and
other historical quirks imposed by working in the real world.
The industry has already capitalised on such techniques as satellite
tracking, the use of bar codes and hand-held scanners for data acquisition,
and on-board laptop or even dashboard-mounted computers.
Its advances rely not on great leaps forward in technology, but in
imaginative use of what's available, with EDI as the mortar between the
bricks.
'The fast movement of information and systems to speed goods through the
supply chain is what logistics is all about,' says Nick Allen, editor and
publisher of the niche magazine Logistics Europe.
'It means supply chain management. It concerns everything from management of
stores right to manufacturing and physical distribution. Logistics Europe,
launched in January to coincide with the abolition of European trade
barriers, covers every aspect of logistics and distribution. The siting of
high-tech warehouses is a particularly hot topic.
Technology, according to Mr Allen, plays an increasing part, and is moving
at a brisk pace, with radio and satellite communications, warehousing and
new barcoding tools such as the PDS417 'chequerboard' which can contain
information about an entire consignment.
'There's a new philosophy coming from the US which suggests that logistics
is all about customer response,' he adds. 'It's led largely by the retail
and grocery business.' There are, he points out, a growing number of
companies large enough to take a global view, and some of them are
restructuring across Europe in response to changing trading conditions.
David Hobbs, associate director of the CMG consultancy responsible for
consumer products, also points to the integration of all sorts of services
and technologies.
These offer individual advantages, but merged together are beginning to
provide a seamless flow of information from manufacturing to the
distribution process.
In effect, the benefits - and the responsibilities - of the 'Just In Time'
manufacturing ethic are being pushed further down the line, right into the
area of delivery and distribution across national borders. But Mr Hobbs sees
problems in the legacy of different systems and protocols in various
countries.
'What clients need is a flexibility of approach to cope with rapid change.
This is reflected in the move to client-server systems, wide area networks,
and the ability of powerful communications to deliver worldwide logistic
information,' he says.
He points to the development of such technologies as satellite tracking,
which can pinpoint the whereabouts of a vehicle within 30m. Information
barriers here are artificial, like many a national border.
MSAS, part of the Ocean Group, is an airline carrier with a crusading
attitude to the removal of barriers in its industry. It has been campaigning
for the clarification of electronic information transfers, regulations, and
systems. These have been complicated by a number of different standards,
developments and protocols governed by different bodies.
'The question is which IT system and package is going to be acceptable and
compatible with the specifications dictated by regulations, procedures,
trends and market forces,' says Mr Geoff Corpe, managing director.
MSAS has developed its own package, Unitel 21, which it claims to be the
largest integrated information system in the world, recording information as
it happens, from initial booking through to pick-up, gateway despatch,
flight and delivery to consignee. Adaptability, for MSAS, means fitting in
with other systems used by contractors outside the air-cargo industry, and
the experience of building Unitel has given Mr Corpe a global view which
looks beyond air-cargo alone.
'If EDI is to come into more frequent usage, the industry body BIFA, and
large airfreight operators such as ourselves must continue to drive home its
benefits. The air cargo community must have a commonality of approach to
message standards, and service providers. At the moment a number of EDI
message formats exist such as CARGO-IMP, ANSI. X12 and EDIFACT (Electronic
Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Trade).
'But CARGO-IMP is a format designed by and for airlines, which allows only
for the exchange of information between the airline carrier and community
systems such as ACP 90 (Air Cargo Processing), and very soon CCS-UK (Cargo
Community System for the UK). It is too restrictive if it is to be quickly
available for consignors and consignees, whereas EDIFACT is the agreed
international standard, recognised by the United Nations and as such should
be adopted by the air industry.'
TNT White Arrow Express, part of the GUS Home Shopping Group, is another
leading investor in systems: GUS has invested over Pounds 65m in its IT
infrastructure over the past five years. It has concentrated on the other
end of the scale, local knowledge, which it has built into its delivery
structure using Geographical Information Systems. Its 38 delivery depots use
'sector management,' assigning delivery rounds not by the number of parcels
but by the territory.
Their data is mapped using software from GB Postcoder (the Royal Mail's
database of 24m UK addresses) and a 1:25000-scale Ordnance Survey map. In
consensus with the local drivers, whose long-standing expertise on an area
is built into the database, each address is assigned a time value. Each
depot has about 400 sectors, optimised to reflect local traffic conditions
and even buildings such as blocks of flats or industrial estates.
The workload then becomes easier to predict and drivers are paid by work
content rather than volume.
'The system bridges the gap between local intelligence and our own skills in
planning,' explains Tony Lowe, White Arrow's services director. 'All our
systems are developed now to improve quality of service, not just to reduce
costs. It makes us more efficient, because parcels don't get returned to the
depot: we know the driver can deliver the allotted load.' He claims a
remarkable improvement due to the system: delivery time within three days
rather than an average seven to 10 days. Future plans include onboard
computers to close the final gap; that of delivery confirmation.
Federal Express has used onboard computers since the 1980s and pioneered
real-time shipment tracking. Its latest innovation has, like White Arrow's,
been aimed at improving courier productivity. Every courier now carries an
ASTRA (Advanced Sorting Tracking Routing Assistance) label printer, which
eliminates human error by converting tracking data into routing labels
readable by both humans and machines.
Few companies have the resources of Federal Express, GUS and MSAS for
development from scratch. Wincanton Storage, a specialist in transport,
warehousing and distribution, has recently adopted the Miracle package from
London-based Calidus Systems. Its aim is to 'drive costs out of the supply
chain' by implementing the system at appropriate manufacturing and retail
customers in industries including ambient, fresh and chilled food, and DIY
products.
Wincanton's approach is typical of future trends, which will probably
concentrate less on functional organisation, and more on business processes.
This is the view of Chris Smith, marketing director for software products,
based in Andersen Consulting's European Software Centre in the south of
France. The spread of EDI, with client-server and distributed computing has
made it possible for processors and processes to communicate.
'One of the key issues is service,' says Mr Smith. 'The process of capturing
and fulfilling a requirement, from order through purchasing, manufacturing
and delivery could take place from different geographical locations:
ordering in one country, manufacturing in another, shipping in another,
invoicing from yet another. These are all possibilities becoming a reality,
enabled by a different type and style of information.'
However, he sounds a warning which echoes Mr Corpe's point about
short-sighted parochial borders. 'As an observer, we've noted that some
organisations are better able to communicate with outside partners than
internally.'

FT  05 OCT 93 / Survey of Distribution Services (2): Single market speeds
traffic - Pan-European operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMAL creation of the European Community single market at the beginning of
this year has already speeded up many cross-border transport and
distribution operations. But the development of widespread pan-European
distribution services and networks seems likely to take rather longer.
Earlier fears that some countries might not be ready to cope with the new
transport environment created by the single market have generally proved
wide of the mark, say distribution service operators. In fact, they claim,
removal of previous border controls and the disappearance of some 85 per
cent of Community transit declarations has accelerated the flow of goods.
That improvement has been particularly noticeable on long-distance road
movements. Overall transit times between the UK and southern Italy, for
example, are said to have been cut by as much as 24 hours, producing cost
savings of up to Pounds 300 per journey.
The real key to those sort of improvements, says Mr Geoffrey Simms,
vice-chairman of the international group of the UK Road Haulage Association
(RHA), has been harmonised customs procedures and faster clearance.
'The dismantling of border controls has had an impact. However, speedier
procedures for customs clearance have had a much greater effect,' he says.
'Prior to European harmonisation, RHA members could waste as long as a day
waiting for clearance from customs. This has been radically cut with
European harmonisation - particularly in France, Italy and Spain - and is a
major benefit to the haulage industry.'
Road-based distribution service activities should further benefit from
recent agreement among EC transport ministers on the format of the remaining
directives needed to complete the single market for road transport
operations.
Specifically, they decided on a common tax for trucks using EC roads,
clearing the way for the full implementation of road cabotage under which
hauliers from one member state can pick up and deliver goods within another.
In that context, EC transport ministers agreed in June that the number of
cabotage licences issued within the Community should rise from the current
figure of 18,500 a year to 30,000 in 1994 and then by 30 per cent annually
until full liberalisation in 1998. As a result, intra-EC road transport
should become much more efficient and - in theory - cheaper.
However, while road transport operations are benefiting from the advent of
the single market, Europe is still generally some way from becoming one
large 'domestic' market as far as distribution is concerned. For the moment,
most goods still tend to be distributed on a national basis. But, says Mr
Michael Browne, BRS professor of transport at the University of Westminster,
that situation is likely to change as cross-border trade increases.
'We can expect to see the growing internationalisation of carriers'
activities, with a company providing full national distribution services in
more than one country. Companies with a customer base that includes
multinationals manufacturing in several European countries will need to
decide their best strategies,' he says.
The influence of manufacturers on the future course of European distribution
industry development is also cited by the RHA's Mr Simms, although he does
not envisage immediate large-scale rapid changes in that area.
'The question of whether Europe will really become one large 'domestic'
market is to a large extent dictated not by the hauliers but by the
manufacturers who own or supply the goods being transported,' he comments.
'It is also dictated by the fundamental traditions which characterise the
European market. Whereas international haulage between countries is a
reality, most countries continue to operate their own domestic distribution
systems. And because such distribution systems are so fundamental, there
will be no immediate change in this arena.'
Reinforcing the argument that many European distribution activities are
likely to remain primarily nationally-based, at least in the near-term, is a
pronounced lack of cross-border retailing operations.
Even those retailers which have established operations in several countries
still tend to organise their distribution activities on a country-by-country
basis.
That point is confirmed by Mr Ronnie Irving, managing director of
international distribution activities for UK-based logistics service company
Christian Salvesen Distribution (CSD). He says leading logistics service
companies realise they must provide different services to retailers in
different countries.
'For example, the business profile CSD has in France is very different to
that in the Benelux countries and our operations in Spain are quite
different to those in Germany. This is a fact which, I believe, will remain
for many years to come,' says Mr Irving.
Elaborating on that point, he claims the single market has not changed the
logistics scene in terms of its effect on secondary distribution in the
retail sector.
'What the Single Market has changed, however, and continues to change, is
the way manufacturers look at their logistics and how they view supply chain
management,' he adds.
Manufacturers would continue to reduce the number of production points they
had in the EC. Instead of having two or three factories manufacturing all
the products in their range in each EC country, they would take advantage of
economies of scale by producing only certain lines in certain countries and
then transporting those products to the countries of consumption.
Most distribution industry observers go along with that picture of future
European distribution, at least over the next few years.
The important thing for distribution service providers, they add, is to
develop a clear strategy to cater for that scenario.
'More and more companies supplying logistics services realise that their
future requires them to develop a European strategy. While some have sought
to build a Europe-wide logistics network, others have been more cautious and
have concentrated on their core skills, transferring these when possible to
new markets,' concludes Mr Browne.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Survey of Distribution Services (4): Debate is renewed -
Contracting out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION and the resulting pressure on company costs have revived debate
about the relative merits of in-house distribution versus contracting out
such operations to third-party specialists.
There have, for example, been suggestions that some large UK retailing
groups - generally acknowledged as leaders in distribution systems
development - might reverse the trend of the past 20 years and resume direct
control of previously contracted-out distribution activities.
Several distribution market surveys during the past two years have indicated
disenchantment among some manufacturers and retailers over the performance
of their contractors. As recession began to bite, some companies found
themselves locked into contracts which gave their contractors
inflation-linked cost increases at a time when their own turnover was
declining.
'When things were going well, companies perhaps signed distribution
contracts without looking as closely as they should have done at clauses on
costs. With the general downturn in activity, some people began to wish they
had considered those sort of points more thoroughly,' commented one leading
UK logistics industry consultant.
At the same time, the development of ever-more-sophisticated and reliable
information technology (IT) systems increasingly enables manufacturers and
retailers to exert tight control over areas of distribution activity where
they now have plenty of experience. And that, it is suggested, is opening up
new opportunities for companies to re-establish more in-house distribution
management. Overall, though, the arguments for and against contracting out
distribution remain finely balanced. That point was highlighted in a study
of distribution issues published earlier this year by the commercial and
distribution committee of the UK's Freight Transport Association.
On the issue of costs, for example, the FTA study concluded that the
operating cost of an effectively-managed in-house distribution operation was
unlikely to differ much from one contracted out.
'It can be argued that a large contractor can use its purchasing power to
secure more favourable terms for supplies of equipment, sites and
consumables. In practice, however, many in-house operators are able to do
better deals themselves,' said the report.
'A poorly-managed, inefficient in-house operation which perhaps has not
taken advantage of the latest technology is a different matter. A contractor
may be able to offer cost savings in this case. But these probably could
have been secured by the in-house operator reorganising his own systems.'
Generally, added the FTA report, the main motivation for a company
contracting out its distribution was likely to be the benefit of the
contractor's specialised distribution know-how. Contracting out distribution
did not necessarily save money.
The FTA's findings on the relative costs of in-house and contracted
distribution activities are significant because that area is now widely
regarded as the most important factor in many companies' approach to
distribution.
The point is reinforced by Mr John Stocker, group director business
development for distribution company Ryder PLC. During the 1980s, he said,
development of distribution systems was often all about supporting business
growth and increasing service levels.
'Now, people still want service levels, of course, but the focus tends to be
on how they can take out costs. There is a lot of benchmarking going on -
and distribution is one of the areas people are looking at most keenly.'
However, while such pressures are encouraging some companies to consider
bringing distribution activities back in-house, demand for third-party
specialist services is also growing. Ipswich-based contractor Russell Davies
Distribution, for example, has over the past three years increased its
annual turnover for UK contract distribution business from Pounds 2m to
Pounds 19m and plans to double that by 1997.
The end result as far as the overall distribution market is concerned is a
continuing mixed picture. Most of the UK's leading supermarket groups, for
example, are continuing to run some distribution activities in-house as an
insurance policy and a benchmark with which to compare their contractors'
performance.
Mr Angus Clark, the director responsible for distribution and logistics for
food retailer J Sainsbury, told a seminar organised by Exel Logistics
earlier this year that he expected the distribution industry to continue
developing in both directions. He pointed out that Homebase, Sainsbury's DIY
subsidiary, was content to have warehouse and transport operations run on
its behalf by Exel. For the supermarket business, though, the group operated
some of the activity directly but outsourced most to third-party operators.
'We believe this combination gives us the advantage that we continue to
source ourselves with experienced and professional distribution management,'
he said.
'It makes research and development easier - both on methods and systems - if
we have our own test beds. And it provides us with direct cost comparison to
help us manage the contract operations successfully, and to feel satisfied
about their performance.'
One relatively new trend starting to become more apparent in the UK
distribution sector is a return to favour of third-party common-user
operations where two or more customers share the same facilities and
services.
The popularity of common-user systems declined during the 1980s as companies
sought the service advantages of dedicated operations. But now, says Ryder's
Mr Stocker, 'people are realising that there are economies of scale to be
gained from shared user networks.'

FT  05 OCT 93 / Survey of Distribution Services (3): Increasingly prominent
role - UK companies target Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT news that UK-based logistics service company McGregor Cory, part of
the Ocean Group, is to build an Pounds 18m distribution centre in Spain
highlights two trends in the UK distribution industry as a whole.
First, there is an increase in the number of leading operators who are
building up their presence in continental Europe. And second, there is a
tendency by several of those companies to base their European expansion on
links with specific customers rather than setting up service networks and
then looking to win new business.
The announcement of McGregor Cory's new venture in Spain, for example,
coincided with news that the company's Spanish subsidiary, Serralta, had won
a six-year, multi-million-pound contract from detergent and household
products manufacturer Procter &amp; Gamble covering the warehousing and
distribution of products in Iberia.
Other distribution companies are following a similar path. Mr John Stocker,
group director business development for Ryder PLC, the UK arm of US-based
Ryder System Inc, said: 'Our approach is to enter a country either with a
customer or with a target industry - it is not our intention to set up a
European network and invite customers to use it.'
Not all UK distribution companies have adopted that philosophy, though.
Business services group Hays, for example, this summer followed up the
acquisition of French specialist distribution business FRIL for Pounds 37.5m
in 1992 with the purchase of a 75 per cent shareholding in German national
contract distribution business Mordhorst for Pounds 32m.
A spokesman for Hays said that unlike some of its UK competitors which had
bought smaller continental distribution service operators and sought to
integrate them, it had purchased companies which already had national
networks. The present generally cautious mood among UK distribution
companies when it comes to European expansion in part reflects the fact that
a number of earlier efforts to develop operations on the continent ran into
problems.
For example, even one of the UK's most experienced distribution operators in
continental Europe, Transport Development Group, was recently forced to
close French road haulage subsidiary Translittoral at a cost of more than
Pounds 12m following persistent heavy losses.
Mr Alan Cole, TDG chief executive, said one of the problems had been that a
big company such as Translittoral had found it hard to compete with small
hauliers prepared to operate at very low margins in a business where there
was little scope to add value to services.
The economic recession in many European countries is further encouraging
caution among UK distribution companies.
TDG's results for the half-year to June 30, 1993, for example, show how the
present downturn in continental European transport business is hitting
overall profits. While operating profits in the UK rose from Pounds 13.8m in
the 1992 half-year to Pounds 15m this year, profits for continental Europe
fell to Pounds 2.9m compared with Pounds 4.3m in the first half of 1992.
NFC group, reporting its latest results last month, said that while positive
signs of economic recovery were beginning to emerge in the UK, the economic
scene in mainland Europe was 'more complex'. Trading remained 'difficult',
particularly in Germany and Spain.
Longer term, however, leading UK distribution companies believe their widely
acknowledged expertise will enable them to become increasingly prominent
players on the broader European scene.
For example, McGregor Cory executives claim their company's planned Spanish
distribution centre at Mataro, some 30km north of Barcelona, will break new
ground as far as Iberian logistics operations are concerned.
Their 22,000 sq m building, due to become operational by September 1994,
will feature a combination of fully-automated high bay warehousing capacity
and conventional manual low bay space. That, they say, will make it the
first such multi-user facility in Spain and probably Europe as a whole.
NFC's thrust into continental Europe is being spearheaded by Exel Logistics
whose European developments over the past year have included work on a
multi-regional chill distribution network in France; the integration of
German distribution company Theo Macke u Sohn; and establishment of a new
operating unit in Belgium.
Also expanding in continental Europe is Christian Salvesen Distribution.
Profits for its continental activities increased by more than 40 per cent in
the year to end-March to just over Pounds 6m. CSD said it experienced
particularly good growth in the Benelux countries, while in Germany a
loss-making contract was terminated and efforts were refocused on the
company's original retail distribution business. Profits in France were held
back by the lorry drivers' strike but the retail customer base was
increased.
Other well-known UK distribution companies to announce new developments in
continental Europe over the past year include leading parcels carriers such
as Securicor Omega Express, United Carriers and Parceline. They have all
expanded coverage through partnership and consortia arrangements.
Prominent among the more general UK-based logistics service operators to
expand on the continent recently are Hogg Robinson, P&amp;O and Tibbett &amp;
Britten.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Survey of Distribution Services (1): Cinderella industry
finds its feet - The European distribution industry is poised for a big leap
forward.  The advent of the EC single market has removed costly border
controls and opened up the opportunity of distributing goods to a market of
320m people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE distribution and logistics sector is a classic Cinderella industry. In
the past 30 years it has been transformed from a rather unglamorous servant
into the indispensable partner of a whole range of businesses.
Despite the Europe-wide recession, the industry and its influence is
continuing to grow and the advent of the single European market has opened
up many new opportunities.
A couple of decades ago, it was very different. Logistics was not a concept
associated with industry at all, but was defined in dictionaries as a branch
of military science dealing with 'the moving of and providing for troops'.
Distribution, says Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman of Hays, the business
services group, had a rather more downmarket reputation.
'Thirty years ago, distribution meant 'I have wheels; I'll carry something
for you'. Warehousing meant 'I've got a waterproof roof; I'll store
something for you',' he says. 'Now it means running a sophisticated,
computer-controlled business.'
The reason for the change was the realisation by manufacturers and service
companies that holding large amounts of stock was costly and tied up
valuable working capital.
They began to see distribution as a capital-, fuel- and labour-intensive
business that lay outside their core activity.
Increasing numbers of companies began contracting out their distribution to
outside specialists and found they could reduce operating costs and improve
margins as a result.
As technology has advanced, many distribution and logistics contractors have
now developed skills beyond the expertise of many industrial companies.
Logistics specialists offer complete supply chain management which is highly
reliable and cost-effective as well as providing 'just-in-time' inventory
systems, so reducing stocks and improving companies' return on capital.
The results can be seen clearly in figures from the Institute of Logistics
and Distribution Management, which found distribution costs as a percentage
of UK companies' turnover fell from 17 per cent at the start of the 1980s to
4.7 per cent in 1991-92.
Now the European distribution industry stands on the brink of another big
leap forward.
The advent of the single European market has removed costly and
time-consuming border controls and opened up the opportunity of distributing
goods to a market of 320m people.
The impact of the single market has been mixed. It has undoubtedly cut costs
for distributors, and reduced journey times by up to 24 hours for
trans-European trips. But the expected development of truly pan-European
distribution companies has been held back by the comparative slowness of
manufacturers to create Europe-wide operations.
Some companies, such as Unilever and Ciba Geigy, have started to close
national factories and concentrate their production sites to achieve greater
efficiency.
Many businesses have also sought to reduce the level of inventory in the
supply chain by centralising distribution. They have moved away from
national sites to warehouses servicing regions of Europe. Philips, the Dutch
electronics group, for example, has rationalised a whole network of national
warehouses into three regional centres.
But the development of pan-European operations has been hampered in many
cases, says Dr James Cooper, director of the Cranfield Centre for Logistics
and Transportation, by two factors.
One is the tendency for marketing departments to be organised along national
lines, with the distribution director reporting to the marketing department.
This, in turn, has been reinforced by the slowness of manufacturers to
standardise product ranges across Europe, instead retaining different
products, with different labels and packaging, for different markets.
There are, of course, exceptions. Unilever has formed Lever Europe and put a
marketing director in charge of each product category throughout Europe
rather than give national marketers control over the whole range in each
country.
Unless more companies follow suit, Europe-wide distribution networks will
remain difficult to achieve.
'Progress towards removing national barriers has been much slower and more
laborious than anyone expected when all this started three or four years
ago,' Dr Cooper says.
That means that some distribution companies who established Europe-wide
capabilities have been left with costly over-capacity.
'You end up with a chicken and egg situation,' says Dr Cooper. 'Do you set
up the network before the customer is ready, but risk getting into trouble
if they don't follow you?'
The deregulation of the distribution services industry with the creation of
the single European market has, however, been very successful.
The bilateral permit system, whereby pairs of governments used to regulate
all haulage between their countries, was progressively broken down from the
mid-1980s onwards. Full deregulation was achieved on time at the end of last
year, making the whole industry more dynamic.
Moreover, this has been followed by national deregulation of distribution
services by several countries including France, the Netherlands, and Spain.
Even Germany is loosening the tight controls on its distribution sector.
The impact of both these changes has been lessened to some extent by
recession, which is still deepening in many parts of Europe.
Although distribution companies have suffered from the slowdown in movement
of goods, however, few have gone out of business.
The recession may even have some positive effects. Mr Ian Canadine,
director-general of the Institute of Logistics, says the need to cut costs
has led even more companies to contract out their distribution.
It has also led to a more open, co-operative approach. Instead of insisting
on dedicated fleets carrying their own liveries, customers have become more
prepared to share vehicles and facilities, he says.
Mr Canadine believes partnershipping of a different kind may be another
important trend in the 1990s. He expects retailers, distribution companies,
and suppliers to work more closely together on cutting down stockholding at
every point in the supply chain, to their mutual benefit. That will involve
exchanging electronic point-of-sale information, and linking systems
together.
'It's not about beating the other guy into submission,' Mr Canadine says.
'You have to have real partnerships based on trust, where all sides get a
fair share of the deal.'
Technology will continue to be a driving force in the industry, with the
most important advances, as Mr Canadine suggests, expected to be in
information technology. Linking systems together through electronic data
interchange will be a priority, as will developing the use of satellite
communications to allow the whereabouts of goods to be tracked right the way
down the supply chain.
A final factor shaping the development of distribution services will be the
environment. The Braer tanker disaster off the Shetland Islands in January
highlighted the impact a transport vehicle can have on the environment.
A survey earlier this year found two thirds of distribution companies
expected operating costs to increase as a result of addressing environmental
issues, although they admitted that nearly all the improvements already
implemented had reduced costs. One example is speed limiters to maximise
fuel efficiency, compulsory since August last year for new vehicles and now
being extended to all vehicles built after January 1988.
The increasing congestion of Europe's transport infrastructure, especially
its roads, may lead to some structural changes in the industry.
Increasing road traffic, coupled with the EC proposal that member states
should be allowed to charge for the use of motorways to pay for their
upkeep, and the opening of the Channel tunnel, could see a renaissance of
the rail network as a freight carrier.
The EC plans to establish a network of intermodal transport 'corridors'
between main centres, with rail providing the main links, and road
operations being used to handle collection and delivery at either end.
Meanwhile, Railfreight in the UK is investing Pounds 500m in new facilities
connected with the Channel tunnel and hopes to more than triple the annual
volume of cross-Channel rail freight to 6.5m tonnes by the mid-1990s.
It says the tunnel will cut 24 hours or more off comparable trans-European
journeys by road. Manchester to Milan, for example, should take 32 hours by
rail, compared with 60 by lorry. Such developments may speed up progress
towards a truly pan-European distribution sector.

THE US Federal Reserve Board has granted a subsidiary of the Bank of
Montreal powers to deal in commodity derivatives, a decision that is
expected to apply to other US bank holding companies. The Fed ruling will
extend competition between banks and broker-dealers - already fierce in
financial products - to non-financial futures and options.
Before the decision, banks were allowed to trade financial instruments on US
futures and options exchanges, but were barred from clearing or servicing
customer needs in exchange-traded energy or agricultural derivatives.
In its ruling the Fed said Chicago-based Harris Futures Corporation could
execute trades and clear non-financial transactions at the US's three
largest futures exchanges. However, Harris will not be allowed to trade
commodity futures and options for its own account, trade the physical
commodities, or offer commodities investment advice.
In seeking the Fed's approval, Harris Futures said it expected 10 per cent
of its commodity futures and options business to come from large managed
futures funds. Funds have become increasingly interested in commodities as a
means of diversifying financial portfolios.
The Fed's finding that commodity derivatives dealing 'is closely related to
banking', was greeted enthusiastically by Chicago's futures exchanges, where
member banks have been restricted from clearing trades in agricultural
futures and options.
'This action is good for the banks, for the customers, and for the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange,' said CME chairman Mr Jack Sandner.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexico divorces farm subsidies
from output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT CARLOS Salinas of Mexico yesterday unveiled a radical reform of
his country's agricultural sector, announcing that price supports for basic
grains such as maize would be replaced by cash payments to farmers according
to the amount of land they owned.
The programme breaks the link between subsidies and production, as farmers
will receive the same payment for land whatever and however much they
produce. Under the new scheme there is bias in favour of maize production
and well-off farmers who sell a lot of maize will not receive the bulk of
government aid.
'Mexico is moving to the most efficient agricultural support system in the
world,' says Mr Luis Tellez, the MIT economist turned agriculture
under-minister. 'We will be the only developing country where people look at
a vector of international prices when making their production decisions.'
The new system commits Mexico to opening the way to maize imports in two
years - which it had promised to do in 15 years under the proposed North
American Free Trade Agreement. The price liberalisation will enable the
government to direct subsidies to the most needy farmers but will increase
agricultural imports and very probably accelerate migration from the
country's rural sector to cities and to the US.
Government officials say the reform will go ahead even if Nafta is not
approved by the US congress. Under Nafta, the US and Canada would be the
main beneficiaries of increased grain exports to Mexico, while without the
treaty the rest of the world could export to Mexico on equal terms, they
note.
At present the Mexican government pays farmers about 750 new pesos (Dollars
242) for a tonne of maize, the national crop, and transport and marketing
costs (worth another 160 pesos), compared with an international price plus
delivery of about 450 pesos a tonne. (Consumers pay an average of about 450
pesos a tonne, although those in Mexico City pay 350 pesos, and those in the
countryside up to 750 pesos).
The land subsidy will be given to farmers who were producing subsidised
grains, although once the scheme starts they can produce whatever they want.
The subsidy will be given for 10 years and then phased out over the next
five years.
The price support system is being scrapped, in part because it
over-stimulated maize production and so held back other crops. The value of
maize output increased from 408m pesos in 1989 to 1.635bn pesos in 1992,
while the rest of the agricultural sector stagnated. This both increased the
financial burden of maize price support and threatened to turn Mexico into a
one crop country.
The government further contends that farmers over-exploited marginal land
for maize production, since the return from selling the crop was
artificially high. For example, farmers might deforest land and plant maize
at a maize price of 750 pesos, but not at 450 pesos.
The old scheme did little to help Mexico's poorest farmers, who do not sell
maize but consume it themselves. For this reason one of the plan's strongest
supporters is Dr Arturo Warman, the government's agrarian attorney and a
left-leaning anthropologist.
According to government figures, the average farmer in the northern state of
Sinaloa produces six tonnes of maize a hectare, giving a subsidy of about
2,760 pesos a hectare. The average farmer in the southern state of Oaxaca
produces about two tonnes a hectare, most of which he consumes, so that he
hardly benefits at all from the price subsidy.
It is reported that the direct support will give all of Mexico's 2.5m maize
farmers a minimum of 400 pesos or so for each hectare of land they own, with
farmers on the most productive lands obtaining a little more than double.
The government is planning to increase the total financial subsidy for
agriculture from 6.4bn pesos this year to some 11bn pesos next year.
Observers point out that farmers will receive their cash payments a few
months before next year's presidential election, and describe the programme
as a vote-buying scheme. The government contends that large numbers of rich,
politically important farmers will lose out from the programme.
While the political impact of the reform is hard to predict, there will
certainly be a switch from grain to non-grain production, such as fruits,
vegetables or tobacco. Officials hope that farmers will be able to borrow
against future land payments to make necessary investment in converting to
higher value crops.
But in many cases farmers will not be able to sell maize or any other crops
profitably at international prices. Some recent studies by academic
economists suggest that as many as 700,000 farmers could be forced out of
work by full liberalisation of maize prices.
While offering direct subsidies will soften the blow of price
liberalisation, one official says: 'In the end we will have fewer people
working in agriculture as a proportion of total employment. You cannot
expect to improve the standard of living in the countryside when you have 22
per cent of the economically active nation producing just 8 per cent of
GDP.'

CHINA HAS foreshadowed the establishment of an international gold market to
facilitate trade in the precious metal and enliven flagging local
production. This important step would end a 44-year-old state monopoly on
gold purchases.
Mr Cui Dewen, Vice-President of the gold administration under the Ministry
of Metallurgical Industry, said last week that the end of the People's Bank
 -China's central bank - monopoly on gold purchases was overdue and the best
way to curb a raging black market.
'A standardised gold market is a must to bring the gold industry under
market management,' he told the English Language China Daily. He gave no
hint, however, on when such a step might be taken.
Mr Cui's remarks follow the government's move last month nearly to double
the state purchase price from Yn51.2 to Yn96 a gramme (USDollars 520 a troy
ounce at the official rate, but Dollars 346 at the open market rate) to
reflect the metal's value in the international market.
The China Daily article said Mr Cui indicated that the establishment of an
official gold market would be accompanied by a crackdown on flourishing
black markets in the big gold producing provinces. State gold purchases fell
by more than 50 per cent in the first six months of this year compared with
the same period last year as miners either withheld product or sold on the
black market.
China is also taking steps to open its gold-mining sector to foreign
involvement. It has been circulating a draft law that would end an effective
ban on foreign participation in the gold sector, but miners are being told
that they will be restricted to marginal areas.
The China Daily quoted Mr Ai Dacheng, a senior official of the gold
administration, as saying that a list of mines open to foreign involvement
would be announced next month. He noted that big gold producers from the US,
Canada, Australia and South Africa had shown interest in exploring China's
resources. But among barriers to their participation was the country's state
gold purchase monopoly.
Foreign mining executives had made it clear to China that the freeing of the
local gold market was one of the first requirement for international
involvement, Mr Ai said. The representatives were also pressing for
'realistic' royalties on gold produced.
In draft legislation presented at a recent conference in Beijing, China
proposed a royalty of 10 per cent, but representatives of companies like
Newmont Mining of the US, CRA of Australia and Cominco of Canada indicated
that this was unacceptably high compared with rates of 2 to 3 per cent in
many developing countries.
China has about 600 gold mines, but many are tiny and employ primitive
methods. At least one-third are estimated to have been losing money because
of the low state purchase price, and spiralling productions costs.
Mr Cui said that the new local price for gold would track that on the London
market with a slight discount. He indicated that it might take some time for
an international market to develop locally. But he was adamant that it would
be part of an important reform of China's financial markets. 'The gold
market, like that in many other countries, will play a key role in China's
financial market,' he said, adding that further reforms of China's foreign
exchange system were required.
China's official gold production last year reached about 110 tonnes,
compared with demand of 250 tonnes.
Since restrictions were eased on domestic gold sales in the past year or so,
the Chinese have emerged as the world's leading purchasers of gold
jewellery. Driving demand for gold in China is the desire of many people to
hedge against inflation, which reached 17 per cent in urban centres in the
first six months of this year.
In its present five-year plan (1991-95) China planned to spend UDollars
1.3bn on exploration and development of its gold deposits. Estimates of
in-ground gold reserves stand at about 3,000 tonnes.
China's People's Bank is reported to have been a seller of gold recently,
and this is one of the reasons advanced for the dip in the gold price
internationally.
The bank last year purchased a substantial portion of the 400 tonnes of gold
sold by the Netherlands central bank. China has not published its gold
reserves statistics since 1981.

TROPICAL TIMBER producing and consuming countries yesterday began a third
round of talks to try to agree a new international tropical timber accord,
amid continuing divisions over its scope and financing. The present pact,
adopted in 1983, expires at the end of March next year.
Informal talks since the second round of negotiations broke up in June have
failed to resolve the differences between the two sides. Delegates were
meeting last night to decide whether to extend the negotiations, held under
the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, from
one week to two.
Producing and consuming countries remain split over producer demands that
temperate timber should be included in the new accord. Producers are also
insisting on additional financial help to meet the proposed stipulation that
by the year 2000 all tropical timber exports should come from sustainably
managed forests. This target was set two years ago by the International
Tropical Timber Organisation which runs the 1983 pact.
Tropical timber producers, which have already lost international market
share to temperate woods because of environmental concerns, argue that
exporters of temperate timber should be subjected to the same conservation
disciplines through inclusion in the treaty.
The present accord has 50 producer and consumer members accounting for
between 80 and 90 per cent of the Dollars 7.5bn annual world tropical timber
trade.

COCOA futures peaked at a new 40-month second position high of Pounds 983 a
tonne before slipping all the way back to close at Pounds 967 a tonne in the
near March position, Pounds 2 below Friday's level. Dealers said there was
no fresh news, people were just becoming more wary as the market approached
the psychologically significant Pounds 1,000. 'I think people believe it's
gone too far too fast,' one trader commented. The COFFEE market spent the
day trying to build a base following its recent correction and the January
contract closed at Dollars 1,173 a tonne, up Dollars 1, after trading
between Dollars 1,165 and Dollars 1,177. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER
prices edged off their lows, but still remained easier. News that Kennecott
workers at Bingham Canyon had reached a tentative agreement removed a
potential prop from the market as the three months position fell Dollars 10
to Dollars 1,690 a tonne. NICKEL trading slackened in the afternoon, with
the market paying less attention to the events in Moscow which had prompted
early firmness. The three months price closed at Dollars 4,170 a tonne, up
Dollars 57.50 on balance.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Options surge gives LCE boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Commodity Exchange experienced a 63 per cent jump in trading
volumes last month compared with a year ago, driven by record turnover in
cocoa futures and options and in coffee options.
The LCE said a total of 431,714 futures and options contracts were traded, a
rise of 27 per cent on August. Volume in the year to date is up nearly 25
per cent on the same period of 1992.
The exchange, which has been streamlining its operations to concentrate on
core contracts, said the number of futures contracts traded in cocoa, its
most popular commodity, had risen by 96 per cent to 249,195.
Cocoa options had soared by 557 per cent to 19,532 contracts and coffee
options were up 76 per cent at 27,014.
Total open interest in September - the number of contracts which had not
been liquidated - was 65 per cent higher than a year ago and 13 per cent up
on August.
The LCE also announced that 1,655 lots were traded on the first day of the
premium raw sugar futures contract launched last Friday. 'The support from
LCE members and the international sugar trade has been very good indeed,'
said Mr Robin Woodhead, chief executive. Interest was more subdued yesterday
with 700 lots traded by late afternoon.
The exchange's other contracts are in white sugar, potatoes, international
freight, wheat and barley.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China considers opening
non-ferrous metals mines
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA IS considering opening its non-ferrous metals mines to foreign
investment and broadening its own investments in copper mines overseas,
according to the China Daily, reports Reuter from Beijing.
The official newspaper quoted Mr liu Wanling, an official at China National
Non-ferrous Metals Industry Corporation, as saying that his country was keen
to raise its production of restricted metals like aluminium and copper and
would seek overseas capital to enable it do so.
China has eased shortages of most non-ferrous metals with the exception of
copper and wants to mobilise foreign investment to exploit overseas copper
mines, Mr Liu said.  Officials have inspected mines in Australia, South
America, Africa and Russia.
'We hope to raise foreign funds to construct copper mines in foreign
countries,' Mr Liu said, although he acknowledged that would not be easy as
the world's best mines were already occupied.
China's broader reah overseas would coincide with the opening of its
non-ferrous mines to foreign capital, especially for zinc, lead and other
metals abundant on the mainland, he said.
China had begun negotiations on proposed joint ventures in the non-ferrous
metals industry that would be far larger than the 220 existing joint
ventures, Mr Liu said.
China's long-term hope is to raise per capita consumption levels closer to
world standards, thereby boosting production.
For example, the Chinese consume less than 1kg of aluminium per head a year,
far below the 20kg to 30kg in industrialised countries.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesian oil output in
decline
</HEADLINE>

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OIL COMPANIES are scaling back operations in Indonesia and completed only
half their budgeted exploration-well programme last year, according to a
report by the US embassy in Jakarta.
Oil and condensate production fell 5 per cent in 1992 to an average 1.5m
barrels a day. Industry analysts expect production to be held at this level
until 1995 before declining towards 1m b/d by the end of the decade.
Net crude and condensate exports fell 17.6 per cent last year to 700,000
b/d, the result of an 8 per cent increase in domestic consumption. Indonesia
is expected to be a net oil importer by the end of the century.
The report says geologists are 'guardedly optimistic at the prospects of
finding new oil reserves. . . in remoter areas' of eastern Indonesia but
notes that only eight of last year's 124 exploration wells were in that
region.
Industry executives say incentives to explore frontier areas are inadequate
and cite high exploration costs at over Dollars 20m a well. Government
officials say improved incentives, allowing companies to maintain a greater
share of production, will be announced by the end of the year.
In contrast, Indonesia's gas sector has continued to perform well. The US
embassy report forecasts liquefied natural gas exports to rise about eight
per cent to 25m tonnes this year, worth over Dollars 4bn.
A sixth production unit with a capacity of 1.4m tonnes a year is being
commissioned at the Bontang processing plant in Kalimantan and a seventh
unit, worth Dollars 750m, has been ordered. This follows a string of
exploration successes by Total of France in its Mahakam River basin block in
East Kalimantan.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: European prices recover from Moscow
mark-down
</HEADLINE>

THE OUTBREAK of violence in Russia sent European government bonds tumbling
at the start of trading, but while the markets remained volatile for much of
the morning, prices closed higher across the board as investors bought on
weakness and relief at President Boris Yeltsin's apparent success in
crushing the rebellion.
Bond dealers were glued to their television screens for much of the day,
closely following the events in Russia. But after the initial marking down
of European bond prices, many felt that the reaction had been too dramatic.
'This is a classic case of over-reaction by the European government bond
markets,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg
Securities.
He pointed out that the turmoil in Russia was obscuring the generally
favourable economic background to the European bond markets which are
expected to benefit from falling inflation and cuts in interest rates.
THE GERMAN government bond market, usually one of the most sensitive to
turmoil in Russia, recouped its early losses and closed higher.
The bund future contract, which closed at 98.86 on Friday, opened at 98.35
yesterday and reached a high of 99.05 before trading at 98.97 in late
afternoon.
UK GILTS ended higher on the day, as dealers pointed out that many investors
regard sterling assets as a safe haven in times of turmoil.
Furthermore, the economic background still looks favourable in the UK and
supply worries have disappeared temporarily.
The market's immediate domestic concerns remain the Conservative Party
conference this week, and the release of the September inflation figures
next week. Gilts closed between  1/8 and  1/4 point higher on the day with
10-year issues seeing the biggest rise.
JAPANESE government bonds opened on a weak note, as dealers marked down
prices on the back of the weekend's events in Russia while news of further
supply at the long end depressed prices even further.
However, late short-covering revived the market and government bond prices
ended higher on the day.
Japanese bond prices weakened in overseas trading on Friday, following the
announcement by the Ministry of Finance that it will no longer buy bonds
outright through its trust fund bureau.
The bureau has bought about Y100bn of bonds a month over the last nine
months, dealers said.
News that the Ministry of Finance plans to auction about Y300bn of 20-year
bonds today pushed down prices at the long end, an area of the market which
has performed well in recent weeks as investors looked for capital gains.
Furthermore, since the cut in the official discount rate last week, some
investors have shifted into the longer maturities for the yield, as they can
obtain a higher return than on bank deposits and other Japanese investments,
dealers said.
US Treasury prices were little changed in late trading yesterday, leaving
analysts surprised that the flight-to-quality that was expected to accompany
news of political unrest in Russia failed to materialise.
In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down
3/32 at 103 15/32 , yielding 5.994 per cent. At the short end the two-year
note was unchanged at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.825 per cent.
The news overnight of intense fighting in Moscow, set the scene for early
gains in Treasuries.
Yet any benefits for the Treasury market yesterday were short-lived. Prices
firmed at the opening, but by early afternoon were flat and soon after
slipped into negative territory.
On the domestic front, news of an unexpected 1.1 per cent decline in August
construction spending helped the long end of the market in early trading.
Investors' attention, however, soon shifted to Friday's September employment
report, and longer-dated prices eventually drifted lower. Analysts expect
the jobs report to show an increase in payrolls of about 150,000.

VOLUME at Chicago's two big futures exchanges surged in September.
Chicago Board of Trade volume hit 16.4m contracts in September, up 34 per
cent from a year ago. Volume for the first nine months of the year was
131.2m, a 15 per cent increase from a year ago.
Although some analysts expected turnover in CBoT's Treasury bond futures to
fall after a US Treasury decision to issue fewer long bonds, September
T-bond futures volume jumped 25 per cent to 7.4m and T-bond options by 60.5
per cent to 2.5m.
At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, exchange-wide volume hit 13.8m contracts
in September, the second-busiest month on record and a 20.4 per cent
increase from a year ago. For the first nine months, CME volume was up 11.2
per cent at 110.5m contracts.
Eurodollar futures and options volume scored a record in September, at 7.8m
contracts. Eurodollar options volume advanced 29 per cent over last year,
and Eurodollar futures 34.8 per cent.
Exchange officials attributed the robust activity to institutional swaps
traders who lay off risks from over-the-counter transactions on the
exchanges.

FT  05 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Report examines ways to
reduce settlement risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WORKING group set up by the central banks of the Group of 10 leading
industrial nations and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has
published a report* examining ways to reduce risk and increase efficiency in
the settlement of cross-border and multiple-currency transactions.
The settlement of such transactions raises significant systemic risk
concerns, owing to the huge daily volumes involved. For example, the BIS
estimates that global foreign exchange market activity amounted to Dollars
880bn per day in April 1992.
The lack of simultaneous delivery of currencies and the interdependence of
payment system participants throughout the world also present considerable
risks, the report says.
A fundamental concept highlighted in the report is multi-currency
delivery-versus-payment (DVP) which ensures that the final transfer in one
currency only occurs if a final transfer of the other currency or currencies
also takes place.
When transfers are made using a DVP mechanism, 'Herstatt risk' - that is,
the loss of the principal value of one or more payments in a sequence - does
not arise, though other risks may still be present.
The term 'Herstatt risk' derives from an episode in 1974 when a German bank
of that name was closed at the end of the German banking day but before the
end of the banking day in North America.
As a result, the D-Mark leg of some of Herstatt's foreign exchange contracts
had been settled before the closure of the bank but the dollar legs of those
contracts had not yet been fully paid.
The report also notes that serious liquidity problems could arise in the
absence of a multi-currency DVP settlement process.
For instance, a fear of incurring a principal risk might lead some market
participants to refuse to honour their obligations in earlier-settling
currencies out of concern that a 'suspect' counterparty would not be able to
settle its associated obligations in later-settling currencies.

and multi-currency transactions, published by the Bank for International
Settlements, Basle, Switzerland.

FT  05 OCT 93 / International Bonds: France Telecom opens 13-year maturity
with FFr2bn offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc sector of the international bond market was active
yesterday as France Telecom and the Kingdom of Sweden raised FFr3bn between
them.
Other features included a Dollars 500m seven-year issue from Telecom
Argentina which was heavily-oversubscribed, and exchangeable bond offerings
from Pennzoil, the US oil company, and Cir, the holding company of Mr Carlo
De Benedetti, the Italian industrialist.
France Telecom opened a new maturity in the French bond market with its
FFr2bn offering of 13-year Eurobonds. The bonds were priced to yield 16
basis points over the interpolated yield curve between the French government
bonds due 2004 and 2008.
Joint lead manager CCF said that the low re-offer price of 98.53 indicated
that France Telecom might re-open the issue at a later date. There was
strong demand for the bonds in Germany and Switzerland.
Sweden insured itself against a rise or a fall in French interest rates with
its FFr1bn offering of callable Eurobonds. This structure has been used
extensively in the Eurolira sector in recent weeks.
The bonds have a life of 10 years but are callable after two years. The
bonds were priced to yield 35 basis points over the 6 3/4 per cent French
government bond due 2003 but yielded 90 basis points over two-year
government notes.
Lead manager CCF said around a third of the issue was placed with domestic
investors and the rest elsewhere in Europe. Supranational, corporate and
institutional investors were the main buyers.
Demand for Telecom Argentina's issue was such that it was able to raise
double the amount it had originally planned as well as complete its
borrowing needs for this year.
Lead manager Chase said the issue was the largest from a Latin American
corporate borrower after Cemex's Dollars 1bn five-year issue which was
launched in May. It was therefore likely to become the benchmark for other
Argentine private-sector borrowers seeking to access the Eurobond market.
More Latin American issues are expected in the next few weeks, including a
Dollars 100m three-year offering from Perez Companc, Argentina's largest
private oil producer.
Pennzoil and Cir tapped current demand for convertible paper with
exchangeable bond offerings designed to re-finance their equity holdings in
Chevron and Olivetti, respectively.
Lehman Brothers, which arranged both deals, said Pennzoil's 10-year Dollars
250m offer appealed to investors seeking defensive holdings. The issue is
callable after five years, giving investors an exposure to the oil sector
and the dollar.
Cir's L282bn issue offers exposure to a recovery in Olivetti's share price.
The five-year deal was priced at a discount of 81.50 and yield to maturity
was 6 1/4 - 6 1/2 per cent.

FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Japanese retailer takes a
surprise gamble on China - China, amid an austerity programme and resurgent
political uncertainty, is reckoned by Kazuo Wada to offer the ultimate in
risk and reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES

<TEXT>
IN 1989, Mr Kazuo Wada made an unusual move for a Japanese businessman. He
moved the headquarters of his Yaohan retailing group from Nimazu in Japan to
Hong Kong.
At that time, Hong Kong was struggling to come to terms with the political
implications of the Tiananmen Square massacre, property was cheap and
influential friends were easily made. Hong Kong was to prove a springboard
for Mr Wada's growing ambitions in China.
Later this month his timing will face a similar test, as he attempts to sell
this story to investors by listing his holding company, Yaohan
International, on the Hong Kong stock market amid a Chinese economic
austerity programme and a resurgence of political uncertainty.
In 1990, Yaohan had three department stores in Hong Kong; it now controls
seven stores, three listed companies, and chains of restaurants, cake
stores, games centres, leather boutiques and home appliance stores. By the
end of 1994, Mr Wada says he will control eight stock market-listed
companies in Hong Kong.
But in spite of this spate of activity in Hong Kong, China has remained Mr
Wada's great rallying cry. The 21st Century will be the era of China, he
claims, and he plans to get in early, opening 1,000 supermarkets in the
still-backward nation by the year 2,010.
Mr Wada said: 'China is now where Japan was thirty years ago. Japan will
still be a big market for Yaohan, but they already have a lot of
merchandise.
'Yaohan has more potential in China, where people have nothing.'
China remains a controversial choice. Other retailers have seen turnover
slide in the face of Chinese vice premier Zhu Rongji's moves to curb
speculation and excessive growth in consumer spending.
As one analyst said: 'You see a lot of people walking around Beijing
department stores, but you don't see them buying anything.'
But Mr Wada disputes this view. Yaohan manages a department store in
Beijing, which claims to have seen steady growth in sales since it opened
earlier this year.
Yaohan clearly understands one of the keys to business in China. It has
built up connections with substantial Chinese corporations, including China
International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) and China Venturetec
Investment Corporation (CVIC). CITIC's Australian subsidiary recently
purchased 10 per cent of Yaohan International, while CVIC has a 5 per cent
stake.
CVIC owns the company's Beijing store, and Yaohan has also formed a joint
venture with China's largest department store operator, Shanghai Number One
department store to construct what will be Asia's largest department store.
Yaohan has a 51 per cent stake in the project, which will cost USDollars
100m and will create a store with a sales area of 122,000 sq metres,
equivalent to Harrods in London or Macy's in New York.
When Mr Wada announced the deal in 1991, he said it would mark 'the
beginning of the era of China'. But in a country that in 1992 had gross
national product of USDollars 355 a head, compared with more than USDollars
1,800 in neighbouring Thailand, it is hard to imagine that China is ready
for such an ambitious project.
But China has substantial hidden resources and an extremely high savings
rate, so disposable income is already significantly higher than the
statistics suggest. Mr Wada is planning for the long term.
He intends to build Yaohan's presence primarily through 'International
Merchandise Marts'.
These will circumvent China's inefficient wholesale system by acting as
distribution centres for numerous Yaohan franchise stores, which would be
primarily owned by local Chinese government. However, no meaningful
contribution is expected from China until 1997.
The flotation of Yaohan International will be sold to investors as a
pan-Asian retailer that has skirted the Japanese recession, using a strong
yen to move successfully into the broader South East Asian marketplace.
But the underlying strategy for the flotation is to raise its profile and
roughly HKDollars 600m (USDollars 77.6m) in capital to aid a push into
China, which is would include vast chains of department stores, fast-food
restaurants and cake shops.
As the largest and least developed of the world's consumer markets, China is
both the ultimate risk and reward for retailers.
Mr Wada, for one, is confident that investors will accept the challenge.

sun goes down - Michiyo Nakamota in Tokyo finds out what measures Japanese
companies are taking as they try to combat recession

JAPANESE companies are generally loath to admit unexpected turns of event.
But at the mid-way point of the fiscal year, investors are bracing
themselves for a number of nasty surprises.
As companies assess business activity in the first half - ended September -
they are being forced to downgrade their earnings expectations which, more
often than not, have turned out to have been on the optimistic side.
Last week Mazda, the car maker, and Matsushita, the consumer electronics
group, joined a growing list of companies deeply troubled by the weakness of
the Japanese economy and having second thoughts about the outlook for
earnings as a result.
Mazda said its losses this year would be Y32bn, more than 2 1/2 times its
initial forecasts. Matsushita predicted its profits would be Y63bn, 35 per
cent lower than last year - it originally thought they would be 3 per cent
up at Y100bn.
Both companies blamed the further weakening of the Japanese economy and the
rapid appreciation of the yen. 'The situation has made it difficult for us
to achieve our target for the first half,' a Matsushita representative said.
'We expect the slowdown to be prolonged.'
When Japanese companies made their initial earnings forecasts for the year,
there were still hopes that government measures to stimulate the economy
would trigger a recovery in domestic demand later in the year.
In June, the Economic Planning Agency even announced that the economy had
bottomed out.
The summer months, however, were to prove those early hopes of a revival not
only premature, but over-optimistic; things were set to get worse.
The pick-up in domestic demand failed to materialise. Both personal
consumption and capital spending by companies continued to sag: department
store sales in Tokyo dropped 6.6 per cent in the year to August, and
private-sector machinery orders fell almost 12 per cent in July.
Japanese consumers, feeling the effects of the economic slowdown through
smaller summer bonuses and worried about possible redundancy, decided they
could not afford to replace cars or stereo sets. The gloom was aggravated by
an unusually cold summer, which had a debilitating effect on personal
consumption.
Meanwhile, the government stimulus failed to have much of an impact. A
government survey in August showed Japanese business confidence at its
lowest level for almost two decades.
'There is something of a crisis of confidence in the Japanese economy,' said
a representative of NEC, the electronics maker, when it reduced its forecast
of annual profits from Y50bn to Y30bn.
This weakness in domestic demand has been coupled with an unexpected surge
in the yen's value against the dollar, which has been little short of
disastrous for many Japanese manufacturers. Since the beginning of the
fiscal year the yen has risen about 5 per cent, wiping billions of yen off
overseas earnings.
Mazda said the yen's rise would reduce revenues by Y65bn, while Matsushita
noted that the impact of the yen's appreciation against major currencies
would amount to a loss in annual revenues of Y132bn.
While the strength of the currency was expected to depress profits at the
start of the fiscal year, companies recognise that the impact is likely to
be even greater in the second half, not only because the yen has continued
to strengthen but also because their ability to hedge dollar earnings will
be significantly reduced.
Japanese executives stress the strenuous efforts they are making to respond
to the bleak conditions. Manufacturing costs are being slashed, capital
spending is being curtailed and R&amp;D investment is being trimmed to save the
last yen.
Restructuring has become the latest catchphrase and corporate priorities are
being reassessed as never before. Debates are aired in public over the need
for higher productivity, particularly among white collar workers.
In a reversal of conventional Japanese corporate wisdom, it is becoming
increasingly acceptable to talk of the greater importance of profitability
over market share.
'It is a perfect time for management to carry out these ideas,' said Mr
Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita.
But in spite of these efforts, as a beleaguered Mazda executive explained
last week, it has been difficult to deal quickly enough with the
deterioration in the Japanese economy and the speed of the yen's rise.
As companies wait for the effects of restructuring measures to come through,
the growing consensus is that Japanese corporate earnings will this year
fall for the fourth consecutive year, and recovery will be delayed until
well into 1994.
Before recovery comes, however, it is likely to be preceded by still more
nasty surprises.
On top of further pain caused by the strong yen, it is increasingly likely
that further job cuts will have to be made.
So far, Japanese companies have been averse to meeting the decline in
business activity through big staff cuts. Life-time employment is a
commitment they have been unwilling to sacrifice. On the whole, the most
that has been done is to implement voluntary retirement schemes and suppress
recruitment.
'Corporations are continuing to act as an unofficial social security
system,' said Mr Peter Tasker, strategist at Kleinwort Benson. Mr Tasker
noted that personnel costs continued to rise in the second quarter by 4.3
per cent year on year.
He said: 'It is hard to see how corporate restructuring can take place
without a significant labour market adjustment.'
If that happens, however, Japanese companies will once again have to admit
to a disturbing and unexpected turn of events.

FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Merged hospital chain to expand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW US hospital chain formed through the takeover of Hospital
Corporation of America by Columbia Healthcare will acquire 10 to 20
hospitals per year, according to Mr Richard Scott, chairman of Columbia,
Reuter reports from New York.
Mr Scott told an analysts meeting that the enlarged company, to be called
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, will also acquire at least 10 to 20
outpatient clinics per year.
He estimated that the new hospital chain, which will combine the two biggest
US hospital groups after the Dollars 5.8bn takeover, will spend about
Dollars 400m per year on acquisitions.
Mr Scott said Columbia/HCA will focus on acquisitions of individual
hospitals in locations in which the two chains currently operate. 'That's
where we get our biggest returns,' he said.
'I think it will mostly be individual acquisitions,' Mr Scott said, noting
that Columbia is in the process of buying a hospital in Independence,
Missouri and is working on acquiring two more hospitals there and a third in
Chicago.
He said the merged hospital chain is likely to purchase some tax-exempt
hospital systems.
Mr Scott also reiterated that the takeover - announced on Sunday - is
expected to result in cost savings of Dollars 75m in 1994 and Dollars 130m
by 1995.
He said reduced costs will boost earnings of the new entity by at least
Dollars 0.10 per share. There will be no dilution to earnings from the
merger.
Mr Scott said Columbia hoped to receive approval for the merger from the SEC
by late November and to close the transaction by the end of the year. He
said the two companies do not foresee any anti-trust problems.
The merger is the most significant sign so far of consolidation in the US
healthcare industry prompted by the Clinton reform plans and by market
pressures for lower medical costs.

FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Minorco buys 4% of Metall Mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINORCO, the offshore investment arm of South Africa's Anglo American
Corporation, is to tighten its mining links with Metallgesellschaft by
taking a small stake in the German metal group's fast-growing international
mining subsidiary.
Minorco has agreed to buy 3.1m shares, equal to a 4 per cent stake, in
Toronto-based Metall Mining, in which Metallgesellschaft has a 68 per cent
interest. The deal is worth about CDollars 31m (USDollars 23.2m) at current
market prices.
Dr Heinz Schimmelbusch, Metallgesellschaft chairman, yesterday expressed the
hope that the deal would be the first step towards a long-term alliance
between the two groups.
Dr Schimmelbusch said that he viewed Minorco's involvement in Metall as an
opportunity for future co-operation. 'We interpret it as a sign that the
friendly fleets have established contact, and that they intend to keep
fending off common enemies,' he said.
Each company will have a window on the other's projects through the planned
appointment of Mr Hank Slack, Minorco's president, to Metall's board.
Minorco and Metallgesellschaft are partners in the Navachab open-pit gold
mine in Namibia, and have indirect links in other international mining
ventures.
Metall last week announced plans to shift its gold mining assets into a new
privately-owned company, to be owned jointly with Australia's Poseidon Gold,
in which Minorco is an indirect shareholder.
Minorco has narrowed its focus on natural resource investments. Under a
restructuring announced last month, it is taking control of Anglo American's
non-diamond investments outside Africa - notably Anglo's unquoted mining
investments in South America.
Metall expanded its copper interests last month by acquiring
Metallgesellschaft's European copper smelting assets. But low copper prices
led the Canadian company to put off plans last week for a CDollars 170m
public share issue, which would have helped finance the purchase.
Metall issued 15.9m shares to Metallgesellschaft in exchange for the copper
assets, raising the German company's stake to 68 per cent from 60.5 per
cent.

FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mexican cornflour producer sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government has sold Maiz Industrializado Conasupo (Miconsa), the
country's second-largest cornflour producer, for Dollars 140.1m to an
investor group headed by Mr Raymundo Gomez Flores, a prominent Guadalajara
businessman.
Miconsa has about 26 per cent of the cornflour market, behind Maseca, the
market leader. Mexicans make about a third of their tortillas, part of the
country's staple diet, with processed cornflour and the remainder using
traditional methods. Analysts estimate the majority of tortillas will soon
be made with processed cornflour, which is cheaper than traditional methods.
The winning group bid about 7 per cent more than its nearest rival, an
investor group led by Mexico's biggest bread producer, Bimbo.
Mr Gomez Flores recently failed in a bid for Asemex, the Mexican state
insurance company privatised last month. He controls Banca Cremi, a bank
that is to merge with Banco Union, and Dina, the truck company listed on the
New York Stock Exchange. Mr Gomez Flores also has a significant stake in the
fruit company Del Monte Fresh Produce.

FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Trotman to take over from Poling
as Ford chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent and ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALEX Trotman is to take over as chairman, chief executive and president
of Ford, the world's second-largest vehicle maker after General Motors, with
effect from November 1.
He will replace Mr Harold Poling, 67, who will retire at the end of the
year.
Mr Trotman has emerged as the favoured candidate in recent months to lead
Ford in preference to the earlier front-runner Mr Allan Gilmour, who remains
as one of two vice-chairmen.
Mr Trotman, 60, has moved rapidly through the senior ranks of Ford since
serving as president and then chairman of Ford of Europe in the second half
of the 1980s.
In 1989 he moved back to the US to become executive vice-president of Ford's
North American automotive operations, and was appointed president and chief
operating officer of Ford Automotive Group in January.
Born in Middlesex, UK, and educated in Edinburgh, Mr Trotman joined Ford as
a student trainee in the purchasing department of Ford of Britain in 1955,
following service as a flying officer-navigator in the Royal Air Force.
Much of his career at Ford has been spent in product planning. He became
director of Ford of Europe's car product planning office in 1967. He moved
to the US in 1969 and was appointed chief car planning manager for Ford in
North America in 1975, the year in which he became a US citizen.
In the early 1980s he also served for a period as president of Ford
Asia-Pacific, before becoming president of Ford of Europe in 1984.
With the retirement of Mr Poling, Ford will lose one of the leading figures
of the US auto industry, who has emerged in recent years as one of the most
outspoken champions of tougher action by the US government to reduce the
large Japanese automotive trade surplus with the US.
After two years of heavy losses, Ford returned to profit in the first half
of 1993 and has gained significant market share, partly at the expense of
its bigger domestic rival, General Motors.
MacMillan Bloedel, the Canadian forest products group, will maintain its
interest in KNP BT, a Netherlands fine paper and packaging group, by taking
its share of a KNP rights issue for CDollars 64m, writes Robert Gibbens in
Montreal.
MacMillan owns 17 per cent of the enlarged KNP, which is making a rights
offer to bolster its balance sheet. MacMillan will buy 2.85m new KNP shares.

FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Congress holds key to Telebras
sale - Privatisation hinges on abolition of monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investors have played a central role in making Telebras, Brazil's
state-owned telecommunications holding company, the flagship of the Sao
Paulo stock exchange.
They will be keenly watching the expected Congressional debate over whether
to abolish the state's constitutionally-guaranteed monopoly over the sector
 -an essential first step towards privatisation.
Telebras often accounts for more than half the trading on the Sao Paulo
stock market, whose market capitalisation last month topped Dollars 100bn
for the first time. The government owns more than 50 per cent of voting
shares, which make up one-third of total capital. Mr Stephen Rose, of London
stockbrokers Stephen Rose and Partners, says 24 per cent of the company is
held by the government and more than a quarter by foreign investors.
The debate over the state monopoly - part of the constitutional revision
process beginning tomorrow - will take place in a climate of uncertainty for
Telebras. A scandal revolving around an alleged extortion attempt by the
company's former finance director prompted the board to suspend
international capital markets operations. A Y10bn Eurobond was cancelled,
while a planned Dollars 150m Eurobond and a share offering of up to Dollars
500m in American depositary receipts (ADRs) were put on hold.
Some analysts now expect that the group's ambitious Dollars 3.5bn investment
programme for 1993 will have to be slowed as cash flow is channelled into
paying 1992 dividends.
A survey by the Brazilian Institute of Political Studies suggests that the
elimination of the monopoly might be an uphill battle. In the Chamber of
Deputies, the lower house, 45 per cent of legislators questioned said it was
'extremely' or 'very' important for the government to operate directly in
telecommunications, compared with 35 per cent who said it was 'not very
necessary' or 'unnecessary'.
'Except for cellular telephones, the sector will probably remain a state
mono-poly . . . this being a strategic sector,' predicted Mr Humberto
Lucena, president of the Senate.
Pro-privatisation forces have not lost hope, however. 'It will be a
difficult fight, but there are already groups in Congress working on this,'
said Mr Renato Johnsson, a leading advocate of privatisation.
Those in favour of privatisation may be aided by the bribery scandal. A
Salomon Brothers report predicted that the scandal would strengthen the
pro-privatisation lobby. It added that the episode could also bolster the
case of those who defend a US-style regional break-up over a unitary sale of
the Telebras conglomerate, with its 27 regional and one long-distance
subsidiaries. Leading subsidiaries 'have longed to escape from the control
of the holding company', said the Salomon report.
In spite of the controversy, Telebras shares have remained above Dollars 30
for a 1,000-share lot, up from about Dollars 18 at the start of the year.
The stock had gained steadily since the government announced early this year
that it would permit real increases in fees, reversing initial indications
that prices would be held down in order to fight inflation. This was
reflected in Telebras' recent results, which showed net profits of USDollars
1.23bn for the first eight months of the year compared with Dollars 431m in
the same 1992 period.
However, the tumult could hurt investment plans. Until the recent
suspensions of its planned operations, Telebras had successfully tapped
capital markets. 'We'll easily pass our investment goal of Dollars 3.5bn
this year,' the company predicted in August, adding that it was also ahead
of its target for the installation of new lines.
The proposed ADR offering was part of Telebras' search to fund investments
to increase the number of telephone lines to 11.7m from 10.5m by the end of
this year, with a goal of 15m by 1995. Brazil has 6.8 lines per 100
inhabitants, lagging Argentina (11.8) and Uruguay (13.9).
If there is any slowdown in investment for 1993, analysts say, it will only
be evident during the final months of the year, as dividend outlays and
suspended capital market operations take their toll.
Meanwhile, the closure of access to new finance is strengthening the
arguments of those who favour privatisation. 'We have to recognise that the
state doesn't have the resources,' said Mr Johnsson.

FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P upgrades Chrysler's debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US carmaker, yesterday had its debt rating upgraded to
investment grade from speculative by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating
agency.
The move was foreshadowed in June, when S&amp;P placed Chrysler's double B plus
senior debt rating on creditwatch with positive implications.
Yesterday, S&amp;P raised its rating on Chrysler and its credit arm, Chrysler
Financial Corporation, to triple B.
The company had about Dollars 12.8bn in outstanding debt at the end of June.
S&amp;P's action completes Chrysler's goal of cutting its borrowing costs.
Moody's Investors Service last month lifted Chrysler's debt rating to
investment grade.
The higher grade allows Chrysler access to a broader investor base. It is
particularly important for Chrysler Financial Corp, which borrows frequently
in the bond markets.
Chrysler has staged a dramatic financial recovery in recent years. S&amp;P
praised the company's well-designed and fortuitously-timed new products, in
addition to its improved operating efficiency. 'Management continues to
demonstrate a conservative financial policy, lending confidence that the
surplus cash generated in coming years will be used to further increase cash
reserves and reduce debt, putting the company in a much better position to
weather the next downturn,' the agency said.
However, S&amp;P noted that Chrysler has a relatively thin product line and
depends on a fiercely competitive market in North America. As a result,
Chrysler's fortunes are expected to continue to fluctuate widely, 'limiting
the potential for additional rating upgrades', S&amp;P said.

FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Nintendo reduces profits
forecast

<TEXT>
NINTENDO, the Japanese electronic game maker, has conceded that its decade
of growth had ended, as it cut a pre-tax profit forecast to Y121bn (Pounds
759m) from Y170bn for the year to March, down 26 per cent on a year earlier.
Super Mario, the company's mascot, was brought down by a strong yen, which
undermined sales in foreign markets. Sales for the year are projected at
Y500bn, down from the forecast of Y600bn, and 11 per cent lower than last
year.
The Kyoto-based company had earned more last year than Matsushita, Japan's
largest consumer electronics maker, and had been confident that the rapid
international growth of video games would continue.
Nintendo set successive profit records by keeping the core workforce at 890
employees, contracting out much of the product development and successfully
marketing and controlling the flow of software. The company faces increasing
competition from Sega Enterprises, another Japanese maker, which has been
prepared to cut prices and has surpassed Nintendo in developing game
technologies.
Nintendo intends to cut its reliance on exports in the second half and
launch a sales drive on the domestic market, where it has been hindered by a
slowing economy: 'In the first half, our export ratio was 59 per cent of
sales, but we expect that it will fall to 42 per cent in the second half.'
It is preparing to make equipment in China, but said the positive effect on
costs would 'not be seen this year'.

into the red
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AEROSPATIALE, the French state-owned aerospace group, suffered net losses of
FFr870m (Dollars 150m) in the first six months of the year, almost double
the FFr477m net loss in the first half of 1992.
The group, which is included on the list of 21 public companies selected for
privatisation by the French government, blamed the decline on the depressed
state of the international civil and military aviation markets.
Aerospatiale said that a return to profits required continued restructuring
and economy measures in the coming months.
Sales fell by 12 per cent to FFr22.98bn for the first half of the year.
Aerospatiale said it expected full-year sales to decline.
The first-half performance included an exceptional charge of FFr640m
resulting from the cost of provisions for the group's restructuring plan.
The plan, announced at the beginning of the summer, includes the loss of
2,240 jobs by the end of next year.
This exceptional loss was partly offset by an exceptional gain of FFr415m as
a result of the sale of shares.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPE BULL, the French state-owned computer group, is to sell one of its
two French manufacturing centres as part of a rationalisation programme
aimed at stemming heavy losses.
According to Bull, it has agreed in principle to sell its factory at
Villeneuve d'Ascq in northern France to Decathlon, a French distributor of
sporting goods. Bull declined to comment on the price of the proposed sale.
The decision comes at a time when Bull is under increasing pressure to
reduce losses which have amounted to about FFr15bn (Dollars 2.6bn) over the
past three years.
The company has asked the French government for FFr9.2bn in new capital over
the next two years to help it fund a restructuring plan which includes 6,500
job losses and a shift in emphasis from the production of computer hardware
towards services and the supply of software.
The French government is considering Bull's request for a capital injection
and is expected to make an announcement within the next week. But Mr Karel
van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, is considering opening an
inquiry into the French state's financing for the computer group.
Industry analysts argue that a return to profitability at Bull requires a
shift in production to low cost sites, possibly outside Europe and the US.
The sale of the Villeneuve d'Ascq plant is regarded as a step in this
direction.

THE directors of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) were forced yesterday to
reaffirm their support for the Alcazar project to combine forces with KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines following media reports
in Scandinavia alleging opposition to the alliance at the highest levels in
SAS.
SAS said the Alcazar negotiating team, led by Mr Jan Carlzon, who resigned
as SAS president and chief executive last week, had the full support of the
board and new management. 'SAS's position in favour of Alcazar is unchanged.
The organisation changes made by SAS last week combine the purpose of
completing the Alcazar negotiations in a manner satisfactory to SAS and the
purpose of improving SAS's profitability,' SAS said.

FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa, UAL confirm agreement
on partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA yesterday signed a wide-ranging commercial partnership with United
Airlines, the biggest US international carrier. The deal is expected to
intensify competition on international routes, especially across the north
Atlantic, and speed up the privatisation of the German national carrier.
Although the two sides said the agreement did not involve any equity swap,
they did not rule out eventual equity investments once Lufthansa was
privatised.
Lufthansa said the foundations for the United partnership had been laid by
the agreement reached 10 days ago between Germany and the US on a new
bilateral air pact between the two countries.
'The new aviation agreement and the co-operative alliance between Lufthansa
and United are important prerequisites for early moves towards Lufthansa's
privatisation,' the German airline added.
The partnership with United would help reduce Lufthansa's heavy losses on
the north Atlantic and return the company into the black, Mr Jurgen Weber,
Lufthansa's chairman, said. The German airline, which has embarked on a
restructuring programme, expects to halve its annual losses this year
compared to 1992. Lufthansa said it may return to profitability in 1994. It
posted a 1992 group net loss of DM391m (Dollars 230m).
The company said that it had eliminated 5,500 jobs by last June and it
expected to cut another 2,900 jobs by the beginning of 1994. The
Lufthansa-United deal is primarily designed to increase the two airlines'
worldwide revenues, but the two carriers expect it to provide cost-cutting
opportunities.
Mr Weber hoped the United deal would help swing Austrian Airlines to
co-operate with Lufthansa rather than join the European four-airline merger
being negotiated between SAS, KLM, Swissair and Austrian.
The Austrian carrier is expected to decide later this month whether to opt
for Lufthansa or for the four-airline merger. The Lufthansa-United deal and
the proposed four-airline merger reflect the scramble for alliances and
partnerships engulfing an industry facing growing deregulation and
increasingly global competition.
The United alliance is likely to face stiff opposition from American
Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the two other big US carriers. American had
sought to negotiate a deal with Lufthansa and is the only big US carrier
without a leading European partner.
Delta, which has equity links with Swissair, sees its position as the
biggest US carrier at Frankfurt threatened by yesterday's deal.
However, Mr Stephen Wolf, United's chairman, said he was confident the
agreement would win the necessary US government approval.

reinsurance business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRYGG-HANSA SPP, the Swedish insurer, is to stop writing new reinsurance
business immediately to concentrate on its Swedish activities and
international industrial and corporate insurance.
The move ends an involvement dating back to the start of the century and
follows the company's March decision to halve its reinsurance activity. The
group is ranked as one of the world's top 50 reinsurers with 1992 premiums
of SKr2.5bn (Dollars 316.4m).
Mr Lars Pihlgren, head of Trygg's reinsurance and marine operations, said
the decision to pull out of reinsurance was logical when it was no longer
considered a core business.
Last year, Trygg suffered a SKr470m loss from reinsurance because of losses
from credit insurance and exposure to hurricane Andrew. In 1993, a
break-even reinsurance result is expected.
The winding down process will take a number of years, as claims can be
expected to come in even though premiums are no longer generated.
The group is seeking a European partner in industrial insurance and it wants
to strengthen its position in Sweden. The company's US affiliate Home
Holdings said last month it would raise Dollars 335m through an initial
public offering and seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Industry bewildered by unlikely
trio - The spate of petrochemicals acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Hanson, Mr Kerry Packer, and Mr Jon Huntsman form a surprising trio.
But during the last two months the English Lord, Australian entrepreneur and
Mormon maverick businessman have taken a punt on the troubled petrochemicals
industry.
In July, Lord Hanson acquired Quantum Chemical, the largest US producer of
polyethylene, for Dollars 3.2bn. Two months later, Huntsman, the
privately-owned US group run by Mr Huntsman, announced its largest
acquisition, buying Elf Atochem's French expandable polystyrene operations
for an undisclosed sum.
Six hours later, the same group in partnership with Mr Packer revealed a
still larger deal, purchasing Texaco's chemicals operations for Dollars
1.06bn.
The acquisitions left the rest of the petrochemicals industry bewildered.
They were unsure whether the trio were demonstrating superb timing by buying
at the bottom of a particularly bad downturn and would soon reap the benefit
of a recovery, or that the three - along with the rest of the sector - would
continue to suffer from continued over-capacity, poor margins and potential
losses.
Mr Huntsman, the chief executive of the largest US privately-owned chemicals
group, has bet his shirt before.
In 1983, one of the least propitious times to enter the commodity
petrochemicals business, he mortgaged his family's fortune and borrowed a
great deal of money to acquire a Dollars 42m polystyrene plant from Shell.
The Shell executives reckoned he would lose everything as well as the bank
loans. They gave him a bronze sculpture inscribed; Riverboat Gambler. From
your friends at Shell.
However, the gamble paid off. Within five years, Mr Huntsman's company had
acquired further facilities from Shell in the UK and Hoechst in the US,
generated pre-tax profits of Dollars 240m in a single 12-month period and
cleared its debts.
Huntsman's latest deals dwarf those of the early 1980s, and nearly double
the group's turnover to Dollars 3.1bn a year, an impressive achievement for
a company that did not exist 10 years ago.
Mr Huntsman explains: 'We don't buy companies to make profits out of the
cycle - that philosophy just does not make sense. We're looking to make
profits from day one.'
Huntsman group can make profits in commodity chemicals at the bottom of the
cycle because of its low cost base, says Mr Huntsman.
'As a private family-run company we just don't have the enormous overheads
associated with a public group,' he says. The group's running research and
development costs and those for sales and general administration are only
4.2 per cent of turnover. That compares with 9 per cent for the rest of the
industry.
Costs are kept down through the company's policy of running plants at 100
per cent capacity. That reduces costs per unit, and improves quality because
the plant is not stopping and starting.
'We've been waiting for the down-cycle to come. We've been planning for it,
while the others have been dreading it. It gives us the opportunity acquire
at reasonable prices. If we make money on the up-cycle - well, that's just
gravy.'
Mr Huntsman admits the group has its work cut out managing the increase in
the business's size. 'Managing growth is troublesome and I do worry about
it. There's a difference between managing 300 people in a family business
and a group employing 10,000 staff in 65 locations.'
Nevertheless, Huntsman managers are confident they can cope with the latest
acquisitions. They argue the purchase of three Hoechst polystyrene plants in
1986 was far more stressful because the deal tripled the size of the group
when there was no corporate structure in place.
As for the gravy offered by the cycle, Mr Huntsman reckons the outlook for
much of the industry remains grim. The cycle is on a more definite curve in
the US than Europe where he expects little light over the next two to three
years. In North America, polypropylene and polyethylene are at a low ebb,
but expandable polystyrene and polystyrene are in short supply and margins
are more healthy than at any time, he claims.
With little help from the market, Mr Huntsman's and Lord Hanson's management
skills will need to be well in evidence to avoid a long-haul to respectable
profits.

FALLING food prices and depressed consumer spending combined with rising
labour costs to cut net profits at GIB Group, the Belgian retailer, to
BFr605m (Dollars 16.8m) in the six months to July 31, from BFr1.68bn in the
corresponding period last year.
GIB, which is Belgium's biggest private-sector employer, announced 10 days
ago that 4,600 of the 17,000 full-time and part-time employees in its
Belgian supermarket chain would lose their jobs over the next three years.
The group said that provisions linked to this recovery plan would appear in
the second-half results, but it made no comment on the outlook for the full
year.
Profits were hit by extraordinary costs of BFr530m related to restructuring
of its Sarma stores. In the first half of last year, GIB recorded an
extraordinary profit of BFr365m, following property sales.
GIB recorded sales of BFr113bn in the first half, against BFr111bn in the
equivalent period. Supermarkets and hypermarkets increased sales by 1.4 per
cent, while do-it-yourself stores pushed up turnover by 5.8 per cent.

Standard Chartered, the UK bank, has received Pounds 25.9m in a settlement
of its legal action against the National Housing Bank of India.
The claim was one of several against banks and financial institutions by
Standard Chartered following irregularities in the Bombay securities market
in 1991 and 1992. The bank disclosed in March that it had sustained a Pounds
305m loss on Indian operations last year and it raised its provision for
possible bad debts resulting from the Bombay securities trading scandal to
Pounds 272m. Mr Malcolm Williamson, chief executive, said: 'We are very
pleased that (we) have been able to settle this outstanding claim in a
sensible commercial manner. We shall continue to pursue our claims with
other counterparties and hope that they will respond as positively and
constructively as the National Housing Bank'.
In November, ANZ Grindlays Bank, the Australian-owned group involved in the
Bombay securities scandal, paid Rs5.06bn (Pounds 116m) to National Housing
Bank against seven disputed cheques.

FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey looks east - Pounds 25m
technical centre outside Tokyo will be catalyst for expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE green fields of Tochigi prefecture, 75 miles north of Tokyo, a
traditional, Japanese-style ceremony will take place today to celebrate
Johnson Matthey, the UK advanced materials and precious metals specialist,
opening its first technical centre in Asia.
The Pounds 25m Kitsuregawa technical centre will be a vital part of its
strategy of expanding in Japan and the rest of Asia.
Johnson Matthey now does about 90 per cent of its business in Europe and the
US; it expects the Asian market to grow to close to a third.
The centre will support its operations in car exhaust catalysts, catalysts
for fuel cells, and electronics.
The company hopes that its presence in Japan will help it to win a larger
share of the market for the exhaust catalysts used in Japanese cars
manufactured at their transplant factories in Europe.
Although it supplies more than a third of total world demand for vehicle
catalysts, Johnson Matthey has less than 5 per cent of the Japanese market,
where it faces stiff competition from, among others, Allied Signal of the
US.
It is already supplying catalysts for engines made by Japanese car makers in
the US and Europe.
But as engines become more complex, the catalysts are increasingly designed
by engineers in Japan rather than locally, and the technology is then
transferred to the transplants. So to compete in that market the company
needed to have technical support in Japan.
Japanese standards for catalysts are stringent and the requirements in terms
of testing, support and information supplied are the highest in the world,
said Mr Alan Fullarton, project director of Johnson Matthey Japan.
'Primarily we need to have very close contacts with the engineers,' he said,
pointing out that the decision to set up a technical centre in Japan was
welcomed by Japanese car makers.
One advantage for the company is that it does not face competition in car
exhaust catalysts from Japanese companies, although Toyota does make about
50 per cent of its catalysts in-house.
This is hardly true in the electronics business, where there is fierce
competition from large domestic compa-nies specialising in precious metals,
such as Nippon Mining and Mitsubishi Kasei.
But Johnson Matthey believes that its analytical skills and expertise in
purifying will help it expand its market share.
It also has expertise in developing catalysts for fuel cells, and has built
a pilot plant at Kitsuregawa to provide makers of fuel cells with samples
which it expects to have to expand in future.
Japan is well ahead of other countries in the commercial development of fuel
cells, and all the electric power stations in the world which use them are
located in Japan, said Mr Fullarton.
Commercialisation of fuel cells in Japan could come in the next two or three
years, and the company has invested substantially in scientists and
evaluation laboratory facilities to prepare for future mass production.

Pounds 9m

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Bilton, the property investment and construction company,
edged ahead to Pounds 8.99m for the half year to June 30, against Pounds
8.88m last time.
Mr Hugh Free, chairman, said that in spite of recession, rental income flow
had been 'strongly maintained.' While growth had been restricted by some
liquidations and receiverships, 'rent reviews and new lettings have been
very satisfactory.'
Net rents receivable were up from Pounds 12.1m to Pounds 12.2m. After
property management expenses net investment income dipped from Pounds 11.3m
to Pounds 11.2m.
Turnover in the building and construction division fell from Pounds 5.55m to
Pounds 4.78m, and trading profit dropped from Pounds 386,000 to Pounds
137,000. The company said that civil engineering, private housing and plant
hire had all suffered in a very competitive market.
After administrative expenses of Pounds 943,000 (Pounds 1.04m), operating
profits were Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 10.6m). Net interest payable fell from
Pounds 1.73m to Pounds 1.37m.
Earnings per share rose from 13.9p to 14.1p. The interim dividend is
maintained at 5.67p.

FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Red is go as a gamble pays off - ShareLink
as it prepares its first results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE traffic lights turn red on the dealing floor at ShareLink
Investment Services, the traders know it is time to step up their pace.
The wall-mounted lights signal the calls queueing up for the
Birmingham-based company's telephone dealing service. Green allows some of
the 200 operators to linger over their transactions; amber means it's time
to wind up; if all the lights turn red - get off the line because one of
ShareLink's 1,500 new customers a week is waiting to get through.
Business has continued to grow rapidly since its Pounds 42m flotation two
months ago, reflecting both the buoyancy of the equity market and
ShareLink's broadening range of services.
From a no-frills telephone stock brokerage service, it has expanded into
self-select Peps, traded options, and a North American stocks service.
The company, currently preparing its first interim results since flotation,
predicts the figures next month will justify its decision to look for
additional trading premises in the Midlands and consider outlets in
continental Europe. Its shares, floated at 250p, closed yesterday at 335p.
Growing demand for ShareLink's services - running currently at 2m calls and
up to 3m postal transactions a year - is partly because of the reluctance of
many small investors to deal with traditional brokers, according to Mr David
Jones, the group's founder and chief executive.
Mr Jones, a miner's son who had no experience of financial services before
setting up the company in 1987, hit on the idea of a no-frills dealing
operation because of his own fears of being over-charged by City brokers.
'I had a couple of thousand pounds to invest but was petrified of ringing a
stockbroker. I thought there must be an easier way to make a low-cost
transaction. This is it.'
The former British Telecom executive scans his main dealing floor in
Birmingham with some satisfaction. When the clearing banks rejected his
business plan, he went ahead without them - launching the service with
management backing from his old employers and finance raised by brokers
Albert E Sharp.
The gamble paid off. Set up on a Pounds 1m budget, the company exploited a
market vacated when several City firms withdrew from private client services
in the wake of Big Bang. That market was boosted by customers attracted to
equities by the large privatisation issues.
Last year Mr Jones felt ready to lead a management buy-out in which he
remained the majority shareholder.
The traffic lights, meanwhile, continued to turn red. And this summer,
buoyed by figures showing it had captured 10 per cent of all UK transactions
by volume, ShareLink floated.
Coming to the stock market has been a lucrative transaction for the founder.
He has cashed in shares worth Pounds 1.8m, while retaining a 14 per cent
stake worth Pounds 7.7m.
Although the management team are pleased with the performance of turnover of
Pounds 14.3m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.1m in the year to March 31, the
group's rise to its present cruising altitude has not been without
turbulence.
Public appetite for equities was severely dented by the stock market crash
in October 1987, undermining the private client business. Inefficiencies
also emerged as the managers tried to co-ordinate a fledgling share service
based at three different sites.
Increasingly aware of the risks in its dependency on execution-only trading,
the company has also begun to diversify. The workforce, meanwhile, has been
cut by more than 50 per cent from 422 in the year to April 1992 to about 200
at present.
Today, customers calling to buy shares are put through to a central dealing
floor which used to be the home of the regional blood donor service. The
newly offered services are catching on with ShareLink handling more than
Pounds 100m in self-select Peps and claiming 25 per cent of the retail
market for traded options.
Since flotation the company has also put increased emphasis on its
distributor services for other financial institutions.
More than 500 organisations such as Allied Dunbar and Harrods Bank have
signed contracts to process their share trading through the Birmingham
dealing room, giving ShareLink some guaranteed income in the event of a
decline in its private client trade.
The growth of third party contracts, now accounting for 20 per cent of the
business, follows the success of its 1989 link with Abbey National, the
company's first outside deal.
Wholesaling for institutions was boosted further at the time of the
flotation when Halifax joined the list of companies using the service.
The rapid rise of the company must be galling to some brokers. But one
element of its success is its ability to set itself apart from the City,
avoiding traditional elements of the Square Mile's expertise and the
overheads that go with them.
ShareLink minimises its risk by leaving the decision-making to its clients.
Its traders offer no recommendations on when to buy and sell, they simply
execute telephone instructions in return for a commission. The profits lie
in the average Pounds 100 annual commission per customer.
The company's good fortune is that few competitors have emerged to its
telephone-based operations. The clearing banks pose a challenge but share
dealing remains peripheral to their main business; and many large brokers
prefer to concentrate on more lucrative institutional transactions than
private clients.
Mr Jones, a psychology graduate, believes he knows what ShareLink customers
have in mind as they look for new ways of investing. To that end, ShareLink
is spending almost Pounds 3m on new software and additional premises to make
the service speedier - ensuring fewer callers wait for the lights to turn
red before they are answered.
During the sale of the third tranche of British Telecom shares earlier this
year, when ShareLink handled applications worth Pounds 120m, the company
pioneered touch-tone dealing allowing customers to buy and sell using the
buttons on their telephone. The service uses 'talking computers' to handle
orders at the best market price at the time of the call.
The chief executive, who had never clapped eyes on a share certificate until
ShareLink had been trading for six weeks, admits such innovations are
regarded as somewhat vulgar by traditional brokers. But he says he's happy
to be regarded as the B&amp;Q of share trading.
'There's Pounds 20bn stashed under the beds in this country. I'm after that
business,' he says.

FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: A determined stamp of authority - The
changes to Lonrho's structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTRUCTURING Lonrho's complicated mix of businesses was always going to be
the easy part. Mr Dieter Bock has now chosen to change the international
trading company's board, an altogether more delicate task.
The German financier, who at the beginning of the year acquired an 18.8 per
cent stake in the conglomerate and was then appointed joint chief executive
with Mr Tiny Rowland, is determined to stamp his authority on the company
with the appointment of non-executive directors.
Lonrho's board, meeting on Thursday, is expected to approve the appointment
of its first two non-executives for two decades: Mr Peter Harper, director
of Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate and Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of
Albert Fisher, a food processor and distributor.
Mr Rowland, who has been Lonrho's guiding force for 30 years and has been
opposed to non-executives since the 'straight eight' directors
unsuccessfully tried to remove him in 1973, is not expected to block the
moves.
Their arrival should mark the beginning of a number of changes to the way
Lonrho is run which could prove uncomfortable to some of the board's
longer-serving members.
The new directors will be set a number of delicate tasks. They will join its
remuneration committee and re-evaluate directors' pay, They will also
determine what to pay Mr Bock, who has not drawn a salary since becoming
joint chief executive.
They will also set up the company's first ever audit committee, to review
its auditing procedures and financial performance on a regular basis.
Mr Bock wants to concentrate on three core businesses; mining, hotels and
agriculture. But despite the sale of many of the group's businesses,
including the lossmaking Observer, Lonrho still has a slightly negative
cashflow - though it could turn neutral next year.
There are likely to be further disposals outside the three core areas.
Profits from these could be significant if the recent sale of a property in
Brussels is any guide.
It fetched Pounds 30m, to yield a Pounds 13m profit. That is a substantial
contribution to earnings, yet few of Lonrho's share-holders probably knew
the company owned that asset.
Profits are likely to receive a further boost from a reduction in the costs
of running the London headquarters at Cheapside, which are estimated to be
more than Pounds 20m a year.
There are likely to be significant cuts in the number of head office staff
from the current 160 and the number of executive board members, currently
12, will also come down.
Some of the full-time executives, who have grown used to the somewhat
idiosyncratic manner in which Mr Rowland has effectively run Lonrho for the
past 30 years, may be wary of some of the planned changes.
One of Lonrho's few institutional shareholders, while welcoming the
appointment of new non-executives, yesterday voiced concern as to whether
they will be in a strong enough position to push through the changes needed
to rebuild bridges with the investment community.
Mr Harper, who has been responsible for Hanson's investor relations, has
been criticised in the past by some fund managers for not keeping them
sufficiently briefed on the company's affairs.
Last year Mr Walls was forced out as chief executive of Arjo Wiggins
Appleton, the Franco-British paper company, after losing a board room battle
over strategy.
Both men will however have the full backing of Mr Bock, who took full
responsibility for finding them. He plans to add to their ranks with a
further one or two non-executive appointments in the coming months.
In order to establish better relations with institutions, which own a
relatively small proportion of Lonrho's shares compared with other big
companies, Mr Bock believes the company has to become a more open company.
Lonrho has only four big shareholders: Fidelity, with 8.9 per cent; UBS
Phillips and Drew Fund Managers, with 2 per cent; Postel with 1.5 per cent;
and Genting, a Malaysian plantations and gaming group, with 3.9 per cent.
For all the speed with which Mr Bock is trying to transform Lonrho, he
cannot expect an overnight increase in the proportion of shares held by
institutions. They are likely to want to see the effects of his changes
before buying.

FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown sells more abattoirs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HILLSDOWN HOLDINGS, the food group, is on the way to completing its
withdrawal from the red meat slaughtering industry with the sale of three
more abattoirs in the north-east of England.
The abattoirs, in Sunderland, Bedale and Doncaster, were sold for an
undisclosed sum by Hillsdown's FMC slaughtering subsidiary to Northern
Counties Meat Group, a new consortium formed by FMC management and backed by
financial investors.
One of Hillsdown's aims was to sell the abattoirs as a going concern in
order to preserve the jobs of 130 employees.
The latest sale leaves Hillsdown with five abattoirs. The group announced
with its interim results last month that it expected to be out of the
business altogether by the end of the current year. It has been reducing the
number of abattoirs from over 25 during the past two years in an effort to
move away from an increasingly unprofitable industry.
The sale is in line with provisions made last year when Hillsdown took a
Pounds 92.3m provision to cover its withdrawal from the slaughtering
business and other problems.

FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Capital &amp; Regional back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL &amp; Regional Properties, the USM-quoted company which last week said
it was to float off its US property interests as a publicly traded Real
Estate Investment Trust, moved into the black in the six months to June 24.
In the first half of what Mr Martin Barber, chairman, described as 'a
milestone year for the group', pre- and post-tax profits emerged at Pounds
151,000, compared to losses of Pounds 137,000 last time.
Mr Barber said that in the past 18 months the group's portfolio had doubled
in monetary terms - it had stood at Pounds 25m in the balance sheet at the
year-end - as a result of the group's 'intensive efforts'. In the period
under review, C&amp;R made acquisitions which totalled Pounds 25.7m.
Mr Barber said that there were more UK acquisitions 'in the pipeline' and
that the REIT was set to have Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) worth of property,
up from about Dollars 85m now.
Mr Barber said that the acquisitions had been well timed, adding that the
window for the buying of investment property was 'still open'.
'Although yields have come down, the opportunities still look pretty good.'
Shareholders had indicated that they would not be averse to a further
expansion of the equity base.
Rental and management fee income rose to Pounds 4.13m (Pounds 2.96m) and
again there was no tax charge.
Mr Barber explained that the UK property interests worked through at about
break-even, with the US 'making lots in UK accounting terms, which you can
then depreciate, leaving those profits tax-free'.
Although the increased interim dividend of 0.5p (0.3p) is uncovered at this
stage by earnings of 0.21p (losses 1.48p) per share, Mr Barber said that the
first-half acquisitions would 'contribute to considerably higher profits
being reported in the second half'.

FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Balance maintained on a floating plane -
Maggie Urry analyses the recent return to popularity of seeking a stock
market listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSH of new companies wanting to join the stock market appears to show
no sign of abating, with most issues having been well received by investors.
There has been a balance in the market with no swing towards flops or heavy
oversubscriptions and big stagging profits. Can this happy equilibrium
continue?
There seems to be a never-ending supply of companies, mainly at the smaller
end of the spectrum, anxious to see their shares traded on the stock market
and gain access to the equity capital they require.
So far, corporate financiers agree, the quality of the issues has been good.
A company which has survived the recession of the last few years and come
out with a track record fit to be seen in a prospectus, has a head start.
Many are management buy-outs, such as the forthcoming flotation of Allders,
the retail group bought out from Hanson in 1989, and Parkdean Leisure, the
holiday park operator bought from Beazer in the same year.
Such flotations are often seeking an exit for venture capital backers and a
chance to recapitalise. As well as recession, the companies have been tested
by the rigours of being bought and examined by investors, and in many cases,
the financial stringency imposed by heavy debt.
Investors have yet to have their fingers badly burnt by an issue, although
one or two have not opened trading at a premium. Court Cavendish, the
nursing home operator, for example floated at 225p but saw the shares end
their first day's dealing at 207p. Now they stand at 200p.
Says one merchant banker: 'There have been no flops yet. But when venture
capitalists sell, you know the market is too high.'
He contrasts the prices available through trade sales and those through
flotation. With only a few exceptions, such as Glass Glover, which was
bought by Unigate, and Medway Ports which fell to Mersey Docks and Harbour,
companies are planning to float to obtain a higher price than they could
achieve in a takeover.
Usually the reverse is true, with takeover multiples higher than flotation
ratings, reflecting a premium for control. Currently, the market is on a
high historic rating while bidders are wary of making acquisitions.
Says a stockbroker: 'We are still in the early phase of the economic upturn.
It is unlikely investors will be burnt soon, but it will happen one day'.
Another adds: 'Our sense is that the quality is still good'. However, 'there
will be some issues people will regret in three to five years time'.
All say that it is up to the issuing houses to act as quality controller.
'We must be very careful about the quality of companies we sponsor,' says
one merchant banker.
However, is there sufficient demand from investors to match the supply of
new companies?
Although there are no signs yet of a turn against new issues, the market is
fickle and the tap of capital can be turned off rapidly. A promising start
to 1992 was disrupted in the summer when some flotations went badly. It was
not until the autumn that confidence was regained.
One difference this year is that institutional investors have become keen on
small companies again and smaller capitalisation stocks have outperformed
the top shares.
Flotations, says one broker, 'are a means for large investors to commit
material amounts to smaller companies . . . and ones which are newly
verified' referring to the scrutiny sponsors apply to companies before they
are floated.
Institutions can buy a large block of shares through the institutional
placing element of an issue. With already quoted companies they can spend
weeks trying to build a decent holding through the market.
The institutional appetite for new equity reflects the rise in the stock
market this year and has been demonstrated by the take up of rights issues.
These, at approaching Pounds 10bn so far in 1993, far outweigh the supply of
new shares from flotations.
Further, some of the shares of larger companies coming to market may prove
more attractive than those being issued in rescue rights by floundering
companies.
James Capel, the stockbroker which has been involved in many new issues this
year, reckons that shares in management buy-outs which float perform better
than the market. This confounds the sceptical view that mbo managers dress
their companies up for sale so as to realise the maximum incentives under
ratchet arrangements typical of such buy-outs.
However, the list of forthcoming floats includes a number of larger
companies such as Gartmore, the investment management house, DFS Furniture,
the retailer, Allders, and, after Christmas, Dairy Crest, the dairy products
group, and possibly William Hill, the betting shop chain. These may prove to
be a tougher test of the market's acceptance of new issues.
As well as institutions, private investors appear to be taking an interest
in new issues, although few involve full offers for sale. Retail investors
may fear they will find it harder to buy shares in flotations because of the
Stock Exchange's upcoming changes in the issuing rules.
From December 1 issuers can place firmly shares worth up to Pounds 25m with
institutions, an increase from the existing Pounds 15m. Issues above Pounds
25m but below Pounds 50m must involve a financial intermediaries offer as
well, where investors can apply to buy shares through an intermediary such
as a stockbroker.
Public offers, in which investors can fill in an application form from a
newspaper or a prospectus, are required above Pounds 50m, a rise from Pounds
30m.
Mr Nigel Atkinson, head of listings at the Stock Exchange, believes retail
investors can successfully use the financial intermediaries offer to apply
for shares, and he has had no complaints from people saying they have been
denied the opportunity to participate.
At the moment there seems no cloud on the horizon to disrupt the balance
between supply and demand. However, market operators who remember the flops
and oversubscriptions of the past, believe it is only a matter of time
before something goes wrong.
But if sponsors exercise sufficient control over the companies that come to
market, and estimate demand for and price issues correctly, the worst
excesses of the past should be avoided.

FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BTR forms UK packaging arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the industrial con-glomerate, has brought together its UK packaging
interests in a new company, ACI Rockware Group, which it said would create a
focus for future growth under new management.
BTR dominates the market for glass containers in Australia and the Pacific
Rim, and bought into the UK and Europe through its Pounds 197m acquisition
of Rockware in 1991.
The new group will comprise Rockware Glass, one of the UK's biggest
manufacturers of glass containers; Dartington Crystal, which makes giftware;
ACI Rockware Plastics; and ACI Rockware's UK metal packaging operations,
Decorpart and Presspart Manufacturing, plus Presspart's US associate.
ACI Rockware said the reorganisation in the UK was designed to consolidate
the management and operation of the group companies.
Mr Alan Peterson, 45, who joined Rockware on 1990 as managing director of
ACI Rockware Plastics, will fulfil the same role for the new group.
Mr Allan Mawby, 43, previously finance director for ACI Rockware Plastics,
will be group finance director.
The group will continue to be part of ACI Packaging, which manages BTR's
worldwide glass and plastics packaging operations. ACI is a division of BTR
Nylex, the highly profitable subsidiary in which the UK company has a 61 per
cent stake.

FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Heywood Williams Pounds 10.6m glass buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEYWOOD WILLIAMS Group, the building materials and automotive components
company, has acquired the UK automotive replacement glass interests of TCG
International for Pounds 10.6m.
The Huddersfield-based group is paying Pounds 4.4m in cash and issuing
nearly 1.82m new shares, worth Pounds 6.23m based on yesterday's closing
price of 343p, up 2p on the day.
TCG International's auto replacement glass business trades as Bridgewater
Speedy Auto Glass, which has 53 branches throughout Britain, and Trans
Britannia Glass which has two wholesale depots.
These operations, which achieved profits of Pounds 599,000 in the seven
months to July 31 and had net assets of Pounds 3.19m, will be integrated
with Auto Windscreens, Heywood's existing windscreen and automotive safety
glazing service.
The two businesses make a good geographical fit since Heywood's auto glass
operations are strongest in the north and the Midlands while Bridgewater is
strongest in the south.
Heywood has been refocusing its glass businesses.
Earlier this year it sold a substantial part of its UK glass division to
Pilkington for Pounds 95m and subsequently paid Dollars 53.3m (Pounds 34.5m)
to acquire LaSalle-Deitch, a US-based distributor of building products and
furnishings.
Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, chairman, said, 'This is a good commercial deal for
Heywood Williams and its shareholders. It is a logical step forward in our
strategy of developing our remaining specialised glass businesses and fits
in well with our overall plan for repositioning the group.' Mr Hinchliffe
said that it should be possible to improve the performance of the depots and
make administrative savings as a result of the merger which he said will
'more than fill our manufacturing operations.'

FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Innovative joint venture to invest in
Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR an innovative form of corporate capital vehicle to invest in the
Lloyd's of London insurance market were announced yesterday in a joint
venture by Hambros, Murray Lawrence Members Agency and Hoare Govett.
The venture will be a Pounds 50m investment company which will secure
underwriting capacity at Lloyd's with bond investments, rather than the
equities portfolios expected to be favoured by the investment trusts that
have been announced so far.
Details were also announced of Syndicate Capital Trust, a fund intended to
raise up to Pounds 50m, being launched by Raphael Zorn Hemsley, the
stockbroker, and Insurance Analysis Limited, a Lloyd's adviser.
The moves are the latest indication of corporate interest since Mr David
Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, announced plans to attract corporate capital to
restore underwriting capacity following heavy losses sustained by some
Names.
The plan to admit limited liability corporate capital will be debated at an
extraordinary meeting on October 20, and both vehicles which announced
proposals yesterday intend to offer shares following that, if it is
approved.
Mr Stephen Drake, finance director of MLMA, said it had chosen to establish
an investment company rather than a trust because it intended to hold most
capital in gilts and money market instruments, which involved little risk.
The joint venture, for which Hambros Investment Management will manage funds
and Hoare Govett will act as broker, is expected to attract mainly
institutional investment, but will seek retail investment through personal
equity plans.
The company expects to participate in a maximum of 25 syndicates, and will
underwrite at Lloyd's through five wholly owned corporate members.

FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BZW launches Pounds 100m food retail
warrant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS DE Zoete Wedd, the stockbroker, yesterday launched a Pounds 100m
warrant for the food retail sector in one of the first such moves involving
UK-only traded stocks.
Investors will be able to buy a warrant at yesterday's closing mid-prices
for a basket of food retail shares weighted by market capitalisation. The
cost of the warrant - which allows investors to exercise an option to buy
the shares at the price on the day of purchase - is 230p based on a basket
price of Pounds 18.80. Investors then have until April 1995 to exercise
their warrants.
BZW said it had decided to use the warrant instrument as a way of
encouraging investors back into the depressed food retail market. Shares in
the sector have underperformed the FT-SE All-Share Index by over 30 per cent
in the past six months.
The launch coincided with the stockbroker's research team adopting a more
positive recommendation on the food retail stocks.
Sainsbury heads the basket weighting of seven food retailers, with 40 per
cent, followed by Tesco (21 per cent) and Argyll (17.5 per cent).
The sector has had a turbulent six months. Investor concern has focused on
lower margins caused by increasing competition and the threat posed by
discount chains, with US and European operators moving into the UK market.
Results from the leading supermarket groups have confirmed the City's fears.
The threat of VAT on food in next month's budget has also undermined
investor sentiment.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Nynex invests Dollars 1.2bn in Viacom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and KAREN ZAGOR

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VIACOM, the US cable television company, yesterday gained a new ally in its
battle to take over Paramount Communications when Nynex, the regional
telephone company serving the north-eastern US, agreed to invest Dollars
1.2bn in Viacom.
The deal, together with a Dollars 600m investment in Viacom last week by
video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment, will give the company a war-chest
of almost Dollars 2bn with which it could increase its bid for Paramount.
However, Mr Sumner Redstone, Viacom's chairman, said last night that
'presently we see no reason to restructure the offer'.
Viacom's agreed shares and cash offer for Paramount, which owns the
Hollywood film studios of the same name, is worth around Dollars 7.5bn -
Dollars 2bn less than a hostile shares and cash offer from QVC Network, the
home shopping channel headed by Mr Barry Diller, a leading film industry
figure.
For Nynex, one of the seven 'Baby Bell' regional telephone companies,
yesterday's deal represents a big leap into the US cable TV industry. The
company's main involvement in the sector at present is in the UK.
Mr Bill Ferguson, Nynex chairman, said: 'We've been looking around the world
for a long time. It's important we have a relationship with content and
software.' Viacom is best known for its MTV pop music channel, although it
also runs a cable TV service to more than 1m US customers.
Nynex will buy Dollars 1.2bn of 5 per cent Viacom cumulative convertible
preferred stock, convertible into Viacom Class B non-voting stock at a
conversion price of Dollars 70. There is a provision for Nynex or Viacom to
reduce the investment by Dollars 600m if the Viacom merger with Paramount is
not completed by next August. The same terms cover Blockbuster's investment
in Viacom.
Mr Ferguson will join the Viacom board, as will Mr Wayne Huizenga, chairman
of Blockbuster.
The largest investment in a US cable company to date is by Denver-based US
West, which has invested Dollars 2.5bn in the cable and film entertainment
arm of Time Warner. Southwestern Bell agreed last February to buy two cable
systems in the Washington, DC area for Dollars 650m.

FT  05 OCT 93 / BNP share sale price set low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government yesterday set a lower than expected price of FFr240
(Pounds 27.33) on shares in Banque Nationale de Paris, the country's third
largest bank, in an attempt to draw investors to the first issue in its
privatisation programme.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said the issue, which will be
offered to investors from today, 'is aimed primarily at French households'.
Analysts in Paris said the price of the issue, which values the bank at
about FFr43bn, was at least FFr10 lower than forecast.
This demonstrated the government's desire to guarantee a successful start to
its plan to privatise 21 groups.
'They want to begin with a bang,' said Mr David Harrington, of James Capel
in Paris.
Mr Alphandery also gave details of a group of stable investors that will
hold about 30 per cent of BNP's shares. These mainly comprise French
financial and industrial groups, but they will also include General Electric
of the US, BAT Industries of the UK, Roche Holding of Switzerland, Dresdner
Bank of Germany and the Kuwait Investment Authority.
BAT said participation in the core shareholding was the most certain way of
ensuring it received shares in the bank. A position in the so-called 'noyau
dur' would also be an advantage in participating in the privatisation of
Seita, the state tobacco monopoly.
Under the terms of the BNP issue, which will close on October 12, some 72m
shares will be offered for sale.
The privatisation of BNP will raise about FFr28bn for the government. The
target for the year is FFr40bn.

KEYCORP and Society Corporation, two of the US's strongest regional banking
groups, yesterday confirmed their merger in a deal which creates a new giant
among the US's 'super-regional' banks.
The new bank, to be known as KeyCorp, will have assets of Dollars 58bn
(Pounds 38.5bn), making it the 10th largest in the US on this basis. Among
super-regionals - banks with operations which span a number of US regions -
the new group will rank behind only NationsBank and Banc One.
Mr Victor Riley, chairman and chief executive of KeyCorp, said the merger
was intended to enhance the two banks' earning power by making available a
broader range of products through their combined branch network. By
contrast, the deal was only expected to shave 4-5 per cent from the combined
cost base of the two companies, or Dollars 80m-Dollars 100m a year.
Unlike other recent regional bank takeovers, the deal is structured as a
pure merger, with the two groups combining their operations in a new holding
company. KeyCorp shareholders will receive 1.205 shares in the new holding
company for each one they hold, while Society shareholders will retain their
existing number of shares.
KeyCorp, based in Albany, New York, has built a 836-branch network by
expanding into eight states in the north-east and north-west: Maine, Alaska,
Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Society has
concentrated on the middle corporate market and has 456 branches in Ohio,
Indiana, Michigan and Florida.
The return on equity of the combined banking group would be 19.75 per cent,
making it one of the most profitable in the US.
In an attempt to dissuade rival bids for either bank, the two sides have
granted each other options over 19.9 per cent of their shares. These options
would become exercisable if either side was acquired by a third party.
KeyCorp also said it had adopted a 'poison pill', similar to one already in
place at Society.
Analysts questioned whether the attempt to put together a true merger,
leaving the management of neither bank in overall control, would slow down
the group's development. However, both banks' shares rose on the news
yesterday.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Invergordon resists latest tilt from Whyte &amp; Mackay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RENEWED attempt by Whyte &amp; Mackay, the UK drinks subsidiary of American
Brands, to gain control of Invergordon Distillers has been rebuffed.
Fleming Investment Management, which has a 13.6 per cent stake in
Invergordon, is understood to have rejected an offer of 300p a share - 275p
cash and a 25p dividend.
Whyte &amp; Mackay was left with 41 per cent of Invergordon after an
unsuccessful takeover bid two years ago. It launched that bid at 225p a
share and raised the offer to a final 275p a share.
Another Invergordon shareholder said yesterday that it considered the new
approach inadequate. 'If Whyte &amp; Mackay thinks it can come back after two
years and take advantage of a temporary dip in Invergordon's share price, it
should think again.'
A price of 300p, the shareholder added, did not reflect the value of
Invergordon, which had doubled net assets to Pounds 64m and reduced
borrowings from Pounds 46m to Pounds 22m since its flotation three years
ago.
Invergordon's share price closed 2p higher at 268p yesterday. The shares
have fallen from 295p since the company last month reported a 23 per cent
fall in first-half profits to Pounds 11.3m. It was the first setback in
nearly a decade of uninterrupted growth.
As analysts downgraded forecasts of full-year profits to Pounds 27m from
last year's Pounds 32m, there was widespread speculation that Whyte &amp; Mackay
would make a further bid to take over the company before the end of this
year.
Robert Fleming, the investment house, which is Invergordon's financial
adviser as well as a leading shareholder, played a crucial role in the
rejection of Whyte &amp; Mackay's bid in 1991.
The deaf ear that its investment management arm has now turned to Whyte &amp;
Mackay's further advances indicates that the institutional shareholders who
supported Invergordon's management then have no intention of giving way
cheaply.
The institutions include Norwich Union, the Prudential and Legal &amp; General.
Invergordon, one of the few remaining independent Scotch whisky distillers,
supplies about a quarter of the own-label brands to UK supermarkets, as well
as marketing Cluny, Findlater and Isle of Jura whiskies.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Gripped by the old frontier spirit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chock-full of capital and with little in the way of new loan growth to look
forward to on their home turf, America's stronger regional banks have been
on a buying spree lately. Their ambition: the creation of the US's first
true nationwide banking groups.
The hunt for higher revenues has been taking banks into new markets and new
product areas. By linking their branch systems, many hope to create bigger
networks selling a broader range of products.
Inevitably, the demand has pushed up the price of banks with good
distribution systems and sound balance sheets. The average purchase price
for US banks has crept up to 2.5 times net asset value - a substantial
premium over the valuation put by the stock market on the banking industry,
which is below 2 times net assets, says Mr John Leonard, an analyst at
Salomon.
With such a premium, will the shareholders of expansion-minded banks end up
disappointed? No bank has yet proved that it can make a success of running a
nationwide business handling a wide range of products, says Thomas Brown, a
banking analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
The KeyCorp/Society transaction, structured as a merger, does not involve
the payment of a premium to either company's shareholders. However, it is
based on the assumption that KeyCorp's branch network, built mainly around
small businesses and individual customers, can be used to generate more
business for Society's 'products'. These are based on specialised lending
and asset management for medium-sized businesses.
Meanwhile, there appear to be few obstacles to the quickening pace of US
regional bank mergers. The biggest single obstacle remains the Southeast
Compact: an agreement between 13 states requiring banks in the region to
maintain at least 80 per cent of their deposits there. Some, like South
Carolina-based NationsBank, have reached into other states only because the
compact does not apply to takeovers of banks which are receiving federal
government support.
The pace of bank mergers has been picking up. Last year, bank mergers worth
Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5.6bn) were announced: this year, the figure will be
higher. 'There have been a lot of acquisitions in the Dollars 3bn toDollars
5bn range,' says Mr Leonard.
NationsBank and Banc One, from Ohio, have set the pace through acquisition
but there is a growing queue to follow them. The KeyCorp/Society merger will
create a third geographically diverse 'super-regional' banking group. The
question now: who will be next?
Fleet Financial and PNC - among the US's top 15 banks in terms of assets -
are most frequently singled out as likely merger candidates, either with
each other or with other banks. Each has a strong local base, a healthy
balance sheet and a good return on capital. Each also has a management which
has expressed interest in expansion.
BankAmerica, the US's second-biggest bank with an extensive presence in the
west, is also waiting in the wings. However, its difficulties with
swallowing Security Pacific, and the recession in California, is expected to
keep it on the sidelines.
With this growing list of merger candidates, it was not surprising yesterday
to see KeyCorp and Society injecting a poison pill into their deal to
dissuade rival suitors. Unsolicited bids among US banks have not been a
feature of the latest takeover wave. But as the pace picks up and the list
of attractive merger candidates shrinks, an unwanted bid looks increasingly
likely.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Shares for BNP sale set low at FFr240
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government yesterday set a lower than expected price of FFr240
(Pounds 27.33) on shares in Banque Nationale de Paris, the country's third
largest bank, in an attempt to draw investors to the first issue in its
privatisation programme.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said the issue, which will be
offered to investors from today, 'is aimed primarily at French households'.
Analysts in Paris said the price of the issue, which values the bank at
about FFr43bn, was at least FFr10 lower than forecast. This demonstrated the
government's desire to guarantee a successful start to its plan to privatise
21 groups.
'They want to begin with a bang,' said Mr David Harrington, of James Capel
in Paris.
Mr Alphandery also gave details of a group of stable investors that will
hold about 30 per cent of BNP's shares. These mainly comprise French
financial and industrial groups, but they will also include General Electric
of the US, BAT Industries of the UK, Roche Holding of Switzerland, Dresdner
Bank of Germany and the Kuwait Investment Authority.
BAT said participation in the core shareholding was the most certain way of
ensuring it received shares in the bank. A position in the so-called 'noyau
dur' would also be an advantage in participating in the privatisation of
Seita, the state tobacco monopoly.
According to Mr Alphandery, BNP's price was slightly above the minimum level
of FFr235.5 set by the privatisation commission, an independent body. It was
'a medium-term' price, calculated on the basis of BNP's earnings performance
and business strategy.
Under the terms of the BNP issue, which will close on October 12, some 72m
shares will be offered for sale. Of those, 37.5m will be reserved for
individual investors, and 34.6m for institutional investors. The tranche
allocated to individuals can be increased to 47m shares.
The privatisation of BNP will raise about FFr28bn for the government. The
target for the year is FFr40bn. The balance will be raised through the sale
of the next companies on the list, Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, and
Banque Hervet, a small retail bank.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Stock Exchange to monitor level of flotation demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK Exchange is expecting a steady flow of flotations over the next
few months, and regards this as a critical time to make sure the mechanism
for new issues is working smoothly. That includes ensuring retail investors
have access to issues.
Mr Nigel Atkinson, head of listings at the exchange, said that so far issues
through financial intermediaries, where investors can apply for shares
through brokers for instance, have generally been oversubscribed but not by
substantial multiples. 'By and large sponsors have got it about right.'
The exchange applied the yardstick of oversubscription to measure whether
sponsors had accurately estimated public demand. Mr Atkinson said sponsors
who got it wrong would be questioned and the exchange would 'take a more
critical view the next time the sponsor comes along with an issue'.
There had been no complaints from the public that they had been denied the
opportunity to participate in new issues. One broker said the intermediaries
offer was seen as a way of accessing the private investor. Another said
these offers only worked if commissions were paid.
Part of the impetus for the spate of flotations has been that, with the
market on a high historic rating, companies have obtained a better price
than by accepting a takeover.
Institutional appetite for new equity has also been demonstrated by the
take-up of rights issues. These have raised nearly Pounds 10bn this year,
far outweighing the value of new shares issued in flotations.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Rise in borrowing eases fears of stalled recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW FIGURES on consumer lending and the money supply yesterday helped to
dispel fears that the UK recovery is losing momentum.
The highest net consumer borrowing for any month since July 1991, and the
fastest growth in the narrow measure of money supply for over three years
indicated that the pick-up in activity since the middle of 1992 is
progressing steadily.
Consumers borrowed a net Pounds 225m in August compared with Pounds 204m in
July. A strong rise in loans from finance houses - in particular for cars -
fuelled the increase.
The official figures from the Central Statistical Office indicated that
consumers are slowly regaining the confidence to take on debt. They borrowed
a net Pounds 298m from finance houses - mainly car loans and hire purchase
agreements - and a net Pounds 16m on unsecured loans from building
societies. On bank credit cards, however, they repaid Pounds 89m more than
they borrowed.
Other figures from the Bank of England reinforced the message of the credit
statistics. Narrow money - mainly notes and coins in circulation - rose a
seasonally adjusted 5.4 per cent in the year to September, the highest rate
of growth since the summer of 1990.
The robustness of M0 coincides with strengthening retail spending. The
annual rate of growth of the narrow money supply has been above the
government's 0-4 per cent target range for virtually every month since
February.
But in contrast to the promising economic figures, the Building Employers
Federation yesterday forecast more gloom for the construction industry. It
said more jobs would be lost in the sector and sustained recovery was not
expected until 1995.
The federation's autumn state-of-trade inquiry, based on a poll of 600
companies, found that only one-third were confident of an increase in output
over the next 12 months.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Major warns rebel MPs not to risk Tory legacy: Rallying call
for united front at conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BLACKPOOL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR warned rebel Conservative MPs last night that a display of
disunity at this week's party conference would put at risk the legacy of 14
years of Tory government.
'We have got to pull ourselves together and we have to start this week at
this conference,' the prime minister told a gathering of 150 Conservative
election agents. He coupled his appeal for unity with a wide-ranging attack
on the opposition parties, and a pledge that the Tories would fight next
year's crucial European parliamentary elections on a 'clear and distinctive'
anti-federalist manifesto.
Mr Major also unveiled moves to strengthen the party organisation by setting
up a Pounds 250,000 fund to help cash-strapped constituency associations to
retain agents threatened with redundancy.
He was rewarded with enthusiastic applause and a declaration of '100 per
cent loyalty to the prime minister and the government' by Ms Judy Jamieson,
chairman of the national society of Conservative agents and formerly the
party's agent in the Christchurch by-election in July.
Mr Major's rallying call followed earlier warnings from other senior
Conservatives to dissident MPs not to undermine attempts to rebuild support
for Mr Major at the conference.
Sir Basil Feldman, chairman of the national union, which organises the
conference, said grass roots Tories were 'fed up' with disunity in the
parliamentary party. Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, said members wanted
to 'draw a line' under the disagreements of the past 12 months and 'get
behind John Major'.
Leading dissident MPs appeared unwilling to challenge the demand for unity,
which was supported over the weekend by Lady Thatcher, the former prime
minister. Mrs Teresa Gorman, an arch-critic of Mr Major, said she wanted him
to change course, but it would be 'completely inappropriate' to change the
leader at the moment. Her comments reflected a widespread view among
rightwing critics of Mr Major that no potential challenger to his leadership
could win this year.
However, the nervousness among party leaders was illustrated by more than
usually vigorous vetting of potential speakers in an attempt to head off
criticism from the floor of conference. Some ministers said the tactic could
backfire by provoking a disruptive demonstration by representatives excluded
from the rostrum.
The most likely flashpoint is the government's proposal to impose value
added tax on heating fuel, which attracted 25 critical resolutions from
constituency parties. None of the resolutions will be debated.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Business fears for Bermuda's future dominate election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HAMILTON, BERMUDA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERMUDA goes to the polls today amid claims that an opposition Progressive
Labour Party victory might undermine the growth of the island's offshore
financial centre.
The moderate PLP, which derives most of its support from Bermuda's 60 per
cent majority black population, needs to capture six more seats in the
40-seat legislature to form its first government.
The PLP insists that it wants to keep and develop the UK dependent
territory's offshore insurance and investment businesses. In the past 12
months some Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) has been pumped into new Bermudian
reinsurance companies by international investors.
Mr Frederick Wade, the PLP leader, says: 'No government would last a week if
they tried to mess around with the industry.'
The party simply wants to implement more effectively an existing government
policy giving Bermudians first choice for jobs when they have the necessary
qualifications and experience, he says. The PLP wants to create a new
ministry to 'troubleshoot' on behalf of international companies.
But business leaders, who almost unanimously support the ruling United
Bermuda party, are concerned about the PLP's ability to manage an economy
now equally dependent on the earnings and jobs generated by tourism and
offshore finance.
Mr Jeffrey Conyers, who heads First Bermuda Securities, a local securities
firm, says: 'Whether it is justified or not, people have jitters.'
Offshore reinsurers are attracted by the Atlantic island's record as a light
but reputable regulator, and the absence of taxes on income and profits.
However, other offshore centres, such as the Cayman Islands, offer similar
advantages.
Mr David Saul, the finance minister and head of the local subsidiary of
Fidelity, the US fund and investment management group, plays up the
significance of former links between the PLP leaders and Sir Lynden
Pindling, the former prime minister of the Bahamas. Sir Lynden's aggressive
economic policies led to a rapid contraction in his country's offshore
financial sector in the late 1960s.
However, Bermuda's recent difficulties have much to do with external
factors. Depressed tourist numbers are expected to bounce back this year,
and GDP to grow modestly. Politicians of all parties agree that Bermudians -
who have one of the highest rates of GDP per capita in the world at more
than Dollars 25,000 - usually vote with their wallets.

FT  05 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A company plagued by inaccurate and potentially damaging rumours is
undoubtedly placed in a difficult position. If it allows the allegations to
be published and issues a denial, it takes the risk that the the rumour may
gain currency. On the other hand, taking out an injunction to prevent
publication may be viewed as an excessive response. To the extent that
Ladbroke was caught between a rock and a hard place, one can feel sympathy.
Yet to use such heavy weapons at a time when the company is in transition
from the long tenure of Mr Cyril Stein's chairmanship to a new team is
perhaps a pity. The new board has the difficult task of making its own mark.
Ladbroke has made efforts in recent times to be more open, and a more
limited riposte to the recent rumours would have confirmed that new
approach.
There have been attempts to cast doubt on Ladbroke's finances before.
Judging by the 1992 annual report and subsequent interim statement, however,
there is little new to worry about. True, borrowings are uncomfortably high,
the rise in the dollar last year forced up gearing, and the heavy dividend
payment looks out of line with trading prospects. The need to conserve cash
is perhaps a barrier to the expansion of the capital-intensive Hilton hotel
chain. Yet that is all well known.
There does not seem to be a massive cash outflow and the company has the
unusual luxury that practically none of its borrowings are secured on
particular assets and it has no covenants on these debts. Since Ladbroke has
considerable flexibility to resolve its difficulties, it might perhaps try
to lighten up a bit.

FT  05 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It will take more than a few overseas contracts to convince that North West
is among the winners in the UK water sector. Potential earnings from its
Mexico City contract are a drop in the ocean compared with profits generated
by its regulated utility business. The performance of the shares in the
run-up to next year's regulatory review suggests that the market sees the
balance of risk and reward closer to home. A poor unregulated business in
the shape of Biffa has not stopped Severn Trent outperforming on the
strength of its main water operations.
With one of the biggest capital expenditure programmes in the second half of
the decade, North West is certainly exposed to the outcome of the review.
South West and Anglian are in a similar position. If Ofwat allows the
companies to earn a generous rate of return on new investment, high spending
might translate into high profits. But investors nervous of regulatory risks
are more likely to favour companies with relatively low spending plans and
strong financial ratios. Severn Trent fits the bill, as do Southern, Wessex
and Welsh.
With the regulator's opening shot still a month away, though, placing bets
now can be based on little more than gut feel. Importantly, the government
has not yet responded to Ofwat's appeal for relaxation of new water and
sewerage standards. Without a political decision on that, the companies'
level of capital spending remains uncertain, let alone the rate of return
they might be allowed to earn on that investment. Until the rules become
clearer, there is a strong argument for investors hedging their bets.

FT  05 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a measure of the resilience of UK equities that the market was not
prepared to retreat on the threat of civil strife in Russia, but advanced as
the crisis was resolved. True, the rise in the FT-SE 100 index was led in
the futures market and the lower echelons of the cash market were left
trailing. But that need not undermine the significance of yesterday's rally.
If overseas investors are taking positions for the fourth quarter and the
new account, the futures market may simply be the first port of call.
That said, there was nothing in yesterday's consumer lending figures which
might rekindle hopes of an interest rate cut to please the faithful at the
Conservative party conference. The picture is not as rosy as the headline
net borrowing figure suggests. Finance houses gained business from the
strong new car market. The rush to take advantage of favourable credit terms
from motor manufacturers could easily dwindle as special offers are
withdrawn. Credit card companies - probably a better indicator of overall
consumer confidence - saw net repayments in August. With retail sales on an
upward trend and narrow money growing faster than the government's target
range, though, the chancellor still has good reasons for delaying any rate
cut.

FT  05 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: BNP's bargain price
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was always a safe bet that the first French privatisation stocks would be
priced cheaply to guarantee success. But the FFr240 a share price tag
attached to BNP dropped off the bottom of most investors' ready reckoners.
With so much at stake, the government clearly felt it could take no chances.
The generous retail allocation suggests it was especially keen to entice
private investors who were badly burned after the earlier wave of French
privatisation. Still, BNP's new shareholders will have to be patient. The
bank, which last reported a 61 per cent fall in interim net profits, may not
return to growth until 1995.
Some distinctly Gallic twists to privatisation appeared yesterday which are
likely to characterise the whole programme. The incestuous clutch of French
industrial groups to appear on BNP's share register will doubtless help
ensure the stability the government so craves. French companies with huge
debts may see additional attractions to buying stakes in one of their main
creditors.
One intriguing aspect, though, is the emergence of foreign investors as core
shareholders, with the Kuwait Investment Authority, Roche, and GE of the US
most striking among them. BAT Industries, too, was among the favoured few.
Its financial services arm no doubt relished the chance to buy a worthwhile
chunk of one of Europe's biggest banks. But its tobacco business was
probably just as keen.
With the state-owned tobacco monopoly Seita soon to be privatised, what
better opportunity could BAT have had to win friends and influence in
France's financial corridors?

FT  05 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Tightening up internal controls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORDS 'internal controls' act like catnip on accountants: they produce a
frenzy of enthusiasm, sometimes for reasons not entirely clear to the
outside world.
Just such a surge of excitement was created by one of the recommendations of
last year's Cadbury committee on corporate governance. 'The directors should
report on the effectiveness of the company's system of internal controls,'
said the Cadbury code.
Since then, an accountants' working party has been fleshing out the details.
Its report appeared last week, under the auspices of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Already, critics are complaining
about the catnip effect.
The report is a long one: six chapters, six appendices and 67 pages. It is
detailed, prescriptive and wide-ranging. It includes, for example, the
question of how a company seeks to enhance the expertise of its staff,
communicate its ethical guidelines, 'evaluate and counsel staff on a formal
basis', and assess the risks of technology, currency fluctuations or
corporate acquisitions.
The recommendations have immediately been criticised: too bureaucratic, too
detailed, impossible to implement, say the critics, who include finance
directors of some of Britain's biggest companies.
Some such opposition was always likely. Much of the original Cadbury report
was about the top-dressing of company life: the structure of board
committees, the role of non-executive directors, and so on. The internal
controls issue reaches deep into the workings of Britain's companies, and
correspondingly stirs up more resentment.
Nitty-gritty
Both sides in the argument have a point. From the accountants' point of
view, internal controls are the vital link between the good intentions of a
Cadbury-conscious board and the nitty-gritty of daily business practices.
Without proper internal controls - and a 'control environment' of honesty
and commitment throughout the company - the governance reforms are a waste
of time.
From the critics' point of view, the report is yet another example of
non-economic thinking. Companies are constantly urged to improve this or
that internal monitoring system - environmental, equal opportunities, legal
compliance, and now financial controls - on the grounds that their
objectives are absolute goods, requiring no further justification.
Yet all internal systems, for control or information, impose costs on the
company, its customers and its shareholders. Collectively, they impose a
cost on society that may be equal to or greater than the sum of the benefits
they provide. Advocates of better control and monitoring usually place
little weight on this possibility; the theme gets only six lines in the
working party report.
Financial scandals
There is plenty of time for the critics to seek to influence the shape, tone
and details of the working party document: the deadline for comments extends
to February next year. As part of the discussion process, it is worth
remembering lessons from the financial scandals that led to the Cadbury
report in the first place.
One common theme of the Maxwell and BCCI affairs - and of other, less
spectacular crashes - was the ability of top managers to distort and
manipulate the most vital records of the companies they led. In the BCCI
case, for example, loan details were falsified; at the Maxwell companies,
transfers of pension fund assets were recorded incorrectly.
In these and other cases, the rest of the directors displayed an apparent
lack of responsibility for the proper functioning of internal controls. This
fully justifies Cadbury's aim of giving directors specific responsibility
for assuring themselves that the company keeps proper financial records.
It would not, however, justify an overly detailed set of recommendations
about how directors should carry out and report on this task. If the working
party has gone too far towards detail and complexity, the comment period
creates an opportunity for revision. But internal controls matter, to
shareholders as well as accountants, and it is important to get directors'
responsibilities for them spelt out clearly. There is more than catnip here.

Light at last on one of the mysteries of British Rail's operations - why,

Asking the question at a suburban ticket office, a reader was told: 'It's

Far from constituting its own reward, virtue can leave you distinctly out of
pocket these days, as Colin Forsyth discovered last month.
Forsyth, a founder director of the insolvent insurance group London United
Investments, had tried everything he could think of to chivvy the Department
of Trade and Industry into finishing its investigation into LUI.
Almost three years since the inspectors began their work, Forsyth got wind
towards the end of September that the investigation had finally been
completed. As one of the only two remaining directors, he awaited his
pre-release copy for comments and suggestions with not a little interest.
But nothing materialised.
So he phoned the DTI yet again, to be informed that, had he been reprimanded
or severely criticised in the report, he would naturally have received an
early copy, gratis, so that he could make a rebuttal, or if necessary,
prepare a defence in law. Since he did not fall into this category, the DTI
added brightly, he would have to pay the full price, Pounds 36 a copy.

Guess who's coming to dinner? The Tory party hierarchy has stepped up its

Sir Norman Fowler is hosting a very private dinner for her on Wednesday

platform during Kenneth Clarke's speech on the economy the following
morning.
So who these days gets invited to such exclusive gatherings? Observer can
reveal that Charles Hambro, Maurice Saatchi, John and Penny Gummer and Lady
Wakeham have all accepted. But there are still one or two places going
spare.
Any suggestions?

When Britain's Sir Nigel Wicks takes up the chair of the European Community
monetary committee he will be joined by another old Washington hand at the
top of the secretive EC body.
For later this month, Gunter Grosche, currently the German finance
ministry's expert on European monetary union, moves to Brussels to head the
committee's permanent secretariat.
Wicks and Grosche know each other from when they were respectively British
and German executive directors of the International Monetary Fund in
Washington.
Both high-fliers, Sir Nigel is second permanent secretary in the Treasury
and so responsible for international monetary affairs. He was formerly the
UK 'sherpa', the senior official who prepares the Group of Seven summit
meetings.
Meanwhile, Grosche has most recently been the Bonn finance ministry's expert
on the Maastricht Treaty. He first attracted notice as a close aide of
Manfred Lahnstein, German finance minister, in 1982.
It will be intriguing to see how relations now develop between the European
Commission and the committee, which is mainly made up of senior officials
from EC member states' finance ministries and central banks. Wicks in
particular is no friend of Euro-federalist views and he takes over as
chairman after a period when relations with the Commission have occasionally
been fraught.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Observer: A way with water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Bob Thian left school at 16 with two years to kill before being allowed
to take up his university place, he initially played jazz at a night club.
Tiring of that, he then took himself off to Geneva University where he had
intended just to try a few law courses. He didn't return to the UK to work
until he was head-hunted for the top job at North West Water some 30 years
later.
In a hurry now as then, Thian is bound shortly for Mexico to celebrate his
latest international deal, providing water services to 2m inhabitants of
Mexico City. North West is already immersed in projects from Malaysia to
Australia, easily outstripping its other UK rivals on the international
stage.
One other British company has bid on every deal in which North West has
taken part, and has yet to win anything.
Working first in Switzerland as a barrister, Thian then spent 23 years in
the pharmaceuticals business, with Glaxo, Abbott Laboratories of the US and
the Danish company Novo Industri. When the head-hunters called about North
West Water, he says he thought they were having him on.
Soon warming to a new industry, he attributes his globe-trotting success to
'team work' and a 'dislike of losing'.
Building what he calls 'a portfolio of regulators' to reduce dependence on
the UK authorities, he has focused on 10 more countries into which he wants
to take North West, five of which he admits are 'very long-term' prospects,
with just one staffer beavering away.
Picked for their political and economic stability, these potential project
locations were selected shortly before the April 1992 domestic elections.
If North West had been judging Britain by the criteria it applied to the
others, this country would not have been one of the chosen.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Victory for all the president's men: Parliament's defeat
might tempt Yeltsin to prolong autocratic rule and delay reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In retrospect, what had seemed on Sunday a rout of the forces of President
Boris Yeltsin by the pro-parliamentary mob on the Moscow streets was,
wittingly or not, a bloody but brilliant trap.
Released from their 12-day confinement in the White House, the parliament
building, the defenders, led by ex-general, ex-vice-president, acting
President Alexander Rutskoi, launched themselves on the mayoral offices and
the Ostankino TV centre. Their easy success at the mayoralty - from which
the riot troops fled ignominiously - made them drunk with success (some were
already literally so). Their attack on Ostankino, initially partially
successful, was halted late last night and by early yesterday morning
repulsed.
From 7am, divisions loyal to the president had removed any doubts as to
their willingness to fight fellow Russians - blasting away at the White
House with enthusiasm, blackening its shining facade in hours. From the
president's men came a steady barrage of propaganda, identifying those
within the building as criminals, communists and fascists: 'Our only task,'
said General Dmitry Volkogonov, Mr Yeltsin's military adviser, 'is to clean
these fascist bandits out of parliament and out of Moscow.'
Mr Yeltsin's television appearance early yesterday was almost contrite. His
weakness, he said, was in being over-patient, not prepared for the ferocity
of his opponents. He had taken a calculated risk, but his citizens could
well ask why he was not prepared, given that the omission caused many
deaths. However, he knows well the psychology of his fellow countrymen and
women, which tends towards pity for the underdog and the victim - a fact
that inhibited him from attacking parliament building before it clearly
revealed itself as the aggressor.
Before and during his troops' recapture of the White House, his moderate
opponents were forced to choose - and chose him. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the
most prominent candidate for Mr Yeltsin's job when elections are held,
called on him to attack the parliament ruthlessly. Mr Yevgenny Ambartsumov,
head of the parliament's foreign affairs committee, who has been
consistently critical of the president, said: 'His weaknesses are well
known, but now we don't have a choice: we support the president.' The sight
of armed bands roaming Moscow's streets, prepared to capture, beat or kill
mayoral aides and television staff, flaunting communist or fascist banners,
sickened all but the most hardened anti-Yeltsinites.
Once more, Mr Yeltsin has shown he is a good man in a tight corner. But this
time he has also shown that he, or his advisers, can construct and execute a
plan successfully. Preparing the ground with visits to the crack divisions
around Moscow (exactly those that came to his aid); giving an elaborate
display of willingness to compromise with parliament; insisting on
constructing a government and a team from one spectrum of politics (at the
cost, of course, of confusion in economic policy) - all of these came to
serve him well.
He has waded through blood, but he can plausibly say he had no choice. The
hard fact is that he has probably benefited from so doing.
Communism has been convincingly identified with violence, extremism and its
supposed opposite, fascism. The flag most in evidence around the White House
before the attack, the most common banner on the victorious marches on
Sunday, was the red flag. Its more moderate supporters claimed they were
fulfilling part of their old duty of protecting the wretched. Now, they have
supported an uprising which claimed many victims - and which failed.
To be sure, the spectacle - watched up close by many in Moscow - of armour
pounding parliament, roused feelings of sympathy for the people inside. But
the winner in Russia still takes, if not all, a great deal: and one would
expect many of the regions, shorn of a federal parliament with which to ally
themselves, to seek an accommodation with a victorious president. The
neighbouring states, led by Ukraine and Lithuania, yesterday reaffirmed
their support for the 'democratic forces' under the president. They had
little choice, since his opponents were increasingly clear that they wished
to resurrect the Soviet Union from which the states had escaped. The
regions, still to respond, will also have to live with Mr Yeltsin, and few
will see much profit in continued principled opposition.
If he goes to an election quickly - and the Interfax news agency, citing his
advisers, yesterday said he now thought he should have simultaneous
presidential and parliamentary elections in short order - he can probably
win as a law and order president. There is, again, the risk of his losing as
a slayer of Russians and a destroyer of the constitution. But if he
continues to insist that he wants to construct a new democracy, he may
convince many of his citizens to support him, because in the main they
simply want peace and elementary order.
It is here, of course, that the largest danger lies - one that has been
imminent since he closed down parliament and thus precipitated this turn of
events two weeks ago this evening. The threat is of a president who finds
the exercise of sole, untrammelled power attractive, and who convinces
himself and his circle - or is convinced by his circle - that the
prolongation (temporary, of course) of presidential rule is best for the
country.
This passage of arms gives him cause to think so. Here was, it seems, a
monstrous and murderous conspiracy to overthrow the state with armed force.
As Gen Volkogonnov and Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff,
said yesterday, the 'mopping up' operations of armed extremists in Moscow
and elsewhere will take some time - a curfew has already been imposed. Mr
Yeltsin has banned all groups that took part in the defence of the White
House, and frozen their funds. Mr Yuri Afanasiev, the veteran radical
democrat who was at the forefront of perestroika under Mr Mikhail Gorbachev
and who deserted Mr Yeltsin because of his lack of commitment to reform,
sounded doubtful yesterday: 'I hope we can get through this to democracy: if
the president can manage this, we may yet build a secure foundation for it -
but everything now depends on him.'
Everything now does indeed depend on him and on his advisers and ministers.
In removing parliament he has cut out a poison, but not yet cauterised the
wound. If left to gape, it could fester well beyond Moscow. After the
exhaustion of the past few days, he must again gird himself to give new
impetus to reforms that will produce no quick results, but without which his
country could more easily fall to the forces defeated yesterday.
History is replete with dictators who destroyed or rendered servile their
popular assemblies in order to have unimpeded power. Mr Yeltsin claims to be
an exception. He has acted, he says, not to rule without hindrance but to
construct a balanced division of powers on a democratic basis. His case is
also that the parliament - which originally elected him, supported him, then
turned against him - is a remnant of an irrelevant communist past.
This claim is at once full of sense and full of danger. Many ordinary
people, by their testimony on the streets, find Mr Yeltsin threatening -
both because he has smashed the countervailing power and because he ploughs
on with reforms that they cannot understand and from which they do not
benefit. On the bridge overlooking the White House yesterday morning, as the
shells crashed into its walls, Mrs Yevgenia Zaglyadina, a middle-aged
teacher, was semi-hysterical: 'Look, this is fascism; this is how it comes,'
she said. 'This is its victory. Yeltsin is at its head.' Now, Mrs Zaglyadina
and others have no choice: there is no one else in a position of independent
authority in whom they can place their trust.
Mr Yeltsin has survived a test of fire. He faces the longer, less
controllable test of bringing together, constructing and letting grow new -
and opposing - forces that will form a new Russia. The shedding of blood -
and the toll will be many hundreds - will be of some value if this massive
task is accomplished through its sacrifice.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Personal View: A blueprint to reshape government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM MATHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vice-president Al Gore's initiative to reinvent US government has been
criticised for being tame. This is unfair. His proposals to decentralise,
cut red tape, empower and expose bureaucrats to competitive tendering are
clearly desirable, if scarcely revolutionary.
The risk is that the reformist thrust will before long lose its momentum,
and the old bureaucratic habits reappear. The problem is global. Just as the
Gore initiative revisits ground trodden by President Reagan's deregulators,
so Britain's prime minister John Major, when he presents deregulation as a
main theme of this week's Conservative party conference, will be
revitalising Lord Young's deregulatory thrust of the 1980s.
The propensity of bureaucratic empires to regroup and expand is at the
centre of the public choice school of economic analysis pioneered by US
economists James Buchanan and Gordon Tulloch. Yet their followers have
failed to devise a new model of government that would curb the growth of
bureaux, build in opportunities to choose between potential providers of
government services, and define more tightly what politicians and public
want officials to deliver.
In one relatively small country the tribulations of the 1980s led to the
invention of a means to achieve these objectives. New Zealand is well known
for its liberalising 'Rogernomics', pioneered by finance minister Roger
Douglas, which helped turn round its economy in the 1980s. In the 1990s it
may become even better known for a sophisticated redesign of its entire
machinery of government.
In the new framework, a policy is no longer a vague notion, linked loosely,
if at all, to what departments actually do, frequently at odds with
available resources and disconnected from desired goals. Every department
now has a weighty, costed, line-by line 'purchase agreement' with its
minister. And not only does the minister explicitly purchase policies from
the department, but the former departmental permanent heads, now re-named
chief executives and on fixed-term contracts, are personally accountable for
departmental delivery.
The secret of the New Zealand formula is that it sharpens and clarifies at
every stage what government thinks. First and foremost, it puts new
pressures on ministers to clarify their own objectives - the desired
'outcomes' of their work - clear them with colleagues, and vote proper
resources and establish political priorities. Not all ministers find that
this comes naturally, but the obligation to sign a contract with their
department specifying its tasks for the year ahead concentrates the mind.
What seemed like a rod for the bureaucracy has become a healthy discipline
for politicians, and a disincentive to seat-of-the-pants short-termism.
The ministerial purchase contract is incorporated within a performance
agreement with each departmental chief executive. It sets out the key areas
for which the chief executive is accountable. Chief executives have autonomy
to run their departments and hire and fire, as never before. The quid pro
quo is tough reporting requirements.
The model contract supplied by the system's watchdog, the State Services
Commission, runs as follows: 'As chief executive I will provide a written
report to the minister against all parts of this agreement in writing as
soon as possible after the end of each quarter. This report will include an
executive summary which identifies any significant variations of actual
against target performance, what specific action will be taken to address
underperformance, and set out in a more detailed report what was expected
and what was delivered.'
Not every chief executive is thrilled by the new regime. It provides, after
all, just the sort of targets, monitoring techniques, incentives and
performance measures that prevail in the business world but are anathema to
many public servants worldwide. But politicians of all stripes are beginning
to recognise the system's potential to squeeze better value for every
taxpayer dollar. Introduced by Labour, the system has been reviewed,
endorsed and developed by the National party. Invented by high-powered
Treasury officials in response to New Zealand's crisis of the 1980s, it is
more than a patch-up, providing a new intellectual understanding of
government as a series of defined and enforceable contracts.
For Al Gore, John Major and politicians across the world struggling to
squeeze more performance out of creaking governmental systems designed in
the last century, New Zealand's redesign points the way.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Leading Article: The final argument
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT LOOKED bad. The parliament building ringed by tanks, firing shell after
shell at its plate glass windows. Inside, a huddled rump, the elected
representatives of the people. Outside, a president who tears up the
constitution, uses the army to impose his authority, and suspends opposition
newspapers, egged on by the leaders of the 'free world'.
It is bad, but that does not mean that Mr Yeltsin or his western backers are
wrong. It is tragic that the post-Soviet power struggle in Russia had to be
resolved in this manner, but it is not really surprising. What has been
surprising up to now is the reluctance of almost all Russian parties to
resort to force, and of the Russian armed forces to act as the arbiters of
political conflict; and the widespread acceptance, in a country with little
or no experience of democracy, of the idea that ultimately political power
must be allocated by majority vote.
Yet that principle, however valuable, is not by itself enough to resolve all
conflicts. So much depends on who votes, and when, and for what. Most
democracies have written constitutions to regulate those matters; but more
important than any text is a social consensus, derived from tradition, about
how things should be done.
Vital principle
In Britain, for example, there is a clear understanding among all parties
that, if the monarch dissolves parliament on the advice of her prime
minister, it is dissolved and new elections will be held. If Mr John Major
lost a vote of confidence in the House of Commons, he would not need to send
tanks to disperse his opponents. The issues in question were decided in
Britain centuries ago, by people who were quite prepared to use the
equivalent of tanks when a vital principle was at stake. Might is not right,
but right without might is inoperative. Force is and always will be ultima
ratio regum: the final argument of kings.
In Russia, where these issues are now being decided for the first time, it
is not surprising that that 'final argument' has had to be invoked. The
locus of legitimacy was not clear. Mr Yeltsin had solid grounds for
believing it lay with him, and took care to establish that this view was
shared by the commanders of the armed forces. But his opponents were not
convinced until the final argument was deployed. Indeed, so sure were they
of their own legitimacy that on Sunday they took the initiative in
attempting to seize power by force.
The bloodshed that resulted is highly regrettable. But the outcome of the
struggle is a matter of quite legitimate relief. Russia's crying need in
present circumstances - and the overwhelming interest of the rest of the
world - is for coherent government. It is not certain that Mr Yeltsin can
satisfy it, but it is quite certain that his opponents could not.
Economic autonomy
Mr Yeltsin has won an important victory, even if at high cost. He owes it,
to the dead as well as the living, to make sure that they have not died in
vain. He must exploit his victory to the full, asserting his new-found
authority not only in Moscow but throughout the federation. That does not
mean installing a reign of terror, which would be repugnant to both Russian
and international public opinion, and therefore counterproductive. It does
mean dismissing officials who reject or ignore government decisions, and -
much more difficult - replacing them with others who are competent as well
as loyal. It means pushing ahead with the reforms that are giving economic
autonomy to Russian individuals and firms. And it means organising new
elections to settle the issue of legitimacy beyond doubt.
Mr Yeltsin was said yesterday to have come round to the view that
presidential and parliamentary elections should be held simultaneously. That
would certainly be preferable to prolonging the agony, with a six-month
presidential campaign straight after a three-month parliamentary one. Mr
Yeltsin's victory yesterday will be pyrrhic indeed if he ends up with a new
parliament no more co-operative than the one he has just forcibly dissolved.
He has not got time to build a fully structured party. But he can and should
endorse a full slate of candidates pledged to support him and his programme
 -so that voters have a chance both to choose a president and to give him a
majority he can work with.

FT  05 OCT 93 / The feeling's mutual: Patrick Harverson examines a change in
US investors' habits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American investors have been pouring Dollars 1bn a day into mutual funds
this year. That would be enough to pay off the government's 1993 budget
deficit in nine months, or to meet the non-mortgage debts of every citizen
in little more than two years.
This unprecedented flow of money has helped lift domestic stock markets to
record levels. Yet the repercussions of the dramatic growth in mutual funds
 -pools of individuals' and institutions' money invested in stocks, bonds
and cash instruments - go beyond contented fund managers and soaring
financial markets.
The inflow represents a shift in the country's investing habits, making
individuals' savings more susceptible to swings in financial markets. This
change in investment behaviour, in turn, may result in less stable markets:
the switching of large amounts of money into stocks and bonds with a higher
risk than short-term bank deposits increases the likelihood that investors
will withdraw their funds at short notice.
Mr Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, warns: 'Many of
these investors are new to the equity markets, and they likely will get very
nervous if the market begin to correct, and they may cut and run. I don't
think at the moment that the market is all that vulnerable, but who knows
what would set such a stampede off.'
The growth of mutual funds is helping fuel economic growth by supplying
capital to corporate and government borrowers. Yet it also complicates the
Federal Reserve's job of managing monetary policy by distorting money supply
measures used to track economic activity and set interest rates.
About Dollars 1,800bn is currently invested by mutual funds in US equity,
bond and money markets, up from Dollars 770bn five years ago. In 1980, only
6 per cent of US households owned mutual funds; today, 27 per cent, or more
than 38m individual investors, own funds.
The most influential factor driving the industry's growth has been low US
interest rates. The Federal Reserve began easing monetary policy in late
1990 to help the ailing US economy. From then on, interest rates fell
rapidly as the economy moved into recession, finally emerging into a period
of slow, low-inflation growth. The sharp decline in rates made stock and
longer-term bond funds attractive to investors who saw yields on their
short-term assets, such as bank certificates of deposit and money market
accounts, drop to below 3 per cent.
'An entire generation of adults grew up with the assumption that they could
get 7 per cent or higher on their money and take almost no risk. Over the
last two years that has become an incorrect assumption - they can only get 2
to 4 per cent risk-free, which is not an adequate return to meet their
investment goals,' says Mr Roger Servison, head of retail sales at Fidelity,
the largest mutual fund group in the US.
At the same time as falling interest rates were pushing yield-sensitive
investors into bond and equity funds, the 35-45-year-olds of the 'baby boom'
generation came of financial age, and embraced mutual funds.
One way 'baby-boomers' have gained access to funds has been through their
company pension schemes. An increasing number of US companies are turning
away from traditional defined-benefit retirement plans, which guarantee
employees a specific pension by investing their cash in a company-wide fund,
towards defined-contribution pensions, which give employees the chance to
choose from a variety of investment options, most of which are mutual funds.
The skill of mutual fund companies in marketing their products has been
another cause of growth. More than 4,000 funds exist, more than double the
number five years ago, and fund groups have been joined by new players in
the market - securities houses and commercial banks. Merrill Lynch, the
biggest US securities house, is now the country's second-largest mutual fund
group with Dollars 115bn of customer assets under its management.
The surge in mutual funds has benefited many companies, as a rising stock
market has made it easier to raise finance. Mr Richard Hoey, chief economist
at the Dreyfus fund group, says the surge in mutual funds has allowed
companies to pay off or reduce their debts. 'We ended up with a corporate
balance sheet dramatically strengthened, and financial risk in the system
dramatically reduced,' he says.
But there are disadvantages to the buoyancy of the mutual funds industry.
The benefits mutual funds have brought to the US economy would be threatened
if new investors stampeded out of funds at the first sign of a stock or bond
market correction.
Last summer a survey by the Investment Company Institute, which represents
the mutual fund industry, showed that one in 10 mutual fund owners had
bought their first fund between January 1991 and mid-1992. Moreover, many
recent buyers are not particularly wealthy - the ICI says the median income
of mutual fund shareholders is a modest Dollars 50,000 a year. What worries
the pessimists is that first-time and less well-off buyers, with a
significant portion of their savings invested in funds, are just the type of
investor likely to be panicked by a market slide.
Most practitioners in the industry agree that the current pace of growth
cannot be sustained, and that the risk of a correction in financial markets
cannot be ruled out.
Mr Ronald Lynch, chairman of the ICI, warned recently: 'It is imperative
that we educate these first-time investors about both the risks and rewards
of investing in long-term funds. In particular, bond fund investors must
understand the impact of interest rate changes on the price of bond funds.'
The chances of a crash in stock or bond prices, however, are regarded as
slim by Wall Street. The economy and corporate earnings are steadily, if
slowly, improving and underpinning the buoyancy of financial markets. At the
same time, Mr Servison of Fidelity is confident investors will not take
fright: 'Eighty per cent of all mutual fund owners have been through the '87
crash, the mini-crash of '89 and the Russian coup of '91, and they have
learned not to panic in sharp drops in the market,' he says.
Industry observers also believe that demographic trends will remain
favourable for several years, attracting new investors. At the same time,
employee pension plans, with an emphasis on mutual fund investing, are
expected to grow more popular.
Such factors encourage companies selling mutual funds to believe that, even
if US interest rates start to rise or financial markets dip, the mutual fund
industry will not be knocked off its confident stride.

Sir, Gerry Boon (Accountancy: 'No room for own goals in financing soccer's

definition of an asset and should be capitalised (not to show the value of
the business but as a record of the transaction). But intangible? Ask the

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, I enjoyed Antony Thorncroft and Richard Fairman's assessment of the
future of London's orchestras ('The men of violins fight for the loot',
September 25). On the whole the piece was incisive and well researched.
However on the subject of theatre funding your correspondents were less
accurate. To set the record straight, the Arts Council has never announced
that a number of theatres would have their grants withdrawn as a result of
the artistic review. This supposition was merely speculation which gained
credence through inaccurate reporting.
Your correspondents are correct, however, to identify the enormous public
support for the arts in the UK which was prompted by this speculation -
support which, I hope, will remain with the Arts Council as we and our
colleagues in the arts fight against the proposed Pounds 5m cut by
government which may well result in irreparable damage to those very
theatres and arts organisations which are so vital to our cultural life in
Britain.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Industrial gas competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Lascelles ('Hot air rises around cool decisions', September 29)
highlights the shifting positions in the debate on the future of British
Gas. I was, however, interested to note that industrial gas consumers can
now get gas at 15 per cent less than British Gas supplies it at. Would that
this were entirely the case.
Prior to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry, the Office of Fair
Trading set a target to reduce British Gas's share of the industrial and
commercial gas market by some 60 per cent, to allow in new competitors. A
likely result of this is that the price of interruptible gas supplies may
now go up. Indeed a number of the new players in the gas market predict
this.
This results from British Gas not needing to have its future largely
governed by the price set in the interruptible market, and from the fact
that, as its overall market share shrinks, its ability to offer low-price
interruptible gas to balance demands elsewhere will also decline. Rising
interruptible gas prices will not only adversely affect much of industry, it
will also limit the spread of combined heat and power at the moment the
government is promoting its wider use to curtail carbon dioxide emissions.
A further aspect of the post-MMC process is the impact the changing nature
of the British Gas tariff market will have on the government-backed Energy
Saving Trust, whose revenue critically depends on the pricing formula for
the tariff market. The trust is a centrepiece in the government's
environmental strategy - if the tariff market is open to all comers, can we
expect new entrants to sign up to the regulatory formula which underpins the
trust's activities?
When the DTI comes to make clear its position, there will be more at stake
than competition alone.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Lethal cocktail exacerbating economic
problems in Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID BRYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, World Bank President Lewis Preston (Personal View, September 27) is
right; the magnitude of sub-Sahara's deepening crisis presents the
international community with a formidable development challenge. The
question is, are the policies of northern governments, the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund capable of meeting it?
Not if proceedings at the World Bank-IMF annual meeting are anything to go
by. Yet again, northern governments missed an opportunity to address
sub-Saharan Africa's debt crisis, with British efforts to secure agreement
on a plan to write off two-thirds of the region's debt foundering on
Japanese resistance. The upshot is that debt servicing will continue to
drain the region of Dollars l0bn annually, or a quarter of export earnings.
These resources are desperately needed for investment in health, education
and the physical infrastructure vital to economic recovery.
With an average debt-to-export ratio of 400 per cent, higher than for Latin
America during the worst days of its debt crisis, the chances of sub-Saharan
Africa attracting the private capital which Mr Preston regards as vital to
recovery are negligible. That is why Oxfam is calling on the World Bank and
northern governments to increase diplomatic pressure on Japan to comply with
the Trinidad terms. As your leader of September 28 ('Debt relief cannot
wait') rightly observes, debt write-offs alone will not resolve Africa's
crisis. Equally urgent is a review of structural adjustment programmes,
designed and implemented under World Bank and IMF tutelage.
Nobody with a concern for Africa can deny the case for adjustment, or the
damage inflicted by policies such as over-valued exchange rates, blanket
protectionism of inefficient industries, or the heavy taxation of peasant
producers by state marketing monopolies. However, adjustment policies are
manifestly not establishing a platform either for sustained economic
recovery or for successful poverty alleviation. This is reflected in the
fact that investment levels in countries undergoing adjustment are lower
than in 1980, and in the persistence of high inflation and unsustainable
budget deficits.
The IMF's dogmatic attachment to reducing inflation through punitive
interest rates, and to rapid import liberalisation, provides part of the
explanation for this failure. Across the region, a lethal cocktail of rising
costs and cut-throat competition from abroad has caused mass unemployment,
and the collapse of labour intensive industries across the region. In many
countries, it is the resulting shortages of goods, rather than lax monetary
policy, which is fuelling inflation.
Oxfam believes that African governments, northern governments,
non-government organisations and the World Bank should unite around a new
agenda for recovery and social justice. That agenda must enshrine a
commitment to debt relief, and to redistributive policies which enable poor
people to benefit from market reforms. Without that commitment, Africa's
accelerating descent into social and economic catastrophe will continue
uninterrupted into the next century.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Stuck in the same old rut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is too easy. Over the past fortnight the Liberal Democrats and Labour
have prepared themselves for co-habitation. The repositioning of the
left-centre has begun. Victory is assured. The Conservatives are wrung out,
testy, ingloriously led. They have lost an ideology and are searching for a
role. Worse, they are tired - tired of squabbling, tired of polemics, tired
of office. Just watch them fall apart at their conference in Blackpool this
week. All that remains is a wait of one, two or at a push three years and
the new thinking of the 1990s will take over from the burnt-out remnants of
the 1980s. Mr John Smith will be in Downing Street and Mr Paddy Ashdown, a
controlling vote in his hands, in seventh heaven.
There is a case to be made for this somewhat unlikely story. It starts with
the prime minister. Mr John Major's strategy for reunifying his party is
that of a former whip. He wants to give something to his loudest opponents,
who are on the right. Thus he confesses, more or less, that there can be no
return to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System while
the party is in its present schismatic state. Meanwhile he plods along the
Thatcher trail, unaware of where the lady might have turned off, and carries
on privatising and market-testing everything that moves.
This approach is out of date. Most of us are turning away from the anarchy
that blinkered libertarians of the new right failed to foresee when they
sought to create a minimalist state. Middle-class unemployment has ensured
that. To take one example, when nobody can get academic tenure but everyone
must accept short-term contracts and find their own funding, bang goes the
support of intellectuals. Crime has rammed the point home: when everyone is
a customer, and nobody a citizen, those who cannot pay smash windows.
Society cannot work if every action within it is based on a cash
transaction. People need a sense of security, continuity, civic comfort.
There must be room for duty, responsibility, charity, professional pride,
enduring institutions, structure.
One straw in this wind is the recent publication by the Institute of
Economic Affairs of Dr David Green's Reinventing Civil Society, in which the
author argues for a restoration of civic society, based primarily on
voluntary welfare associations. That is a subject all of its own. My point
today is that the IEA, the think-tank that led the way towards 1980s market
thinking, is now publishing an argument to the effect that Thatcherism
over-stressed the market economy at the expense of community. Another straw
is Mrs Virginia Bottomley's attempt to delete the word 'market' as applied
to the NHS reforms. Yet another is the message put out by Labour's Mr Tony
Blair, the shadow home secretary. The interests of the community and of
individuals are intertwined, he says, and few of us forebear to cheer.
Perhaps the most articulate exponent of this change in the political terms
of trade is Mr John Gray, a Conservative philosopher and fellow of Jesus
College, Oxford. I discussed his book, Beyond the New Right, earlier in the
year. Yesterday he wrote in The Guardian that 'the Conservatives have no
coherent view of the functions and limits of market institutions'. The
'stagnant corporatism' of the 1970s was, he implies, rightly discarded. The
result of this, plus seeing 'government as the problem and markets as the
all-purpose solution', is that 'British conservatism today has nothing to
say about the political task of the age, which is reconciling the subversive
dynamism of market institutions with the human need for local rootedness and
strong and deep forms of common life'.
I would disagree with his characterisation of British conservatism as
anything nearly so coherent. There is the market-besotted right, and there
are the rest. The fault-line lies a millimetre to the left of Mr Michael
Portillo, who spoke up recently in favour of the Judeo-Christian ethic of
helping individuals help themselves. That line bundles a great many Tories
into the territory inhabited by everyone else: in favour of markets, but
worried about unemployment, social disintegration, the latter-day
destructiveness of the Thatcher-initiated revolution.
Former Conservative voters are turning to the Liberal Democrats, while
Labour becomes less frightening, less obviously subservient to unions. The
latter are more popular. It may become safe to vote Lib Dem, even if it puts
Labour in. So runs my likely story.
It may be a fairy story. The Tories have time to pull themselves together
before the next general election. The current cry in Blackpool is that this
is the week in which to support the party and cheer its leader. It may not
last the week, but over the weekend the mood began to turn against
dissidence. It may become less chic to be a destructive complainer. What the
party managers want us to believe is that this is a turning point for Mr
John Major. Perhaps it is. He can hardly sink much lower in the opinion
polls; nor can the Conservatives. There is nowhere to go but up - isn't
there? Technically speaking, the election can be postponed until April 1997.
That is an exceedingly long time in politics.
Anyhow, the Lib-Labs are not exactly close to perfection. The Liberal
Democrats have been exposed as rampant opportunists. Labour has been seen to
be clinging in ever closer embrace to its trade union parents. Do not
misunderstand me. Mr John Smith deserves the applause he received for
risking his authority on a vote in favour of reducing the influence of trade
unions in parliamentary selection procedures. He was brave, and he got a
good press for it. He did, however, pay a high price, partly in promises of
legislation that will protect employees but discourage employers from taking
them on, and partly by demonstrating that the horse-trading of union votes
is still what Labour is about.
In a hung parliament, if there is one, Labour might be accepted as the only
possible match for desperate Liberal Democrats. Yet what happened at
Brighton was a setback for Labour's modernisers. The cry for 'strong and
deep forms of common life' will not be stilled by the lullabies of the 1960s
and 1970s. Lab-Lib must do better if it is to be sure of defeating even the
pathetic bunch of dispirited Tories gathering here in Blackpool.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Evidence of Bundesbank role
inconclusive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES FORDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on Hans Tietmeyer ('Changeover at the Bundesbank', October
1) is accompanied by a chronology of the Bundesbank which records several
public disputes between government and bank. Since the Bundesbank usually
won, it might give the impression that central bank independence is part of
the story of the long period of west German economic success.
However this evidence would not be conclusive even if the bank had been
right on every issue. In an environment where decisions are taken by the
bank, politicians can take the opportunity to criticise policy without
having to be responsible for changing it. That does not mean that they would
change it if they could. This behaviour also occurs in the US where
Congress, although it has no power over the Federal Reserve, often debates
monetary policy.
After a dispute in 1972, however, as you say, finance minister Karl Schiller
resigned. He clearly wished to challenge the Bundesbank's policy, but what
were the motives of the bank? More than one scholar of German policy has
recorded the opinion that the Bundesbank deliberately picked a fight with
Schiller because it found him uncongenial. Indeed, the bank adopted
Schiller's policy once he had resigned.
This kind of distortion both of economic policy and of the democratic
process should not be counted a benefit of central bank independence.
It should make us reject the idea forthwith.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Arts: Artists true to their imagination - William Packer
admires modern art that is not avant-garde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French are still capable of surprising and gratifying us all. Just as we
finally despair of the current, apparently terminal state of the visual
arts, with a supposed avant-garde committed to nothing more than the glib
orthodoxies of critical fashion and the market-place, up they come with an
exhibition that clearly shows us that true painting and sculpture have been
going on all the time.
And what is it exactly, this 'true painting'? It is easier to say what it is
not, for here is nothing of empty conceptualising, no striking of
self-conscious attitudes, no idea-led and limited investigation or polemic,
no art about art. Above all, there is nothing in which responsibility for
the work as it actually appears is shuffled off onto mere process or the
bare proposition of idea or image. Here is the work of artists as
individuals, engrossed simply in the resolution of their work in terms of
their own direct experience of the world. At the last it is neither more nor
less than what they themselves have done. Responsibility is all.
That said, it has its limitations. Manifeste is hardly an earnest for the
future, for many of its artists are dead and none is exactly young. There is
to it all a whiff of the old-fashioned, which, to be fair, is openly
acknowledged in the excellent catalogue. 'Here are the crossers of the ford.
They have known another Europe, one still essentially agricultural,
industrial and artisan, such as it was in the 19th century, a culture from
before the media . . . They were active when those ideas that shaped our
epoch were in the melting-pot . . . they conducted their debates, of
solitude to solitude, with an astonishing vitality, for all their apparent
respect for traditional techniques, or their indifference to the spectacular
developments of newer generations.'
And, this being France, it is of course over-whelmingly Franco-centric, not
so much a celebration or attempt to reassert the primacy of the School of
Paris, but rather an acknowledgment of its survival. 'They knew how to keep
their distance. In the singularity of their work, these artists have indeed
written a 'parallel history', though its global sense was perhaps lost with
the end of the dominance of l'Ecole de Paris.' The exhibition is drawn from
the collections of the Musee nationale d'art moderne which are held at the
Centre Pompidou, and of its international element - that includes Balthus,
Giacometti, Picasso, Soto, Vasarely, Tapies, Fontana, Poliakoff, Miro,
Calder and many more - only Francis Bacon and Anthony Caro, at a quick
check, spent no extended working period in Paris.
The point is not altogether gratuitous, for that missing sens global might
well have been supplied, were there the works within the collections to
supply them, or the curatorial will to choose them. Quite whose fault that
is is an open question. We do well to remember that a narrow chauvinism,
though a French word, is by no means peculiar to the French.
The show is divided under headings - the painter and his model: figuration,
defiguration: the skin of the work: sign and handwriting: gesture and
colour: the surprises of geometry: and so forth. And, given the period, it
is not hard to find the places that might have been filled by American
painters such as Guston, Rothko, Motherwell, Kelly or de Kooning, or British
for that matter, such as Bridget Riley, Freud, Auerbach, Kossoff. It remains
true that most British painting of the period is barely known abroad. As for
the Americans, one of the show's most spectacular paintings is by Joan
Mitchell, an abstract expressionist who died last year at the age of 66,
having been resident in Paris for many years. She is not represented at all
in the current survey in London of 20th century American art. Forgetfulness
or indifference?
But this is a School of Paris show, even so, to be taken as it is, with all
its special emphases and lacunae, and as such it is one of the most
stimulating and encouraging exhibitions of near-current art to be seen in
recent years. The reason, adumbrated before, is simple, with the artist
shown once again in proper relation to his work, one to one, direct and
physical.
The imagery might be more or less figurative - Picasso's desperate, fading
sexuality; the more ambiguous, charged sexuality of Balthus, the
angst-ridden intensity of Giacometti, the humane despair of Bacon, the
dreadful, symbolic autobiography of Zoran Music. Again we might have Pol
Bury with his clicking, shifting, mechanical surfaces, Vasarely with his
eye-teasing opposition of positive to negative, Morellet with his dense,
meticulous cobwebs, Soto with his disrupted, moire-pattern effects, all of
them testing the muscular, palpable sensation of vision.
Or here are Burri and Tapies, Kemeny and Fontana, working the surface as a
physical object, or Mitchell, Bazaine, Riopelle, Viera da Silva, taking the
mark and the gesture at the brush's end and conjuring from it the internal
landscape of the mind to which all abstract painting would seem to aspire.
Whichever it is, before each particular work we confront an artist's
singular engagement with work, achieved with his own hands and resolved
through the medium of his own imagination and experience.
This is some of the work with which my generation grew up and, the nostalgic
frisson apart, it is good to see it brought once again into the light, not
as a critical curiosity, but as something still vital and imaginatively
potent. Painting is not dead, nor even moribund and in despair, but it is
critically neglected, especially that of the more recent generations.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the next three weeks, the South Bank is running a 'Czech Season': not
just a matter of dusting off familiar Dvorak and Janacek, for there are
unfamiliar and intriguing pieces too - by Suk, by Kozeluch and Krommer, Eben
and Benda, orchestral pieces and chamber works old and new, in all three of
the South Bank halls. Among the visiting Czech performers, on Saturday we
had the venerable Czech Philharmonic to open the season in the Festival
Hall.
Their programme consisted, grandly and simply, of Smetana's six-part cycle
Ma Vlast, 'My Fatherland', which we scarcely ever hear in a complete
end-to-end performance. Everybody knows the enchanting river-scape Vltava,
but the other five panels get only occasional exposure. If the
programme-book was over-excitable in declaring Ma Vlast 'without a doubt the
most complete embodiment of the Czech spirit in music', the conductor Jir
Belohlavek and his players persuaded us that the cycle is indeed aglow with
national spirit and that nobody is likely to deliver it so fairly and
fervently as Czechs.
Calling the components of Ma Vlast 'symphonic poems' is stretching a point.
Smetana offers even less symphonic argument or development than Berlioz or
Liszt. Except for Vltava, each of these pieces works chiefly by alternating
tuneful sections, with the odd academic fugato and loud, emphatic
repetitions at the close.
The saving virtues are Smetana's natural, unadorned fluency (folk-based but
inventive too), his special and affecting turns of modal harmony, and his
pristine orchestration: no recherche tricks or blends, but a lovely
appreciation of plain instrumental character. His strings always sound like
strings, his clarinets like clarinets, his horns like horns; the
sophisticated ambiguities of a Strauss or a Debussy were still some way off.
Like his Russian contemporary Balakirev, Smetana was a master of 'honest'
orchestral sound.
It is a rare Western band that can play him now with the right unforced,
uncomplicated candour - but the Czech Philharmonic did. Ma Vlast was
wonderfully bracing to hear, even for us non-Czechs who lack the native
response to the most resounding patriotic tunes.

Geneticists have just identified the learning gene which brings a little
nearer the day when it may be possible to ask the doctor to make your child
a Kasparov. Public awareness of genetic engineering, both its possibilities
and the attendant ethical dilemmas, is growing fast. Cracking the Code (BBC
2, 9.30), the series devoted to genetic engineering, strikes me as something
of a missed opportunity.
Cracking the Code is worthwhile and its American presenter, Dr David Suzuki,
is a good communicator. However, it tends to underestimate viewers'
sophistication and at times even a layman has the feeling that it is out of
date. Furthermore, it is irritating to find yet another medical series which
concentrates on the North American picture.
If you found last week's two-hour opening instalment of Armistead Maupin's
Tales of the City (C4, 10.00) slow and insipid, I would agree. However, this
series does build up momentum as it goes along. Strongly in its favour is
Olympia Dukakis's performance as the surprising Mrs Madrigal, enchanting
enough to make it worth it.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Arts: The Lion - Fringe theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another political play has opened on London in the last few days, apart from
David Hare's The Absence of War, and is much more fun. For all its
liveliness, it is no less serious than the work at the Royal National
Theatre.
The Lion, by the Guyana-born Michael Abbensetts, is about a deposed
Caribbean despot in exile in England called Ramsay James. After
independence, he was first prime minister of his island, then president for
life before his fall in a coup. Since he was educated at an English
university, he is not exactly a stranger in the land to which he returns.
James (Stefan Kalipha) is a ranter and a raver, an opportunist who has
ultimately sought to stamp out the opposition, also English-educated, by
force. Measured by the standards of some third world leaders, the portrait
of him is probably too kind. He is accused of killing 19 people, though he
has acted indirectly through his bodyguard, Hendricks.
The bodyguard, played by David Webber, is a wonderful figure who practises
obeah (a form of voodoo) but is equally at home in more conventional methods
of applying the frighteners. There is also an illegitimate daughter left
behind by James in England and an estranged (very black) wife who has become
rich with at least three elegant houses.
But forget about the plot. The remarkable fact about The Lion is the style.
It is almost entirely English, adapted for the Caribbean. The principal
influence is Noel Coward. The rich black lady imperiously played by Madge
Sinclair could step straight out of one of his works. It is drawing room
comedy which towards the end turns more into a thriller.
No-one should say you cannot make jokes about race or degrees of black and
whiteness. The Lion is full of them, and very funny a predominantly ethnic
audience found them. Equally appreciated are the jokes about third world
dictatorship and a lust for power.
There are snipes at Britain too. The exiled prime minister is quite used to
turning up at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for talks with
intelligence. He lies to them, they lie to him, he says. But when the FCO
decides he has no chance of returning to power, he is dropped and becomes
'just another black man'. A more moving line comes from a young black who
was born here. 'I'm a black Briton,' he says. 'But what are you to the
British?' comes the response from another black.
Directed by Horace Ove, the performance on the first night by the Talawa
Theatre Company was slightly under-rehearsed; by this week, however, The
Lion should look like a winner.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Arts: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds - Pop concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nick Cave has been loitering with intent in rock music's seamier
neighbourhoods for the best part of a decade and a half. Throughout his
career - first as the lead singer of the glum Australian post-punk band The
Birthday Party and then with his backing band the Bad Seeds - his attempts
to squeeze a depressing art from dirt has commanded a sizeable cult
following.
At no time has he ever been in danger of becoming a pop star. This is not
entirely his fault: he cannot help looking and sounding like a member of the
Addams family, but it is his choice to use the same tailor and barber and to
make the more literate horror story a model for so many of his songs which
pick obsessively at humanity's weaknesses and capacity for evil. Cave is
careful to lace his music with an appropriate degree of self-mockery - it is
only rock 'n' roll after all, but he undoubtedly takes it seriously. He
wrote music for Wim Wenders' films Faraway So Close and Wings of Desire, and
appeared in the latter and also in Johnny Suede. He has written a novel And
the Ass Saw the Angel. Clearly Cave is a highly creative type. But rock
remains the most natural medium for his Gothic, melodramatic personality.
At the Brixton Academy his voice, deep, rich doom-laden, lacking range but
perfectly suited to his material, fills the hall - with the help, of course,
of powerful amplification. He stands at the front of the stage waving an
admonitory cigarette at the black-clad crowd as he sings. In response a few
sway to the music, most simply stare like an army of undead. It is not until
Cave leaves the stage that they show signs of animation with a rapturous and
sustained demand for an encore.
The repertoire is hard work. Dirge is the dominant style, death the chief
subject. He can occasionally vary the pace. 'Papa Won't Leave You Henry' is
a grim tale delivered with a rolling, good-natured bluster, 'Deanna' a good
old-fashioned rocker - about murder. Yet there are moments when Cave manages
to be more than a grim joker. With 'The Ship Song' and 'The Weeping Song',
memorable tunes played in an almost stately fashion by the Bad Seeds, he
achieves a shabby grandeur and suggests a little hope, both musical and
lyrical.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Arts: Messiaen remembered - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Symphony Orchestra starts the current concert season in
commemorative mood, recalling two colossi of 20th-century music. A week ago
it was Leonard Bernstein (who died three years ago); last Sunday it was
Olivier Messiaen (who died last year). On both occasions the mixture of
memorial and celebration has been expertly judged.
Sunday's LSO Messiaen concert launched a series of four at the Barbican Hall
 -two by the LSO, two by the London Sinfonietta, the last timed to fall on
what would have been the composer's 85 birthday (Dec 10). During its course
the orchestra will give the eagerly-awaited London first performance (a year
after the New York premiere) of Eclairs sur l'au-dela, the last big Messiaen
composition.
But in the first of the series the approach was both introductory and
panoramic: in four works covering more than 50 years of creation -
L'Ascension (1933), Poemes pour Mi (1937), Chronochromie (1960) and La Ville
d'en haut (1987) - the evolutions in language and style of a composer who
came to dominate French music in the second half of the century were fully
and rewardingly adumbrated.
The idiom may have altered, sharpened, enriched its amalgam over time -
birdsong, Messiaen's most remarkable and most personal appropriation for
music, entered his artistic universe only in the 1950s. Yet the vision
behind the idiom remained utterly consistent. For Messiaen music was always
a means of glorifying God: this is the chain that securely joins up the
complete span of his compositions.
Sunday's LSO conductor was Pierre Boulez, in most respects a Messiaen
conductor non-pareil. The accuracy, brilliance, clean cut and balanced
outlook of his readings hardly need describing at this date. Not for the
first time, however, it struck me that the determinedly 'non-mystical' side
of Boulez's character sometimes prevents him from penetrating that very
region in Messiaen.
In L'Ascension, for instance, the numinous atmosphere that should accrue
from the ritualistic passage of four richly-textured movements was undercut
by the conductor's matter-of-fact-ness; and in Chronochromie, the most
ruggedly complex of Messiaen compositions, though Boulez always sorts out
the barrage of detail with enviable lucidity, the spiritual purpose behind
the detail remained unclear.
Yet when so much of Messiaen's thinking is characterised with so much
mastery, by conductor and orchestra alike, it is hard to remain long in this
critical mode. And to the performance of the rapturously romantic Poemes by
the French soprano Francoise Pollet, ample, beautiful and serenely dignified
in every bar, surrender was the only possible response.
Earlier on Sunday the Barbican had offered the first of its 'Celebrity
Recitals': Stephen Kovacevich played Beethoven and Schubert (two more later
this month). In spite of an early technical hiccup with the Steinway, the
pianist produced the sort of playing that now places him among the world's
small number of reigning Classical masters. Kovacevich seems boldly
unconcerned with tonal allure; his Beethoven Op 31 sonatas were often gruff,
but never lacking in spirit. His Schubert - the late A major - combined
simple lyricism and long-term dramatic intensity in a way to bring to mind
the late Rudolf Serkin. No praise could be higher.

FT  05 OCT 93 / People: Vernon takes on Blanchardstown
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Green Property, the Dublin-based property investment company quoted on both
the London and Dublin stock exchanges, has a new managing director, Stephen
Vernon. He takes over from John Corcoran, who founded the company 28 years
ago and who retired in August.
Vernon, 43, is a chartered surveyor and was group managing partner of St
Quintin in London before taking up his new post. He has been a non-executive
director of Green Property since 1989.
Vernon faces a number of pressing tasks at Green, the most immediate
probably being to ensure the successful re-start of the group's planned
Blanchardstown shopping centre project, suspended amid controversy in June
1991.
Blanchardstown, a new town being created to cope with Dublin's rapidly
expanding population, has experienced delays in its development as
politicians and lobbyists have clashed over the rezoning of land - altering
its designated purpose - for either residential or industrial purposes.
'The political hold-up has in large measure been cleared up, though
resolution of the zoning issue is not yet complete,' says Vernon.
Green Property will, he says, forge ahead with its plans forBlanchardstown
but it needs to finalise details on its financing and also on its 'anchor'
tenants; negotiations are proceeding on both fronts and Vernon says he hopes
the financing will be with a suitable partner.
He emphasises that pushing ahead the 57-acre site, with its planned 1m
square feet of shopping, leisure and community facilities, is in any case
only one of several priorities.
He wants the company to grow; it is 'still very small, with a market
capitalisation of a shade under Pounds 20m, whereas I think it should be
closer to Pounds 100m'. He plans on keeping its portfolio solidly in the
offices/shops/industrial property sector. As for his current commuting life
 -3 days in Dublin, 2 days in London each working week - it has its
compensations, including visits to Dublin's Abbey Theatre.

FT  05 OCT 93 / People: Computer Users' Associations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The task of a Computer Users' Association has changed as the computer
industry itself has changed. There is less need to act as a forum for
aggrieved customers; the associations act now more as mediators between the
plethora of industry lobbies and standards organisations.
The ICL CUA realised earlier this year that it needed to present a more
forceful image; for the first time it has appointed a full-time national
officer in the shape of Derek Cripps .
Hailing from South Wales, Cripps, 54, is well qualified for the part in two
ways; he was a member of the ICL CUA in an early incarnation as a dp in the
construction industry and for 17 years was an ICL employee. He is anxious to
increase membership and to see members getting greater value from the
association. In particular, he wants a stronger user voice in industry
concerns. In these roles he should benefit from his background in marketing
and sales.
Cripps is well aware of the paradox that CUAs - which are supposed to be
champions of the customer - are more often than not funded by manufacturers,
thus casting doubt on their independence and efficiency as a watchdog. He
argues, however, that the CUA is not controlled by ICL and that it forms an
effective interface between the company and its customers.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Jurisdiction of CFI extended -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first major increase in the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance
since its creation in 1988 came into effect last week. By its decision of
June 8 this year, the Council of Ministers extended the jurisdiction of the
CFI to cover all direct actions brought by private parties against the
Community institutions. The transfer, however, is not to apply to
anti-dumping cases until the Council says so.
The practical implications of the Council's decision have become apparent
from an order of the European Court of Justice, transferring cases within
this general category to the CFI. As a result, in the region of 450
individual cases have descended to the CFI from the ECJ.
These cases include an exceptional number - 380 - of milk quota cases, in
which compensation is claimed from the European Commission for mishandling
milk market regulation. Many more may have been filed directly with the CFI
under its new jurisdiction before the expiry of the deadline for making
compensation claims.
The others are mainly judicial review and damages claims in the fields of
state aids, external trade relations, environment and consumer protection as
well, as employment (pensions) questions involving the EC institutions.
One of the main purposes of the Council's decision to extend the
jurisdiction of the CFI is to permit the ECJ to reduce still further delays
in hearing cases by cutting the court's case load.
In fact, leaving aside the exceptional number of milk quota cases, each of
the 13 ECJ judges is unlikely to lose more than four or five cases for which
they bear primary responsibility as the reporting judge.
Similarly, the 12 CFI judges individually will receive only a few additional
cases. Nevertheless, the increase in case load will be welcomed by the CFI
judges who have been restricted previously to competition, staff and certain
coal and steel cases.
The ECJ will, however, take on a new role as the appeal court for all the
cases transferred to the CFI. All cases heard by the CFI at first instance
may be appealed to the ECJ on a point of law.
ECJ Order, September 28 1993, applying Article 4 of Council Decision
93/350/ECSC/EEC/Euratom of June 8 1993, OJ 1993 L144/21, June 16 1993,
modifying Council Decision 88/591/ECSC/EEC/Euratom establishing the Court of
First Instance.
Pensions judgment
The European Court of Justice has announced that it will give judgment
tomorrow in the Ten Oever equal pension rights case. This case was referred
to Luxembourg on questions concerning pension rights in the light of the
court's 1991 Barber judgment. The Court has decided to give judgment in this
case alone rather than together with the cases joined with it, which include
the Coloroll case.
C-109/91: Ten Oever v Stichting Bedrijfpensioenfonds voor het Glazenwassers.
Competition cases
Last week, the ECJ held oral hearings in two competition cases involving the
Treaty ban on abuse of a dominant position. The first concerns the scope of
the competition rules and their application to the public sector in the case
of Eurocontrol.
In particular, the Court has been asked to rule whether operations such as
Eurocontrol are 'undertakings' (or the sort of economic enterprise) covered
by the competition rules.
C-364/92, SAT V Eurocontrol, hearing ECJ FC, September 28 1993.
The second concerned the appeal by Hilti to the ECJ against the CFI's
December 12 1991 decision (Case T-30/89), rejecting Hilti's original appeal
against the Commission decision fining it for abuse of a dominant position
in connection with the tying of the purchase of Hilti nails to the purchase
of Hilti nail guns. Hilti is challenging the CFI's determinations of the
relevant product market, the finding of dominance and the burden of proof.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Towards a rescue culture - The debate
over insolvency law in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Britain emerges from recession, analysis of the insolvency regime
introduced by the 1986 Insolvency Act has already begun.
Prior to 1986 the UK insolvency regime was not geared to rescuing companies
as going concerns. The 1986 act, which came out of recommendations of the
Insolvency Law Review Committee chaired by the late Sir Kenneth Cork, was
designed to facilitate the rescue of the viable portions of a business and
to penalise directors who did not act responsibly.
Its main innovation was the introduction of the role of administrator,
normally an accountant, appointed by the courts to try to save the business
rather than to liquidate it.
Through the introduction of the administration order and the company
voluntary arrangement, where the directors voluntarily hand the running of
the company to an insolvency practitioner, it was hoped a 'rescue culture'
similar to that engendered in the US by the 'Chapter 11' procedure could be
achieved.
Administrations differ from Chapter 11, however, in that the appointment of
an administrator frequently results in the displacement of a company's
existing management, whereas chapter 11 leaves existing management in place
as 'debtor in possession' to run the company under the watchful eyes of the
creditors.
This difference of approach has prompted much debate. As the UK climbs out
of recession, lawyers, accountants and insolvency practitioners have begun
to question whether the English administration procedure has achieved its
objective or whether the issue should be re-examined with a view to
designing a system closer to the American debtor in possession concept.
The recession gave the rescue procedures introduced by the 1986 act a
baptism of fire. There have been some successes, with businesses emerging
from administration as going concerns but, for many lawyers and accountants,
the procedures have not been a success.
Administration has proved prohibitively expensive for smaller companies
largely, it is said, because of the procedure's over-reliance on court
involvement.
When companies find themselves in financial difficulties, most boards do not
embark on the administration procedure early enough for successful rescue,
perhaps because the procedure does not leave a large enough role for
existing management and directors fear loss of control.
The statistics suggest the hoped for 'rescue culture' has failed to
materialise: rescue procedures, already in decline, represent less than 1
per cent of company insolvencies.
How, if at all, Britain should change the insolvency regime and whether
English corporate insolvency should move towards the US system, were debated
last weekend at the Bar's annual conference in London.
Mr Robert Rosenberg, a partner of US law firm Latham &amp; Watkins, said America
had opted for a debtor in possession concept because that was what the
marketplace wanted.
There was general confidence that the chapter 11 system contained enough
checks and balances on directors' conduct, such as creditors' committees, to
prevent the debtor in possession running amok.
Americans also subscribed to the 'better the devil you know' philosophy, he
said. However incompetent the management of a company had been there was no
reason to believe new management would be any better.
But the debtor in possession concept had its drawbacks, he said. It worked
poorly in small cases, where creditors were often reluctant to get involved
in the rescue.
In the large cases, there had been criticism of the size of lawyers' and
accountants' fees. The process was also said to be too lengthy. In reality,
however, fees were normally a very small percentage of the assets of the
estate, and most chapter 11 cases were successful.
In the UK, bankruptcy is still very much a moral issue, according to Mr
Michael Crystal QC, a leading commercial silk. The Victorian concept that a
director responsible for getting a company into difficulty is not a fit and
proper person to continue to manage it is reflected in the 1986 legislation.
Administration involves displacement of existing management.
Mr Crystal told the conference England needed a system which allowed
existing management to have a real role. That would give them an incentive
to stay, to go for rescue early and would motivate them to co-operate with
an outsider supervising the process.
The English regime was also too court driven, he said. 'The High Court is
not the appropriate type of court to deal with the vast number of issues
which arise in an insolvency. Its training does not give it the necessary
expertise. So, to expect it to express business value judgments is
unrealistic,' he said.
There could be a role for a type of commercial court staffed by people
capable of taking commercial decisions, he suggested. Some thought should be
given to creating an insolvency tribunal.
Mr Crystal said there was also a need for a body like the Financial Law
Panel to develop a code on corporate governance issues for directors whose
companies are in difficulties. It was not enough to refer them to wrongful
trading legislation and leave them to it.
Mr Fred Pointon, head of group risk at National Westminster Bank said that,
before opting for legislative change, some thought should be given to
adapting elements of the London Rules Approach, a set of voluntary
principles used by bank creditors, to provide a framework for continued
support for troubled companies from banks until agreement can be reached on
the way forward.
The London Approach involves three stages: a standstill or moratorium on
enforcement procedures; an investigation by accountants; and, a refinancing.
In the last three years, NatWest had used the London Rules to deal with bank
debts of Pounds 19.8bn, and in only 1 of 27 cases had the company gone on to
insolvency. 'We believe the procedure has some value in preserving companies
rather than pushing them under,' he said.
There are those who believe the 1986 act has been a success, however. Mr
Justice Millett, a member of the Cork Committee, said there was little
basically wrong with the present regime. It had its faults - there was too
much displacement of existing management, for example. But the real problem
with administration was its high cost.
In that respect it was no different from Chapter 11. But there was little to
choose between the two systems, he said. Both could and did save large
businesses. If success meant the continuation as a going concern of a
business, as opposed to the company, the UK's success rate was better than
the US's. But if success meant keeping the company going, the English
success rate was much worse than the US's.
The overriding need was for a cheap form of administration, but there was no
reason why this could not be achieved within the existing legislative
framework, he said.

button - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifty of the UK's top 100 law firms will this week receive on a trial basis
a computer-based reference work on tax law. The Books on Screen package is
described by Compliance, its creator, as a new approach to information
retrieval.
While lawyers may have struggled to come to grips with cost-efficient use of
standard text retrieval systems such as Lexis, Books on Screen looks like a
book and can be accessed and read like a book. But it also offers the added
benefits that can be achieved through using technology.
Books on Screen is designed for publications that contain a large number of
cross-references. These can be called up on screen without the effort
involved in checking cross-references on a hard copy. It is therefore ideal
for tax legislation.
The tax package contains the yellow and orange tax handbooks, the yellow and
orange tax guides, Butterworths UK tax guide and Simon's tax case headnotes
since January 1973. The system will be updated weekly. Compliance hopes to
launch a company and commercial law package in December.
Lawyers and accountants buying the system will have to pay Pounds 995 a year
for one user and Pounds 395 for each additional user. They will also need a
25MHz 386 PC with 4MB of Ram using Windows to run the system.

FT  05 OCT 93 / People: IPE's growth potential attracts Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trevor Christmas, the new director of business development at London's
International Petroleum Exchange, is in the odd position of hoping that his
most recent experience at British Petroleum will have little relevance to
his new job.
He was one of six BP executives charged with planning ways to slim down the
European workforce, a skill which he hopes won't be needed at the IPE. The
growth potential of the IPE, which last month saw a record number of futures
contracts traded, was its main attraction, Christmas says. That is in
contrast to the oil industry, 'which many people consider to be mature, and
where the current name of the game is to become more efficient', a process
that almost invariably means consolidation and cutbacks.
Christmas' career at BP International began after graduating with honours
from the LSE. His 23 years with the company included stints as an oil trader
in New York and Tokyo before taking on the recent European assignment. It
was during that trading experience in the mid-1970s to mid-1980s that he
became familiar with the IPE.
Another attraction of the IPE job is the opportunity to operate 'on a world
stage rather than just a European one'. That, however, could mean even more
time away from home as he has made a priority of meeting as many IPE clients
as possible.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A better way to export
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exporters, the banks and the government are all criticised in a report* on
the quality of services to help exports. Exporters are accused of
insularity, the banks of not providing suitable support and the government
of failing to market its services effectively.
'It is particularly depressing to note the number of active exporters who
are insular in their approach to currency management, risk reduction and
competitive sales practices,' commented Ian Campbell, director general of
the Institute of Export, which commissioned the survey.
It was based on the responses of 250 companies, 69 per cent with sales of up
to Pounds 10m. All were already engaged in exporting.
Few companies had a strategy for handling foreign exchange and many small
companies would sell only in sterling, the survey found. Businesses were
concerned at the cost of credit insurance premiums and British companies
made less use of insurance than their continental European counterparts.
Three-quarters of the companies polled went first to their bank for export
advice, but smaller firms in particular were dissatisfied with the service
they received. Most exporters financed exports from working capital, usually
their bank overdraft, although 5 per cent used their own funds.
This reliance on overdrafts and own funds reflected the decline in the
number of special export finance schemes on offer from the banks. They have
fallen from 13 to five over the past two years.
Exporters were critical of services provided by the Department of Trade and
Industry, with most criticism coming from companies which used the services
least. Amid this general criticism, some elements of DTI help were rated
more highly, including its regional offices, overseas trade missions and
export market research service.
'The government still has much work to do in persuading smaller companies
that the services it offers and the assistance it provides are relevant and
beneficial to them,' the report, by the Bank Relationship Consultancy, said.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Businesses in Britain owned by ethnic minorities will have to work harder to
develop new markets in future, according to a survey by Kingston University
Small Business Research Centre.
The ending of large-scale immigration and the move by many younger members
of ethnic minorities out into the broader community to live and work will
reduce the size of the 'captive' ethnic market, the researchers concluded.
The study looked at three ethnic communities: Bangladeshi, Afro-Caribbean
and Greek-Cypriot. Seventy-six businesses in London, Sheffield and Leeds
took part.
The Greek-Cypriots had gone furthest in breaking into the wider markets
needed to develop mature, successful businesses, the study said. They also
had the widest range of kinds of business.
The Bangladeshis tended to be in low-profit, highly competitive markets with
low-growth prospects such as restaurants, clothing manufacture and
retailing. Compared with the other two groups, they operated in the
narrowest range of enterprise.
The Afro-Caribbean businesses were the smallest and the youngest and all had
been set up after 1980. They were strongest in food manufacturing and
non-professional services.
Ethnic minority business owners were educationally well qualified compared
with white small-business owners and the working population as a whole.
Afro-Caribbeans were the best qualified and Bangladeshis the least.
More than one-third of businesses were dependent on their own communities
for more than 50 per cent of sales, with Afro-Caribbeans the most dependent.
Some 45 per cent had used bank finance to get started and only 7 per cent
reported being refused. Accountants were the main source of business advice.
But trade associations and chambers of commerce were less popular and
greater use was made of the assistance of family and friends.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Let the customer be your
guide / A look at a marketing premise in practice - make what you sell, not
sell what you make
</HEADLINE>

When Julian Rankin and Michael Osborn established their lighting business in
London in 1985, they had definite plans for the future. They had set their
sights on establishing their company as a manufacturer of well-designed,
high-quality light fittings.
But they encountered two problems. As a very small company, Ora Lighting had
neither the manufacturing scale nor the marketing presence to take on its
bigger rivals. More important, architects kept commissioning them to carry
out one-off lighting design projects.
'Seventy per cent of our work was special-product development,' recalls
Rankin, an industrial design engineer by training. 'We tried to steer away
from that and impose our own standard ranges of products on the market. Up
to a point we were successful, but we didn't have the marketing muscle and,
as a small company, we couldn't produce in large runs anyway.'
Realising they needed outside advice to resolve their dilemma, Rankin and
Osborn signed up for subsidised consultancy advice under the government's
Enterprise Initiative. They were put in touch with Mapa, a London-based
marketing consultancy.
The advice from the Mapa consultant was to go with the market rather than
fight it. If Ora's customers valued the company for its skills in designing
bespoke lighting arrangements, then why try to ram the standard designs down
their throats?
Once the decision was taken to concentrate on the 'specials', then Ora's
promotional literature had to be modified to take account of this.
Previously the company had emphasised its stock lines, but had few
photographs and brochures illustrating its bespoke installations. This was
remedied.
At Mapa's suggestion, Ora stepped up its direct mail campaign, targeting
existing customers to win repeat business and new ones to extend its client
base.
Rankin is in no doubt that the decision to take a more professional approach
to marketing and to respond to the clear signals its customers were sending
helped Ora survive the recession. At a time when many of its competitors
have gone out of business, Ora, which now has 15 employees and turnover of
Pounds 500,000, has record order books.
Ora's initial approach to marketing is by no means unusual. Entrepreneurs
frequently set up in business with an idea for a product or a service which
they are convinced will take the market by storm. They may be lucky, but
many fail.
'A lot of companies think they have something which is unique and are
surprised to find someone else offering something very similar,' comments
John Maclaran, a consultant with Mapa. 'They think they know who their
customers are but they never talk to them to find out what they really want.
It is a question of looking at the product from the other side.'
But persuading business owners and managers to take a fresh look at their
marketing can be difficult. 'Getting somebody to go out and ask their
customers what they want is not easy,' comments Terry Mitchell, manager of
the Milton Keynes Marketing Centre, which advises local businesses.
'There is a lot of pride involved for someone who has built up his own
business. He doesn't want somebody telling him he has got it wrong.'
Instilling a more professional approach to marketing is hampered by
widespread ignorance of what marketing actually is. Many owners assume that
marketing is synonymous with sales promotion and imagine that it is limited
to advertising, mail shots and public relations. The marketing industry has
not always been its own best advocate, confusing potential customers with
jargon.
'I have people come in and say: 'We did some marketing once and it didn't
work',' says Mitchell. 'What they have done is put together a brochure
featuring a history of their company. Engineering companies are particularly
good at that.'
Marketing specialists commonly fall back on a description of their craft as
helping people to make what they can sell instead of selling what they can
make. Far from being a technique to be adopted at the end of the production
chain, marketing is a discipline which goes right to the heart of a
business, determining its field of activity and choice of products.
It starts with market research in order to build up a knowledge of customers
and competitors. It moves on to designing products or services to suit the
market-place and pricing them at the highest level the market will bear.
Only then does marketing take on its more familiar forms of promotion,
advertising and selling.
'We tackle marketing as a strategic issue,' explains Maclaran. 'We review
the existing business, look at their customer base and audit their publicity
material. We find out where they fit on the market map and how they relate
to their customers.
'We analyse the market and try to quantify how big a segment a client can
realistically aim for. We look at the competition. People's objectives and
the size of the market are often poles apart. We analyse their financial and
operating information and try to formulate a marketing strategy.'
Robin Phelps, co-founder and managing director of the 'florists' sundries'
wholesaling business which bears his name, is typical of many business
owners. 'In the late 1980s everyone was talking about marketing,' he says.
'We thought: 'What the hell is it all about?''
With signs of an approaching recession and increasing competition from
cut-price suppliers, Phelps needed some answers. Help came in the shape of a
mail shot from the Milton Keynes Marketing Centre, offering the advice of
its experts.
At the suggestion of Terry Mitchell, Phelps decided to establish a
cash-and-carry outlet, so as to reach the smaller florists he could not
economically serve from his main warehouse. These customers had begun buying
their artificial flowers and other flower arranging materials from
travelling vans.
The cash-and-carry operation was started under a different name while an
effort was made to strengthen the more upmarket image of the Robin Phelps
name. The company developed - 'repackaged' - its own range of bouquets of
artificial flowers for sale through petrol station forecourts.
This has not worked out quite as Phelps had hoped, because the large petrol
station chains switched over to centralised buying. But the company, which
has 17 employees and sales of Pounds 750,000, is now hoping to develop other
niche markets.
Concentrating on a particular niche also proved to be the answer for Andrew
Morris, an accountant based in Richmond, west London. Morris, a sole
practitioner who trades as Ixer/Morris and employs a staff of four, says he,
too, was concerned at signs of the impending recession.
Worried more about its impact on his clients than its possible direct impact
on his own business, Morris went to a 'roadshow' organised by the Department
of Trade and Industry. He got talking to one of the advisers and realised he
might benefit himself from some consultancy.
'The consultants' message was simple: identify your market and major on it,'
says Morris. 'We had been a general practice, but we decided to concentrate
on specifics.' Morris is unwilling to identify the type of client he now
targets but says they are in the services sector.
He stopped advertising in the local paper and the Yellow Pages and
concentrated on the trade press.
The outcome of this more targeted approach has been to allow a small
expansion of Morris's firm. Without it, he says, he could well have been
forced to lay off staff.
Businesses which take marketing seriously often face painful choices. They
may have to give up a cherished product to move into a more promising area.
But the alternative to making what your customers want, could be making, and
selling, nothing at all.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Technology: Computers take centre stage - London's South
Bank arts complex has high hopes for its latest information system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH UNDERWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a new season opens at London's South Bank Arts Centre, the usual bustle
of activity behind the scenes is extending beyond the rehearsal rooms and
into the computer department. Its task is to provide easy access to all
kinds of information, from an artist's taste in mineral water (still or
fizzy) to the current balance of the centre's Pounds 20m budget.
The centre, which is Britain's largest arts complex, comprising the Royal
Festival Hall, two smaller halls and an art gallery, is no newcomer to
information technology. Now, however, it is making an important transition
from 'systems management' to 'information management'. This means that
instead of simply managing an IT department it is now exploiting a valuable
resource.
As Arts Council grants fail to keep step with rising costs, the centre needs
tighter controls if it is to maintain its artistic budgets. In order to
streamline the planning of events, it is moving towards full implementation
of its US-developed Concentrics electronic diary software to cover
everything from space allocation to the timely supply of fireworks for a
performance of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. At present, the electronic diary
is used for scheduling events.
On the other hand, it plans to improve customer service and identify
marketing opportunities, while reducing its advertising budget. This
involves the introduction of systems specially tailored for its use.
Thus the key to the centre's commercial development is the Box Office
Computer System (BOCS) supplied by Space-Time Systems of the UK. Some 20 per
cent of visitors buy 80 per cent of the tickets sold every year (more than
1m), but the centre has not been able to identify its patrons. Thus its
direct mailing efforts constitute an ineffective, scattergun approach to
marketing.
By making individual contact with potential ticket purchasers, the centre
hopes to slash its spending on press advertising. It will then use press ads
only to attract new audiences. The centre's marketing database, the BOCS
Marketing System, and applications - run on Digital Equipment Vax computers
 -are linked to the box office.
Details of individual customers, such as their name and address and the
performance for which tickets are sold, are recorded at the box office and
then moved to the marketing system. This continuously updates customer
records, noting interests, frequency of visits, take-up of special offers
and so on. This information is used by the marketing staff to prepare direct
mailing lists and develop promotional programmes to meet existing customers'
interests and generate new business.
BOCS is also linked to the centre's accounting system. This, too, is being
overhauled to provide tighter management control. A registered charity with
an annual budget of Pounds 20m, the South Bank must end the year showing
neither a profit nor a loss - a feat Alan Wilks, deputy finance director,
likens to parachuting out of an aircraft and landing on a pinhead. In past
years, failure to arrive at zero has meant a cut in funding.
An accounting system installed last month and due to be up and running in
the next financial year is designed to solve the problem. 'Our existing
software was slow and inflexible, so people didn't use it,' says Wilks. 'It
also ran on different hardware from BOCS, making communication difficult.'
After an extensive software evaluation, the centre selected CFACS from
Cedardata of the UK on the grounds of cost and functionality. Among key
requirements were the ability to answer inquiries, to monitor the impact of
new accounting entries, to set up authorisation levels for order and invoice
approvals, and to help with forward planning.
Ease of use was also a requirement as the centre plans to open access to the
accounting system to non-financial departments, giving them responsibility
for their own budgeting and report writing.
The Cedardata software, which will run alongside BOCS, was designed
specifically for the centre, and keeps track of departmental budgets. Artist
bookings, for example, can be accounted for when they are made rather than
after a production when an invoice is received. Budget planning will be
improved by capturing information on bookings as far ahead as three years.
Ultimately, the accounting and BOCS systems and Concentrics will be
integrated, providing estimates of income from accurate forecasts of ticket
sales.
The need to improve management and cost control is also driving development
of the Concentrics electronic diary and scheduling system, which streamlines
the production process from the moment an event is booked until the curtain
comes down and the bills are paid.
Initially, the system is used to allocate space, check against clashing
events in the centre's concert halls and generate an event profile which
holds all directly related information, such as set-up time, rehearsals and
receptions.
As a production unfolds, comments can be added to the event profile and
technical requirements detailed from which the system generates worksheets
for both backstage and front-of-house staff. Users also enter equipment and
staff needs. These are automatically charged to accounts, while shortages
trigger the system to jolt memories in supply departments.
The system reduces duplication of effort by storing information pertinent to
particular productions. Dorcas Johnson, computer projects manager, says: 'In
the past, all the information collected for an event was lost. Two years
later, we would put on a similar event and make the same mistakes. Now the
experience gained can be reapplied.'
As grants go down and costs go up, successful information management will be
essential to curb overheads and maintain artistic budgets. Computers will
increasingly control the environment in which inspiration can flourish.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Technology: Machines set for election victory - Automated
counting and voting are polling well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX GLASKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Howard, the UK home secretary, will soon decide whether machines can
be trusted to count votes at local, general and European elections.
Barcodes, light pens and optical mark readers could replace humans, if he
decides that the technology offers 'real advantage'.
Greater speed, convenience and accuracy make machines attractive, but cost
will be the biggest factor. To count ballot papers by hand costs about 5p
for every registered elector. But a parliamentary Home Affairs committee has
found that it is increasingly difficult to staff ballot counts. Thus the
committee is expected to recommend vote-counting machines in its report this
month to Howard.
Three companies with different systems are waiting for the creation of the
new market. The push for technology has largely come from American
Information Systems, a company whose optical mark readers (OMRs) were used
in 30 states at last year's US presidential election.
Blind eyes were turned to allow the southern English town of Bognor Regis to
use an AIS machine at a local referendum last December. The count, which
would have taken 10 people more than two hours by hand, was completed in 33
minutes.
The machine has sophisticated techniques for auditing the ballot and
eliminates the need for pre-sorting the papers. However, it only reads
special ballot cards, the same width as an A4 sheet but 6cm taller. At the
count, stacks of cards feed into the machine automatically. Four hundred a
minute can be scanned.
Ordinary ballot papers can be used on two other systems. Miste Data Services
of Redbourn, Hertfordshire, has adapted OMRs commonly used for marking
multiple-choice examination papers. Papers are fed in by hand and the
machine is linked to a PC loaded with proprietary software to tally votes.
Miste shadowed the St Albans local election in May and claims it is
significantly faster than manual methods in multi-seat votes.
Epping Forest local authority in Essex has designed its own semi-automatic
process. At the count, each ballot paper is placed in turn underneath a
template which has a different barcode against each candidate. An operator
with a light pen swipes the barcode of the selected candidates and software
on a standard PC stores the totals.
Epping Forest's system was used at parish elections in Theydon Bois in May.
It took five people two-and-a-half hours to swipe 15,000 votes. Manually it
would have taken 30 people an hour longer.
AIS reckons its system will cost about Pounds 10,000 for a constituency and
will take six years for costs to be recouped. Miste's package will cost less
than Pounds 5,000. Epping Forest only aims to cover its software development
costs and charges Pounds 79 for a single site licence or 1.5p for each
registered elector. Two local authorities in the West Midlands have bought
licences.
None of the machines are likely to be cost-effective or quicker in 'first
past the post' ballots such as the British general elections. They will come
into their own at district and parish elections when many candidates can
appear on one ballot paper to contest several vacant seats.
The US, Australia and the Netherlands have gone a step further than merely
automating the count. Their polling booths have push-button machines for
voting.
At the Norwegian general election on September 13, Oslo leased OMRs from
British company DRS, to test automatic vote counting. They worked well.
Meanwhile, Belgium is preparing to use computer screens, light pens and
credit cards to automate voting and counting. Trials costing BFr480m (Pounds
9m) will take place at next June's European elections, using modified school
computers.
If Howard gives the go-ahead for the machines, Parliament will have to amend
the Ballot Act of 1872. He may also have to consider whether ballot
equipment grants to cover 50 per cent of the costs should be made available.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Technology: No end to MiniDisc madness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sony has launched a series of MiniDisc products which take miniaturisation
one stage further with a 50 per cent reduction in the size and number of
components used.
The latest MiniDisc offerings, which follow a first-generation range
launched last year, include a portable MiniDisc player/recorder that is
about half the size and weighs 45 per cent less than its predecessor.
The reduction in size and weight was made possible by using smaller and
fewer integrated circuits for digital signal processing and by the
miniaturisation of other components.
At the same time, Sony has been able to increase the density of its chip
boards and thus reduce their size by some 40 per cent. The latest range uses
lithium ion batteries which have the advantage over the nickel cadmium
batteries used before of offering greater reliability and longer play-back
time - two and a half hours, or seven and a half when they are used in
conjunction with alkaline batteries.
Less than a year since its launch, MiniDisc is selling roughly twice as fast
as CDs did at a comparable stage after their introduction, Sony says. In the
10 months between the launch in November last year and this August, 300,000
MiniDisc units have been shipped worldwide.
Sony's shipment figures also appear to disprove the argument that the lack
of compatibility with existing systems would discourage consumers,
particularly in Europe, from buying MiniDisc players which do not play any
existing medium. However, Sony's shipments to Europe, at roughly a third of
the 300,000 total, have been comparable to shipments in Japan and the US.
Whether MiniDisc takes off or not will depend, however, largely on the
availability of recorded discs and on a substantial reduction in price.
Sony says 1,200 titles are already available, but this is far behind the
17,600 CD titles launched last year in Japan alone.
As for price, the Y55,000 (Pounds 340) cost of a playback unit - and Y75,000
for a recodable player - seem slightly extravagant in today's penny-pinching
environment.

FT  05 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Upbeat PM hails 'new
prosperity'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister believes Britain can still achieve 'new success and
prosperity' in the 1990s despite the 'severe difficulties and tough choices'
experienced recently.
In a foreword to a new 48-page pamphlet setting out the government's record
in the 1990s, Mr John Major looks forward to a change in the fortunes of the
government and the nation yesterday.
A revealing comment by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, leaves little
doubt about the despondency he and the prime minister encountered last month
during their visits to various provincial centres to meet Conservative
activists.
Sir Norman said it was made clear to them that 'there was a need for a clear
account of the government's many positive achievements'.
The prime minister underlined the need to build a recovery creating jobs,
and renewed opportunities for ownership of homes, shares, pensions and
wealth.
He also accepted that there should be wider choice in education, health,
housing and transport - 'because more choice means higher standards'.
The pamphlet, which according to Sir Norman 'conveys a clear impression' of
where the prime minister intends to lead Britain, reaffirms the commitment
to further income tax cuts.
It states: 'The government will continue to move towards a 20p basic rate of
income tax for all, when resources allow.'
Acknowledging the political sensitivity of law and order issues, the
pamphlet states 'new reforms will strengthen the partnership between the
police and public still further.
'Forthcoming legislation in the new parliamentary session will focus the
police's work more closely on tackling crime and will improve local
accountability.'

FT  05 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Bottomley denies threat
to health service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, will signal a new offensive on
Thursday to rebut the accusation that the government's reforms threaten the
National Health Service.
In a speech redefining the government's duties towards the NHS she plans to
say: 'Perverse critics of the internal health market say that the economics
of the market place are inappropriate to caring. They rely on a jaundiced
view of markets and an inadequate sense of caring.'
Instead, she argues that the internal health market is a mechanism of
ensuring that patients have choices in the way services are provided,
benefiting both people and the NHS.
'It is the proper function of government to ensure equal access to the NHS.
It does not follow, however, that the government should insist on how that
service is delivered.'
However, Mrs Bottomley makes it clear that the government's reforms do not
amount to support for a total free market in health and she is at pains to
emphasise that she has no plans to introduce one.
'We do not, and cannot, operate an entirely free market in health. That has
never been our objective. The NHS is what it says - national.'
The Labour party is accused of misrepresenting the Conservatives' health
reforms, which is why Mrs Bottomley says the health service has been the
source of such dissent between political parties.
'The difference between the parties' she says, 'is on how best a national
health service should be delivered.'

FT  05 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Lilley still 'invisible'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Lilley, the social services secretary, last night claimed an
unenviable place in opinion poll history after being voted the cabinet's
most invisible member for the fourth year in succession.
The annual Gallup survey for today's edition of The Daily Telegraph showed
that only 11 per cent of voters were able to identify Mr Lilley from his
photograph. The only consolation was that four years ago, when he first
topped the anonymity poll, a mere two per cent had any idea of who he was.
Predictably Mr John Major, Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr
Kenneth Clarke dominate the other end of the recognition scale. Mr John
MacGregor and Mrs Gillian Shephard could, like Mr Lilley, benefit from a
little more public exposure.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR is odds-on to be replaced as prime minister before the next
general election, with Chancellor Kenneth Clarke 5/4 favourite to take his
place.
Bookmakers William Hill quote Mr Major at 8/13 to be replaced as leader of
the Conservative party and 6/5 that he will lead them into the election.
But Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor and former Tory chairman, last night
warned the party not to ditch Mr Major.
In an interview for the BBC's Panorama, he said: 'I do not think the
electorate would flock to a party which changed its leaders every time
things seemed to be tough.'
He added: 'The right thing to do is to support the prime minister, not to
criticise him, not to bellyache about him, particularly when nobody has a
better agenda for the future.'

FT  05 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Fowler to review claims
on spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE Central Office is to look into claims the party spent
significantly more than it disclosed under electoral law on by-elections in
the run-up to the 1992 general election, David Owen writes.
Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, told a Blackpool press conference he
would try to find papers detailing the overspending, referred to in The
Times newspaper.
The newspaper said it had seen unpublished and confidential documents
showing the party spent more than Pounds 300,000 - 50 per cent more than
budgeted - on six by-elections up to November 1991.
The party said it had adhered to legal limits on the amount it could spend
on the promotion of its by-election candidates.
It said suggestions in the same article that there was an apparent Pounds 7m
'hole' in the party's 1992 accounts were unfounded.

FT  05 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: The flamboyant tendency
breaks cover - Alison Smith catches Euro-sceptic MP and author Teresa Gorman
in conciliatory mood . . . almost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAUNCH of Mrs Teresa Gorman's book about the 'dirty tricks' endured by
Tory Euro-rebels, coincided almost to the minute with the insistence from
Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, that it was time to draw a line under the
troubles and divisions of the past year.
But while Mrs Gorman publicised her book The Bastards, by re-opening
Maastricht wounds there was some evidence in what she said to support Sir
Norman's assertion.
The paper being carefully pasted over the cracks may just be strong enough
to last the week.
Mrs Gorman maintained a severely Euro-sceptic line, but said only that it
was 'still an open matter' whether she would vote against the government the
next time the vexed question of value added tax on domestic fuel came before
the Commons.
She appeared to accept that VAT on fuel would be implemented, and that the
point of continuing to exert pressure was to make ministers think carefully
before extending VAT further - in which she would probably be in the
mainstream of party opinion.
Her tone on Mr John Major's leadership has also been tempered since the
summer.
In August there were dark hints that unless the prime minister changed his
policies then the party would change him. Yesterday Mrs Gorman said: 'I
believe at the moment it would be completely inappropriate to change the
leader.'
While her remarks remained somewhat barbed, she said that her purpose was
'to support John Major but to try and change his mind'.
Mrs Gorman's role as standard-bearer for the flamboyant tendency among the
persistent rebels, makes her softening of tone especially good news for
party managers, in spite of the minor controversy over whether the
conference bookstall would stock her book.
But her words echoed the views of one party official that although
Maastricht was a real battle, VAT on fuel is not an issue over which the
party will tear itself apart.
Certainly the first representatives arriving at the Imperial, the conference
hotel, seemed keen to avoid a public fight with the party leadership.
In the bar and lounge they expressed irritation and dismay at the way in
which the VAT issue had been handled, but sounded similarly disenchanted at
the way some former ministers were adding to the government's difficulties.
Some also believe that distaste for the media will serve the party well,
with many representatives determined to deny the press a week of fireworks
in the conference hall. 'There'll be headbangers on the fringe, and the
representatives will give us a kicking in private,' one party worker said,
'but they'll want a good conference'.
An MP with a large enough majority to be relatively detached expressed a
similar view.
'You won't get a true and fair picture this week,' he said, 'what happens
over the next few months is going to be much more important.'

FT  05 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: MacGregor warned over BR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MacGregor, the transport secretary, should 'bow to common sense and
travellers' wishes' and abandon rail privatisation, a passenger group urged
yesterday, on the eve of his address to the conference.
Opinion polls showed only 8 per cent of people believed privatisation would
work, said Mr Steve Wilkinson, chairman of the Railway Development Society.
He said there was 'precious little enthusiasm for privatisation among Mr
MacGregor's parliamentary colleagues, party members or, indeed, potential
private railway operators'.
Meanwhile, Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour transport spokesman, warned that 23
Tory marginal seats could be at risk if the 'running down' of the
cash-starved London-to-Scotland West Coast main line was allowed to
continue.
Fares would rise by up to 50 per cent and staff levels would be cut by more
than A third, the Scottish Save Our Railways campaign said yesterday. Its
figures were based on a study carried out by the Scottish Transport Studies
Group.
ScotRail is to be one of the first pilot shadow franchise areas, a test for
privatisation.
Meanwhile British Rail said yesterday that an increasing number of speed
restrictions are having to be imposed on lines because of lack of
maintenance funds.
BR warned: 'We need Pounds 850m a year just to keep existing passenger
services at their present level and our funding for each of the next three
years is less than that.'
The environmental group Transport 2000 said it feared routes in need of
repair might be axed altogether when BR is privatised.

FT  05 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Tories row over veto on
speakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BEHIND-THE-SCENES row over attempts by the organisers to stifle attacks on
Mr John Major's government erupted last night on the eve of the
Conservatives' Blackpool conference.
Officers of the party's National Union were accused of seeking to 'screen
out' representatives planning critical speeches from the conference floor
during this week's debates.
The task of vetoing potentially 'dangerous' speakers has been handed to
ministers' political advisers and to the research department at Conservative
central office.
But a number of ministers have expressed fears that the tactic could
backfire by increasing the anger of the government's critics and provoking
public demonstrations during debates. They have told their advisers to
ensure a reasonable balance in the choice of speakers.
The conference organisers are also trying to ensure that the prime
minister's critics on the Tory back benches at Westminster - the so-called
'barmies' - are denied a voice by preventing all MPs from speaking in the
main debates.
All of the constituency party motions chosen by the organisers are
supportive of the government's policies.
The motions range from one on the economy urging the government to stick
with its policies, to one praising the government's intention to target
social security benefits.
There is no mention of the imposition of value added tax on fuel or of the
government's inability to curb rising crime rates, despite the scores of
critical motions submitted.
But to the embarrassment even of some cabinet ministers, the organisers have
attempted to prevent any public rows by 'vetting' those constituency
activists who have asked to speak.
The principal flashpoints at this week's conference are judged to be
tomorrow's law and order debate and Thursday's economic debate.
But there are also fears that the opponents of the Maastricht treaty could
seek to stage a demonstration during today's foreign affairs debate.
Sir Basil Feldman, the chairman of the National Union, denied yesterday that
the organisers' refusal to hold a separate debate on VAT was an attempt to
stifle debate.
He said that the issue was certain to be raised from the floor during the
economy debate.
But in a reflection of the determination in Blackpool to damp down attacks
both on the government and Mr Major's leadership, Sir Basil told a press
conference: 'The party is fed up with the disloyalty and negative messages
being put out by the malcontent minority.'

FT  05 OCT 93 / Gloomy forecast for construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in the construction industry is set to continue, more jobs
will go and sustained recovery is not expected until 1995, a forecast
yesterday from the Building Employers Confederation says.
The confederation's autumn state-of-trade inquiry, based on a poll of 600
companies, found that only a third of companies were confident of an
increase in output over the next 12 months, with the rest predicting a
decline or at best no change.
A fifth of companies expect to reduce their workforce still further over the
next few months. Employment in the industry has fallen by more than 500,000
since the middle of 1989 - the present recession is now the longest in the
industry since the 1930s.
Sir Brian Hill, the confederation's president, said: 'The construction
recession is still continuing and it must be worrying that the majority of
firms do not expect any improvement in output over the next 12 months. This
will postpone any sustained recovery until 1995.
'This must also mean that unemployment levels will remain high over the same
period, which in turn will further damage the industry's training and
recruitment programmes.'
The survey's findings are in line with recent industry forecasts of a
further 2 per cent fall in construction industry output this year, making a
total fall of about 17 per cent over the past three years.
However, the confederation said more companies reported an increase in
third-quarter output, compared with the second quarter. Work inquiries had
also improved, albeit only slightly and from a low base.
The survey found that the housing market had shown some improvement from
last year, but was still a long way from recovery.
The confederation said fears of redundancy and uncertainties about possible
tax changes in the November Budget continued to undermine buyers'
confidence.
In the private commercial sector the level of inquiries had again fallen
sharply.
In the private industrial sector, growth prospects had improved in line with
those in the manufacturing sector. But because of the time lag between
output and investment, a large revival is considered unlikely unless Budget
measures are introduced to bring forward investment. The repair and
maintenance market showed signs of improving.
The confederation said output improved among companies in the south,
south-west, north and north-west but fell in London, the Midlands and the
Yorkshire region.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Buy-outs fall to seven-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT buy-out activity plunged to a seven-year low in the third quarter
of 1993 with just seven large deals of Pounds 10m or more being completed.
This compares with 14 deals in the second quarter of this year and 15 in the
third quarter of last year, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants.
Buy-out activity was also depressed in terms of the value of deals, falling
to Pounds 360m from Pounds 740m in the preceding quarter and Pounds 430m in
the same quarter of last year.
In the first nine months of the year the number of deals fell sharply but
the value was slightly higher than in the same period last year. Thirty
buy-outs valued at Pounds 1.56bn were completed between January and
September compared with 45 deals worth Pounds 1.49bn in the same period last
year.
Mr Chris Beresford, Peat Marwick's head of buy-outs, said that one reason
for the decline was the increased time it took to complete a deal. He added:
'Deals are taking twice as long to consummate as we normally expect.'
Venture fund managers who finance buy-outs have also been busy arranging to
sell or float the ones they backed in previous years and have little time
for new deals. Record numbers of companies backed by venture capital have
obtained stock market listings this year.
The high stock market ratings enjoyed by many companies makes them reluctant
to sell subsidiaries or divisions by means of a buy-out at lower
price/earnings ratios than their own because this would reduce their own
capital value.
In addition, some potential vendors expect an improvement in the trading
performance of subsidiaries and are waiting for this to emerge before
disposing of them, Mr Beresford said.
The largest deal completed in the third quarter of 1993 was the Pounds 192m
buy-out of the Eurodollar car rental business from the TSB banking group.

FT  05 OCT 93 / M0 rise is highest for three years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NARROW measure of money supply increased by 0.4 per cent last month to
give the highest year-on-year growth rate since the summer of 1990.
M0 - mainly notes and coins in circulation - rose by a seasonally adjusted
5.4 per cent in the year to September, after an increase of 5.2 per cent in
the 12 months to August. Together with buoyant consumer credit figures, also
out yesterday, the news will help to ease fears that the UK recovery is
running out of steam.
The strength of M0 is also likely to diminish prospects for an early cut in
interest rates.
M0 rose above its ceiling in February and has, apart from one month, stayed
there since. The month-on-month rise was slightly higher than economists'
expectations of 0.3 per cent.
The buoyancy of M0 reflects strong growth in retail spending and the
reduction in UK interest rates over the last year, which has made it less
expensive to hold cash.
There were few revisions to the provisional figures for broad money in
August. M4 - M0 plus bank and building society deposits - rose a seasonally
adjusted 3.7 per cent in the year to August. The government's target range
for M4 is 3 per cent to 8 per cent.
Confidence about exports among UK manufacturers has improved on the last
quarter, according to a survey carried out by Gallup and DHL, the
distribution company. Half of UK producers believe the likely reduction in
interest rates will have a positive effect on export sales while two thirds
of companies say the UK is ahead of overseas competitors in coming out of
recession.

PROFESSOR Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge University cosmologist, yesterday
joined schoolboy Neil Wallace at the opening of a Science Museum exhibition
in London on improving communication for people with disabilities, Clive
Cookson writes.
Prof Hawking, who has motor neurone disease, communicates via a computerised
speech synthesiser with a special keyboard operated by two fingers of his
left hand, and can manage about 15 words a minute.
Neil, 10, has cerebral palsy. He is using the US-made Liberator, which in
its basic form costs Pounds 5,795. Prof Hawking said such devices made such
a difference to the lives of people who could not speak that they should be
available on the National Health Service.

FT  05 OCT 93 / MoD rejects call for more orders to save BAe jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence has told Ayrshire MPs that it will not order
aircraft specially to avert redundancies at British Aerospace's Jetstream
subsidiary at Prestwick.
The plant, which employs 2,500 people making Jetstream turbo-prop regional
airliners, is expected to announce a package of redundancies in the next few
weeks because of a shortage of orders.
It has already told its workforce that it will have to realign production
programmes with market demand.
Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, together
with four other Ayrshire Labour MPs, had urged the MoD to bring forward
replacement of 26 Jetstream aircraft used by the RAF and the navy, and also
to replace the RAF's Andover aircraft with Jetstreams.
But Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence minister, has told Mr Foulkes that the
Jetstream fleet will not be replaced in the short or medium-term. The
Andovers are being replaced with existing aircraft and commercial charters.
Mr Allan MacDonald, Jetstream's managing director, told the workforce in
August that all manufacturers of aircraft in Jetstream's regional category
were facing severe shortages of orders and were making heavy discounts on
prices.
Yesterday Mr MacDonald told employees that the main board of British
Aerospace and the Prestwick management would be meeting on October 13 and an
announcement would be made soon after.
He added that a final decision on the cost-cutting package had been delayed
because of the need to investigate more options. In August he had promised a
decision by the end of the month.
The company makes the 19-seat Jetstream 31 and the 29-seat Jetstream 41. It
is also building the first Jetstream ATP (advance turbo-prop) aircraft after
production of this model was transferred from Woodford near Manchester.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Leeds set to join network of Europe finance centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN network of regional financial centres, which includes Edinburgh
and Manchester, is to expand, its chairman announced yesterday on a visit to
Leeds.
Mr Franco Cellino, who is also president of the Turin Stock Exchange, said
Bordeaux, Hanover, Antwerp, Bari and Leeds were trying to join the
Association of European Regional Financial Centres.
The aim is to build better relationships between the cities and the European
Commission - and possibly to set up new sources of growth capital for local
companies.
In addition to Edinburgh and Manchester, members include Barcelona, Bilbao,
Lyons, Oporto, Stuttgart and Turin. Leeds is applying for membership through
a financial services initiative which Mr Cellino helped launch yesterday.
Wider representation is expected to strengthen the association's hand in
Brussels.
Regional financial centres are the principal sources of professional
services - such as banking, corporate law, accountancy, and consultancy -
for small- and medium-sized businesses in their areas. During the 1980s such
centres saw a concentration of professional firms and services while
national centres such as London, Paris, Frankfurt and Milan looked
increasingly to international markets and large corporate clients.
Mr Cellino said the association would encourage better professional services
for small- and medium-sized enterprises, which comprise more than 90 per
cent of businesses in the EC. He said this would help ensure the single
market did not work against small businesses as national professional
services became concentrated and geared to large and multinational
companies.
He also believed regional centres should increasingly promote an 'economy of
networking', helping cross-border transfer of capital.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Consumer borrowing up: Credit demand strongest since 1990 -
Money supply reflects growth in spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS are shaking off debt fears and borrowing more from building
societies, retailers and on credit cards, official statistics indicated
yesterday.
Credit business figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that
consumers borrowed a net Pounds 225m in August, the highest figure since
July 1991. It compares with Pounds 204m in July.
Net lending to consumers has been rising erratically since August last year.
However, the figures account for only about 10 per cent of total consumer
borrowing as they do not include bank overdrafts or mortgages. Nonetheless,
they are a useful indication of willingness to borrow for goods that include
cars.
In the three months to August, consumers borrowed a net Pounds 642m compared
with Pounds 508m in the previous three months. The seasonally-adjusted
figures suggest demand for credit is stronger now than at any time since the
end of 1990. It is still weaker than in 1989 and 1990 when quarterly net
lending figures were as high as Pounds 900m.
In August much of the increase in net lending was generated by finance
houses, responsible for many car loans and hire purchase agreements.
Consumers borrowed a net Pounds 298m from finance houses, the highest amount
since March 1989. It compares with Pounds 189m in July.
Consumers borrowed a net Pounds 16m of unsecured loans from building
societies in August, compared with Pounds 6m in July. They repaid a net
Pounds 89m on Visa and Mastercard credit cards. This compares with net
borrowing of Pounds 9m in July.
Much of the pick-up in demand for credit since the beginning of the year has
been in finance houses. Credit card and building society components have
been more sluggish.
The amount of new credit advanced to consumers rose to Pounds 4.68bn in
August, up from Pounds 4.46bn in July.
In the three months to August, new credit advanced to consumers rose to
Pounds 13.83bn from Pounds 13.35bn in the previous three months. A rise in
new credit advanced by finance houses accounted for most of the increase.

FT  05 OCT 93 / 'Wise men' expected to oppose Budget tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NARROW majority against tax rises in the November Budget is expected to
emerge from today's meeting of the Treasury's panel of outside economic
advisers.
The four panel members thought likely to oppose any further tax increases in
1994-95 on top of the Pounds 6.8bn already announced are Mr Andrew Britton
of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, Liverpool
University's Professor Patrick Minford, Mr Andrew Sentance of the
Confederation of British Industry and Professor Wynne Godley, formerly of
Cambridge University.
Prof Godley, who is in the US, will not attend the meeting but will send his
views by fax.
The other three members of the panel - Professor Tim Congdon of Lombard
Street Research, London Business School's Professor David Currie and Mr
Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs - have expressed a preference for further tax
increases to curb growing public borrowing.
The panel is divided about the need for cuts in interest rates, with
supporters of higher taxes on the whole wanting a relaxation in monetary
policy. Of those wanting no change in tax policy, Prof Minford favours
urgent cuts in bank base rates. The group will talk to Mr Alan Budd, the
Treasury's chief economic adviser, again next Tuesday.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Amerada Hess to shed 10% of staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERADA HESS, the US oil company whose North Sea operations have expanded
rapidly in recent years, is to cut about 10 per cent of its 1,000-strong UK
workforce today.
The staff cuts are thought to be confined to onshore workers and are not
expected to affect employees on North Sea production rigs.
The company has blamed the cuts on changes to the Petroleum Revenue Tax
introduced by the government in the last Budget. Other factors cited by the
company include the present low oil prices and the fact that the prospect of
further large-scale oil discoveries in the North Sea is becoming more
remote.
The cut marks an end to Amerada's aggressive expansion of its British
operations in recent years. It spent more than Dollars 800m (Pounds 519m) to
develop the Scott field, which was brought onstream last month recently and
is likely to be one of the largest developments on the UK continental shelf
in the 1990s.
Amerada has made no secret of its opposition to the tax changes proposed by
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor of the exchequer, in his Budget
speech last March. The company's biggest concern, shared by a number of
smaller oil companies operating in the North Sea, was that exploration costs
could no longer be offset against the tax.
The company has repeatedly warned in recent months that it would have to
re-assess its exploration programme in the UK.
It said that the tax reforms reduced the incentive for companies to seek out
the smaller reserves of oil which are likely to characterise UK offshore
exploration in coming years.
Mr Sam Laidlow, managing director of Amerada's UK operations, predicted
earlier this year that job cuts would follow the introduction of the new tax
system.
The government's reforms included a lowering of the tax rate on existing
fields and its elimination on new fields.
The effect of the changes was to make production from developed fields more
profitable but to increase sharply the cost of exploration for companies
that had been able to take advantage of the tax offset.
Almost 160 jobs are to be created by Avon Rubber, the tyre and motor parts
company, in a Pounds 3m investment to produce components for vehicle air
conditioning systems near Williamstown, Rhondda, south Wales.

FT  05 OCT 93 / 40,000 respond on Thorp future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 40,000 letters on the controversial Thorp nuclear reprocessing
plant in Cumbria had arrived at the Department of the Environment by last
night, the closing date of the second public consultation on the plant's
future.
DoE officials, who will spend the next few weeks assessing the replies, said
they reflected both strong support and opposition to the plant.
The latest consultation focuses on the economic case for the Sellafield
plant, and on wider questions of the proliferation of plutonium and nuclear
weapons capability.
Thorp, which has taken Pounds 2.8bn and nearly 10 years to build, is waiting
for a licence to start operation. It is designed to take used fuel from
nuclear reactors and separate out the reusable uranium and plutonium.
British Nuclear Fuels, Thorp's owner, delivered 12,000 of the letters in
favour of the plant from its employees and Cumbria residents yesterday.
Mr Nick Johnston, secretary of the Windscale branch of the GMB general
union, said that BNF had also gathered 22,000 signatures to petitions
backing the plant. However BNF added that there might be overlap between
letters and petitions.
The DoE has received several hundred letters from Japan, many of which are
understood to oppose the plant. Japanese power utilities make up the largest
single tranche of BNF's order book for the next 10 years.
The DoE has also received about 40 letters from Ireland, opposing the plant
because of fears of radioactivity crossing the Irish Sea.
Yesterday Greenpeace brought traffic in Whitehall to a standstill as it
organised a demonstration outside the gates leading to Number 10, the
residence of Mr John Major, the prime minister.
Wearing black paper one-piece suits and party masks designed as skulls
heads, 600 Greenpeace volunteers lay down in the road. Greenpeace, which
said that 44 protesters were arrested, claims that 600 people worldwide will
die from radiation discharged by Thorp in the first 10 years of its
operation.
BNF has maintained that the plant poses no risk to health. The first public
consultation into the plant, which ended early this year, concluded that the
environmental and health risks were insignificant.
Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said yesterday that he hoped that the
decision on Thorp's licence 'will be settled by Christmas'.
The High Court is expected to expected to deliver its judgment on Friday on
the case of two families who claim to have suffered from exposure to
Sellafield radiation.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Radio watchdog gets howls of complaint: The finances behind
the controversial award of the capital's speech franchises to London Radio
News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Radio Authority's decision last month to end LBC's 20 years of
broadcasting news and comment in London caused a furore.
The regulatory body received so many letters of complaint - stirred up at
least partly by the commercial radio station's presenters appealing for
support on air - that a temporary secretary had to be taken on to answer the
thousands of letters.
Some in the industry believe the decision to award both London speech
frequencies to London News Radio is as controversial as the decision to
reject LBC's new management team and Dame Shirely Porter, the station's
head.
It is now clear that the LNR application was firmly supported by only Pounds
9,000 in equity and an underwriting of the Pounds 4m financing by Guinness
Mahon, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank of Yokohama.
The LNR application, based on a round-the-clock news service and a second
more conversational service, was put together by Mr Bruce Fireman, managing
director of the communications division of Guinness Mahon.
A potential investor was Europe-1, the French radio company which has a
stake in Allied Radio in the UK, and which planned to take a 20-25 per cent
stake in the venture. This, however, was subject to shareholder approval.
LNR also said the financing would include convertible preference shares. The
LNR's application document said no loan stock would be involved in the
financing.
After it awarded the frequencies, the Radio Authority is believed to have
been unhappy with the share structure and wanted to see changes made. There
are statutory requirements under the 1990 Broadcasting Act that majority
control in commercial radio licences in the UK has to be held within the
European Community.
Under the latest LNR structure Mr Fireman, who is to become managing
director of LNR, has left the employment of Guinness Mahon. He now holds 52
per cent of the Pounds 150,000 equity in LNR - due to go on air in October
1994 - with Guinness Mahon holding the rest.
The Radio Authority is happy with this new arrangement and last week gave
LNR a formal letter of financial satisfaction. Apart from the Pounds 150,000
equity, the radio statio's money is now going to be raised through Pounds
3.85m in redeemable loan stock all fully underwritten by Guinness Mahon.
The Radio Authority takes the view that the move from preference shares to
loan stock makes no regulatory difference.
Mr Fireman said last night the change from preference share financing to
loan stock had taken place entirely because the company would probably run a
deficit in its first year and it would not be possible to repay preference
shareholders.
LNR says it is in negotiations with a number of institutions to take slices
of loan stock. But the Radio Authority takes the view that even if nothing
changes between now and next October, LNR would probably still get its
licence because control rests within the EC.
'This is a completely routine financing,' Mr Fireman said last night.
Europe-1 is now unlikely to invest in the venture because of reservations
about the business plan.
LNR, chaired by Mr John Tusa, former managing director of the BBC World
Service, is planning to hire 88 journalists and expects to have revenues in
1995 of Pounds 9.78m. Running costs that year are estimated at Pounds 10m.
In the year to September 1993 LBC is understood to have achieved revenues of
just under Pounds 8m.
Last month the Radio Authority announced it was bringing forward by a year
plans to launch a national commercial speech station. Dame Shirley Porter is
determinated to submit an aggressive bid for its licence.

FT  05 OCT 93 / BT to cut 1,187 operator jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications is to shut 10 of its 29 telephone operator
centres with the loss of 1,187 jobs.
The company said some of the job cuts were included in last year's
announcement of a plan to cut 30,000 jobs over the two years to March 1995.
About 8,000 operators, mainly working on directory inquiries, will be left
after the latest cuts. But BT said last night that the company had not ruled
out further job losses.
Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the Union of Communication Workers,
said last night that the news came as a 'devastating blow'. He added: 'These
closures are on a far greater scale than we could possibly have expected.'
BT said the company hoped to achieve the staff reduction through
non-replacement and redeployment, without having to resort to any compulsory
redundancies.
It added that the main reason for the cuts in the number of centres stemmed
from the decline in the number of calls being made by customers needing
help.
The union claims this is because BT now charges for this service but the
company believes the decline in demand stems partly from improvements in the
telephone network and from the greater use of pay phones.
The centres to be closed are at Chester, Edinburgh, Exeter, Glasgow,
Kettering, Leeds, Norwich, Sheffield, Southampton and Taunton.
The latest job cuts are likely to intensify the dangers of industrial
disruption this autumn, union officials claimed.
The union is already urging all BT operators to support calls for a strike
ballot in preparation for industrial action.
This is in protest at planned cuts in operators' allowances and benefits. A
union conference is planned for next week where delegates are expected to
endorse the leadership's strike call by agreeing to the calling of a ballot.
Mr Johnson said that the union was concerned that the rundown in the number
of the operator centres would reduce the quality of BT's service to the
customer.
Last month it was revealed that BT may move as many as 18,000 office jobs
out of central London under a relocation strategy being considered by an
internal review team. The move would leave only about 2,000 posts in central
London.
The relocation is aimed at rationalising BT's substantial office holdings
and could save the company up to Pounds 44m in London-weighting payments.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Shorts wins Pounds 65m order from US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT BROTHERS, the Belfast aircraft and missiles manufacturer, has won a
Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) order to supply 20 C-23 Sherpa military transport
aircraft to the US National Guard.
The contract includes an option for a further 10 aircraft worth about
Dollars 44m.
The three-year programme will involve converting FD360 commuter aircraft
into C-23B Sherpa military aircraft.
Their primary role will be transporting army aviation spares and components
between National Guard bases. But it is envisaged that the aircraft will
also be used for transporting passengers, the dropping of paratroops,
freight-carrying and other air-dropping roles.
Shorts, part of the Canadian transportation group, Bombardier, will be
responsible for managing the programme.
They will also undertake all engineering design, planning, procurement and
the manufacture in Belfast of sheet metal and machined components.
Conversion of the aircraft will be carried out at the West Virginia Air
Center at Bridgeport, West Virginia.
Mr Roy McNulty, Shorts president, said it was yet another strong endorsement
of the Sherpa's capabilities from the National Guard.
Shorts also welcomed the announcement of Lauda Air of Austria and Air
Littoral of France for up to 14 Canadair jets for which they supply the
fuselage and engine housings. If all the options are taken out, the work
will be worth Pounds 15m.

FT  05 OCT 93 / British Land pays Pounds 32m for complex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH LAND, the commercial property company, is to buy one of the largest
retail and office complexes in the Midlands, the company said yesterday.
The acquisition, valued at up to Pounds 32m, is the latest in a series of
deals signed by the company following the launch in June of a property
partnership with Quantum Fund, the investment vehicle owned by Mr George
Soros, the international financier.
The investment in Temple Court, a 300,000 sq ft complex under development in
central Birmingham, will bring the total value of acquisitions by the joint
venture to Pounds 120m.
Temple Court is the first partially built office complex to be acquired by
the partnership, which boosted property shares at its launch by announcing
plans to invest up to Pounds 1bn over the next four years.
Richardson Barberry, the developers, said the final purchase price would
depend on its success in letting retail units on the site.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, has already agreed to lease 100,000 sq
ft, while a further 125,000 sq ft will house eight county courts and offices
for the Lord Chancellor's Department.
Mr John Weston Smith, finance director of British Land, said the deal would
be put forward to Mr Soros' officials shortly for final approval.
Once the transaction and development work is completed next year, British
Land expects the complex to generate income of Pounds 2.75m a year.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Monktonhall miners face pit takeover ultimatum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINERS who operate the Monktonhall colliery in Scotland are likely to be
told by their advisers in the next few days that the only hope of saving
their jobs is to accept the takeover of their consortium by RJB Mining, the
quoted mining company.
The 187 miners, who have each invested Pounds 10,000 in Monktonhall
Mineworkers, will be offered Pounds 1,000 for their shares. Those who lose
their jobs will be offered an extra Pounds 3,000.
RJB is understood to have signed a memorandum of intent to buy Monktonhall
Mineworkers, which leases the pit from British Coal. The deal would involve
a settlement by the consortium with its creditors, owed more than Pounds 3m.
Monktonhall Mineworkers took over the deep mine from British Coal in June
1992 and began producing coal in January. But a combination of initial
underfunding and management errors led to heavy operating losses, despite
the fact that the company won contracts from ScottishPower and British Coal.
Quayle Munro, the Edinburgh merchant bank hired by Lothian regional council
to help solve the company's financial problems, calculated that a capital
injection of Pounds 3m was needed to make the mine viable by opening a new
face.
RJB, which was quoted on the Stock Exchange earlier this year, is believed
to have been underwriting the wage bill of the company since the memorandum
of intent was signed early last month. It is unwilling to comment.
Monktonhall Mineworkers is believed to have debt to secured creditors of
Pounds 1.8m. Preferred creditors are thought to be owed about Pounds
800,000, and unsecured creditors a similar amount. Few saleable assets are
believed to be available to pay them.
The details of the offer from RJB are likely to be put to the miners who own
the company in the next few days. No other offers have been received and it
is thought that if RJB's offer were refused the mining operation would close
and the mine revert to British Coal. The initial reaction of the miners has
been mixed.
The Department of Trade and Industry is believed to be having talks with RJB
about grants for the expanded mining operation which would create jobs.
Lothian regional council is also prepared to offer finance.
At the end of August, Monktonhall Mineworkers had to state publicly that it
would not accept any offer of finance from the Libyan government, with which
it had been holding talks.
That followed publicly expressed criticism of the Libyan connection by
Quayle Munro and opposition from Scottish politicians.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS' awareness of vocational qualifications has risen significantly
over the past few years, although only a third of employers are offering
these work-based qualifications, a survey funded by the Department of
Employment has found, Lisa Wood writes.
Skill Needs in Britain is the fourth in an annual series examining
recruitment difficulties and other skills and training issues among
companies that employ more than 25 people.
The first National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) were introduced in
mid-1987 but they have been slow to arrive in the workplace. Employers have
often complained about their cost and quality.
The survey showed that 74 per cent of employers knew about NVQs, compared
with 63 per cent in 1992. Only 33 per cent of employers said they offered
them to employees. Four out of five of these employers were satisfied with
the qualifications on offer.
The main reason for not offering NVQs was a lack of detailed knowledge of
what they involved.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Plans for free market in milk may trigger legal row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MILK Marketing Board yesterday announced detailed plans for the
structure of the new free market in milk when the compulsory purchasing
scheme is wound up next April and replaced by Milk Marque, a producer-owned
co-operative.
The proposals confirmed a controversial giveaway of the bulk of shares in
Dairy Crest, the board's dairy products subsidiary in which a minority stake
is due to be floated on the Stock Exchange next February or March.
The board's plan to distribute the shares to current dairy farmers only is
expected to trigger legal action from former producers if the scheme is
approved by the Ministry of Agriculture.
Mr William Neville of Burges Salmon, the Bristol solicitors representing
hundreds of former producers, said they were confident that the plan would
be rejected by Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister. The ex-farmers
claim that they should receive shares because they contributed to Dairy
Crest in the past through the milk price and capital levies.
But the board said the proposals, under which up to 75 per cent of its
shares in Dairy Crest would be handed to farmers according to the value of
milk they produced in the 1992-93 financial year, were the fairest that
could be devised.
The ministry will consult the dairy industry and other interested parties
and is expected to issue its response by the end of the year.
The board said that Milk Marque would be established with a net asset value
of Pounds 50m. This will comprise Pounds 27m in working capital and Pounds
23m for assets including the board's milk testing laboratories and 23 of the
40 collection depots owned by Dairy Crest.
The board is proposing that 25 per cent to 35 per cent of Dairy Crest should
be floated. Individual shareholdings would be limited to 15 per cent of
total share capital during Dairy Crest's first five years as a quoted
company.
Current dairy farmers will receive certificates of entitlement to a share of
the board's assets according to their milk output. They will receive
interest on these and be entitled to a cash payment after five years if they
do not join Milk Marque or decide to leave it.
Mr Andrew Dare, the board's chief executive, is predicting that up to 80 per
cent of the UK's 30,000 dairy farmers will join Milk Marque.
Under yesterday's proposals, they would have to give 12 months' notice to
leave and would forfeit 2 per cent of the value of their previous year's
milk production if they gave less notice.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Dublin warms to IRA peace move: Hume-Adams talks seen as
'potentially significant' - DUP anger persists / Bomb attacks in north
London

<TEXT>
THE IRISH government has described as 'potentially significant' the
unprecedented statement at the weekend by the Irish Republican Army
supporting the peace initiative launched 10 days ago by Mr John Hume, the
leader of the SDLP and Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein.
Details of the initiative are still private, but Mr Albert Reynolds, the
Taoiseach (Irish prime minister), and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister,
are expected to discuss them with Mr Hume tomorrow in Dublin, when he
arrives after a nine-day visit to the United States where he met
Congressional leaders and advisers to President Bill Clinton.
Last night Mr Spring said: 'Any statement that gives the appearance of
wanting to establish peace in Ireland is something that has to be dealt
with.'
'But if they are serious about wanting to establish peace . . . I would say
to them 'Stop the killings, stop the bombings', and let people know that
they are serious.'
An Irish government spokesman said yesterday: 'The Taoiseach is keeping an
open mind. He is looking forward to hearing what progress has been made (in
the Hume-Adams talks) and if they can advance the progress to peace, then
there will be a positive reaction to the initiative.'
The Dublin government has maintained that it has not yet received any
details of the Hume-Adams initiative, although a senior foreign ministry
official is reported to have met Mr Hume a few days before the Hume-Adams
announcement.
The foreign ministry would neither confirm nor deny these reports. 'Our
officials have many contacts in Northern Ireland and it is not our policy to
make comments on individual meetings,' it said.
The UK government is also believed to have been informed of the initiative,
when Mr Hume met Mr John Major on September 16.
As a result, the hard-line Democratic Unionist party headed by Rev Ian
Paisley has angrily ruled out any further participation in the round-table
talks process.
DUP leaders walked out of an acrimonious meeting in Belfast last Friday with
Mr Michael Ancram, minister of state for Northern Ireland, claiming that the
government had refused to discuss fresh DUP proposals for a new
constitutional assembly in Northern Ireland, which were first presented to
Mr Major more than two weeks ago.
A Northern Ireland Office spokesman said last Friday's meeting: 'was not a
fruitful meeting'. He said that the DUP proposals had been on the agenda,
'but Dr Paisley instead launched an attack on what he claimed was a
government dialogue with Sinn Fein'.
He said the NIO had not yet decided whether to attempt to reconvene the
round-table talks, which have been stalled since last November, without the
participation of the DUP, 'but it has not been ruled out either'.
It has also emerged that Mr Spring and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary,
met in New York last week when the latest developments on Northern Ireland
were discussed.
Mr Spring had been in New York to address the General Assembly of the United
Nations last Friday. In his speech he said: 'The pieces of the jigsaw are
all to hand if only we can find the right way to fit them together . . we
will bring to any resumed talks the resources of goodwill, flexibility and
imagination which we believe all participants must display if a new
agree-ment is to be achieved.
'It is painfully obvious that all traditional approaches have failed and
that new thinking is urgently required . . . we are ready to accept the need
for radical and innovative compromise as part of a new accommodation which
will bring lasting peace and reconciliation to the island of Ireland.
'Peace is now the imperative; and the continuation of violence is the single
greatest obstacle to the realisation of our hopes. An end to violence would,
at least, help to clear the way for compromise and negotiation'.
As if to underline that statement, the IRA yesterday exploded bombs in both
Belfast and London.
Two bombs exploded in Belfast, one at a tyre depot in the docks area, and
one at an electrical wholesalers in the north of the city. No one was
injured in either blast but both bombs caused extensive damage.
Five bombs were set off in north London yesterday morning, causing havoc
with rush-hour traffic but apparently causing no injuries and only minor
damage. Commander David Tucker, head of the Anti-Terrorist Squad, said that
the lack of a usual telephoned warning was a 'sinister change of strategy'
by the IRA. The IRA has confirmed that it planted three bombs in north
London on Saturday which injured five passers-by.

FT  05 OCT 93 / New City insurance centre optimistic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE London Underwriting Centre got off to a good start yesterday Mr John
Hesh, the general manager of the new City insurance market, said.
'We had a tremendous number of visitors and not only brokers,' Mr Hesh said.
'There was a full and heavy day's business and . . . the opening response
was greater than expected.'
Twenty-two underwriters from companies such as GRE(UK), Mercantile &amp; General
Reinsurance, Commercial Union and Eagle Star have taken space in a new
Pounds 50m building in Mincing Lane. Between them they underwrite Pounds
2.5bn of premiums a year.
Their combined capital and surplus or 'capacity' totals more than Pounds
6bn. The capacity at Lloyd's is more than Pounds 8bn but there are
predictions that it could fall next year.
Mr Blake, chairman of the centre, said: 'In the past, brokers have had to
trudge around 22 different offices for quotes. We are offering one-stop
business. We see the LUC as complementary to Lloyd's. If Lloyd's is unable
to undertake the same volume of non-marine insurance in the next year . . .
we want the world to know that London as a centre can still handle the
necessary business.'
Mr Nick Phillips, Lloyd's property manager, said the LUC business was not
new, just existing business under one roof.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO brothers were yesterday fined nearly Pounds 100,000 for their part in a
Pounds 1m grain export fraud.
Belfast Crown Court judge Frank Russell told Anthony and Dermot McGeough to
pay at once or go to jail after they admitted charges of conspiracy to
defraud and unlawfully exporting nearly 400 tonnes of wheat to the Irish
Republic.
The court heard the grain was smuggled through a shed straddling the Ulster
border at Jonesborough with one door to the north and one to the south.
A crown lawyer claimed Anthony McGeough had been more involved than his
brother.
Anthony McGeough was fined Pounds 67,500. A lawyer said he should be given
credit for his guilty pleas and for crossing the border to stand trial.
Dermot McGeough was fined Pounds 31,000.

THE prosecution of six people following the Serious Fraud Office
investigation into European Leisure, the entertainment and nightclub group,
was yesterday transferred to the crown court by Bow Street magistrates.
The SFO investigation, carried out with the Metropolitan police, centred on
European Leisure's hostile takeover of Midsummer Leisure, the pubs and
discos group, in May 1990.
The six include Mr Michael Ward, former chairman and chief executive of
European Leisure and two former directors, Mr Jeremy Howarth and Mr George
Hendry.
They are charged with conspiracy to defraud, conspiring to create a false
market in the company's shares and theft. All six were remanded on bail.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Government cuts school reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEACHERS were yesterday offered deep cuts in the number of reports they must
make to parents under the national curriculum as the government tried to
persuade unions to abandon their boycott of school tests.
Reactions from the three teachers' unions that boycotted the tests earlier
this year were lukewarm. None were prepared to call off their action. There
were, however, signs of disagreement.
For 14-year-olds, teachers must now only report on six items of national
curriculum assessment for each pupil, rather than 41, while for
seven-year-olds, the number of items has been cut from 22 to 13.
Schools would have to give each child's parents at least one written report
a year, but its time of publication would be flexible. Pupils' results would
be compared with the average for their year-group.
Baroness Blatch, the education minister, called on teachers to end their
boycott.
The National Union of Teachers said Baroness Blatch 'appeared to have
misunderstood the union's concerns'.
It said: 'The tests continue to be educationally unsound. They may not match
teacher assessments, which will result in misleading information being given
to parents.'
But the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, whose
boycott is based on its complaint against excessive workload, welcomed the
proposals. The union's executive meets at the end of this week and will
consider the government's proposals 'very seriously'.
The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said the government had made a
'move in the right direction'. It would re-ballot members once it had
evidence on the changes the government would make to workload.

THE European Space Agency (ESA) signed a Ecu446m (Pounds 340m) contract
yesterday with Alenia, Italy's state-controlled aerospace group, to head a
group of companies to build a telecommunications satellite to be called
Artemis, write Robert Graham in Rome and Daniel Green in London.
The Italian government is covering 40 per cent of the costs of the project,
which will produce a new generation of satellites to handle
telecommunications traffic, especially cellular telephones. In return,
Italian companies will get 48 per cent of the work.
It will be Alenia's first non-Italian prime contractorship, placing it at
the head of a group of Europe's best-known aerospace companies including
Aerospatiale and Alcatel Espace of France, Fokker of the Netherlands,
Matra-Marconi, the Anglo-French joint venture, and Casa of Spain.
One of the reasons Alenia won the contract is that Italy was 'owed' some
business to balance its Ecu500m contribution to the ESA budget.

concerns

<TEXT>
THE European Commission told France yesterday it would justify with clear
and detailed proposals its strategy of including Europe's film and
broadcasting industry in the Uruguay Round negotiations on world trade
reform.
At a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Luxembourg, France, supported by
Spain, argued for taking the audiovisual sector out of the negotiations,
conducted under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Backed by intellectuals across the EC, Paris maintains that Europe's
cultural identity would be submerged by US television and films if
audiovisual trade were liberalised to an extent which prevented governments
from protecting and subsidising national cultural output.
Though marked by continuing confrontation between Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's
chief trade negotiator, and Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister,
yesterday's meeting successfully reduced intra-EC tension over the Round's
farm trade chapter. France has threatened to veto any world trade accord
unless it wins more concessions for its farmers.
Almost all discussion centred on other areas of the Round, on which Sir Leon
reported 'a certain amount of progress' ahead of the December 15 deadline
for conclusion. On steel, services, textiles and aircraft manufacture,
ministers were able to feel satisfied either that progress was being made,
or that the EC was pursuing a robust and constructive line, in alliance with
other Gatt signatories.
The Commission also put forward detailed proposals to halve the time it
takes to conduct anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations against
imports deemed to have an unfair advantage inside the EC. These could take
some of the heat out of another French demand that the EC arm itself with a
trade defence arsenal at least equivalent to the US '301' laws, which allows
Washington to impose unilateral sanctions against partners it considers are
breaking the rules.
But the sharpest exchanges were over the audiovisual issue and US 'cultural
imperialism' - despite the irony that participants and press at the meeting
spent much of yesterday watching the events in Moscow unfold through the CNN
news channel. Sir Leon has opposed French demands to keep the sector out of
the Uruguay Round, arguing that it would prosper more within Gatt rules, so
long as 'cultural specificity' allowing some protection were achieved.
He promised 'very definite and detailed proposals which would enable us to
continue our obligations internationally. . . . and give real protection to
the sector'.
Mr Juppe said he remained to be convinced, and offered French-speaking
Quebec in Canada as an example of why culture had to be kept out of trade
agreements.

FT  05 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Construction equipment due for a dig-out -
Japan's local suppliers look to recovery but imports remain uncertain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARD times at home could soon be over for Japan's construction equipment
producers, but foreign suppliers seeking success in one of the world's most
difficult markets may still find themselves up against a brick wall.
The phenomenal post-war growth of the Japanese construction equipment
industry has given rise to some of the sector's most powerful companies
worldwide - Komatsu, for example, is second only to Caterpillar of the US.
In the process, Japan has fostered a more concentrated domestic market than
that of North America or Europe. With fewer suppliers in each product area,
producers have had a field day at home, and foreign companies have found it
hard to break in.
These are some of the findings of a new study of the Japanese market by the
London-based Corporate Intelligence Group, working with its Tokyo
representative Rayden Research.
The 326-page report* claims to be the first to reveal the market and
producers in such detail. 'It has always been assumed in the past to be a
closed world which could not be revealed,' it says.
It comes at a turning point in the fortunes of the Japanese market and its
players. The bursting of the 'bubble economy' and the end of the
construction boom depressed sales of construction equipment from 169,215
units in 1990 to 128,064 last year, says the study. It sees a further slight
decline this year before sales pick up steadily in 1994 and 1995, then reach
nearly 150,000 units a year in 1996 and 1997.
The need to improve infrastructure is likely to result in a big programme of
civil engineering, with beneficial effects for the equipment suppliers from
1995 onwards, according to the report.
Whether foreign suppliers can benefit from the forecast recovery of the
Japanese market is debatable, however. Overall, imports currently account
for only about 2-3 per cent of the market, says Mr Chris Barrow-Williams,
author of the study.
'(Foreign companies) could make more profits out of selling in Japan, and
could price the products competitively,' he says. 'But they have to
replicate the established infrastructure to make the products attractive.'
There are more than 790,000 units of construction equipment in Japan - an
enormous figure, says the study, which reflects a need to use machinery as a
substitute for labour at every turn. This requires large service networks.
One strategy for importers is to offer a product that the Japanese do not
make. This can be hard - Mr Barrow-Williams says some imported products are
totally different to Japanese machines, and are difficult for local
customers to accept.
The study chronicles some of the successes and failures of foreign equipment
suppliers. Caterpillar is by far the biggest and benefits hugely from
selling its products through Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi, jointly owned with
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. SCM sells both Caterpillar and Mitsubishi
products through a unified distribution network with 200 sales points
nationwide.
Through SCM, Caterpillar is market leader in articulated dumptrucks, which
are not made in Japan but became popular in the construction boom partly for
their usefulness in golf course construction.
Sales surged from 26 units in 1988 to 165 in 1990, but dropped back to 100
last year. Its main competitor is Brussels-based VME, whose Volvo BM
machines are sold by a unit of Marubeni, the big Japanese trading house.
The third player, Komatsu, sources its articulated dumptrucks from Norway,
so all three rival ranges are marketed through strong organisations.
According to the study, this illustrates that 'if imported machines and
ideas are to make their way in Japan they definitely need high-powered
back-up'.
No amount of back-up, however, seems likely to retrieve things for importers
of backhoe loaders, one of the leading products in the European market.
In the 1960s Japan used to import 600-700 units a year, but since then sales
have plummeted in favour of Japanese-built mini-excavators - much more
suitable for roadworks in Japan's narrow streets. According to the study,
just 18 backhoe loaders were sold in Japan last year - 15 by Hitachi which
imports machines from John Deere in the US, and three by JCB.
Perhaps the most intriguing thing for importers is the market for
'all-terrain cranes'. Developed in Europe to enable fast travel between
sites and better handling on-site, these are an alien concept in the
Japanese market, although Kato, Tadano and Sumitomo make them mainly for
export.
The biggest European supplier, Liebherr, has its own small sales operation
in Japan. 'It has a product which is different, which will bring out the
classic reactions - curiosity and then worry about not supporting Japanese
companies, not having enough service back-up and so on,' comments the study.
The German company will face a big challenge if Tadano broadens its range of
all-terrain cranes and enters the local market, it says. On the other hand,
by endorsing the concept, Tadano could make Liebherr's job easier.

FT  05 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Chemicals sector at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S chemical industry risks following the dinosaur into extinction, the
chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's largest chemicals group,
warned yesterday. Sir Denys Henderson told the Society of Chemical Industry
in Rome that the sector had to take more account of changes in the economic
environment and adapt more quickly. Recent half-year results had been
dismal.
'Very little has happened to persuade me we are making significant progress
to solve the serious problems of over-capacity, falling prices and miserable
margins that afflict our industry,' he said.
Mergers like that between Renault and Volvo were imaginative, but massive
businesses were not always the answer, said Sir Denys. He suggested possible
routes for European companies included alliances with chemicals groups
elsewhere or with the oil sector.
Alternatives might involve partnerships, though with smaller equity stakes
than previously acceptable to the chemicals industry. Such partnerships were
common in the mining sector, an area where Sir Denys had gained expertise as
a non-executive director of RTZ, the world's largest mining group.

FT  05 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Japan hits at targets for US car parts

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association,
yesterday criticised the US for trying to correct the trade imbalance
between the two countries by setting targets for purchases of US vehicle
parts by Japanese carmakers.
'The US is trying to seek a solution to a macro-economic problem at the
micro-economic level,' he told a group of foreign correspondents in Tokyo.
By doing so, it was delving into business matters in a way that condoned
managed trade, could impede business activity and could be detrimental to
consumers' interests, he said.
His comments follow talks last month between the US and Japan involving US
vehicle parts purchases by Japanese companies in a new framework of trade
talks agreed between the two countries this summer. A second meeting is
planned for this month.
The US side, Mr Kume said, appeared to be asking for purchasing targets in
1995 and 1996 but 'targets should be set by the seller'. Japanese car
companies would be glad to purchase US-made vehicle parts as long as the
quality and prices were right but it was up to the seller to make the
effort.
Mr Kume also cast doubt on US claims that the Japanese market was closed to
foreign cars, saying European car makers were doing very well in Japan.
The problem was rather that the Big Three US carmakers - General Motors,
Ford and Chrysler - did not make cars that were suited to the Japanese
market. For example, about 80 per cent of cars sold in Japan had an engine
displacement of less than 2,000cc but no US carmaker had introduced a car
with engine displacement of less than 2,000cc into Japan.
Mr Kume pointed out that Japanese carmakers had offered to open their
dealers to US cars but had received no proposals from the US side on that
offer. 'We can only conclude that that must be because they have no cars to
sell in the Japanese market,' he said.
Better marketing efforts were also needed, as shown by a survey conducted
last year by the Japanese Consumer Research Institute which showed that 89
per cent of respondents either 'do not want to purchase' or 'do not want to
purchase at all' cars made by the Big Three. This compared with 54 per cent
which responded negatively to European cars.

BOMBARDIER'S Short Brothers subsidiary in Belfast will supply 20 Sherpa C-23
aircraft worth CDollars 130m (Pounds 64m) to the American armed forces, for
delivery over the next three years. The US has taken options on 10 more.
Bombardier has won a USDollars 127m (Pounds 82.4m) order for six
50-passenger Regional Jets from Lauda Air of Austria for use with Lufthansa
from a new Vienna hub. Hughes Airport Systems of California has been given a
Dollars 80m contract by the Trinidad and Tobago Airports Authority to expand
and improve the country's main international airport, Canute James writes
from Kingston.
The work, the first part of a 25-year project, will cover the construction
of a new passenger terminal and new air cargo facilities, with supporting
infrastructure. The improvements will also include a higher level of
aircraft maintenance services, and more efficient piping of aviation fuel.
The expansion of the Piarco airport is intended by the government of the
Caribbean republic to make it a hub for air traffic between South America
and North America and Europe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday named General George A Joulwan as Supreme
Allied Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's forces in
Europe (Saceur), George Graham writes from Washington.
The Pentagon said the Nato allies had already approved Gen Joulwan's
appointment, which opens the way for General John Shalikashvili, his
predecessor as Saceur, to take up his new post as chairman of the US Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, said he
would not complete Gen Shalikashvili's confirmation until a successor had
been named.
Gen Joulwan, 53, is in Panama as head of the US Southern Command, in charge
of all US forces in Latin America. Known for a ferocious temper, he has
overseen US efforts to curb drug running and terrorism in Latin America, as
well as presiding over preparations for the US's withdrawal from the Panama
Canal by the end of 1999.
An infantryman with two combat tours in Vietnam and extensive service in
Europe, he had been considered less experienced than some other candidates
in the political skills required for the job.
Mr Les Aspin, US secretary of defence, yesterday decided not to fire Admiral
Frank Kelso, the senior serving US navy officer, for his handling of the
1991 'Tailhook' sexual harassment scandal, Jurek Martin writes.
Mr Aspin overruled the recommendations of Mr John Dalton, appointed by Mr
Clinton as the civilian secretary of the navy this summer. His action
probably avoided further souring of relations between Mr Clinton and the
military. Mr Dalton urged that Admiral Kelso be dismissed for failing to
show leadership in the 'Tailhook' conference in Las Vegas, during which navy
airmen allegedly assaulted female colleagues.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S Peronist government has emerged as the overwhelming victor in
Sunday's mid-term congressional elections. The government took 42 per cent
of the votes against 30 per cent for the Radicals, the main opposition
party.
The Peronist triumph was more significant for its defeat of the Radicals in
Buenos Aires city, their stronghold, and a decisive victory in Buenos Aires
province.
The government now holds 48 per cent of the seats in the 257-strong lower
Chamber of Deputies, against 45 per cent before the election. It already has
a two-thirds majority in the Senate.
The victory should increase President Carlos Menem's chances of amending the
constitution so that he can run for re-election.
The government's only significant reverse was in the province of Cordoba,
where the Radicals have ruled for 10 years. The economy minister, Mr Domingo
Cavallo, led the government campaign in Cordoba, but the Peronists won only
36 per cent of the votes - 2 points less than in the last elections two
years ago.
Mr Cavallo said yesterday he was 'sad and disappointed' with the outcome,
attributed to local political rivalries. The minister's successful economic
policies were the chief factor in the government's election victory but his
rumoured bid for the presidency in 1995 now looks less likely.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Republican leader to quit: Michel goes, Gingrich may take
over in House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN a move which could herald more confrontational relations between the
Republican party and the Democratic administration, Congressman Robert
Michel, leader of the Republican minority in the US House of
Representatives, yesterday announced he would retire from Congress after the
next election.
Mr Newt Gingrich, an acid-tongued Georgia conservative, is the front-runner
to take Mr Michel's place as leader.
Mr Michel has in recent weeks signalled growing disillusionment both over
his chances of ever becoming Speaker of the House and over the strident tone
of the right-wingers in his party.
Announcing his retirement in his native Peoria, Illinois, Mr Michel said
that he would have felt an obligation to continue to serve if former
President George Bush had won re-election last year.
'I don't have that obligation now,' he said.
'Even though I believe the prospects are excellent for our winning big in
the House next year, I'm not sure it will be enough to make me speaker.
Therefore, I believe it's appropriate to announce my intention to bow out
now, when we're on a high and there's time remaining in this term to help
make an orderly transition from my leadership to whomever,' Mr Michel added.
Mr Michel, 70, has been in Congress for 37 years and served as House
Republican leader since 1980.
His obvious discontent with the younger right-wingers in his party in the
past few years has less to do with content than with style. His own voting
record is solidly conservative on economic, social and foreign policy
issues, but he also comes from a tradition of working with the majority
Democrats in order to win concessions.
He particularly resents those of his colleagues who spend their time in
Washington criticising Congress.
'I never went to Congress with the idea of trashing that institution,' he
said.
The younger right-wingers, who now dominate the House Republicans, 'judge
not by philosophy but by belligerence', according to former Republican
congressman Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma.
Mr Gingrich, a mop-headed former history teacher, has been the leader of
this school, and now holds the Republicans' number two position as minority
whip.
Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader in the other chamber, faces much
the same sort of challenge as Mr Michel from Senator Phil Gramm of Texas,
another aggressive right-winger.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Economic virtue brings Mexico little reward: Low growth may
put market reforms at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S reward for eight years of text-book market economic policies is
proving scant.
Modest growth of 2.4 per cent last year gave way to a 1.4 per cent expansion
in the first half of this year, while growth in the second quarter amounted
to just 0.3 per cent, with agriculture and manufacturing contracting by 3.7
per cent and 1.1 per cent.
For Mexico's ruling party, which faces a presidential election in August,
the low growth threatens to erode support for the pro-market economic
reforms of the past decade. All year, businesses, unions and farmers have
been clamouring for more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.
Some of these demands were met on Sunday when President Carlos Salinas
announced measures agreed in the annual pact between government, unions and
the private sector. These included a cut in corporate and employment taxes,
and a more than 15 per cent increase in the minimum wage by next year.
That would see the government with a balanced budget next year, down from an
expected surplus this year of about 1.1 per cent of GDP.
Despite such fiscal prudence, the economy remains vulnerable, particularly
if the North American Free Trade Agreement is not approved as scheduled by
January 1. Were Nafta rejected, the government might have to push interest
rates even higher than the 8 per cent real rate already seen to protect the
exchange rate.
A greater problem might be the uncertainty of another postponement of the
treaty. Investment, the main engine of economic growth over the past two
years, has slowed sharply this year, partly in response to high interest
rates, but also as nervous businessmen await the Nafta outcome.
Meanwhile, Mexico's private sector is undergoing a radical transformation to
compete under free trade and unregulated domestic markets. Most businesses
have cut production in unprofitable lines, fired workers, and closed
factories. In the short term, such actions have contributed to the slowdown.
Mr Sebastian Edwards, the chief economist for Latin America at the World
Bank, says: 'It takes a lot of time for reforms to work. The big question is
whether there is enough patience in a democracy, or semi-democracy, to wait
long enough for the results.'
Mr Edwards emphasises that many of Mexico's important economic reforms, such
as widespread privatisation, deregulation, and the opening to international
capital markets, only occurred after President Salinas came to power in
1989. The reform of Mexico's ejido (quasi-communal) farm system was not
finalised until the end of last year, and with regularisation of land titles
going slowly, will not have any positive impact for some time.
Mexico's labour laws still encourage rigid work practices, and the country
has, according to Mr Edwards, the most distorted system of severance
payments in all Latin America. This has made the job of restructuring
Mexican companies more onerous than it could have been.
For the moment a reform of the labour laws is out of the question. As the
new social pact reflected, the ruling party is nervous about upsetting the
unions in the run-up to the presidential election. And any attempt to weaken
unions before the US congressional vote on Nafta would almost certainly
create a furore in the US.
However, Mr Salinas yesterday announced a radical reform of Mexico's
agricultural sector, replacing price supports with direct cash grants to
farmers. Later this year, he is expected to propose a new liberal foreign
investment law and legislation allowing more private investment in railways
and airports.
A government official says the increased emphasis on micro-economic reform
accompanied by a gentle relaxation of fiscal policy will lead to economic
growth of around 3.5 per cent next year. If such growth is not obtained,
then the 'Mexican model' may start to lose its lustre.

THE number of US citizens living in poverty last year reached a 30-year

reports.
That compared with 19.5 per cent in 1963, the US Census Bureau said
yesterday.
The south remained the region with the highest poverty rate, 16.9 per cent.
Household income was flat compared with the year before, except in the
north-east, where median household income fell 3.7 per cent. The number of
those lacking health insurance also climbed by nearly 6 per cent to 37.4m,
the bureau said.

<TEXT>
HEAVY casualties and a shortage of troops have forced the Sri Lankan army to
pull out of the troubled Jaffna peninsula, bringing to an apparent end its
biggest military offensive (Operation Yal Devi) against Tamil guerrillas in
more than two years.
The army says 118 soldiers were killed and 250 injured when a 5,000-strong
force, backed by tanks, gunboats and jet fighters, advanced 24 kilometres
into the rebel-held areas last Friday and captured the port of Killaly.
Yesterday the defence ministry said it had abandoned the port, used by the
guerrillas for several years to beat an army blockade, and had withdrawn to
the Elephant Pass army base on a strip of land which joins the Jaffna
peninsula to the Sri Lankan mainland.
Military analysts say Sri Lanka's defence forces, which lost two tanks in
the operation, was taken aback at the heavy loss of life in spite of
government claims of a great success. The Sri Lankan army does not have
enough men to keep the port supplied through rebel territory during the
monsoon.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHILIPPINE government is moving towards accepting an offer for an
out-of-court settlement from Westinghouse Electric of the US to end a
protracted legal battle involving the construction of a 620MW nuclear power
plant.
President Fidel Ramos yesterday said he had approved 'in principle' a review
committee's recommendation to accept Westinghouse's offer worth Dollars
49.5m (Pounds 32m) to settle the conflict.
The committee, set up to review the government's options in connection with
the case, is headed by Mr Delfin Lazaro, the energy secretary.
The Philippines had sued Westinghouse, along with its subcontractor Burns
and Roe Associates, in a US court for allegedly bribing the late Mr
Ferdinand Marcos, then Philippine president, and an associate in order to
win the power plant contract.
Last May a New Jersey court cleared the two US companies of the Philippine
government's charge. However, the Philippines kept its option for an appeal.
Mr Ramos, after the May verdict, had also ruled against operating the
facility as a nuclear plant, ordering instead its conversion to enable it to
be fired by conventional fuel.
The settlement offer involves the supply by Westinghouse of two turbine
generators, which can be fired by oil or gas. The first is due by the end of
this year and the other in February, and both should be in operation by May.
Mr Ramos said in a press briefing yesterday it was still necessary to inform
the two chambers of Congress about the compromise package. While Mr Ramos
said informing Congress was only a formality, some members of the House of
Representatives and the Senate said they would in fact vet the agreement.
Some congressmen were yesterday already criticising the deal, noting that
the Philippines was 'at the losing end'.
Before the trial on the case early this year, Westinghouse had offered a
compromise worth some Dollars 75m, but the Manila government rejected it.
After the May verdict, Westinghouse offered originally one turbine worth
Dollars 25m to avert a Philippine appeal.
Mr Lazaro, who had led the talks with Westinghouse, described the settlement
as 'the best we can get at this time'. He said further litigation could
prove costly without any guarantee of winning.
The settlement does not cover loans acquired by the Philippines for the
nuclear plant construction. Some Dollars 1.1bn of such obligations remain
payable to a consortium of financing institutions led by the US
Export-Import Bank.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday insisted the US would 'complete our
mission' in Somalia, despite the deaths of at least 12 US soldiers in a
battle in Mogadishu on Sunday night between UN troops and militias loyal to
Gen Mohammed Aideed, Somalia's rebel warlord.
US officials said a number of American troops were also missing. Mr Les
Aspin, defence secretary, warned that the US expected humanitarian treatment
of a helicopter crewman shot down over Mogadishu. President Clinton stressed
that if any harm came to captured Americans, US and not UN forces would
respond unilaterally.
The president said the US still planned to hand over its mission in Somalia
to other nations, and urged the UN to step up efforts to re-establish a
political structure in the country. 'Meanwhile, be sure we will do whatever
is necessary to protect our own forces and complete our mission.'
Mr Aspin said the US was sending four tanks, 14 Bradley fighting vehicles,
two AC-130 gunships, replacement helicopters and about 200 extra troops to
Somalia 'to prevent the return of anarchy and famine'.
One Malaysian UN peacekeeper was also killed in Sunday's battle, the
fiercest clash since the UN military took command of Somalia in May. US
officials said 'one or two' top aides to Gen Aideed had been captured.
The International Committee of the Red Cross counted 500 Somali wounded in
Mogadishu's three hospitals. Journalists said they saw truck-loads of
corpses being driven from around the Bakara market where the battle raged
until dawn. UN military officials said they had captured 24 of Gen Aideed's
militiamen.
Hostile Somalis dragged the corpses of two US soldiers through the streets
of Mogadishu in a display of anti-US and anti-UN sentiment which is becoming
more entrenched as the death toll rises.
Leaders of both parties in the US Congress yesterday stepped up their
demands for the US to withdraw from Somalia.
'Enough Americans have died,' said Senator Robert Dole, leader of the
Republican minority in the Senate, in a call backed by Senator Robert Byrd,
the senior Democrat who presides over most government spending.
Although members of Congress last week dropped an attempt to force Mr
Clinton to justify the continued US military presence in Somalia, in the
face of a threatened presidential veto, they retaliated by stripping funding
for peacekeeping operations from a defence spending bill.
'If the US. . . pulls out its troops, then other countries which have sent
troops to Somalia are unlikely to remain committed to the UN operation,' Mr
Terence Lyons, a policy director at the Brookings Institution in Washington,
said. Even scaling down US military involvement would debilitate the UN
mission.

shot down

PENTAGON officials said yesterday that as many as a dozen US soldiers were
killed in Mogadishu on Sunday night during a battle between United Nations
troops and militias loyal to Gen Mohammed Farah Aideed, Somalia's rebel
warlord.
One Malaysian UN peace-keeper was also killed in the fiercest confrontation
since the UN military took command of Somalia in May.
The International Committee of the Red Cross counted 500 Somali wounded in
Mogadishu's three hospitals. It gave no figures for the dead. Journalists in
the Somali capital, however, said they saw truck-loads of corpses being
driven from streets around the Bakara market where the battle raged until
dawn.
UN military officials said they had captured 24 of Gen Aideed's militiamen
in a search operation east of the market. Earlier they said five US soldiers
had died and a further six were believed to be missing after ground fire
shot down two US helicopters.
Hostile Somali crowds dragged the corpses of two American soldiers through
the streets of Mogadishu in a display of anti-US and anti-UN sentiment which
is becoming more entrenched with the rising Somali death toll in the United
Nations' war against Gen Aideed.
The high casualty rate among US troops is likely to harden the resolve of US
congressmen to pull their troops out of Somalia.
Already, there have been two votes on Capitol Hill requesting President Bill
Clinton to justify the continued US military presence in a country which
does not appear to appreciate the international intervention. Mr Clinton has
until October 15 to find a rationale that could turn the
anti-interventionist tide in the US.
'If the US decides Somalia is a loser and pulls out its troops, then other
countries which have sent troops to Somalia are unlikely to remain committed
to the UN operation,' Mr Terence Lyons, a policy director at the Brookings
Institution in Washington, said yesterday. Even scaling down US military
involvement would debilitate the UN mission, as American troops form the
backbone of the operation.
'If the multinational peacekeeping experiment is judged to be a failure in
Somalia, then other countries crying out for international action - Bosnia,
Angola, Mozambique - will be ignored,' Mr Lyons said.
The latest battle brought the number of UN peacekeepers killed to 63 since
the 27,000-strong UN force arrived in Somalia in May. Hundreds of Somalis
have been killed in the effort to trace Gen Aideed.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Singapore goes all out to turn its citizens into share
owners - The 'stocks are good for you' policy is a significant change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Singapore's leaders decide on a new policy, the state's considerable
propaganda apparatus swings into action. Earlier this year Mr Goh Chok Tong,
Singapore's prime minister, announced plans to turn the island republic into
a share-owning society, saying: 'The aim is literally to allow Singaporeans
to own a piece of the economy'.
Since Mr Goh's March speech, Singaporeans have been bombarded by
state-sponsored television and newspaper advertisements describing the
virtues of share ownership.
For Singapore, a carefully-controlled society where speculative business
activity and risk-taking have been officially frowned on, the new 'stocks
are good for you' policy represents a significant change. The government has
granted considerable incentives to those who put their money into the stock
market.
Tight regulations on the use of funds from the Citizens Provident Fund
(CPF), a compulsory national savings scheme, have been lifted. Singaporeans
have been urged to use a greater portion of their CPF funds, once viewed as
sacrosanct by the government, to invest in the market. From the beginning of
this month more than SDollars 20bn (Pounds 8.3bn) of additional CPF funds
was made available to buy shares.
There are political reasons for the new approach. The People's Action party
(PAP), in power since Singapore's independence in the mid-1960s, is
concerned about a decline in its vote in recent general elections. The PAP
wants to rebut criticism that Singapore is becoming a more inequitable
society: one way is to widen share ownership and make people feel they have
a financial stake in the economy.
But economic considerations are central to the new policy. In recent months
official recognition has been increasing that the rapidly developing
Singapore economy risks outgrowing its small home base.
Singapore is sitting on a mountain of savings. The island republic of less
than 3m people has foreign exchange reserves of more than Dollars 40bn
(Pounds 25.9bn). The CPF's total assets are now put at about SDollars 50bn.
The country's vast savings should be better used, say the policymakers, and
directed into overseas investments.
Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's senior minister and still the main architect of
many policies, said earlier this year that if the country failed to
internationalise its economy and develop a 'second wing', it would be
quickly left behind by newly-industrialising countries such as South Korea,
Taiwan and Hong Kong.
'We will be a failed story, one that nearly made it but stalled half-way,'
said Mr Lee. The hope is that Singapore's citizens will now invest their
saving in listed companies, thereby providing the financial muscle for a
push overseas by corporate Singapore.
Though Singaporean investors have traditionally been far less adventurous
than their counterparts in Hong Kong, signs are that the official campaign,
known as 'Invest Singapore', is having results. Recent share flotations of a
number of companies, some of them former state-run enterprises, have been
oversubscribed several times.
The real test of the new policy will come this month as Singapore Telecom
(ST), the state post and telecommunications service, goes on the market. ST
is one of the world's most modern telecoms companies, with some of the
lowest customer costs. ST's net income rose 9 per cent to SDollars 1bn on
sales of SDollars 2.8bn in the year to March 1993.
The ST flotation, being billed as the largest public listing yet in
South-East Asia, will take place in carefully-planned stages. The government
has offered an array of incentives to local investors to take part in the
flotation, including big discounts to those who buy ST shares on a long-term
basis.
The launch is likely to set the pattern for future listings, which are
planned to include the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit System, the port and the
board of public utilities.
Urging the public to go on a share-buying spree could backfire on the
government. ST and other companies have done very well in the protected home
market. The central question now is whether these companies can compete
overseas.
With few exceptions, Singapore companies have not distinguished themselves
overseas. Analysts point out that many cash-rich companies have been very
hesitant about competing abroad. Mr Lee himself has berated Singaporean
business people for their stay-at-home attitude, their lack of
entrepreneurial flair and their reluctance to take risks.
If corporate attitudes do not change, Singapore investors might be
disappointed in their investments. In turn, people could become angry with a
government which has so zealously preached the virtues of participation in
the stock market.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Fresh arrest in Japanese 'bribes' case
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE public prosecutors yesterday arrested an executive of Taisei, a
leading construction company which had denied its head-office officials were
involved in a widening political bribery scandal.
Mr Takashi Hashimoto, 57, a vice-president of Taisei, was arrested for his
alleged role in the bribery of a local governor who, prosecutors say,
accepted Y20m (Pounds 122,600) from the company on the understanding it
would be awarded public works contracts.
Taisei said last week that two provincial managers arrested for the alleged
bribery of Mr Shuntaro Honma, the governor of Miyagi, north of Tokyo, had
acted without the approval of head office, apparently prompting the
prosecutors to take aim at the company again.
The company yesterday apologised for the embarrassment caused by the case,
though it insisted that executives had merely given a political donation to
Mr Honma, whose resignation was accepted by the Miyagi prefectural assembly
yesterday.
Executives from five of Japan's largest contractors have been arrested in
the past three months, and the scandal has forced the government to review
the selection process for public works contracts.
But Construction Ministry officials say the unfolding scandal could slow the
award of construction projects commissioned under the government spending
packages intended to stimulate a weakening economy.
Prosecutors appear to be shifting their investigation to national
politicians with close ties to the construction industry, particularly
members of the Liberal Democratic party and ex-members of the party who
joined the government coalition of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa.

ABOUT 30 Israelis were injured yesterday when a Palestinian suicide bomber
drove a car laden with explosives into a bus near the West Bank settlement
of Beit El.
The dead bomber, identified as 20-year-old Kamal Bani Odeh from the West
Bank village of Tamoun, was said by Israeli military officials to have
belonged to the Hamas Islamic resistance movement. He had been wanted by the
army for more than a year, for the alleged stabbing of an Israeli civilian.
The bombing, which followed three failed suicide attacks by Hamas activists
in the past month, came in the wake of a series of Israeli army operations
in the occupied territories targeting Hamas members and other radical
Palestinians opposed to the Israeli-PLO autonomy accord. There have been
about three dozen arrests.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, yesterday said that India
welcomed the foreign funds offered by various countries following Thursday's
devastating earthquake in Maharashtra, Shiraz Sidhva reports from New Delhi.
Visiting the region, a visibly shaken Mr Rao pledged central government aid
of Rs500m (Pounds 10.5m), saying money was 'no constraint' to rehabilitate
the victims of the disaster. The government's immediate priority, he added,
was to rebuild the flattened villages at safer sites.
The Maharashtra state government is planning to ask for a Rs2bn loan from
the World Bank for rebuilding houses. The bank will send a team of surveyors
to assess the damage.
The government's initial reluctance to accept foreign aid was set aside when
the scale of the disaster became apparent. Officials in New Delhi say the
government hopes foreign donors will contribute those relief items the
country could not itself provide, such as X-ray plates.
'We have been able to (fulfil) the immediate demand for food, blankets, and
medicine, and we have thousands of medical volunteers and relief workers
ready to help,' said a member of the government's crisis management group in
New Delhi yesterday. 'But we have allowed supplies from foreign agencies
because we realise the task is more daunting than we had earlier
anticipated.'
Offers of aid have been received from the United Nations, the west as well
as from Iran and even Pakistan, which set aside the traditional enmity
between the two countries. Millions of rupees are being collected in India.
Estimates of the death toll in the earthquake range from 10,000 to 30,000.
In the quake-hit area, army rescue teams scrambled through endless piles of
debris, continuing their search for the dead for the fifth consecutive day,
their task made difficult by bad weather and onlookers who poured into the
worst-affected areas.

Taiwan's annual economic growth is expected to slow to an average 6 per cent
in the five years up to 1997 as the island's export-led boom cools down,
according to the government's Bureau of Statistics, Reuter reports from
Taipei.
'Slower growth will be mainly due to curbs on government spending, which is
expected to show zero growth in real terms, compared with an average 8.9 per
cent in the previous five years,' a bureau official said yesterday.
Gross national product expanded at an annual rate of 10 per cent in 1983-87
and 6.7 per cent in 1988-92. Between 1952 and 1990 it grew at an average of
nearly 9 per cent.

This followed talks last Friday with Mr Khieu Samphan, Khmer Rouge

coalition government, elected in a United Nations-organised poll in May.
Earlier, the group had asked for an advisory post in the new administration,

its 10,000 hard-core guerrillas.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Pakistan poll looks unlikely to settle score: Bhutto leads
contest where winning votes is only half the battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN goes to the polls tomorrow in its third general election in five
years with the leaders of the main parties both claiming victory is in their
sights.
But independent observers believe Ms Benazir Bhutto, prime minister between
1988 and 1990, has an edge over Mr Nawaz Sharif, her successor who was
forced to resign in July after a prolonged political crisis.
However, Ms Bhutto's lead could be so thin that her Pakistan People's Party
(PPP) may find it difficult to form a stable government. A poll published by
Newsline, a weekly magazine, gave the PPP 34 per cent of the vote against 31
per cent for Mr Sharif's Moslem League and 9 per cent for the Pakistan
Islamic Front, an alliance of Islamic parties.
Other estimates suggest Ms Bhutto could win 70 to 80 seats in the 217-seat
National Assembly - more than Mr Sharif but not enough for a majority.
Pakistanis are less interested in the outcome than in the last two
elections, which came after 11 years of military dictatorship under General
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq. Gen Zia's death unleashed hopes that Pakistan might
quickly evolve into a stable democracy - hopes which generated enormous
enthusiasm and which have since been dashed.
Politics since his demise have been dominated by conflicts within the
three-cornered establishment which rules Pakistan - the prime minister, the
army and the president. These conflicts brought down Ms Bhutto's government
in 1990 and this year destroyed that of Mr Sharif. 'I'm not going to waste
time voting. I'm going to work,' says an Islamabad businessman.
Ms Bhutto and Mr Sharif do not differ greatly on policy. Their economic
options are limited by serious current account and government deficits: they
largely accept the austerity measures of Mr Moeen Qureshi, the caretaker
prime minister, who has sought emergency funds from the International
Monetary Fund.
On foreign policy, Ms Bhutto seems more committed than Mr Sharif to solving
the dispute over Pakistan's nuclear programme which has soured relations
with the west; but Mr Sharif is no isolationist. Meanwhile, both want to
reduce the president's powers via a constitutional amendment.
However, the two leaders' styles are utterly different. Ms Bhutto, daughter
of Mr Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the populist prime minister of the 1970s executed
by Gen Zia, has inherited her father's oratorial ability. Tall and elegant,
she is treated like a queen by her most loyal supporters. At a rally last
week in the southern province of Sind, her home territory, she was presented
with a gold crown.
Mr Sharif does better in the backrooms of politics than on the campaign
platform. He made his name as a businessman and powerbroker in his home base
of Punjab, the largest and richest province, and won Gen Zia's attention
with his skill in the murky financial dealings which underlie Pakistan's
politics.
The campaigns have not been short of vitriol, including charges of
corruption, murder and terrorism. Ms Bhutto accuses Mr Sharif of abusing
power almost as much as General Zia. Mr Sharif retorts that he stands for
'democracy not dynasty' - a reference to the Bhutto family's domination of
the PPP. Mr Qureshi's interim government has added spice by publishing names
of loan defaulters to highlight abuses by the rich and famous.
Ms Bhutto is riding the crest of a wave largely of Mr Sharif's making. Just
last year, her support seemed at its nadir when PPP protest marches fizzled
out. Mr Sharif appeared to be firmly in power, working closely with
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and with military leaders who seemed content to
take a back seat. But the delicate power balances collapsed when the army
chief of staff died suddenly and Mr Sharif and Mr Ishaq Khan quarrelled over
appointing a successor.
The arguments escalated into a bitter struggle in which each tried to curb
the other's power. The president dissolved the National Assembly in April
only to be overruled by the Supreme Court. Eventually, the army generals
urged both the prime minister and the president to resign.
Mr Sharif has lost the military and bureaucratic establishment's backing.
But he is not without resources: he has money and professional managers and
the support of big business. His party appeals to many middle-class
Pakistanis. Moreover, he has made political capital out of the fact that Ms
Bhutto, for all her democratic ideology, co-operated with the president when
he tried to dissolve the National Assembly.
Ms Bhutto is the beneficiary of all the turmoil. On the campaign trail she
behaves like a leader who feels confident of returning to the prime
minister's office. But as she knows from her own experience and from Mr
Sharif's more recent travails, winning an election is only half the game.
The other half begins once the votes are counted.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Yeltsin pulls army into political ring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS an irony that Mr Boris Yeltsin relied so heavily on the army to
prevail over his enemies yesterday - an army which had desperately tried to
stay out of Russia's political battles.
Only two weeks ago, General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, warned of
disaster if the army were drawn into politics.
But when police and Interior Ministry troops fled from the rag-tag army who
broke out of the White House on Sunday, Mr Yeltsin had only the army to turn
to.
'I am not surprised by the support he received because the army's conditions
had considerably improved in recent times,' says Professor Sergei
Blagovolin, a defence expert at Moscow's Institute for National Security and
Strategic Studies.
'But I am surprised by the fact that support was so unanimous.' By
increasing officers' pay and touring key garrisons outside Moscow, Mr
Yeltsin had done a certain amount of homework before using the army.
But more than anything else, the success of Mr Yeltsin's desperate gamble
depended on the speed with which elite troops moved to crush the rebellion
in the White House.
At his disposal were the paratroopers from the 77th Guards airborne division
in Pskov and the 106th from Tula, as well as the Kantemir artillery
division, which is a four-hour tank drive from Moscow.
Any protracted conflict in Moscow would have given army commanders more time
for doubt. That was precisely what the disgraced vice-president, Gen
Alexander Rutskoi, had banked on when he ordered his detachments to seize
key points in the city.
In the event, Gen Alexander Lebed, the ambitious commander of Russian forces
in the breakaway enclave of Dnestr, was the only senior officer to publicly
express doubt in Mr Yeltsin's ability to override the crisis as he did. But
he went no further than suggesting that Russia's regional leaders should
take power in their hands.
Mr Rutskoi may have complained at a press conference only hours before the
onslaught that Mr Yeltsin would be held responsible for the destruction of
the army and the fact that it could no longer defend the motherland.
But it was Mr Rutskoi, a former Afghan war veteran who saw himself as the
country's saviour, who pushed Russia to the brink of civil war by making a
last pitch for power.
'He was nothing but a puppet who was manipulated by pro-communist forces,'
said Nikolai, a major in the air force where Mr Rutskoi made his mark. 'They
thought the army would follow him.
'But more than anything else, the army is afraid of the country falling
apart,' he added, as he stopped along the Moscow River to watch the storming
of the White House. 'It has stopped believing rival politicians' promises
they would do a better job defending the army's interests.'
Popular memories of Russia's own murderous civil war in 1918-20, as well as
of the disgrace of officers who supported the failed coup against President
Mikhail Gorbachev, were an added incentive for officers to keep their heads
down.
But another lesson of the 1991 coup, which Mr Yeltsin must now act on, is to
capitalise on his victory and move ahead quickly with reforms, including
sweeping reform of the army.
The fact that only officers manned the tanks and armoured personnel carriers
at the White House underlined Kremlin leaders' preference for a professional
army instead of its big unwieldy conscript force. But moves to cut the
2m-strong force to a 1.5m semi-professional army, and to stop it from
meddling in the affairs of other former Soviet republics, will require
level-headed management of the army by the civilians. Although conscripts
were present, President Yeltsin's military adviser, Gen Dmitry Volkogonov,
said the White House operation was planned to 'prevent the deaths of Russian
18-year-old conscripts'.
The pace of the assault on the White House was also slowed to minimise a
loss of life among the anti-terrorist Spetznaz troops who were the first
into the parliament building yesterday.
The Russian army has traditionally played a crucial role in Russian history.
'In truth what is it that has essentially upheld Russian statehood? Not only
but exclusively the army,' said Sergei Witte, Russia's prime minister at the
beginning of the 20th cen-tury.
But at a time when the country faces dire financial straits and restlessness
among its regions, its masters are rightly keen to use the world's most
powerful standing army with care.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Assault tactics puzzle experts - Western
military surprised by number of troops used and timescale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILITARY experts were puzzled yesterday by the tactics used in the assault
against Moscow's parliament building.
Despite the success of the operation, they said they would have expected a
much larger force to be deployed to ensure a quick result.
They were surprised that no attempt was made to set up a security cordon to
keep crowds back and allow forces to take over the White House unimpeded.
Instead, bystanders were allowed to come between the firing line and the
building.
About 500-700 troops were thought to have been involved in clearing the
building itself, with about 1,000 more - two battalions' worth - in the
immediate vicinity.
Armoured vehicles from crack airborne units, which could have ferried forces
in by helicopter, were not sighted until late in the proceedings.
Perhaps most astonishing was the apparently hasty preparation. Tanks did not
come with their ammunition loaded, as would normally be the case.
According to western experts, the operation relied mainly on two divisions,
with tanks from the 4th Guards tank division and armoured personnel carriers
from the 2nd Guards motor rifle division. Both these divisions were deployed
during the abortive 1991 coup. Mr Yeltsin has credited them with refusing to
attack the parliament building on that occasion.
Also involved were elements of the Interior Ministry Dzerzhinsky division,
the 27th motor rifle brigade, as well as the Kremlin Guard, which reinforced
its positions on Sunday night, and elite army special units, employed in the
storming of the White House.
Experts saw several possible explanations for what they described as the
'unusual' nature of the operation:
An effort to keep casualties down, partly in response to international
pressures. However, one expert pointed out: 'It is not necessarily a good
way of minimising casualties to attack a building with an insufficient
force.'
Concern about stirring up the civilian population.
An indication that Mr Yeltsin did not have many reliable units to call on.
Hasty preparation could suggest that initial plans for storming the building
had to be substituted. Most senior military figures are thought to have been
extremely reluctant to become involved in the politicalstruggle.
Experts believe the scenes in Moscow may have built up resentment in the
military against Mr Yeltsin's handling of the crisis.
They also believe it may be harder for him to count on military support as
he confronts regional demands for autonomy.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Eastern Europe looks on without the old
fears - No longer directly affected, countries of the former Soviet bloc see
President Yeltsin as democracy's best hope
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE tremors from power struggles in Moscow have traditionally radiated far
beyond the confines of the Kremlin and been monitored with a mixture of hope
and fear in east and central Europe.
This time too, anxious spectators have been glued to live television and
radio reports of events around the Moscow White House. But this time it is
different.
For the first time in five decades the peoples of former communist Europe
have been watching as voyeurs rather than potential participants in a drama
whose outcome could immediately threaten their own existence. For
politicians, businessmen and ordinary citizens, the travails of the new
Russia are looked on with understanding more than fear, and Russia is seen
more as a long-term trade partner than a potential enemy.
Yesterday, east and central European leaders joined those from the west in
expressing support for Mr Boris Yeltsin, as democracy's best hope.
Czech President Vaclav Havel said: 'It is a clash between those who seek
democracy and those who have decided to fight under the red flag and at the
cost of bloodshed and victims to reinstall the old order.'
Ukraine strongly condemned the 'irresponsible and adventurist' Russian
parliament and appealed to the Russian people to support the government and
'prevent the reversal of democratic reforms'.
It was very different in August 1991. When the anti-Gorbachev forces set out
to restore the essentials of the old Soviet empire, both the Soviet Union
and the Soviet Communist party still existed. Thousands of Soviet troops
remained in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia as well as former East
Germany.
At that point a victory for the old communist forces could still have led to
a new chill in relations with the west and, perhaps, a new attempt to
reassert some form of Soviet control over the former east bloc.
Yet such a restoration would have been beyond the powers of those who filed
out of the White House yesterday afternoon after failing to wrest power from
President Yeltsin. Russia without the Baltic states, Belarus, and above all
Ukraine and the central Asian states, is not the same as the Soviet Union.
It is still huge and unwieldly, and needs a new constitutional arrangement
to give a more flexible federal structure. But it is no longer the
threatening Soviet bear.
Mr Jozsef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister, yesterday declared his
support for Mr Yeltsin. He went on to reassure Hungarians, who fought their
own bloody revolt against Soviet rule in 1956, of his conviction that 'no
problem would arise which would mean the victory of the forces of
restoration or some such crisis which would affect the whole world'.
At the same time, however, he said continuing instability in the east
highlighted the need for Hungary and other former communist states in
central Europe to be fully integrated into a wider European Community and
Nato.
The sight of fighting in the streets of Moscow also revived nervousness in
Warsaw, where a week earlier voters had been sufficiently nonchalant about
any communist danger from the east to support former communist-era parties
at the general elections.
'What happens if the armed forces in the Kaliningrad region decide to march
home to take part in the conflict? One of their possible routes lies through
Poland,' one commentator worried aloud on Polish television on Sunday.
But Mr Aleksander Kwasniewski, the leader of the Democratic Left Alliance
was quick to tell the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper that his party was not
interested in supporting anyone 'who wants to rebuild Russia's imperial
traditions'.
'We are for democracy, a free market and integration with Europe, and it is
in this light that we will assess the changes in Russia' he said.
In the same paper Mr Bronislaw Geremek, leader of the Democratic Union
mainstream Solidarity party, warned that the events in Moscow marked 'an
enormous threat to European security'; in the circumstances, the west
'should not support just anyone who was able to restore order in Moscow but.
. . the most important thing was that the democratic reforms in Russia
should continue'.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: IMF loan may be delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE latest developments in Moscow have left the International Monetary Fund
more uncertain than ever about whether it will be able to resume financial
support for economic reform in Russia, writes Peter Norman, Economics
Editor.
Yesterday, officials in Washington were trying to establish what had
happened to the IMF office in Moscow after reports that it had come under
fire.
More worrying were the implications for the future. Ten days ago, Mr Michel
Camdessus, the IMF managing director, put a brave face on events in Russia
and held out hope that Mr Boris Yeltsin's government would be able to step
up the process of economic reform sufficiently to qualify for a Dollars
1.5bn (Pounds 970m) payment early next year.
But after a visit by IMF economists to Moscow, the fund's view is that plans
already announced for subsidy cuts and controls over credit and the central
bank are insufficient.
Whether Mr Yeltsin's government will be able to turn policy into practice is
also an open question.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: West backs Russian leader's action
</HEADLINE>

WESTERN leaders rallied behind President Boris Yeltsin yesterday, pledging
their continuing support for the Russian leader after the surrender of his
opponents in Moscow.
The US found no fault with the suppression of the Moscow revolt. The
operation in Moscow had been 'strategically planned and tactically executed
so as to minimise the loss of life', said Mr Strobe Talbott, in charge of
policy towards the former Soviet Union at the State Department. Mr Warren
Christopher, the secretary of state, may go to Moscow later this month to
demonstrate the 'business as usual' US approach. Earlier, Ms Dee Dee Myers,
the White House spokeswoman, said President Bill Clinton, who is in
California, stood 'four square' behind President Yeltsin. 'Democratic
governments have to defend themselves against force and clearly that's what
Yeltsin has done.'
In Luxembourg, the European Community backed Mr Yeltsin with an agreement in
principle to hold an EC-Russia summit in November and to accelerate efforts
to reach a new bilateral trade agreement by the end of the year.
The strategy, agreed at a meeting of EC foreign ministers, rests on
strengthening political support for pro-democracy forces in the run-up to
Russia's parliamentary elections scheduled to take place in December,
Brussels officials said. 'We are putting our money on the Yeltsin horse,'
said one diplomat, 'because we have not got any other horse'.
Britain, France and Germany led the push for Mr Yeltsin at the Luxembourg
gathering yesterday. A joint statement deplored the loss of life in Moscow,
but declared that 'elements hostile to the democratisation forces in Russia'
carried 'a heavy responsibility for having deliberately provoked violence in
the Russian parliament and in different parts of the capital'.
In Bonn, Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, said Mr Yeltsin had his
'full sympathy and support'. He identified a 'vital interest of Germany and
the west in a continuation of the democratic reform process in Russia, as
embodied by President Yeltsin'.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said in London: 'There should be
no doubt that he (Yeltsin) has our total and unequivocal support for the
action that he has taken.' He was speaking after talks with Mr Boris Pankin,
the Russian ambassador.
The Japanese government expressed full support for the reform aims of Mr
Yeltsin, who is due to visit Tokyo next week. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign
minister, said Mr Yeltsin's reform efforts 'must not be blocked, and Japan's
support for his efforts will be unchanged'.
China was the only important power not to back Mr Yeltsin, painstakingly
avoiding taking sides. 'We are deeply concerned about the recent bloodshed
in Moscow,' the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.
At the Luxembourg meeting of EC foreign ministers yesterday, Sir Leon
Brittan, EC commissioner for external affairs, urged ministers to be more
flexible in trade negotiations with Russia so that a deal could be wrapped
up by the end of the year. The EC underlined yesterday it would want to
discuss with Russia security issues and prospects for Nato enlargement, as
well as bilateral trade at the proposed summit in November.
Mr Yeltsin considers a trade and political co-operation pact with the EC to
be a big prize, but talks stalled during the summer over several Russian
demands which Brussels considers unrealistic. These include Mr Yeltsin's
wish for the same treatment as emerging democracies in eastern Europe, such
as Poland and the Czech Republic, rather than as a 'state trading' country
such as China or North Korea, whose exports can be restricted under
so-called safeguard clauses.

MR GEOFF RHODES, British Airways manager in Moscow, spent yesterday lying on
the floor of his office. Above him, snipers on top of the 20-storey
Mezhdunarodnya building exchanged fire with artillery on the ground.
Despite the disruption to business, however, foreign companies were
cautiously optimistic about the situation yesterday. They also emphasised
that operations outside the Russian capital were largely unaffected.
The UK computer company International Computers (ICL), which has been
operating in Russia for 25 years, said the expectation among staff and
customers was that the situation would soon return to normal. Emergency
plans to evacuate staff were in place, but things would have to get 'very
much worse' before they were implemented, ICL said.
The German chemicals group BASF, which has its office very close to the
White House, said its 40 staff had stayed away yesterday. However, work on
its two joint ventures in Siberia went on as usual.
BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco giant, said: 'We have a staff of 30 in
the city, but we have not taken any steps yet to pull them out. They are all
staying in their homes for the time being and appear to be safe there.'
Flights in and out of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport were unaffected, BA
reported yesterday. Russian airspace, the main air corridor between Europe
and Japan, was still open.
However, BA staff at the airport were staying at nearby hotels last night
rather than risk returning to their homes in the city.
One western oil company executive said in London yesterday that production
was normal at the company's operations in western Siberia. 'We're just
carrying out business as usual,' he said. 'We're in Russia for the long term
and believe the government will overcome its present problems.'
Most companies said their financial exposure to Russia was strictly limited.
The engineering contractor Trafalgar House, which has large contracts with
the Russian government, said all its Russian business was covered by advance
funding. ICL said that on a worst case, the investment it stood to lose in
Russia was only Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m.

WORLD financial markets appeared yesterday to put their faith in the
relative stability offered by President Yeltsin, although most trading was
still cautious.
'People took the view that Yeltsin would win even if it meant flattening the
White House,' said Mr Julian Jessop of Midland Global Markets.
The D-Mark, the currency most at risk from any turmoil in Russia, recovered
an early loss of around two pfennigs on Far East markets to close later in
London at DM1.6240 against the dollar.
European government bond markets, which normally thrive in a climate of
political stability, rose across the board. Stock markets also edged higher.
German government bonds moved higher, with the bund futures contract for
December ending 0.20 points higher at around 99.00.
Gold rose sharply at the opening in London, but plunged later under pressure
from US selling inspired by the belief that Russia's turmoil was ending. It
closed down Dollars 2.45 at Dollars 352.75.
European equity markets were relatively unperturbed in early trading but
rose as Mr Yeltsin was perceived to be regaining control.

THE Security Council yesterday extended by six months the mandate of UN
troops in the former Yugoslavia and tenuously linked the lifting of
sanctions against Belgrade to enactment of a peace plan in Croatia, Reuter
reports from New York.
The resolution was adopted by a unanimous vote, including Russia which had
previously objected to the measures. The Council warned nations of 'serious
consequences' if they interfered in Croatia, a reference to any military
supplies Belgrade might deliver to fellow Serbs.
Meanwhile, fresh clashes erupted in north-west Bosnia yesterday after forces
loyal to local Moslem leader Fikret Abdic tried to wrest control of Bosnian
army positions in the isolated Bihac region.

GERMANY is pressing for rapid acceleration of the negotiations with Austria,
Finland, Sweden and Norway to join the European Community if the goal of
accession by January 1 1995 is to be met.
The fear in Bonn is that if the negotiations are not concluded by the end of
February, 1994, it will be impossible to conclude ratification formalities
through the European parliament, and all the individual national
parliaments, by the end of the year.
The danger will then be that the whole enlargement process will slip back to
1996 or even 1997 and political momentum lost, according to officials.
The urgency of the enlargement timetable is such that Bonn believes
far-reaching institutional reforms of the EC, to streamline its activities,
should be postponed until the next full-scale inter-governmental conference
on political union in 1996.
Both Paris and London, as well as many politicians in Germany, are concerned
that the enlarged community will become hopelessly unwieldy and incapable of
taking decisions without institutional reforms. They would include reduction
in the size of the European Commission and the European Court, and
overhauling the current six-monthly rotation of the EC presidency.
Ideas for streamlining the commission to just 10 members, and similarly
reducing the size of the European court, have been floated in Paris and
Bonn. However the thinking now in Germany is that it will be impossible to
reach political agreement on such a drastic move in the next five months.
Another key element in the reform debate - probably the most contentious
issue of all - is the future weighting of votes in the EC Council of
Ministers, between the large member states, like Britain, France, Germany
and Italy, and the smaller ones. The enlarged community will reduce the
ability of the Big Three to prevent decisions they do not like.

SWEDEN'S centre-right government yesterday announced a big package of
corporate tax reforms designed to encourage business expansion and lower a
record 13 per cent unemployment rate.
Under the proposals, to be put to parliament later this month, the basic
rate of corporate tax will fall 2 points to 28 per cent, taxes on dividends
from Swedish companies will be scrapped for Swedish residents, and capital
gains tax on equities will be halved to 12.5 per cent. Tax rules for small
non-incorporated businesses will also change to bring about lower rates on
capital yields and retained profits.
'The idea is to make it profitable to expand businesses and to start new
businesses,' said Mr Bo Lundgren, deputy finance minister. 'We are taking
away obstacles to growth.'
With the budget deficit set to rise next year to 15 per cent of gross
domestic product, the changes are to be fully financed. Just over half the
SKr3.3bn (Pounds 273m) cost of the tax cuts - to take effect from next
January - has already been accounted for in the 1993-94 budget. The balance
will be financed mainly by raising employer contributions from 30 per cent
of employees' salary to 30.2 per cent and partly by cuts in individual tax
allowances for days spent working abroad.
The package is the most far-reaching change in the corporate tax regime
since 1991 when the then Social Democratic government cut the basic
corporate tax rate from 52 per cent to 30 and largely dismantled an
elaborate system of tax write-offs.
The Social Democrats, now in opposition, persuaded the present government
last year to postpone the reforms because of the severe pressure the
recession has placed on welfare programmes. But Mr Lundgren said he was
confident parliament would approve the proposals.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Miners turn meaning of Solidarity on its head: Poland's last
government has passed on a nightmare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEN sprawled across the entrance hall of Poland's coal mining industry
headquarters in Katowice know they have their backs to the wall.
But these striking coal-miners from Zory, a town of 60,000 inhabitants south
of Katowice in southern Poland, look set to present the future Polish
government with its first headache - an unresolved dispute inherited from
the outgoing government of Ms Hanna Suchocka.
They are demanding that promises of new jobs in mines elsewhere, which were
made last winter in the wake of a three-week stoppage, be honoured.
Alternatively they want the planned closure of their loss-making coking coal
pit by 1995 slowed or substantial redundancy benefits paid for two years.
The coalition government, defeated in elections on September 19, failed to
satisfy their demands. These were triggered again when the first 250
redundancies were announced last week.
Now their protest threatens to spread as miners take over other management
buildings in an attempt to paralyse the industry.
The dispute is the first big test for the next - left-of-centre - government
coalition, now in its birth throes as the Polish Peasant party (PSL) and the
former communist Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) search for a consensus on
policy and cabinet posts.
The Zory dismissals are the first of a series planned to bring the number of
miners down to 200,000 toward the end of the century from its present
320,000, matching falling output from 178m tonnes in 1989 to an expected
124m tonnes this year.
The proposed cuts challenge a favoured workforce that has traditionally been
at the top of wage scales and, in the late 1970s and 1980s, had guaranteed
access to western consumer goods as a reward for working a six-day week.
The strike could prove a stiff test for the SLD which has a massive
faultline running down its 171-strong caucus in the 460-seat parliament. As
many as 61 of those SLD deputies owe allegiance to the OPZZ, a trade union
federation established in the 1980s under the auspices of the then ruling
Communists, and which has won a measure of credibility, in opposition, in
the past four years. This was when its rival, the Solidarity union, sought
at massive political cost to itself to defuse shop-floor protests as it
protected the reforming government's tight money policies.
Now the roles are reversed as the SLD leadership adopts the reformist
language of the new era, partly through conviction and partly because it
knows it has to retain credibility with the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank.
Pay protests last spring led to the fall of the outgoing government and
there is a queue of groups ready to renew their assault on a threadbare
budget.
The miners playing table tennis in the corridors and cards in the
headquarter's conference rooms are non-committal about any new government.
'We are trade unionists and so we don't get involved in politics,' says Mr
Ryszard Jaston, Zory's Solidarity leader whose rag-tag army is well versed
in the art of protest. The strikes in 1980 to win trade union rights, then
against martial law in the bitterly cold winter of 1981 and again in 1988
for Solidarity, are emblazoned on the Zory pit's battle standards.
The strike by the 2,500 miners still employed at the pit and the occupation
of the industry headquarters is being led by Solidarity. But it is also
backed by the Contra union linked to the populist Confederation for an
Independent Poland (KPN) party. The KPN scraped into parliament on September
19 with 5.8 per cent of the national vote and 22 seats. But the party is
strong among miners and won 18 per cent of the vote in the town of Zory
itself against Solidarity's 3.4 per cent.
The SLD also performed strongly, winning a 19 per cent share of the vote in
Zory. Nevertheless the local branch of the OPZZ has failed to back the
protest, even though Ms Ewa Spychalska, the tough and canny national head of
the 4.5m-strong movement and an SLD deputy, has said 'we back the miners'
and many of her members are occupying the headquarters.
The dispute should help Solidarity, which just failed to win the 5 per cent
of the national vote needed to get into parliament, repair its frayed
credibility. Its national leader, Mr Marian Krzaklewski, has already said
his movement will be 'more radical' than before in pursuing its demands.
Indeed he talks of 'using all legal means to speed new elections'.
Whatever government is installed in the next few weeks in Poland, its
freedom of manoeuvre will be limited. One question is whether the miners'
mood, once the hopes the elections have engendered are dashed, will turn to
one of anger or apathy.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Warning on EC pensions compromise: Restrictions may damage
industry and raise costs says trade association
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EC MEMBER states are moving towards a compromise on liberalisation of
pension funds which could damage the industry and increase the cost of
labour and pensions, according to the pension funds' trade association.
The measure, which would affect 83 per cent of the Ecu1,000bn (Pounds 766bn)
of assets in European pension funds, was originally intended to open up
cross-border investment and management of funds.
But the European Federation for Retirement Provision yesterday warned that
the EC risked adopting 'a counter-productive and restrictive directive'.
'You have to query whether it's worth having a directive at all if it's one
with restrictive norms,' said Mr Philip Lambert, chairman of the EFRP and
general manager of Unilever's pension funds in the Netherlands.
The federation claims that a working group of national officials, appointed
in June to re-examine the draft directive, is diluting the measure, despite
objections from countries such as the Netherlands and the UK,which have
large funded pension schemes.
For example, the draft would abolish requirements for pension funds to
invest a minimum of their capital in certain categories of assets, such as
government bonds.
The EFRP has welcomed this move, but believes EC countries will be able to
get round the obligation easily because maximum limits are not outlawed.
Some member states, such as Italy and France, also want to maintain or
strengthen strict limits on the proportion of assets which can be invested
in currencies other than that of the fund's home country.
The measure should be discussed by ministers at one of the two internal
market councils to be held before the end of this year.
Officials from Belgium, which holds the EC presidency until January, said
yesterday that a general 'willingness to compromise' existed on the
directive.
The Belgium presidency has called a pensions funds working group meeting
today.

FT  05 OCT 93 / German new car sales set for further 5% fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales in Germany are likely to fall by a further 5 per cent in 1994
after a slump of more than 20 per cent this year, according to the
influential Ifo economics institute.
In real terms, this means the first-time registration of 2.8m-2.9m new cars
compared with 3m this year and 3.9m in 1992, when recession struck and the
unification boom ran out of steam.
The continuing fall marks a further stage in the normalisation of the
domestic market which was distorted by pent-up demand in the former GDR.
Many east Germans bought new cars after unification in late 1990, while
western Germans replaced their old models earlier than normal to take
advantage of higher prices for second-hand vehicles.
The 1992 figures were also boosted by a buying surge last November and
December before an increase from 14 to 15 per cent in value added tax on
January 1 this year.
But next year's sales will also be hit by a sharp increase in fuel taxes,
the institute said. Government levies on petrol and diesel fuel are to rise
by 16 pfennigs and 7 pfennigs a litre next January.
Rising unemployment and lower disposable incomes will also take their toll.
The annual German wages round, due to start in the next few weeks, is widely
expected to result in awards at or below next year's expected inflation rate
of 3.5 per cent.
The forecast supports the widespread view that German economic recovery,
next year at least, will depend on improved exports rather than any rise in
domestic demand.
According to Ifo, replacement purchases in western Germany this year will
fall by only 4 per cent to 1.04m cars. However, growth in overall car
ownership dropped almost 50 per cent to fewer than 400,000 vehicles in the
first half.
Industry executives do not expect a return to 'normal' market conditions in
Germany and abroad before mid-1995.
West German industrial production increased by a seasonally adjusted 2 per
cent in August against July, Ariane Genillard adds from Bonn.
The largest increase was in capital goods, which rose by 4.5 per cent.
Manufacturing went up 2 per cent and the construction sector by 3 per cent,
according to the Economics Ministry.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Fall in steel use forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMPTION of steel in the industrialised countries will fall by 3 per cent
this year to 297m tonnes, reflecting sharp declines in the European
Community and Japanese markets, according to the International Iron and
Steel Institute, Andrew Baxter reports.
Consumption in the EC, excluding eastern Germany, is expected to fall by
nearly 9m tonnes or 8 per cent from the 1992 level, and will recover by only
3m tonnes in 1994, the institute said yesterday.
In Japan, it is expected to fall by 3m tonnes or 4 per cent this year, with
a further decline seen next year.
The decline reflects the recession in many steel-consuming industries, and
is offset by a predicted 5 per cent rise in developing countries'
consumption to 135m tonnes this year.
Overall, consumption in the western world - industrialised and developing
countries - is forecast to fall by 1 per cent this year to 432m tonnes, and
to rise by 2.7 per cent next year to 443m tonnes. Total world consumption is
predicted to fall by 1 per cent this year to 611m tonnes.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Hopes fade for Madrid pay pact: Angry union leaders threaten
'mobilisation' in attempt to shift government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOUBTS are growing in Madrid that the Spanish government, the two main trade
unions and the country's main employer federation can reach agreement on a
much vaunted three-year wage moderation pact.
Following his narrow election victory last June, Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez made the achievement of a 'pacto social' - agreement on wages,
pensions and labour market reform - central to his efforts to help the
economy recover from recession.
But in three weeks of carefully structured talks before the 1994 budget was
presented to parliament last Thursday, precious little headway had been
made. The government, frustrated by the lack of progress on pension
increases, civil service pay and unemployment benefits, simply put its own
figures in the budget and now says these are not alterable.
The budget figures include a civil service pay freeze next year, cuts in
benefits and a less generous calculation of the way pension increases will
take place next year.
Angry union leaders have already threatened 'mobilisation' programmes to
scare the government into softening its stance on some of these policies as
the budget makes its way through parliament between now and the end of the
year.
Yesterday the three sides began a second phase of talks aimed at securing a
three-year public and private sector wages agreement and a sweeping reform
of many of Spain's rigid old labour laws that make it one of the most
expensive places in Europe to fire people.
Foreign investors, who in the past few months have invested heavily in the
bond markets on hopes of Spain achieving this social pact and, consequently,
being able to bring down interest rates, are watching this round of talks
very carefully.
But some senior government officials believe that the atmosphere has been so
soured by the failure of the pre-budget talks that there is little hope of
agreement being reached.
The government believes it may no longer need a wages deal to stave off
further pressure on the peseta. The economy is likely to begin growing again
next year, according to budget forecasts, and the markets have been
impressed with a budget promise of a real fall (1.3 per cent) in central
government spending next year.

FT  05 OCT 93 / UK steelmakers question aid plan for Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH steel industry officials are mounting a campaign to force changes in
a European Commission-backed restructuring scheme for Sidenor, the
loss-making Spanish special steels producer.
Mr Ian Rodgers, director for international affairs at the British Iron and
Steel Producers Association (Bispa), will today launch a strong attack on
the plan, which he claims would harm private unsubsidised competitors and
is, anyway, not viable.
The Commission had hoped that the restructuring of Sidenor, along with that
of Freital in Germany, would be approved at the last EC industry ministers'
meeting in Brussels on September 21.
Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, wanted the two relatively
minor subsidy cases resolved to send a clear signal of intent to reach a
solution on the larger cases - involving CSI in Spain, Ilva in Italy and
Ekostahl in eastern Germany.
But the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark and France said they wanted more time
to study the proposals, and the UK argued that all the subsidy cases should
be agreed together.
Since then, UES Steels, a private competitor of Sidenor, has announced it is
closing its Templeborough plant in Rotherham, northern England, with the
loss of 260 jobs. UES blamed excess capacity for engineering steels, which
was being artificially kept in place by state subsidies. Mr Rodgers says the
Commission had made no attempt to reassess the viability of the Sidenor
scheme, drawn up last year, in the light of present market conditions and
Sidenor's recent operating performance.
He is expected to tell a meeting of the European coal and steel community
consultative committee in Luxembourg today that the amount of aid proposed
has increased by 13 per cent to Pta80bn (Pounds 406m) since the plan was
drawn up. According to Bispa, Sidenor's domestic turnover fell by 33 per
cent in the first half of this year, and orders in export markets are being
won as a result of 'ruthless' price cutting that has only been made possible
by subsidies.
The association says sales targets assumed in Sidenor's 'viability' plan are
unachievable without further price cutting, and says the next industry
ministers' meeting in November should not authorise aid without significant
additional closures.

WEST German industrial production increased by a seasonally adjusted 2 per
cent in August against July.
The largest increase was in capital goods, which rose by 4.5 per cent.
Manufacturing went up 2 per cent and the construction sector by 3 per cent,
according to the economics ministry.
However, output for the two months of July and August remained unchanged
compared with May-June. German economists pointed out that while foreign
demand, mostly from the US and Asia, was picking up, domestic orders
continued to decrease.
They warned that the energy tax planned for 1994 and extra burdens on
pension funds from next January, would partly dampen any upswing in domestic
demand.
Output for the two months was 6.5 per cent below the level for the same
period last year. However, this represented a slight improvement over the
months of June and July, when it stood at 6.9 per cent below the previous
year, and over May-June when it was 7.3 per cent below.

<TEXT>
THE National Democratic Party, Germany's radical right-wing party, yesterday
threw its support behind Mr Steffen Heitmann, the Christian Democratic Union
candidate in next May's presidential election.
The backing is likely to embarrass Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing CDU
which has stood behind Mr Heitmann, Saxony's justice minister, despite his
controversial remarks about Germany's past.
An NPD statement said: 'While Mr Heitmann is still a long way from taking
true nationalist positions, we can expect him to speak out on uncomfortable
truths.'
Mr Heitmann has been criticised mainly for his views on the Maastricht
treaty, which he believes is being imposed on people, his conservative views
on women and suggestions that Germans need no longer be so obsessed by the
country's Nazi past. At present he faces only one opponent - Mr Johannes
Rau, North Rhine-Westphalia's premier, who is the opposition Social
Democratic party's candidate.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Yeltsin crushes Moscow revolt: Rebel leaders jailed -
President bans opposition groups and closes newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FORCES loyal to President Boris Yeltsin took the Russian parliament
yesterday in a brutal battle that ended with many of its rebel defenders
dead and their ringleaders in jail.
The death toll remained unclear last night as a Yeltsin aide retracted a
claim of 500 dead, but dozens were reported killed and more than 100
wounded.
After the 10-hour assault by troops with tanks, sporadic shooting continued
for hours as soldiers hunted snipers in and around the shattered parliament
building, the White House.
Mr Yeltsin followed up his victory by banning a number of opposition groups,
issuing a warrant for the arrest of two of their leaders, closed several
hardline newspapers including Pravda, and imposed an overnight curfew on the
capital.
Western leaders voiced support for Mr Yeltsin, who also received backing
from the former Soviet republics of Ukraine and Belarus. President Bill
Clinton said he now expected Mr Yeltsin to build democracy and validate his
own leadership again at the ballot box.
Foreign ministers of the European Community, meeting in Luxembourg, elicited
a promise from Mr Yeltsin's office that his leading opponents would not be
harmed.
The EC ministers were drawn into the fray when Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov,
parliament's leader, and former vice-president Alexander Rutskoi voiced an
appeal to them to guarantee their safety before giving themselves up.
Mr Khasbulatov and Mr Rutskoi, stripped of his general's rank and his
vice-presidency, were driven away from parliament in a bus and herded with
others into Moscow's notorious Lefortovo jail. A Yeltsin aide said they
might face trial.
When a truce was agreed, some 300 deputies, supporters and staff filed out
of the smouldering parliament building between lines of soldiers.
Their surrender to the army's ruthless assault on the White House ended 12
days of defiance of Mr Yeltsin's decree dissolving parliament ahead of
elections to a new-style body in December.
The rebellious deputies initially won some support for their defence of the
constitution in the face of Mr Yeltsin's decree. But anti-Yeltsin groups,
including communists and nationalists, lost sympathy by launching violent
attacks on Sunday on the mayor's office and the TV centre.
Last night the 19-storey white marble parliament was left burning, with
black holes torn in its facade.
Inside parliament in the early evening, bodies still lay on the glass-strewn
floor as soldiers searched the building for pockets of resistance. Fresh
troops were sent into the area around parliament as fighting broke out from
unidentified defenders.
In the streets of Moscow around the building, which were cleared of traffic,
knots of people gathered, many of them voicing strongly anti-Yeltsin
sentiments.
In one side street, a group - unarmed - was formed into a detachment and
marched off, its leader warning them to 'watch out for the paratroopers'.
With passions still running high, gunmen early today unleashed automatic
fire on the headquarters of the Itar-Tass news agency, but troops killed one
of the attackers and arrested eight others.
Besides the two leaders of the parliamentary revolt, troops seized
ex-General Albert Makashov, the leader of Sunday night's attack on the
Ostankino television centre. They also took into custody the three 'power
ministers' appointed by parliament: Mr Viktor Barannikov, security; Mr
Vladislav Achalov, defence; and Mr Vladimir Dunayev, interior.
Mr Yeltsin, who returned to his state dacha late yesterday afternoon after
two days in the Kremlin supervising the attack, promised that leaders of the
'communist-fascist' uprising would be harshly dealt with.
His first real test of public reaction comes today, when he meets regional
leaders in the Federation Council - the body he has named to be the upper
house of a proposed new parliament, or Federal Assembly. The first reactions
from the regions were cautious, as their leaders called for order to be
maintained - although Irkutsk's council blamed the 'tragic events' on the
'irresponsible actions of both levels of power', a formula that may be
widely copied.
Mr Yeltsin has already decreed that the Federation Council must be
subordinate to him.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Uprising founders in blood and devastation: The wrecked
parliament building
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSIDE the once imposing halls and corridors, the scene was of carnage,
squalor and hideous destruction. Bullets and shells had raked the walls,
smashed down ceilings and made matchwood from doors.
With the surrender of the rebels in the White House in the late afternoon,
the wounded, some screaming in agony, were being evacuated slowly by medical
teams. In the upper chambers, firing went on as the floors were cleared.
Suddenly, a huge explosion, bigger than anything before, shook the edifice.
An ammunition dump on the ground floor had blown up - whether by design or
chance was not clear.
The bodies were still being attended to. Two men, one grasping a machine
pistol, were curled into each other on the corner of a corridor, the blood
still wet from the head and chest wounds that had killed them. Acrid smoke
hung in the low corridors, which were almost pitch black in places. Men
stumbled in shock through pools of water and blood.
From the front doors of the building, a column of surrendering deputies,
defenders and staff - many of them women - filed towards the Moscow River,
the victorious troops standing to both sides. Many of the defeated were
trembling; two of the women crying. They moved heavily and stood still when
commanded, before being loaded on to buses and driven away.
For the instigators of the revolt, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary
speaker, and Mr Alexander Rutskoi, stripped of his vice presidency, the end
was ignominious. Witnesses who met them as the troops entered the building
spoke of men breathless with fear, desperately suing for their lives.
Surrounding them, similarly distressed, were the deputies who had chosen to
stand with them, like Mr Sergei Baburin of the Russia Unity group and Mr
Oleg Rumyantsev, a former leader of the Social Democrats.
The government troops had taken the White House slowly, at an almost
leisurely pace, the T72 tanks on and under the bridge across the Moscow
River before the parliament slamming round after round into the building,
raking the windows with their machine guns. To one side, a detachment of
troops was pinned behind a wall for hours, firing at very close range into
the windows.
From 7am, when the armed personnel carriers and the light tanks moved
smartly into position around the building, until the surrender came, the
firing was constant, intense and - for the defenders - deadly. The secondary
tactic to taking the building was - as General Dmitry Volkogonov, Mr
Yeltsin's military adviser, confirmed - to avoid loss of life on the
attackers' side. This meant there were many victims within the parliament
building.
The nine-hour battle attracted a huge crowd of onlookers. The bolder ones
surged forward to near the line of fire. The more fearful hung back.
Only sporadic attempts were made by the troops to stop them getting closer.
The young soldiers manning the tanks periodically snarled at them to get
back, but the spectacle was too engrossing to make the prohibition stick.
It was clear from midday that the resistance within the White House was
barely more than token. Sporadically, a flash of fire would appear at an
upper window of the 19-storey building. Invariably, it was answered by heavy
machine gun salvos, even shells fired from tanks. Snipers from the mayor's
office, recaptured from the parliamentary side earlier, kept up steady fire
on the upper windows.
Around 5pm it was over. The taking of the White House, never dared by those
who staged the August 1991 putsch, was a hellish battle - for those who had
grievously miscalculated, or pushed their defiance too far, or who really
believed that the principles they espoused were worth facing death.
For whatever reason, many found it.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Bank deputy calls for 2.5% upper limit on inflation target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNDERLYING inflation rate of 1 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent should be
regarded as the 'true target' of Britain's counter-inflation policy, rather
than the 1-4 per cent target range announced last year, Mr Rupert
Pennant-Rea, Bank of England deputy governor, said last night.
Addressing the Cardiff Business Club, Mr Pennant-Rea, who moved from being
editor of The Economist to the deputy governor's post at the beginning of
July, said it was only through progressive reductions in the inflation rate
that people would come to believe that a new surge was not around the
corner.
Mr Pennant-Rea is known to support a more independent Bank of England and
his speech yesterday was notable for the way he unilaterally clarified a
target set by government.
In a passage that may cause some irritation among Conservative leaders in
Blackpool this week, he also gave a brutally frank assessment of how high
inflation had caused the recent recession.
'The fundamental cause of the recession we suffered in 1990-92 was not
recession elsewhere in the world, or membership of the exchange rate
mechanism, or any other diagnosis that relies on coincidence of timing,' he
said.
'We had recession in 1990-1992 because we had rising inflation in 1989-90;
and we had rising inflation in 1989-90 because we had allowed demand to grow
too rapidly in 1987-89.' A year ago, Mr Norman Lamont, as chancellor,
announced that the government intended to keep underlying inflation -
defined by the retail prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments -
within a 1 to 4 per cent range 'for the remainder of this parliament'. He
added: 'I believe that by the end of the parliament we need to be in the
lower part of the range'.
Yesterday, Mr Pennant-Rea, giving his second public speech since joining the
Bank, refined the more distant goal as a range of 1-2 1/2 per cent, and in
the process underlined that he, like Mr Eddie George, Bank governor, is a
convinced inflation fighter.
'In my view, this second bit of the target matters more than the initial 1
to 4 per cent range,' Mr Pennant-Rea said. 'It is right that 1 to 2 1/2 per
cent should shortly come to be seen as the true target, and 1996 or 1997 as
the true timetable.'
Only through lower inflation, he said, would the full benefits of stability
appear in the form of better investment decisions, greater equity between
savers and borrowers, and significantly lower long-term interest rates.
But he warned that further reductions in underlying inflation, which at
present stands at 3.1 per cent, would be difficult.
'Getting inflation down by a couple of percentage points is much harder to
achieve when the rate is already quite low than it is when inflation is at
10 per cent or so. We have had the easy bit. Now we must prepare for the
hard part,' Mr Pennant-Rea said.

FT  04 OCT 93 / People: Gaelic oils Cairn's finances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gaelic is not a language much used in the boardrooms, even of Scottish
companies, but the occasional word may soon be heard in the corridors of
Cairn Energy, the Edinburgh-based independent oil company, following the
appointment of Agnes McLeod, 33, as its new finance director.
McLeod, left, is a fluent Gaelic speaker. She joined Cairn in 1988 after
spending five years as an accountant at Lasmo, another independent oil
company.
She spent her first two years at Cairn as a financial accountant. A stint as
assistant company secretary followed, with promotion to company secretary
coming at the beginning of this year.
Her appointment trebles the ranks of women finance directors at UK oil
companies, with Liz Airey of Monument and Phoebe Wood of Arco British
leading the way.
McLeod expects to be busy in implementing the financial aspects of Cairn's
far-flung international activities in places such as Papua New Guinea and
Vietnam.
Earlier this year she played a key role in gaining shareholder approval for
Cairn's US subsidiary to issue 4m new shares for Dollars 19.7.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Mexican pact boosts wages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S government, unions and private sector signed yesterday a new social
pact whereby the budget surplus would be eliminated and wages increased
before the presidential election next August.
The pact is to raise the minimum wage by at least 15 per cent, eliminate a
formal ceiling on contractual wages, and give farmers the equivalent of
about Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.27bn) in cash. The prices of industrial fuels
and rail travel, and airport charges, are to be slashed. Corporation tax is
to be cut from 35 to 34 per cent.
The government plans to achieve all this next year with a balanced budget
and an inflation rate of 5 per cent. Exchange rate policy will be unchanged,
with the daily maximum devaluation against the US dollar kept at 0.04 pesos
(about 5 per cent a year).
A government official said the measures would help lift economic growth to
about 3.5 per cent next year, from a consensus forecast of less than 2 per
cent this year.
He said the government would use the budget surplus this year - now expected
at 1.1 per cent of GDP - to retire domestic debt.
The government will also scrap price supports for basic grains such as maize
and introduce direct cash subsidies according to the amount - and the
fertility - of land a farmer owns.

He has been attacked by fellow members of the CDU, the party of Chancellor

FT  04 OCT 93 / Israel to continue hunt for violent activists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR YITZHAK RABIN, Israel's prime minister, said last night he had instructed
the army to continue its intensified hunt for violent Palestinian activists
in the occupied territories, thus ignoring protests from the Palestine
Liberation Organisation.
Two members of the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement were killed by the army
on Saturday, in a big offensive in the Gaza Strip that prompted a letter of
complaint to Mr Rabin from Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman.
Mr Rabin said that Israeli troops would continue to target 'all terror
forces'. He added that the army and security services had recently
uncovered, on the West Bank, three other Hamas cells believed to be
responsible for having killed two soldiers and three Jewish settlers.
The army's operation at the weekend involved hundreds of soldiers and
curfews being extended to large areas of the Gaza Strip.
The two Palestinians were killed when the army blew up an underground
hide-out in the Bureij refugee camp.
The men were named as Mr Hamed al-Krenawi, the commander of several Hamas
military units, and Mr Musa al-Sayeed.
Mr Arafat's letter of protest complained that the Gaza offensive - which had
followed the capture of six pro-PLO fighters in the West Bank earlier last

Israel and Palestinians.
The PLO also asked the US to press Israel into halting such operations.
But Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, retorted yesterday that his
understanding of the deal was that Israel and the PLO would join forces to
fight those who opposed it.

FT  04 OCT 93 / VW seeks Dollars 185m from sale of housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, the troubled German vehicle maker, is attempting to raise an
estimated DM300m (Dollars 185.10m) by selling part of its housing stock in
its home town of Wolfsburg to company tenants.
VW accounts for three out of five jobs in the town and owns more than one in
five houses and flats. It has offered 1,400 tenants the right to buy their
homes.
If they choose not to buy, the properties will be sold on the open market,
the company says. Although security of tenure is guaranteed, the likelihood
of demands for rent increases from conventional landlords and the high cost
of home loans has caused a local outcry.
The move, which has been greeted by a petition protesting at the company's
'attack on social harmony', demonstrates the company's wide-ranging search
for savings. Its housing subsidiary has 12,700 homes on its books - worth an
estimated DM2.5bn - and says the sell-off is well on the way to success.
According to German media reports, the monthly cost of a mortgage on a
typical, modest 70 sq m flat is about DM1,700 - double the present rent for
such an apartment.
Wolfsburg is a company town in the old style, with many of its cultural and
social facilities provided by VW. Company flats are in orderly, compact
blocks. Most were built in the post-second world war boom, when German
workers aspired not only to a VW Beetle and foreign holidays but to a decent
home as well. Those on sale at present, for example, are about 30 years old.
The VW move is one of hundreds of savings and cost-cutting moves being
applied throughout German industry's generous network of social benefits.
Robert Bosch, a leading component supplier, has after eight months of talks
negotiated a package cutting DM180m off its cost base. The measures include
cancellation of company-paid cures in German spa towns and lower canteen
subsidies.
Daimler-Benz has told some of its workers it is no longer prepared to pay
for their children's first-communion dresses.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Monday Interview: Statesman soothes the waves - Douglas
Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, talks to Philip Stephens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party has a simple choice at its conference this week in
Blackpool. It can re-ignite the fires over the economy and Europe which for
the past year have consumed Mr John Major's government. If it does, the
future of the prime minister can be counted in months. Alternatively the
party could decide it prefers government to self-destruction,
problem-solving to civil war. Mr Major then at least would have a chance.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the distinguished elder statesman of a
none-too-distinguished cabinet, has largely escaped the opprobrium heaped on
his colleagues as the government has stumbled from crisis to crisis.
The foreign secretary, of course, was a pivotal figure in both the decision
to take sterling into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and in the battle
over Maastricht. Somehow most of the mud stuck to the prime minister.
There are those who believe that Mr Hurd's reputation as a master on the
diplomatic stage has been badly tarnished by his fierce opposition to
military intervention in Bosnia. Lady Thatcher has made little secret of her
disgust with what she refers to as Foreign Office appeasement.
By and large though, he has escaped the malaise. He came third in the
leadership contest following Lady Thatcher's departure three years ago. He
is 63, 13 years older than the prime minister. But he is still touted as a
serious contender for No 10 Downing Street by those who cannot be convinced
that Mr Major will recover. The foreign secretary has what they call 'grip'.
Talking at the weekend at his elegant but unostentatious Oxfordshire
farmhouse, Mr Hurd exuded the calm authority admired by his supporters.
There were occasional flashes of complacency in his prognosis. Sometimes, it
seemed, that after a week at the United Nations general assembly he found
the Tory party's private wars an annoying distraction.
But he acknowledged the significance of the Blackpool conference for Mr
Major and the government. The crises triggered last year by Denmark's
initial rejection of the Maastricht treaty and by the ERM debacle had
subsided. 'Now we have come out of that, but it has left a certain weakness,
a political malaise, behind.'
So: 'This Blackpool week is important. It should mark and underline for
everybody the move from one phase to another, from fever to recovery, from
political fever to political recovery.'
With Maastricht awaiting only German ratification, and the mood in the rest
of Europe moving Britain's way the Conservatives had the opportunity to heal
the divisions over Europe which had sapped Mr Major's authority.
Mr Hurd spoke though with hope as well as expectation: 'The Tory party
should be able (he emphasised twice the word 'should') - because that is no
longer an argument and there is no particular focus for further 'barminess'
 -to collect itself as it has often done in the past and get on with
supporting the government.'
He was determined that the problems should not be seen in isolation. The
malaise was not unique to Britain. Ask President Bill Clinton or Chancellor
Helmut Kohl. 'It is quite common in the western world at the moment. It
occurs in more countries than not.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, he reckons, is the Ross Perot of
British politics: 'If it were a malaise particularly against the government
then the support would go to the alternative government. But it's not. It is
going to a party (the Liberal Democrats) which is empty and contradictory, a
receptacle for protest.'
He warmed to the theme: 'I don't say we are OK, but we are not up against a
great urge to replace one government by its alternative. That is very clear.
The Labour party has done disastrously in by-elections. We are up against a
feeling of suspicion, scorn, for politicians and politics.'
That is as may be, but it is the government, and Mr Major in particular, who
must climb out of what Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, calls a dreadful
hole. The elderly facing VAT on domestic fuel, the southern middle classes
ravaged by unemployment and soaring crime rates and teachers facing chaos in
the classroom are not much interested in Chancellor Kohl's problems.
Was not the problem that the government has no sense of direction? Could he
define Majorism, 1990s Conservatism, or whatever?
Mr Hurd is one of his party's thinkers but he is not impressed these days by
the quest for philosophical blueprints. The government, he insists, will
recover because it delivers answers to problems. 'People don't really think
in terms of the party's identity. They think in terms of the actual events
of their lives and the decisions of government which shape them.'
Competence was the key: 'We will deal with this political malaise by the
orderly and competent handling of different problems. I think that's
perfectly possible. Indeed we have to do it.'
The economy, of course, is central. So too will be Mr Clarke's November
budget. If Mr Clarke entrenches economic growth with low inflation then few
voters will worry about the government's philosophical label.
Then there is Europe - more specifically Britain's opportunity to win the
post-Maastricht argument for a wider, more open, decentralised Community.
The Conservatives had the chance now both to bind their wounds and to shape
the future of Europe.
Mr Hurd offered a third, post-Thatcherite, theme for this exercise in
pragmatic government: public services, 'how do you give them a respected
place in a Conservative society. What (US vice-president) Al Gore called
re-inventing government.'
The prerequisite was reform - of the health service, education, the police
and, above all perhaps, of prisons. But once the government was certain the
reforms would stick, 'then you have to show the people who are in those
services that they are a necessary and respected part of society.'
It did not sound like a programme to raise the spirits of a depressed and
disgruntled nation. After 14 years, a promise to get to grips with law and
order or with standards in the nation's schools has something of a hollow
ring.
Mr Hurd was unapologetic. 'You exaggerate the extent to which people pine
for intellectual excitement. I don't think they do. If we can sustain the
recovery without inflation, if we shape the European Community in the sort
of way we want, if we can make the health and education reforms stick and
thus transform the nature of the public services . . . Then if we can do all
those things, then I think we are doing a good job.'
Would they accept too Mr Major continuing as prime minister, or has the
'nice man but not up to the job' jibe sunk too deeply into the nation's
political consciousness?
Mr Hurd sighs. The press, it seems, cannot cope without a crisis. 'We have
run out of crises. There isn't a European crisis. There isn't an economic
crisis. There isn't a sterling crisis . . . There isn't a crisis. But, my
God, there has to be a crisis. So let's find a crisis. There's a leadership
crisis, of course, the prime minister's not up to it . . . That is I think
rather the process of thought.'
But the fever will subside and Mr Major will stay: 'Yes I am sure he will. I
can't think that any effort to displace him would be successful and I
believe that he wishes to continue. And I think its right he should.' What
then of Mr Hurd's own future? Barely a month passes without some newspaper
story suggesting that he wanted more time for his young family, for writing
novels, and even perhaps for his memoirs.
The truth is Mr Hurd has not made up his mind. 'I am not in any tearing
hurry to change. I don't feel under any huge pressure to do so . . . I'm
blessed with a robust Anglo-Saxon constitution and I enjoy my job. There are
other things I would like to do later but later is later. I can't really say
more than that.'

FT  04 OCT 93 / Nothing to fear from Nafta: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing better illustrates America's loss of self confidence than the
hysterical opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). It
seems scarcely believable that the world's greatest economic power - the
founder of the liberal global trading system - should be leery of a free
trade pact with impoverished Mexico, whose economy represents only 4 per
cent of US gross domestic product. Yet the fears are real and are being
expertly fanned by such canny political operators as Mr Pat Buchanan on the
Republican right, Mr Ross Perot, the Texan billionaire, and Mr Richard
Gephardt, the popular Democratic congressional leader.
President Bill Clinton is now backing Nafta, although not with the passion
he brings, say, to healthcare reform. But if Congress fails to ratify the
agreement in December, he will bear much of the blame. He was passive during
the spring and summer while opposition to Nafta steadily gathered momentum.
He equivocated during last year's election campaign, refusing wholeheartedly
to support President Bush's initiative.
Just as significant, by talking constantly of US economic decline, he helped
create the national mood of economic insecurity that lies behind opposition
to Nafta. Every time his campaign jet touched down, he reminded voters they
were 'working harder for less' as a result of the failure of Reagan/Bush
policies.
As a political strategy, Mr Clinton's declinist rhetoric paid off
handsomely. But it was never well supported by the facts. Between 1980 and
1992, US GDP rose 32 per cent in real terms - hardly a sign that tougher
foreign competition was undermining living standards. This was not fuelled
solely by population growth: after allowing for inflation, per capita
personal disposable incomes rose more than 18 per cent. The distribution of
income did grow somewhat more unequal in the 1980s, but most boats were
lifted by this tide of prosperity. It was only the unskilled - mainly young
high school drop-outs - who experienced a significant absolute decline in
wages.
As a nation the US thus has nothing to fear, and much to gain, from a
lowering of barriers to trade and foreign investment. It is not even certain
that low-skilled US workers will be adversely affected. Professor Jagdish
Bhagwati of Columbia University points out that foreign competition can only
reduce US wages if it first reduces the prices of goods produced with
unskilled labour. He claims there is little evidence of downward pressure on
prices and therefore blames falling real wages at the bottom end on other
factors, such as rapid technological change.
If this sounds counter-intuitive, remember that as incomes in developing
countries rise, so does their demand for goods produced in industrial
countries. The negative impact on wages from an increased global supply of
low-skilled labour has to be balanced against a positive 'income' effect,
reflecting higher global demand for goods and services. Some of the detailed
econometric analyses of Nafta support the Bhagwati thesis, claiming that it
will raise the wages even of unskilled US workers because of positive demand
effects.
But even if intensified competition does put downward pressure on the wages
of unskilled US workers, it is extraordinary that so many leading public
figures, including a majority of congressional Democrats, appear to believe
the solution lies in protection. There is a strong economic case for
responding by improving education and training for the low-skilled and by
extending financial relief through the tax system, as the Clinton
administration did in the budget through its expansion of the earned income
tax credit.
But to try to narrow opportunities for trade and foreign investment on the
grounds that some groups will lose out is to inveigh against capitalism
itself. The domestic equivalent of fighting Nafta is to argue that companies
should not be allowed to move from California to Utah, in case reduced
labour costs enable them to become more efficient.
Mr Clinton, admittedly, has rejected overt forms of protection. He says the
US should embrace change and create the jobs of tomorrow rather than try to
'preserve the economic structures of yesterday'. But his commitment to
market principles is skin deep. The whole point of trade is to benefit from
your neighbour's comparative advantages which, in Mexico's case, include
relatively low wages. Yet Mr Clinton is proudly pointing out that this is
the first trade agreement to insist that the poorer country gradually raise
its wage rates toward those in the richer nation. With this clause he is
pandering to the same special interests as Nafta opponents; his tactics are
just more subtle.
Yet in a strange way, Mexico holds the key to Nafta. Unless the US Congress
comes to its senses, Mexico faces a serious political rebuff. But although
it cannot force the US to sign up it can unilaterally introduce many Nafta
provisions, for example by cutting tariffs further and by liberalising rules
for US direct investment. It already enjoys pretty unrestricted access to
the US domestic market. This would be the ultimate humiliation for the US:
to be informed by its economically sophisticated neighbour that it can take
advantage of opportunities it is too frightened to demand.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Peace in, peacekeeping out: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the world's most important politicians gather at the United Nations to
make speeches about the future of the world, we are unaccountably seduced
into hoping for uplifting guidance. Usually, of course, we are disappointed
by the gap between rhetoric and reality; but sometimes the rhetoric seems
actually to be the exact opposite of reality.
Take President Bill Clinton's expose of his administration's foreign policy
at the United Nations in New York last week. Some people had started to fear
that the Clinton administration was beginning to seem worryingly
inward-looking, potentially even neo-isolationist. So Mr Clinton went to New
York to reassure the world that these fears were unfounded.
America would continue to lead, he said, and America would remain engaged.
'We cannot solve every problem,' he admitted, 'but the United States must
and will serve as a fulcrum for change and a pivot point for peace'.
Moreover, America had developed a new foreign policy orientation to replace
the containment of the cold war: it is called 'enlargement', meaning the
encouragement of democracy and market forces in an ever larger number of
countries.
He said he would work to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction;
he would seek to strengthen the UN's peacekeeping capabilities; and he would
promote the objective of sustainable economic development in the third
world.
As an expression of high-minded aspirations and laudable values, President
Clinton's UN speech showed that his heart is in the right place on all the
conventional issues of the day: in favour of democracy and market forces, in
favour of Gatt, and free markets, against terrorism, against the spread of
nuclear weapons.
There is just one problem: his speech does not amount to a serious
description of a foreign policy, let alone the foreign policy of the
superpower that proclaims its intention to lead the free world.
Some passages are trumped up with mushy or even meaningless rhetoric. It is
unnerving to be told: 'This is a moment of miracles.' And how does the US
propose to go about being 'a fulcrum for change and a pivot point for
peace'? It sounds quite uncomfortable.
But even where the president's aspirations are relatively comprehensible and
precise, it remains unclear how he proposes to act. The new catch-phrase is
'enlargement': but what exactly does the administration propose to do to
increase the number of countries that are market-based democracies? Apart
from reiterating his support for freer international trade, Mr Clinton is
careful not to tell us.
The speech scarcely mentions Russia or China; except to claim that 'a
thriving, democratic Russia makes the world safer', and that 'the growing
economic power of China could bring great benefits to Asia and to the
world'. Surely the UN General Assembly deserved something more serious than
that.
In short, it appears that Mr Clinton is on the side of the angels, in a
moderate and reasonable way, and he appears to be a thoroughly nice man. But
he does not seem to have a foreign policy, in the sense of an articulated
set of goals, strategies and tactics.
The usual explanation is that his experience and priorities are domestic,
and that he feels no urgent need for an original approach to foreign policy.
This may not be a true picture. But anyone who saw Mr Clinton preside over a
TV talk show on his healthcare proposals on Sunday, and then heard him
expound his foreign policy at the UN on Monday, could not fail to be struck
by the extraordinary contrast in his passion and apparent conviction.
A second version is that the pace of change in the world is so great that it
is not yet possible to frame a coherent foreign policy. The world expects
the US to lead, President Clinton feels the US has a duty to lead, and he is
reluctant to admit that he is floored by the pace of change. So he says the
US will lead, but gives us mush, which he pads out with motherhood and apple
pie.
If there is a clue to the truth, it probably lies in President Clinton's
back-handed proposals for the UN itself. He praised its peacekeeping
achievements in Namibia, Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia, and he said he wanted
to strengthen the organisation's peacekeeping capabilities, which have not
kept pace with its rising responsibilities.
But his primary aim is clearly to curb all future UN peacekeeping
operations. He would give the UN a proper planning staff, a logistics unit,
access to intelligence, and a modern operations centre. But new peacekeeping
operations would have to meet tough criteria: Is there a real threat to
international peace? Does the proposed mission have clear objectives? Can an
end point to UN participation be identified? How much will the mission cost?
These are questions which are designed to be hard to satisfy for any
American contribution to a peacekeeping force in Bosnia, or anywhere else.
The excessive euphoria of 1989 is now over, and President Clinton's
hard-nosed criteria are just representative of the increasingly sceptical
tone of voice of the realpolitik community in other western capitals.
Mr Clinton's realism was echoed brutally the next day by the UK foreign
secretary. Sudan, Somalia, Bosnia, Angola, said Mr Douglas Hurd. were not
crises for the international community, because they were not threats to
world peace. They were just tragedies which, by implication, did not require
the intervention of the UN. That's the new western policy: no more
peacekeeping.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPORTANT event on the foreign exchanges this week will be the release on
Friday of US employment data for September.
Dealers are anticipating a positive set of non-farm payroll figures, their
hopes boosted by the results of the Chicago purchasing managers index last
week. This showed a sharp jump in the employment component of the index.
Last month the dollar was damaged by a 39,000 fall in non-farm payrolls, but
technical factors, together with the rebound from August, should lead to a
substantial rise in the September figure. The median forecast from
economists is for a 150,000 rise.
A good figure might tilt sentiment in favour of the dollar. Some economic
data at the end of last week did not live up to expectations and proved
insufficient to correct the view that the US recovery is disappointing.
In Germany, Mr Hans Tietmeyer takes over as president of the Bundesbank. He
inherits a more favourable inflationary background, but does not appear
inclined to accelerate the central bank's gradualist approach to rate cuts.
Sterling is unlikely to make many advances this week as the ruling
Conservative party meets in Blackpool for its annual party conference.
Although many dealers are sceptical that the government will use the
conference as the background for a rate cut, investors remain cautious.
However, as analysts at Barclays de Zoete Wedd point out, last year sterling
stood at DM2.43 on the last day of the Labour party conference but a week
later, at the end of the Tory gathering, was at DM2.52.
'It may be too much to expect an exact repeat this year, but such a
comparison does illustrate how dangerous it can be to short sterling when it
is obviously cheap relative to its purchasing power parity.'

and the A46 Leicester western bypass, the A34 contract award takes the total
value of work won by the joint venture to almost Pounds 110m in just nine
months.
Located to the south of the Manchester conurbation, the A34 scheme entails
construction of 15km of flexibly paved dual carriageway and up to 40 minor
structures including 31 bridges, two river crossings, three railway
crossings, footbridges, culverts and several reinforced earth retaining
walls.
The project is designed to ease congestion locally and will eventually form
part of the eastern link road to Manchester Airport.
Made up of AMEC Civil Engineering and Alfred McAlpine Civil Engineering, the
joint venture will begin work on the 104-week contract, which was awarded by
Cheshire County Council, in early October.

<TEXT>
The Scottish Office has awarded BALFOUR BEATTY the contract for the M8
motorway extension to the west of Edinburgh.
The contract is valued at a fixed price lump sum of Pounds 39m with a
contract completion date of February 1996, and is believed to be the largest
design and buiId road construction contract to be awarded in Britain so far.
The contract will extend the M8 motorway from its terminal point just south
of Newbridge to connect with the Edinburgh City bypass at Sighthill. The
works comprise the construction of 7.3km of dual two-lane motorway with hard
shoulders and some 16 structures of which three are contractor designed.
Also included are earthworks, accommodation and works for the statutory
authorities.

FT  04 OCT 93 / US Money and Credit: Conflicting economic signals bring
volatility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOLATILITY in bond prices says it all. After a lacklustre first half of
the year, the US economy has been throwing off conflicting signals in recent
weeks.
Signs that the halting economic recovery may be picking up speed,
alternating with renewed evidence of the recovery's weakness, have made the
market jittery and big price movements common.
The bond market is still looking for the evidence that will either propel
yields on long-dated bonds decisively below 6 per cent or finally bring an
end to the bond market rally.
September employment figures, due on Friday, could help to determine which
way the market will turn.
Last Friday's movement in prices summed up the recent mood.
A sharp jump in the August index of leading indicators, to 1 per cent,
suggested a quickening in the economic pulse: the index had grown only 0.1
per cent in June and July, and fallen in the two previous months. Bond
prices slid on the news.
But the regular survey from the National Association of Purchasing
Management which followed later in the day pointed to the slow pace of
manufacturing growth.
The NAPM index rose to 49.7 during September, from 49.3 in August (which was
itself a fall from the 49.5 of July). Recovery, perhaps, but hardly
striking: the bond market regained some of its confidence.
After all the choppiness in the market, bond yields ended little changed and
still close to the psychologically important 6 per cent level.
The benchmark 30-year US Treasury long bond ended the week higher than it
had started, at a yield of 5.99 per cent, compared with 6.03 per cent at the
beginning.
Other straws in the wind also point to the lacklustre pace of recovery.
After the collapse of new bank lending in 1991 and 1992, virtually any
increase in bank credit growth has the potential to look dramatic.
Therefore, it is as well to be cautious about the Dollars 5.8bn growth in
bank lending in the latest reporting week, following the three-week decline
that preceded it.
However, the make-up of that credit growth may be instructive: Dollars 1.1bn
was in the form of personal loans, while Dollars 4.7bn was real estate
lending.
This figure represented lending for residential rather than commercial real
estate, but there have also been suggestions recently that the banks are
beginning to overcome their commercial real estate phobia.
These latest bank lending figures bear out the picture for far this year:
consumer loans have provided all the growth, rising consistently since the
first quarter of the year.
Commercial and industry loans, by comparison, have continued to edge
downwards.
Large companies have chosen to finance themselves through the capital
markets. Smaller companies, meanwhile, have reduced their borrowings.
Nevertheless, with bank balance sheets primed with new capital after the
bust at the start of the decade, and signs that lending is picking up in
some sectors, the stage seems set for steady (if not dramatic) lending
growth in the months ahead, helping to support the recovery.
August's employment data, which showed an unexpected fall in non-farm
payrolls of 39,000, helped to spur the bond market rally.
However, September figures to be published this week are widely expected to
have just the opposite effect.
Salomon Brothers, for instance, is projecting an increase in non-farm
payrolls of 225,000, while Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette predicts a 175,000
rise.
Both point to an expected pick-up in employment in services industries. On a
less positive note for the economy, though, both predict a slight fall in
working hours during September.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Portuguese Bonds: Rich pickings for yield-hungry investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH YIELDS and the prospect of further market liberalisation are luring
foreign investors into the Portuguese government bond market.
Compared with most of their European counterparts, Portuguese bonds offer
yield-hungry investors particularly good returns.
The 10 5/8 per cent government bond - or Obrigacoe do Tresouro (OT) - due
2003 currently yields 9.70 per cent, 65 basis points over its Spanish
counterpart and 360 basis points over the benchmark German bond.
Portugal has undertaken extensive reforms to create a liquid and transparent
bond market.
The Treasury now holds regular auctions of bonds with maturities between
three and 10 years, with a recent emphasis on seven to 10-year bonds; 14
primary dealers make a market at relatively tight bid-offer spreads; debt
management has been centralised at the Treasury; and capital controls were
lifted in December 1992.
The country is gearing up for further innovations. 'It is definitely our
intention to make the market more efficient, that is, deregulated,' said Mr
Manuel Pinho, director general of the Treasury. 'This could permit a greater
presence of non-resident investors.'
Overseas involvement is 'abnormally low' compared with other bond markets,
he said. Foreigners own some 5 per cent of Portuguese bonds, but the
Treasury is believed to want to lift this to some 30 per cent.
Foreigners have been big players in warrants on Portuguese bonds, hedged in
D-Marks, which are traded in Frankfurt.
But Mr Pinho stresses he welcomes non-resident investment through 'official
channels', explaining that 'we would like non-residents to come in through
the door, rather than the window.'
Attracting heavier foreign involvement will require further changes. For the
primary market, the Treasury is mulling ways of speeding up settlements
through a more efficient delivery-versus-payment system.
In the secondary market, it is considering regulating bond lending and
repos, and is thinking of creating a screen-based over-the-counter market.
Meanwhile, investors hope the 20 per cent withholding tax for non-residents
will soon be abolished. This would benefit US and Japanese investors most
since their countries have no double-taxation treaty with Portugal. But even
where such agreements exist, the reclaim procedure can be cumbersome.
Since 'the Treasury receives very little income from withholding tax, it
defies logic for the current system to continue,' argues Mr Steven Major,
senior bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais.
'There is a strong argument to consider buying now with a view to taking
advantage of withholding tax abolition,' he recommends.
According to Mr Major, other liberalising measures are likely to include
lower transaction costs, new settlement procedures conforming with
international standards, and an automated link between the Portuguese
Central Securities Depository to the Euroclear and Cedel clearing agencies.
He expects the measures to be announced in October to coincide with the
publication of the 1994 budget.
Portugal's economic fundamentals are encouraging, with forecasts for a
debt-to-GDP ratio of less than 60 per cent and a budget deficit of below 5
per cent of gross domestic product in 1994.
Its tough fiscal policy earned it an upgrading of its credit rating by
Standard &amp; Poor's from A plus to double A minus. This has helped its smooth
return to the Eurobond markets where it has issued DM1.5bn of 10-year bonds,
Y75bn of five-year bonds and Dollars 1bn of 10-year bonds this year.
Wage moderation and the depressed economy are limiting cost pressures so
that average inflation will be close to 6 per cent at year-end, falling
further in 1994, predicts Mr Major. Meanwhile, he expects GDP to grow by 0.2
per cent this year and 1.2 per cent in 1994.
The currency remains a risk, however. The escudo has depreciated by some 18
per cent against the D-Mark since it joined the European exchange rate
mechanism in April 1992, though it has stabilised within a notional 6 per
cent trading range since the widening of ERM trading bands in August.

FT  04 OCT 93 / UK Gilts: Steady period in prospect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND for gilts strengthened last week on the back of anecdotal evidence
that inflationary pressures in the UK are unlikely to be a problem for some
time.
With little in the way of economic data on inflation, investors were quick
to dive into the market to buy gilts at the first sign of any fall in
prices. Such developments kept support fairly strong, in spite of last
Wednesday's Pounds 3.25bn auction of 11-year gilts, which drained a large
amount of supply.
Over the week, 10-year gilts saw a yield drop of about 10 basis points, with
yields being quoted at around 7 per cent on a par basis on Friday night. The
auction means that the Bank of England has found buyers for three-quarters
of the Pounds 45bn of gilts which it is estimated the UK will need to sell
during 1993-94.
During the week, demand from non-UK institutions as well as UK pension funds
and insurance companies was steady. While prices dipped on the day of the
auction, they recovered later as investors moved in to take advantage of the
increase in yields.
The next few days will see few economic data likely to affect demand for
gilts. However, the markets will be watching for today's publication of the
figures for the year-on-year rise in the M0 measure of money supply last
month.
City analysts expect this to be about 4.3 per cent, rather less than the
figures for recent months. If they are right, the data can be expected to
lift gilt prices, on the grounds that they add to recent evidence that the
upturn evident earlier this year is slowing.
Subdued expectations remain that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, could
cut base rates, now at 6 per cent, during the next few days. He could
announce this in his speech to the Conservative party's conference on
Thursday. However, the consensus in the markets is that the chancellor is
more likely to cut borrowing costs later in the year, possibly to offset any
increases in taxes he might announce in the November 30 Budget.
Many commentators think a rate cut might be needed to inject more life into
the economy, which has been looking lacklustre in recent weeks.
Mr Brian Pearce, chief economist of the Item forecasting group, relies for
his views on anecdotes fed to him from 25 companies and financial
institutions. He says: 'Because of a slackening in demand, industry is being
extremely cautious about predicting any significant rises in output. Costs
are generally under control and many companies are suffering from severe
competitive pressures. As a result, I don't see any good reason to be
worried about inflation.'
Summing up the view of many financial commentators outside the UK, Mr David
Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, says: 'The
British labour market has become a lot more flexible and cheap and as a
result the UK looks in a good position to attract international industry. I
don't think inflation in the UK is going to be an issue for the next 18
months or so.'
If these views are correct, gilts can be expected to see a generally steady,
if rather dull, period over the next few months. They may be helped by any
general interest rate cuts in the rest of Europe but in the next few weeks
few expect much in the way of any easing in monetary policy across
continental Europe.
At the Bundesbank this Thursday, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, in his first council
meeting as president, is expected to set the tone for such thinking and is
unlikely to press for action on German interest rates.

FT  04 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Global offerings push US houses up
league table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POPULARITY of global bond offerings has strengthened the position of US
investment banks in the international bond market, at the expense of
European and Japanese banks, industry data show.
The number of US banks in the top 10 positions in the league table of
Eurobond lead managers has risen to five at the end of the third quarter of
this year from three at the same stage last year, according to IFR
Securities Data.
Goldman Sachs, which was in fifth place last year, has captured the number
one slot from Deutsche Bank. Morgan Stanley, Salomon Brothers and Lehman
Brothers have climbed into the top 10 from double-digit positions in 1992.
A wide range of supranational, sovereign and provincial borrowers have
issued global bonds in the past year, culminating with the Republic of
Italy's record Dollars 5.5bn offering in mid-September.
The process of offering bonds simultaneously in the US, Europe and Asia
allows borrowers to raise larger sums than in the Eurobond market and to
place the paper at the best possible price.
Not surprisingly, the mandates for these issues - the majority of which have
been in dollars - have tended go to banks which have the ability to
distribute and trade the bonds on a global basis.
This is where US banks have the edge over their European and Asian
competitors, since they have been more successful in penetrating the
European and Asian markets than vice versa. Their increased market share
also reflects the diversification of their primary and secondary business
into other currencies apart from the dollar.
By contrast, the majority of mandates won by German, Japanese and UK banks
are still for issues denominated in their domestic currency despite their
efforts to diversify into other currencies.
However, although US banks have been successful in establishing
relationships in a market where around half of the borrowers and investors
are European, they still have to prove that they have a long-term commitment
to the market.
Although they are quicker off their feet when a market becomes interesting,
in the past US banks have been equally quick to withdraw when conditions
deteriorate. European and Asian banks, by contrast, have a much more
consistent track record.
US banks also remain a force to reckoned with because of their extensive
retail networks. The Eurobond market is still dependent on retail investors
in Europe and Asia, in spite of the growing interest from institutional
investors.
Volume in the Eurobond market has topped the Dollars 300bn mark after the
first nine months of this year, compared with Dollars 269bn for the whole of
last year.
Syndicate managers expect the new issues market to remain active for the
next eight weeks, during which time the World Bank is expected to launch its
first D-Mark global bond offering.
The European Community is expected to tap the D-Mark and Ecu sectors.
Several sovereign borrowers, including the Kingdoms of Belgium and Denmark,
are also scheduled to make an appearance.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Risk and Reward: Setback for active quantitative fund
management sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The active quantitative ('active quant') fund management sector suffered a
setback last week when it was revealed that the performance statistics of
one of the most successful managers is being questioned.
Hill Samuel Investment Management is one of the few active quantitive fund
managers to be able to attract the attention of the pension fund
consultants, and consequently their clients, with its Active Value
Management product. Its chief attraction was that it had a five-year track
record based on actual returns from money under management and did not rely
on hypothetical 'back-testing' to show prospective clients how it performed.
Active quant is a broad term encompassing a mathematical approach to stock
picking and asset allocation by collecting and analysing vast quantities of
data about each stock. Active quant managers decide which stock
characteristics are likely to lead to outperformance and tilt their
portfolios accordingly.
Last week, Mr Richard Bernays, chief executive of HSIM, said he had notified
IMRO, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, that the
internally generated performance data which had been used for marketing
purposes had overstated the returns of some clients who had their own pools
measured externally.
The disparities occurred primarily in 1992. One pension fund client, who
said he took on Hill Samuel in 1992, said he did so after seeing performance
returns showing that until then AVM had been delivering returns 4 percentage
points above the FT-A all-share index. Mr Bernays said that for 1992 and
1993 the product had been just matching the FT-A all-share index.
While the client said he believed Hill Samuel had made every effort to deal
with the problem, his pension fund board of trustees will be meeting later
this week to decide whether they still retain confidence in the product.
So far, Mr Bernays said, HSIM has lost only one of its 11 clients, and a
small one at that. The account left 'not for performance reasons. We made
some pretty rash claims which did not materialise,' he said.
Within the past few months, HSIM has made some revisions to its product,
broadening to 60 from 40 the number of stocks it holds in each portfolio.
'When we analysed the portfolio, we found that the tilts were basically
right. However, we had too many stock-specific and sector-specific risks,'
he said.
Pension consultants said that in addition to the reported performance
figures, questions have been raised about the data for 1987. It is not clear
whether the returns represent that of an actual portfolio or whether an
'intellectual' portfolio was being run for a part of the year.
The problems were discovered after the departure of the team which developed
the product. The team moved to State Street Global Asset Management, where
it is now developing a product to compete with Hill Samuel's AVM.
Consultants said the affair may raise as many questions about performance
measurement as it does about active quant as a technique.
'The industry was prepared to allow managers with good track records to show
only three years of performance data,' said one. Typically, five years of
performance data are required for client presentations but, because active
quant managers are much more clearly able to explain how they achieve their
results, some consultants were prepared to recommend them based on only
three years of performance.
Mr Alan Greenhorn, the former HSIM official who developed the AVM product,
said he could not discuss the matter because of a confidentiality agreement.
But he says that 'performance measurement is the most difficult aspect of
fund management. It is a kind of reverse engineering.' Current methods are
most appropriate for classic balanced management in which the manager
allocates assets among different classes and picks securities within them.
But for specialist fund management, new forms of measurement are needed, he
said.
'You have got to be able to determine what was added by asset allocation,
stock selection and currency overlay,' Mr Greenhorn said. 'Current
performance measurement technique doesn't do that.'

FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ifil to bid for 33% of
Rinascente

IFIL, the Agnelli family's stock market listed investment group, is to bid
for 33 per cent of Rinascente, the Italian stores chain, as part of the
financial restructuring of the Fiat group.
Fiat currently holds 58 per cent of Rinascente's capital. The restructuring
plan for the motor group, unveiled last week, includes a cash injection
through the sale of the stores stake in two stages, culminating in Ifil
acquiring control.
However, it was not made clear whether Ifil would absorb the full Fiat stake
or sufficient shares to take control. Over the weekend, Ifil revealed it was
offering to pay L12,500 per share for 52.1m Rinascente shares, equivalent to
33 per cent of the ordinary capital. The offer will open on October 29 and
close on November 19.
Ifil already has substantial cash reserves, but will help pay for the deal
by a one-for-five rights issue raising L492bn (Dollars 309m). Acquiring the
33 per cent stake in Rinascente is expected to involve Ifil in a total
outlay of L650bn.
Although Fiat's sale of its Rinascente stake 'in house' in its restructuring
arrangements has aroused the most comment, Ifil was reported over the
weekend as saying it was not over-burdened by the deal.

FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: US banks poised for merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO leading US regional banks are expected to announce a merger today in a
move that would create one of the country's biggest and most geographically
diverse banking groups.
Shares in both KeyCorp, based in Albany, New York, and Society Corp, of
Cleveland, Ohio, were suspended late on Friday pending unspecified
announcements from both groups.
A merger would create a unit with assets of more than Dollars 50bn, putting
it among the 12 largest banks in the US and making it one of the leading
'super-regionals,' which combine operations in a number of states.
KeyCorp has already grown rapidly through acquisition in recent years,
putting together a string of banks in eight northern states, including
Alaska, Oregon and Washington. Its operations are concentrated in the
north-east and north-west of the country, leaving a gap which would be
filled by Society, based in the mid-west.
Mergers among regional banks in the US have picked up in recent months as
consolidation in the banking industry has gained momentum.
Some of the country's largest banking groups, including NationsBank and
BankAmerica, are also reported to be hunting for acquisitions to extend
their networks into new states.
Both KeyCorp and Society ranked among the country's top 30 banks in terms of
assets at the end of last year.
They were also among the most profitable, with a return on equity in excess
of 17 per cent.

FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: Publicis warns of downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLICIS, one of France's largest advertising groups, has warned of a fall
in net profits for 1993 following a 7.1 per cent decline in first-half net
profits to FFr60m (Dollars 10.5m), compared to the same period of 1992.
The group, like other advertising agencies, has been affected by the general
slowdown in the French economy. The combination of static consumer spending
and reduced industrial investment, together with comparatively high interest
rates, has forced many French companies to cut their marketing budgets.
These problems have been aggravated by the reform of French media buying
regulations implemented by Mr Michel Sapin, the former socialist finance
minister.
Mr Maurice Levy, chairman of Publicis, had already warned that net profits
for 1993 would show a 'slight fall' on the previous year.
Publicis yesterday forecast a 16.1 per cent reduction in net profits to
FFr125m in 1993 from FFr149m in 1992 and a decline in sales of 4 per cent to
FFr19.2bn from FFr19.9bn.
Operating profits fell 8.9 per cent to FFr199.9m in the first half of 1993
from FFr219.6m in the same period of 1992, on turnover down 11 per cent to
FFr9.33bn.
Elf-Aquitaine, the state-controlled French oil group, has appointed Alice as
the advertising agency for its forthcoming privatisation. Alice was the
agency behind the advertising campaign for this year's 'Balladur bond'.

FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: UAP in fresh talks on Victoire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French insurance group, has
reopened negotiations with Suez, the financial and industrial holding
company, over the future of Victoire, the French insurer in which the two
groups have significant share stakes.
The wrangle over Victoire, in which the Suez group has a majority holding
and UAP a 34 per cent stake, has been one of France's most tortuous
corporate sagas.
UAP has for some time been pressing Suez to agree to exchange the former's
Victoire shares for shares in Colonia, the German insurer controlled by
Victoire.
The two companies last year came close to a deal, only to fall out at the
last minute over the price.
Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Suez, then announced that his group was
withdrawing from negotiations.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of UAP who was previously Mr Worms' boss as
head of Suez, has since pressed for a resumption of the talks.
On Friday, Suez issued a formal statement confirming that the two companies
had 'recently resumed' negotiations over Victoire. The statement added that
the talks had not yet been concluded but they were being 'actively pursued'.
The reopening of negotiations comes at a critical time for Mr Peyrelevade.
He has made no secret of his eagerness to conclude the Victoire affaire
before the forthcoming privatisation of UAP, a state-controlled company
which is on the government's list of sale candidates.
The need to secure a successful conclusion has also been heightened by
speculation that Mr Peyrelevade is a candidate to succeed Mr Jean-Yves
Haberer, as chairman of Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French banking group.
Mr Haberer recently confirmed that he was considering quitting Credit
Lyonnais. Mr Peyrelevade would be keen to secure a successful conclusion for
the potentially embarrassing Victoire saga before leaving UAP.

FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: France expected to price BNP
share offer today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government is expected today to launch the first share sale in
one of Europe's most ambitious privatisation programmes by announcing the
price of the shares to be sold in Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the
leading banking group.
Sources suggest that the economy ministry plans to announce the share price
late this afternoon after the close of trading on the Paris stock market.
However, the government will only proceed with the sale if it is convinced
that market conditions are right. If not, it will postpone the offer until
the investment climate improves.
The success of the BNP issue will be critical to the prospects for the rest
of the privatisation programme, which could include the sale of as many as
21 state-controlled companies to the private sector, including the
Elf-Aquitaine oil group and the Renault motor company.
BNP, the traditional bastion of French banking, is one of the most
prestigious companies on the privatisation list.
The consensus among analysts is that the BNP shares will be priced at
between FFr250 and FFr275, valuing the group (which will have a total of
around 180m shares) at between FFr45bn and FFr49.5bn (Dollars 7.9bn-Dollars
8.7bn).
Exact details of the allocation of shares in the offer have yet to be
confirmed.
However the government, which owns 72.9 per cent of BNP, is expected to sell
72m shares, or a 40 per cent stake.
Approximately half of these shares will be sold to French individual
investors. Some 17.4m shares have been earmarked for French institutions and
32.6m will be available to foreign investors.
Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the insurance group which now owns 10
per cent of BNP, plans to raise its holding to 15 per cent. Another 15 per
cent tranche will be set aside for long-term strategic investors.
A 17 per cent stake is likely to be set aside for the holders of investment
certificates in BNP, who currently hold the same proportion of its equity,
although the precise terms of conversion for the investment certificates
have yet to be finalised.
The government will be left with a 13 per cent holding in BNP. Of this, it
will cede a stake of up to 10 per cent to Dresdner, the German bank with
which BNP has negotiated a cross-shareholding venture.
A further 8m shares are earmarked for sale to the bank's employees, with the
rest of the state's holding reserved to be given as loyalty bonuses to
long-term investors.
After the completion of the BNP offer, the government hopes to press ahead
with the privatisation of Rhone-Poulenc, the flagship French chemicals
company, which is scheduled as the second issue in the share-sale programme.
The Rhone-Poulenc offer is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: Swiss Re lifts earnings to
SFr281m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS Reinsurance has reported a 5.6 per cent rise in net earnings to
SFr281m (Dollars 197m) for 1992 and has proposed a share split and rights
issue to raise SFr575m.
The group, the world's second largest reinsurer after Munich Reinsurance,
said gross premiums rose by 25.6 per cent last year to SFr21.9bn.
However, about half of the growth in gross premiums came from changes in the
scope of consolidation, mainly from including Elvia's figures for the first
time. Net premiums rose 27 per cent to SFr20.7bn.
The underwriting loss in non-life business soared by 43 per cent to
SFr1.12bn, reflecting the impact of Hurricane Andrew and a generally
'unfavourable experience' in the insurance business. Hurricane Andrew cost
the group SFr500m.
On the other hand, the underwriting income in life insurance jumped 38 per
cent. Financial income was 11.9 per cent up to SFr2.06bn.
The management board has proposed splitting the company's SFr100 nominal
registered and bearer shares at the rate of five for every one share held,
and also converting the SFr20 nominal non-voting participation certificates
into registered shares.
These moves are similar to those made by other quoted Swiss companies
following a change in company law last year. Swiss Re said the changes would
promote liquidity of its share trading.
The board is also proposing opening its share register to foreigners, but
limiting all shareholders to a maximum of 3 per cent of the registered share
capital.
This too follows a trend aimed at overcoming the unhappiness of foreigners
with being disenfranchised, while preventing hostile takeover bids.
The rights issue will be on the basis of one new bearer or registered share,
following the splits, for every 10 shares or participation certificates
held. The price, expected to be about SFr475 a share, will be set on
November 24.
Swiss Re said that the funds would be used 'to support the growth in
business anticipated for 1993 and subsequent years'.
In August, the group joined with John Head &amp; Partners, a New York merchant
bank, to create a new company, Partner Reinsurance, to specialise in natural
catastrophe insurance.
Swiss Re will contribute Dollars 100m to the Bermuda-based venture.

FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: Record Malaysian financing for
YTL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK BUMIPUTRA, the Malaysian bank which in the past has been dogged by
controversy and bad debts, is heading a group of institutions arranging a
MDollars 2.66bn (Dollars 1.04bn) debt financing package for YTL, a listed
Malaysian construction company.
The package, which will be entirely in ringgit, the Malaysian dollar, is
described by Schroders, YTL's financial advisers, as the largest debt
financing ever arranged for a Malaysian borrower.
YTL has the licence to build, own and operate two power stations in the
south of the Malaysian peninsula under the country's independent power
producers (IPP) programme.
National Power of the UK was to have taken a 10 per cent equity stake in the
project, but it withdrew in July this year citing 'contractual differences.'
Subsequently, the German Siemens group has become involved in a turnkey
project to build the two power plants, but is not taking any equity in the
project.
There had been speculation that without a foreign equity partner YTL would
face problems raising such a large amount of project finance. Banking
analysts say the government, keen to make a start on IPP projects to satisfy
Malaysia's growing power needs, is likely to have exerted some pressure on
state-controlled Bank Bumiputra to arrange the loan.
The financing consists of two facilities: a 15-year fixed-rate ringgit bond
issue, which will be subscribed by the state-run Employees Provident Fund
(EPF), and a 15-year ringgit floating-rate commercial loan.
The loan is underwritten by Bank Bumiputra, United Malaysian Banking and
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of Germany.
Bank Bumiputra plans to sell down its floating-rate loan to other Malaysian
banks. KfW is also being funded by local banks.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Miami-based fund management group Thomas J. Herzfeld has launched the
first closed-end fund to invest in US, Caribbean and Latin American
companies likely to benefit when the US trade embargo against Cuba is
finally lifted.
Although the main purpose of the fund is to allow investors to buy a stake
in the future of a post-communist Cuba, the fund - Herzfeld Caribbean Basin
Fund - will also invest in companies that benefit from the development of
economies in the Caribbean region as a whole.
Current US law prohibits direct or indirect investment in Cuba. However,
Cuba's economic problems, the steady deterioration of the economic and
social infrastructure on the island and the gradual erosion of President
Fidel Castro's popularity and power has led many US politicians and
businessmen, especially those in Florida (which is only 90 miles from Cuba)
to prepare for the end of communist rule in Cuba and the lifting of the US
embargo.

FT  04 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Market float likely to value Fenchurch up
to Pounds 80m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fenchurch Group, which specialises in insurance broking and is a Lloyd's
agent, is coming to the market later this autumn, writes David Blackwell.
Before the flotation, which is expected to give it a market capitalisation
of Pounds 70m to Pounds 80m, it will demerge Fenchurch Underwriting
Agencies. It believes investors might be nervous about buying into a Lloyd's
underwriting agency.
Mr Tony Wheal, finance director, said the proceeds would be used to repay
the remainder of the debt - about Pounds 20m - incurred in the Pounds 33m
management buy-out from Guinness Peat in 1989. The company intends to be
ungeared.

FT  04 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ladbroke injunction against Mail on Sunday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LADBROKE, the hotels, betting, property and DIY group, has obtained an
injunction against the Mail on Sunday preventing it from publishing specific
allegations which the company says are untrue and highly damaging.
The injunction was obtained on September 25. Last Friday, after hearing from
contacts in the City that other Sunday newspapers were investigating these
allegations, Ladbroke instructed its lawyers to send them a letter informing
them of the injunction.
The letter said: 'It has been brought to our attention that certain
scurrilous rumours are circulating regarding both Ladbroke's relationship
with its bankers and the circumstances of its chairman's recently-announced
decision to retire at the end of this year. These rumours, as well as being
entirely false, are highly damaging.'
'Our client has already obtained an injunction against a national newspaper
preventing their publication, and no application has been made to discharge
it', the letter continued. However, the Mail on Sunday reported yesterday
that it was preparing an application to have the injunction lifted.
Ladbroke said that it had no alternative but to take the legal route when
these 'off-the-wall' allegations were brought to its attention.
One month ago, Mr Cyril Stein announced his intention to retire at the end
of the year after 37 years at the head of Ladbroke. However, he will be a
non-executive director for a further three years.
Turnover in Ladbroke's shares almost doubled last week, from 3.5m shares on
Monday to 6.6m shares on Friday.

FT  04 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Clean, tidy and ready for new brooms -
Andrew Baxter on the challenge for Babcock's chief executive and managing
director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT CAN'T have been much fun for Mr John Parker and Mr Nick Salmon to see
news of their arrival at Babcock International, the big engineering
contractor, accompanied by an immediate 20 per cent fall in the share price.
The two men start work today as chief executive and managing director
respectively at Babcock, less than a month after the company shocked the
City by revealing it would report a loss for the six months ended September
30, and would pass its interim dividend.
That was the result of a Pounds 20m provision because of cost over-runs on
Babcock's Pounds 420m flue gas desulphurisation contract at National Power's
Drax power station in North Yorkshire, and closure costs for Babcock
Africa's non-core mining activities.
It was just the latest in a long run of knocks for Babcock over the past
year - the loss of Pounds 6.2m on a power station contract in Humberside,
the departure in May of Mr Oliver Whitehead as chief executive, and the
choice of Devonport as the UK's nuclear submarine refitting base in
preference to Rosyth, where Babcock has the management contract.
Inevitably, the bad financial news rather overshadowed the appointment of Mr
Parker, who joins Babcock after 10 years as chairman and chief executive of
Harland and Wolff, the Belfast ship builder, and Mr Salmon, formerly deputy
managing director of GEC Alsthom's gas turbine and diesel division.
However, the appointments could mark a turning point in Babcock's fortunes,
and those of its two new chiefs. Babcock will not disclose its succession
plans, but it seems likely that Mr Parker could end up as chairman of the
company, taking over from Lord King in two or three years. Mr Salmon might
then step up to become chief executive.
The two new men are not talking yet about their plans for the company, but a
rigorous review of the business over the past year by Lord King and Mr Jeff
Whalley, who has been acting chief executive since May and will remain as
joint deputy chairman with Mr Parker, has laid the ground and pointed the
way ahead.
The picture that emerges is a company that is, in Mr Whalley's words, 'clean
and tidy,' with no more shocks in store for shareholders. But it also has a
number of strategic challenges to address around its main divisions:
Materials handling: Last year's acquisition of Consilium was intended to add
ship-to-shore materials handling to Claudius Peters' onshore bulk handling
equipment, mainly for cement. Manufacturing and marketing has been
rationalised and combined, and management 'needed a push along, and to show
a bit more aggression,' says Mr Whalley. The division makes about Pounds 9m
to Pounds 10m on sales of Pounds 150m to Pounds 160m, but could achieve as
much as 10 per cent return on sales, he says.
Facilities management: Babcock Thorn's management contract at Rosyth, a
65-35 arrangement with Thorn EMI, runs out in April 1995, but can be
extended for a year either by the government or the contractors. Mr Whalley
says Babcock, as sitting tenant, is in a good position to win a renewed
contract or bid for the dockyard if the government decides to privatise it.
Meanwhile, with employment at Rosyth down from 7,000 in 1987 to 3,800,
Babcock is keen to build up its rail refurbishment work at Rosyth, a
business it entered through the 1991 acquisition of Coventry-based Tickford
Rail.
As Tickford only refits carriages it needs to form a partnership with a
company that knows how to refurbish locomotives to be sure of winning future
business from British Rail. It is talking to a number of potential partners.
Energy: This is another area where partnerships or joint ventures could be
crucial to Babcock's future. In the past, it was the natural supplier of
boilers to UK-funded GEC power stations built all over the UK and the old
British empire.
But GEC Alsthom, inheritor of the GEC power plants business, has its own
boiler makers in France and Germany, and Babcock has to fight much harder to
win business. It is also having to respond to the need for more local
content in big Far Eastern contracts, which explains why the Renfrew plant
has seen employment fall by 400 to 1,150 in the past few months.
In the City it is no secret that Babcock is talking to other boiler makers
with different geographical strengths and modern 'clean coal' technologies.
A deal with a turbine producer which lacks its own boilers could also make
sense. Contractors: Closely related to the energy division, this has also
had to respond to the collapse of traditional UK markets, such as nuclear
work. The purchase of King Wilkinson 18 months ago took it into the Middle
East oil and gas contracting business. It is also beginning to expand in
Asia.
At Drax, the Pounds 15m cost overrun was caused by the need to 'flood' the
site with workers so that Babcock could keep to its deadlines following a
technical problem last autumn.
With a new team running the contract, Mr Whalley says he feels much more
comfortable, and is confident that the first two of six FGD units will be
handed over to National Power on December 17.
The problem at Drax, however, highlights a broader issue that the new chiefs
at Babcock will have to resolve. If a Pounds 15m provision can cause such
havoc financially, is the company big enough to survive in the risky world
of contracting? According to Mr Whalley, the current balance sheet of Pounds
90m is big enough for Babcock's current level of business.
However, if the new team makes a success of developing Babcock's contracting
business in international markets, which is where its skills are needed
most, it looks as if the balance sheet will have to expand too.
'If they want to expand in the Far East, and cope with the penalty clauses,
no money up front, and slow progress payments in modern contracting, it is
obvious that the balance sheet will have to expand,' says Mr Jonathan Getz
at Robert Fleming Securities.
There are, of course, a number of ways Babcock could achieve this. But that
will be up to the new team.

FT  04 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Strategy change at Do It All
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new business strategy for Do It All, the DIY chain owned jointly by Boots
and WH Smith, is due to be announced before Boots reveals its interim
results on November 4.
Options under discussion include sales of stores, or closures, or an
acceleration of plans to 're-vamp' existing stores by refitting them so that
products are grouped according to different DIY projects.
Boots and WH Smith have also been in discussions with possible buyers for
the company, although a spokesman for Boots asserted that reports that
'parcels of stores' had been marketed to other retailers were untrue.
In August, WH Smith, which owns 50 per cent, said its share of Do It All's
losses for the year to May was Pounds 14.3m, with sales down 7.3 per cent.

FT  04 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Biotrace plans flotation via private
placement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIOTRACE International, a small biotech company which has developed a simple
and quick electronic test to check food industry hygiene using the substance
in fireflies which enables them to glow, is planning a stock market
flotation later this autumn.
The Bridgend-based company, which claims to be an industry leader in hygiene
and microbial testing systems. plans to come to market through a private
placement organised by Allied Provincial, the company's financial advisor
and broker to the issue. In the year to July 31 Biotrace had sales of about
Pounds 2m, roughly double the previous year, and is thought to have made its
first small profit.
Biotrace systems use a natural phenomenon, luciferase, which emits light
when it comes into contact with a substance called Adenosine Triphosphate
(ATP) which is present in all living cells including bacteria. An electronic
instrument called a luminometer is then used to measure the light.
Its rapid hygiene and microbial testing systems are mainly supplied to the
international food and drinks industry. Its products are used by almost all
the top 20 UK and European food and drink manufactures. About one-third of
its systems are installed overseas.
Legislation covering food factory hygiene in Europe and the US is being
tightened, resulting in a rapidly growing market for test systems.
The company was founded five years ago by Mr Ian Johnson, a former Welsh
Water Authority microbiologist, and Mr Colin Griffiths, an accountant, who
retain a 60 per cent equity interest. A further 30 per cent is in the hands
of Questor and Abingworth, two venture capital groups which invested Pounds
1.35m in the company, another 8 per cent is in the hands of a local investor
and the balance is held by the Welsh Development Agency.
Mr Brian Levett, managing director, said the original investors still have
to decide how much of their equity holding will be released to the market.
He said additional funds raised through the placing would mainly be used to
fund an overseas marketing drive. Biotrace already has a direct sales
operation in the US and a marketing partnership in continental Europe with a
Danish group, Foss Electric.
'The plan is to become the world market leader as well as the technological
leader,' Mr Levett said.
Biotrace currently has three new rapid testing systems in its range, the
Multi-Lite which is used for laboratory testing of food and drink, Auto-Lite
used for testing long life products for sterility and its recently launched
Uni-Lite, the first direct hygiene swab monitor.
Biotrace has also sold instruments to companies in other industries
including water treatment, sanitation, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.

FT  04 OCT 93 / UK group wins water contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH West Water has won a Pounds 285m 10-year contract to provide water
services for more than 2m people in Mexico City.
The company said yesterday that this deal was the biggest of four announced
over the weekend as part of a drive to save water. Mexico City, the world's
most densely populated city, relies on an underground aquifer for its water
supply. At current rates of extraction, the aquifer could be exhausted by
the turn of the century.
North West will have 49 per cent of a Mexican joint venture company set up
to administer the contract, which covers nearly a third of the city,
including the most affluent western residential area. Its partner is Grupo
Gutsa, one of the biggest construction groups in Mexico. Each will subscribe
equity to a maximum of Pounds 2m.
Three further consortia have won similar contracts for other parts of the
city. One is led by Severn Trent, another UK water company, while the two
others are led by the French groups Lyonnaise des Eaux and Generale des
Eaux.
Mr Bob Thian, North West's chief executive, described his company's project
as 'one of the most challenging' in the water industry. The company
estimates that a further Pounds 100m of revenues could come later in the
project, when infrastructure is refurbished.
Work will begin later this year, when the company will draw up a
computerised map of the 264,000 water connections in its area. It is
expected to take two years to install meters to double the income of the
city's water authorities.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Bull pleads for FFr9.2bn aid: Alan Cane and John Ridding
report on the plight of the French computer maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPE Bull, the troubled computer manufacturer, is asking the French
government for FFr9.2bn (Pounds 1bn) to fund a package of measures designed
to restore the state-owned company to profitability. The company has lost
FFr15bn in the past three years.
The package includes a fundamental transformation of the way the company
carries out its business. Restructuring will continue and there may be
further factory closures.
Politically sensitive steps, such as phasing out production of personal
computers at Villeneuve D'Ascq, near Lille, and St Joseph, near Chicago, are
not ruled out.
The managing directors of Bull subsidiaries outside France are likely to
find their autonomy drastically curtailed. They will be obliged to follow
business strategies laid down in Paris.
The essential details of the plan have been agreed since the end of June, it
is understood. Over the past three months Mr Bernard Pache, Bull's chairman,
has been negotiating with the government over the size of the investment it
is prepared to make. An announcement is expected soon.
Mr Pache, formerly head of the French coal board, was appointed last year
with instructions to cut costs and return the company to profitability.
The government has put Bull on its list of 21 privatisation candidates, but
the computer manufacturer's parlous state make this a remote prospect.
Observers believe it has little option, therefore, than to make a
significant capital injection.
But this is likely to bring the French government into conflict with the
competition authorities in Brussels, which are already questioning whether
the French are ploughing anti-competitive subsidies into their computer
champion. An investigation into FF2.5bn given in February by the former
government is expected to be announced this week.
Bull, Europe's second largest indigenously owned computer company after
Olivetti of Italy, has been hurt by fundamental changes in the computer
industry. These have forced down prices and profit margins and lessened the
importance of mainframe computers, traditionally the largest contributor to
Bull's revenues.
The company was slow to exploit personal computers. The purchase of Zenith
Data Systems, of the US, to retrieve the situation has proved a disaster.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Hospital group to buy rival for Dollars 5.8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COLUMBIA Healthcare, a fast-growing US hospital company, has agreed to buy
HCA-Hospital Corporation of America in a Dollars 5.8bn all-share deal which
creates the country's largest hospital group.
The merger, agreed by both boards on Saturday, is the most significant sign
so far of consolidation in the US healthcare industry prompted by the
Clinton reform plans and by market pressures for lower medical costs.
The new group, to be known as Columbia HCA Healthcare, will have 190
hospitals and 42,000 beds, mainly in the south and west of the US. It also
has hospitals in London and Geneva.
The deal marks the latest step in the rapid rise of Columbia and its
chairman and chief executive, Mr Richard Scott. Starting the year as a
26-hospital company, Columbia has already completed one merger - with the
Galen hospital group - taking the total to 90 hospitals.
By merging their hospital operations, Columbia and HCA hope to be able to
compete better for business from the regional 'health alliances', through
which most healthcare will be bought under the Clinton plan. The two predict
that the merger will lead to cost savings of Dollars 75m next year and
Dollars 130m in 1995.
Commenting on the quickening pace of mergers in the industry, Mr Scott said
yesterday: 'In the US there are 30 per cent too many hospital beds. Clearly
people cannot afford to pay for it, so we will have to consolidate.'
None of the 190 hospitals in the new group would be closed, he said, though
he added that the company would attempt to buy rivals in areas where there
were too many hospital beds and close them down. He singled out Chicago,
Miami, Houston and Kansas City as cities in need of a reduction in capacity.
Columbia, whose shares closed at Dollars 30 1/4 on Friday, will exchange
1.05 shares for each of the 182m HCA shares outstanding - a significant
premium over the HCA share price, which stood at Dollars 22 7/8 on Friday.
Mr Scott said that based on market estimates for Columbia's earnings, the
deal would not be dilutive, but would increase earnings per share by around
10 cents. He will be president and chief executive of the new group, with Mr
Thomas Frist, chairman of HCA, as chairman.

FT  04 OCT 93 / National champion on the ropes: Alan Cane and John Ridding
report on the plight of the French computer maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the files on the desk of Mr Gerard Longuet, the French minister for
industry, the most problematic is that of Groupe Bull, the loss-making
state-controlled computer manufacturer.
Since taking his post with the new centre-right government in March, Mr
Longuet has repeatedly demanded that the computer group draw up a
restructuring plan aimed at stemming losses which threaten its survival.
'Bull must be taken in hand,' the industry minister said bluntly in July.
Now, after numerous rounds of negotiations between Mr Bernard Pache, Bull's
chairman, and the government, a recovery plan is nearing completion.
Government officials say it is a matter of days, or weeks at the most.
Bull and the government are tight-lipped about the plan. It is understood,
however, that at its heart is a request for a capital injection of FFr9.2bn
(Pounds 1bn) to fund radical restructuring over the next two years. This is
in addition to a contribution of FFr2.5bn approved in February by the
previous government.
Sources close to Bull insist that a capital injection of this magnitude is
necessary if the group is to survive. It is needed to:
restore the balance sheet to a healthy state;
pay for restructuring measures, including factory closures and the loss of
thousands of jobs;
fund a substantial programme of retraining to transform Bull from a
predominantly hardware manufacturer to a global supplier of software and
services, with hardware playing a less important role.
But whether the cash injection can bail out the company will depend on the
plan's acceptance by the European Commission.
The first hurdle for Bull lies in Brussels. Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC
competition commissioner is expected this week to announce an inquiry into
French state capital injections into the computer group. If all, or even
part, of the FFr9.2bn requested under the new plan were to be endorsed by
the French government, this would be added to the scope of the EC inquiry.
Even if the computer group receives approval for a fresh capital
contribution, however, its business strategy and prospects remain highly
uncertain. Losses in the first half of the year mounted to FFr1.98bn from
FFr1.69bn.
Under the management of Mr Pache, chairman since June last year, Bull has
already taken several big steps towards restructuring. In July this year,
the company announced plans to cut its workforce by 6,500 by the end of
1994. This reduction, from a total of 35,175 at the end of last year, is
just the latest step in staff reductions. In 1989, Bull had 47,000
employees.
The new plan, however, is thought to prescribe a structural and managerial
reorganisation more radical than any Bull has yet undergone. It will mean a
profound change in the culture of the company. At present, Bull is organised
by geographic region; under the terms of the new plan it is expected to be
organised by product or service category, a concept sometimes called 'line
of business'. Individual countries will be responsible for implementing, but
not for determining, business strategy.
Radical changes are expected at Zenith Data Systems, a US personal computer
maker which Bull bought in 1989 and which has since proved a heavy drain on
the company's resources. It is thought that virtually all the company's
operational losses of FFr642m in 1992 were attributable to ZDS.
Analysts attribute ZDS's weakness to poor management, including the decision
to continue manufacturing personal computers at Villeneuve d'Ascq in France
and St Joseph, Michigan, where overheads are high.
ZDS today loses money on each PC it sells; sales volume has been improving
over the past two years, magnifying the company's problems. It is thought
the plan will recommend an end to PC manufacturing at Villeneuve and St
Joseph. Instead it suggests further exploitation of the company's link with
Packard Bell, a US PC maker which sources its hardware in east Asia and has
expertise in low-cost marketing and distribution.
In June, Bull announced that it was taking a 19.9 per cent stake in Packard
Bell. Under the terms of the agreement, ZDS and Packard Bell will jointly
design and manufacture desktop PCs while ZDS will supply its American
partner with notebook and sub-notebook computers. The deal will enable Bull
to share production and development costs.
Analysts argue that even if Bull wins the investment requested, it will
still need to build upon existing strategic alliances and to form new
partnerships with other international computer groups.
Within the next two months, for example, the French company is expected to
announce a co-operation agreement with NEC, the Japanese computer company,
for the development of powerful mainframe computers. The agreement with NEC,
which holds just under 5 per cent of Bull's shares, will be aimed at
supplying the top end of the business market, where profit margins are
relatively high.
NEC already provides Bull with its top-end mainframes and some observers
believe it might be prepared to extend its stake in the company to safeguard
its European distribution channel.
Further investment from International Business Machines, which hold a 5.7
per cent stake, is unlikely. Alliances with Europe's remaining hardware
manufacturers, the troubled Olivetti of Italy and Siemens Nixdorf of
Germany, are equally unlikely.
However, Bull would welcome an alliance with a large systems integrator or a
telecommunications company.
Without further alliances and success in cutting costs, the outlook appears
bleak. Continued support for Bull as an integrated computer manufacturer
remains conditional on improved performance. The French budget deficit,
forecast at FFr317bn this year, and resistance from Brussels place a limit
on assistance.
The new plan may, therefore, represent the last throw of the dice for the
struggling computer group.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Economics Notebook: Anatomy of a stalled reform programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Was President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela hounded out of office because
of the price of bus tickets in Caracas? Or because his government failed to
tell people in advance that bus fares were to rise? Or because the increases
were introduced at the end of month when most workers in Caracas had little
left of their monthly pay packets?
The rises in transport prices in February 1991 - three weeks into Mr Perez's
second term of office - triggered riots which engulfed the capital. The
trauma that this set off coloured the rest of his presidency. The fate of Mr
Perez, suspended from office on May 21 this year on corruption charges, may
thus not have been decided by the big decisions of his economic reform
programme but by the apparently insignificant issues he ignored.
As the Russian president Boris Yeltsin is finding out, the path for those
who promote economic reform is not easy. A book* by Moises Naim, a former
industry minister, casts new light on what he calls the 'reverse Midas
touch' of successive Venezuelan governments. It dissects the Perez reform
programme, of which he was part, and zeroes in on its failures. It provides
an object lesson for those with similar projects elsewhere in the world.
Although managing economies dominated by a single commodity is notoriously
difficult - Venezuela earns four fifths of its foreign exchange from oil -
the country was even two years ago regarded as one of the Latin American
countries best placed for success. Now it is viewed as one of the region's
less stable countries, a legacy of two 1992 military coup attempts and a
political crisis as yet unresolved.
Mr Perez took office facing a host of problems: foreign currency reserves
were sorely depleted, the fiscal deficit exceeded 9 per cent of GDP, the
current account deficit was at a record high and prices of most basic
products were artificially and unsustainably repressed.
A system of price controls and regulation had grown up over decades. The
government even controlled the price of a cup of coffee in a cafe - which
was different depending on whether you drank it at the counter or sitting at
a table.
The repression of prices became particularly intense in the last year or so
of the government of President Jaime Lusinchi, Perez's predecessor. It
produced severe shortages of goods and, as in the Soviet Union, supermarket
shelves emptied because of hoarding and capacity closures. On the streets,
tensions rose since this followed years in which most people had become
poorer and public services had deteriorated.
It was against this background that the Caracas bus fare rises took place.
Nobody knew about them in advance: 'In what later proved to be a systematic
flaw of the Perez administration, the government failed to communicate its
decision in a timely and effective manner,' says Naim.
The timing of the increases was bad. Furthermore, the Caracas police force
was in crisis and let rioting take hold. It was a day-and-a-half before
Perez decided to bring in the army.
The government had decided on a shock approach to freeing prices, but it was
not, Naim makes clear, driven by ideology, 'more by the lack of
administrative capacity to introduce reforms gradually'. The price
inspection administration simply was not functioning.
The aim of the government was to replace a system of generalised price
controls and subsidies with programmes aimed directly at the poor. The
government set up parallel organisations to sidestep the traditional
bureaucracies, run for the benefit of political party loyalists and the
trade unions.
During the 1980s, these corrupt bureaucracies were responsible for spending
10 to 14 per cent of GDP on social programmes. The government spent three
times more per head on health than Chile, Jamaica or Panama, but had an
infant mortality rate that was 200 per cent higher than Jamaica's, 80 per
cent higher than Chile's and 30 per cent higher than Panama's. In education,
the government spent more than four times as much per student as Chile,
Jamaica and Argentina, yet suffered the worst illiteracy rates in the
region.
The administration needed the support of the political parties in Congress,
in particular his own Accion Democratica. Yet the AD hierarchy was adamantly
opposed to reform having spent, as Naim says, 'most of the 1980s profiting
from the many opportunities to serve as a broker between society and the
state'. The parties had been captured by special interests and over time the
state came to depend for its survival on the specific groups that benefited
from its policies.
Yet the president and his advisers continued to use the political parties -
and other exhausted organisations such as the trades union and employers'
federations equally remote from the population - to explain policies. His
fatal error may simply have been that he made no effort to reach out direct
to society.
Perez became the lightning rod for the genuine ills suffered by Venezuelans,
who blamed the reform programme rather than the preceding decades of
government incompetence for their troubles. Corruption - ironically probably
lessened by the reform process - became the stick with which to beat him and
eventually remove him from office. The army - the other element in his
downfall - was another exhausted institution without clear organisational
goals.
As the country heads towards presidential and congressional elections in
December, it continues in a state of uncertainty. The element of hope is
that a genuine democracy will be able to override the special interests that
forced the Perez programme into the sand. Venezuela is in transition, but to
what is unclear. Naim quotes the Italian political scientist, Antonio
Gramsci: 'The ancient is dying and the new has yet to be born. In this
interlude, monsters are bred.'

FT  04 OCT 93 / Fiat holds talks on European alliances to cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR GIANNI AGNELLI, the Fiat chairman, said his company had been discussing
possible alliances with other European car-markers to tackle overcapacity
and high production costs.
Though nothing had come of these talks, he said further significant
consolidation of the European car business was inevitable. It would perhaps
be triggered by one of the bigger manufacturers drawing clearly ahead of the
rest.
Mr Agnelli would not identify companies with which Fiat might co-operate.
But he said that 'in Europe, there are too many brands. I think we need to
reduce them'. He explained: 'If something happens, and one producer rises to
24 per cent of the market, then the whole thing starts moving.' The European
car market is split between six main producers, with Volkswagen, the
biggest, accounting for about 17 per cent.
Fiat last week announced a L966bn (Pounds 400m) net loss for the first half
of 1993, caused by the steep fall in demand for cars in Europe.
Fiat, which last week launched Italy's biggest rights issue, also said it
would sell its 58 per cent stake in La Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailing
group, to generate additional funds. Ifil, the quoted investment company
dominated by Agnelli family interests, is a likely buyer. The disposal is
likely to generate an extraordinary gain of L437bn.
Mr Agnelli added that the need for austerity would put pressure on Fiat's
ability to pay a dividend. Stressing that a decision was still up to the
board next May, he hoped it would at least be possible to pay holders of
Fiat's non-voting savings stock.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Clarke hints at Pounds 6bn tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke yesterday fuelled expectations among ministerial
colleagues that he is considering Budget tax increases of between Pounds 4bn
and Pounds 6bn by flatly rejecting further cuts in public spending.
Speaking on the eve of the Conservative party conference, the chancellor
said the Treasury's existing targets had already produced the 'bloodiest'
spending round since the Conservatives took office in 1979.
His comments came as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said the
Blackpool conference would mark the beginning of the government's political
recovery. In an interview with the FT, Mr Hurd also dismissed suggestions of
a crisis surrounding Mr John Major's leadership.
Mr Clarke, however, predicted that the public spending details when
publicised would cause 'howls of rage' and hinted at cutbacks in the civil
service, a fresh round of defence cuts and restrictions on a range of
welfare benefits. Other ministers said the government's housing, roads and
public transport budgets were among the main victims.
Mr Clarke has summoned his Treasury team to a planning session at his
Dorneywood country house in mid-October to agree the broad framework for his
November 30 Budget.
But although he has taken no firm decisions yet on the scale and
distribution of tax increases, colleagues said that a 'significant' rise now
looked inevitable to curb public borrowing. Mr Clarke's blunt assessment of
the outlook for borrowing and spending reinforced fears in the Conservative
party hierarchy of a stormy mood at a conference seen as critical to Mr
Major's hold on the premiership.
The chancellor insisted that the threat of a grass roots rebellion would not
force a retreat from the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel.
Speaking on independent television's Walden programme, he said the Treasury
would retain the timetable for an 8 per cent levy next April, moving up to
the full 17.5 per cent in 1995.
The chancellor also gave a clear hint that he was sticking to his plans to
secure a faster reduction in the government's Pounds 50bn annual borrowing
requirement. With the Treasury warning that a pick-up in the rate of
economic growth has yet to make any significant dent in the borrowing
requirement, senior ministers said the mood in the cabinet pointed to a net
increase in tax of between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 6bn. That would be in
addition to the Pounds 6bn of tax increases for 1994-95 and the Pounds 10bn
for 1995-96 already put in place by Mr Lamont.
Mr Clarke hinted that tax increases should fall on those items currently
zero-rated for VAT. Some of the chancellor's colleagues expect that he may
seek to get the bulk of the additional revenue by restricting income tax
allowances to the 20p lower rate of income tax.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Lord Chief Justice backs curbs on right to silence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSIAL government proposals to curb a suspect's so-called right to
silence have won the backing of Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice.
The proposals are among tough measures to be announced by Mr Michael Howard,
home secretary, on Wednesday at the Conservative Party conference.
Under the government's plans, trial judges would be able to comment to the
jury on a defendant's failure to answer reasonable questions put to him at a
police station.
At present, judges have to tell juries that a defendant's refusal to answer
police questions should not be a factor in deciding guilt or innocence.
The move would necessitate a change in the police caution to suspects. The
police would have to say that although a suspect is not obliged to answer
questions, failure to do so might be the subject of adverse comments by the
judge at the trial.
Speaking at the bar's annual conference in London at the weekend, Lord
Taylor said he supported change. 'I feel there are circumstances in which it
should be open to a judge to comment on the defendant's failure to respond
to questions.'
It was important he said that it be left to the judge to decide in each case
whether comment should be made.
Lord Taylor confirmed his opposition to abolition of the defendant's right
to a jury trial in cases that can be tried by magistrates or at the Crown
Court.
That was the most controversial of the 352 recommendations made by the Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice in July.

FT  04 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Telephone banking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to gain the impression from reading the advertisements that
telephone delivery of financial services is the coming thing. Yet
uncertainties remain where banking is concerned. While Midland Bank's
Firstdirect is proud to point to the number of bills it pays, it remains
remarkably coy about customer balances in its accounts. The suspicion is
that while it offers a convenient and cheap transaction service, it finds it
harder to attract retail deposits. That would be natural for two reasons.
People tend instinctively to prefer placing their savings in an actual
branch rather than dispose of them remotely down the phone; users of
telephone banking tend to be professional people who are unlikely to leave
money lying idle in current accounts.
That raises the question of whether the efficiency advantage of a low-cost
transaction service outweighs the cost of forgoing some of the profits from
cheap retail deposits that flow readily into a branch network. If it does
not, Firstdirect may not become a real money spinner, while Barclays and
National Westminster would be right to talk more of bolt-on services.
Yet the conclusion changes again when one considers the industry trend away
from using cheap deposits to subsidise current account transaction services.
Most expect this will eventually lead to charges on current accounts. When
that happens, organisations like Firstdirect, which are already set up to
provide a value-for-money transaction service, will have a distinct edge.

FT  04 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Goode Committee's suggestion that the government should tailor gilts
especially for pension funds prompts the question of what such instruments
might look like. Since many pension fund liabilities are subject to limited
price indexation - where pensions in payment are increased in line with the
retail price index up to a maximum of 5 per cent - a bond offering a return
on the same basis would provide a clear match. Rather than paying a cash
yield, which pension funds then have to reinvest, index-linked bonds issued
at a deep discount to face value would remove another element of risk.
Such gilts would please many in the pensions industry. If they offered index
linking up to 5 per cent, they could be sold at an even deeper discount than
a bond which fully compensates for inflation. That would help pension funds
match their liabilities in a particularly productive way. The government's
attitude would doubtless turn on cost. But if inflation protection was
limited, its debt repayment burden would lessen if prices rose at more than
5 per cent. Gilts linked fully to the RPI provide the Treasury with a
particularly harsh discipline.
Such innovation would have to be on a modest scale at first, but it could
still be useful. Pension funds which are faced with winding up could buy
such instruments instead of expensive deferred annuities from insurance
companies. More important, the instrument would provide a clear benchmark
against which the solvency of all pension funds could be measured.

FT  04 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Greycoat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rescue package for Greycoat may not be voted through this week if the
entrenched growls coming from both Postel and the company's preference
shareholders are any guide. A complex balance between different groups of
creditors will make adjustments to the basic deal difficult unless Postel is
prepared to sweeten the deal for preference shareholders itself. Yet that
would leave it open to further pressure from other groups.
Since the alternative to accepting Postel's offer is probably putting
Greycoat into administration, the company's management is naturally
enthusiastic. Preference shareholders may only be bluffing in their
resistance to the Greycoat plan, but they have to balance a number of
competing factors. While they would not have to cede any value to ordinary
shareholders if the company were wound up, neither would they benefit from
the interest concessions offered by the banks as part of the Postel scheme.
Then there is the valuation of Greycoat's properties. The current
renaissance in property is largely confined to assets with cast-iron cash
flows. Most of Greycoat's portfolio arguably fits into that category, so
that the preference holders might decide it was worth hanging on. Then again
there is the danger that delay will impose its own cost. As Alistair Ross
Goobey, Postel's chief executive, has committed himself to standing pat he
may feel he cannot move now. The preference shareholders may crumble, but in
such a game of bluff that will not be until the last. And the 75 per cent of
acceptances needed hardly helps Postel's cause.

FT  04 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling's silver lining
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The party conference season is often an anxious time for sterling. Last week
saw a wobble on worries that the prime minister's authority would take
another knock at Blackpool and that interest rates would be cut to regain
some political bounce. This week will show if such fears are justified. On
the surface, though, they look distinctly overdone. A rate cut at conference
time was a favourite trick of Lady Thatcher's. Politically inspired cuts
have become controversial since the pointedly disparaging remarks in Norman
Lamont's resignation speech. While Mr Major may be in for a rough ride, it
is hard to discern a shock with palpable economic consequences.
One risk is that a bitter row over VAT on fuel may convince the markets that
the government is unable to confront its deficit problem. But the City has
been shading down its estimates of the PSBR and has given up expecting much
by way of tax increases in November. The extension of VAT to items other
than fuel - newspapers look a particularly obvious candidate after recent
price-cutting - offers some compromise between those Conservative who want
to maintain services and those who dislike direct tax increases. It might
just suffice.
Raising revenue through VAT will increase the headline inflation rate,
however. That may be a further reason for caution on interest rate cuts. The
money markets are discounting a mere half point fall by the end of the year.
Sterling would be well under-pinned for the next few months if that is all
that happens while continental countries cut much more.

FT  04 OCT 93 / A patriarch constrained: Fiat's chairman Gianni Agnelli,
faced with criticism of his refinancing plans, talks to Peter Martin and
Haig Simonian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gianni Agnelli, l'avvocato, sometimes called the uncrowned king of Italy,
hunches forward on the pink sofa in a smart Paris hotel and ponders the
question: is he worried?
Most people would say he has a lot to be worried about. Fiat, the car
company his grandfather founded, is on course to make a pretax loss he puts
at 'around L2,000bn' (Dollars 1.25bn) in the current year; he has just had
to prop up its finances with Italy's biggest rights issue; like other large
groups, it has been implicated in Italy's bribery scandals; its share of a
shrinking Italian car market has dropped from 60 per cent a few years ago to
around 45 per cent; and he himself, at the age of 72, has had to postpone
his retirement from the chair to see the company through its difficulties.
Still, there is no real pause before he answers: 'I'm worried about being in
the motor car business. I'm not worried about being in Italy, though it's
problematic. But I do think that we've done everything necessary to try.'
Certainly, he does not seem oppressed by the problems that surround him. His
features, once famously handsome, are now broader, more grizzled, the face
of a patriarch rather than a playboy. The idiosyncratic Agnelli style of
dress, once aped across the continent, has taken on grandfatherly overtones:
his wristwatch, still worn over the shirt-cuff, now has larger,
easier-to-read numbers. But his conversation is relaxed, his manner
unthreatened, his smile as dangerously charming as ever.
It comes into play right at the outset, as he starts the interview by
attacking his critics. Some stockbrokers' analysts, quoted in the FT and
elsewhere, disliked one aspect of last week's capital raising exercise: a
deal to sell Fiat's controlling stake in the profitable Rinascente
department store chain. Because the sale is not to a third party, but to
Ifil, another quoted company in the Agnelli empire and itself a major Fiat
shareholder, it seemed an artificial contrivance, and one that threatened to
treat at least some of the outside shareholders unfairly.
Nonsense, said Mr Agnelli: he was walking a tightrope in trying to deal
fairly with all the various interests: Rinascente shareholders, Fiat
shareholders, Ifil shareholders. 'I must navigate between Scylla and
Charybdis'. In any case, who was to say that the deal would go through?
Perhaps another bidder would emerge: 'Once the ball is in the field to play,
anybody can play it. If somebody makes a higher price, we're very happy for
them to have it.'
It is, to be sure, a bad time to be making disposals, but Fiat's financial
needs are pressing. The company's problems stem in part from the continental
recession, in part from the fiercely competitive nature of the European car
market. Six big rivals, all with roughly the same market share, fight one
another for sales that are threatened by the surge of Japanese production in
Britain. Though the Japanese threat is new, the competition is not.
'Our philosophy, what I've tried to do, is to make Fiat as big as possible.'
That accounts, in part, for Fiat's huge market share at home. Surely that is
now doomed, thanks to the single market and the changes in restrictions on
Japanese imports? Mr Agnelli disagrees politely: 'Of that I'm not so sure.
We went down below 45 per cent, now we're back to that and we're not
declining. We should be able to hang on to that.' After all, he says, in
France the domestic producers, Renault and Peugeot-Citroen, have roughly
that figure between them.
But Fiat's European market share, like that of most of its competitors, is
12 per cent, 'and that's very little'. So 12 per cent is not a sustainable
long term market share? 'That's my impression. I don't think it's the right
balance.'
As a result, he foresees further sweeping changes in the structure of the
European industry, which has already seen the gobbling up of all the
second-tier manufacturers and, just this year, the announcement of a
full-scale merger between Volvo and Renault.
The companies are constantly talking to each other about alliances, says Mr
Agnelli. 'First of all when you talk, you discuss is it technically
possible, who is it technically feasible with - an American company, a
private French company, a state-owned company - what sort of combination are
they going to work out? And then you've got to see the industrial logic. So
one is always playing with the idea of all these deals. I won't say any
further than that.'
Surely the mergers up till now have been mainly the strong taking over the
weak? Is it feasible to expect mergers between strong companies, especially
given the cultural barriers? Yes, says Mr Agnelli, it is - and the cultural
barriers to cross-border mergers, for example, have largely disappeared as
Europe's younger generation, at least on the continent, becomes used to
working with people of other nationalities.
What would bring about such a merger? 'Well, I personally think that if
something happens, and one producer rises to 24 per cent of the European
market, then the whole thing starts moving.'
Will he be the one to start that process? 'I don't know when, who, how,' he
says. But remember that Volkswagen is already up to 17 per cent market
share, and 'before these recent troubles, Volkswagen was pretty
imperialistic.'
VW's current problems stem in part from overmanning and high costs, which it
is now trying to tackle, most spectacularly by importing Mr Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua from General Motors in Detroit. Some analysts say that
Fiat has to take similar steps, though on a less drastic scale.
What does Mr Agnelli say to that? 'It can be done. Cost cutting means
personnel reduction. We live in a country, Italy, whose philosophy is
Catholic, solidaristic, Marxist,' and that imposes limits on any cuts.
Still, 'some has been done, and we have to go on. But I surely would never
dare say like they did in Daimler-Benz that they have to get rid of 45,000
people.' Would he like to have an equivalent of VW's Mr Lopez? There are
lots of efficient cost-cutters at Fiat, he says, 'just not so glamorous.'
One question much discussed in Italy is the future of the old Alfa-Romeo
plant at Arese, near Milan. Will it be closed? 'Let's just say it doesn't
have a growing future.'
Not even the Agnelli family is immune from personnel pressures these day. Mr
Agnelli's brother, Umberto, is the most recent casualty of blighted
expectations, deprived of his planned succession to the chairmanship next
summer. Gianni Agnelli will retain the chairmanship; Mr Cesare Romiti,
managing director, will also stay on.
Was the decision to stay as chairman forced on him? And is this the first
sign that his freedom of action will increasingly be constrained? Mr Agnelli
does not answer the question directly. 'I am going to the market for a huge
amount of money, I have partners coming in and they say 'For God's sake, you
aren't going to do all this and then leave'.'
The partners are Germany's Deutsche Bank, the Italian merchant bank
Mediobanca, Italy's largest insurer Generali, and Alcatel Alsthom, the
French industrial group. Between them they will own 10 per cent of Fiat's
voting shares, held as part of a 'hard core' of shareholders, including two
Agnelli companies, that altogether controls 30 per cent of Fiat votes.
Another 10 per cent of Agnelli family interests remain outside the hard core
 -so as to avoid swamping the minority partners, says Mr Agnelli.
How long will he now stay on as chairman? 'I said three years but what I
really mean is that I would like to see it through this difficult moment,'
he says.
Where does that leave Umberto? 'I am convinced,' says Gianni Agnelli, 'that
my brother is the best person to be chairman of Fiat. Everything he does,
he's always done much better than me. He's much more serious than me, he's
worked much harder than I have, he's 15 years younger - I'm an old man.'
But in endorsing Umberto, he said, he was expressing a personal opinion and
could not speak for others. 'With the hard core, the chairman will not be
elected alone by the family, there will be a consensus of others. I can't
see why they would not give their consent, but I can't speak for them.'
So how much will the arrangement with the new partners tie his hands? 'We
have just started to work together. I am curious to see how much interest
they will take.' Won't their presence on a new, slimmed-down, more hands-on
board limit his freedom of manoeuvre? 'We will see, working together. I hope
that they will give good advice. I don't know how much time they will want
to dedicate, how much attention - I hope it will be a lot.' Dr Ulrich Weiss,
the Deutsche Bank representative on the board, has been a member for some
years. Will his role change? Mr Agnelli says: 'He said to me 'now in these
circumstances we're going to ask more questions'.'
One subject any board member will find it hard to avoid is Fiat's role in
Italy's pervasive political corruption. The company seems to have made some
sort of peace with the prosecutors, but senior executives are still under
investigation. How does Mr Agnelli feel about his company's involvement?
'I was very ashamed,' he says bluntly. But his shame clearly has limits:
'Ninety per cent of the Fiat trouble came from one company, the construction
company Cogefar. If we hadn't taken over that company, (Fiat's involvement)
would have been 10 per cent of what it is.' When Fiat took over Cogefar, 'I
was very afraid' of the construction industry's notorious reputation for
corruption. 'And then it appeared to be exactly what I feared.' Fiat has
imposed strict new anti-bribery rules, he says.
The corruption scandal has had one beneficial side-effect: the government
led by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, former governor of the central bank, which is
starting to tackle some of the country's neglected economic problems. Mr
Ciampi is a technocrat, not a politician. 'C'est un commissaire de gestion,'
says Mr Agnelli, slipping into French.
'Personally I think that if one could run a country forever like that it
would be ideal.' Obviously that isn't possible, he says wistfully. Still,
the recent, quite new, budgetary discipline 'shows that this country has got
elasticity and capacity of recovery.'
There has been one other helpful Italian development: last year's
devaluation. Without it, Fiat's losses would have been still more
disastrous. 'I was absolutely convinced that we should devalue,' says Mr
Agnelli. 'One should aim at a common currency, one should aim at a common
central bank,' but this is only feasible at the moment for Germany, France
and Benelux, plus Austria and Switzerland. They could form a hard core, he
says, which Italy, the UK and Spain could converge towards. So he doesn't
have any problems with a two-speed Europe? 'Well, I mean, it is two speeds -
what can you do about it?'
Does he feel sad that at the end of his career, he is presiding over a
company in difficulties? 'No, absolutely not. I've seen such ups and downs,
at Fiat and in my life, that I just take that as part of life, part of
industrial history. You have very little scope for determining things by
yourself.'
Does he expect Agnelli family control to survive into the next generation?
'I hope so. Everything finishes in time - but I don't think I will see it
finish.'

FT  04 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Brazil and its constitution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's legislators have an historic chance this week to improve the lot of
the people who voted for them. On Wednesday they are due to start work on
revising the country's 1988 constitution, which has been an important
hindrance to sensible government. If the opportunity is used wisely, a big
step will have been taken towards improving economic management. With
presidential and congressional elections due next year, constitutional
revision could even open the way for a more fundamental resolution of the
country's difficulties.
Part of the problem lies in the current constitution's sheer complexity. The
best constitutions are relatively simple: that of the US and its 27
amendments can be printed on six sides of paper. By contrast, the Brazilian
constitution's 123 pages represent more of a wish list from legislators
after 20 years of military government than a coherent code of individual
rights and state powers. This has made Brazil - already difficult to govern
because of its size and diversity  - almost impossible to rule responsibly.
It has been all too effective in constraining the federal government in the
fight against inflation, doling out a huge proportion of federal government
revenues to the states and municipalities but leaving the concomitant
responsibilities - for example for education - with the federal government.
As a result local governments have engaged in a frenzy of hiring and
spending, while the central government has been faced with an increasing
structural fiscal deficit.
Rising inflation
This deficit - the public sector borrowing requirement last year equalled 40
per cent of gross domestic product - has been driving inflation. Now
touching 35 per cent a month, inflation could rise to 40 per cent by the
year-end. That this has not already generated consensus among legislators on
the dangers of the fiscal deficit reflects conventional Brazilian wisdom
that unemployment is a greater problem than inflation, and continuing
confidence in economic growth - this year expected to be about 5 per cent.
Yet inflation is now calling the durability of that growth into doubt. Signs
of public unrest - street protests and clashes between the police and the
poor - suggest that traditional Brazilian passivity in the face of inflation
is breaking down.
In leading the campaign for a revision, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the
finance minister, acknowledges that the current constitution is a source of
fiscal indiscipline. The constitutional assembly should start by addressing
the mismatch of revenues and responsibilities between the centre and the
regions. Given Brasilia's own propensity for waste, responsibilities should
be devolved to the regions rather than more revenues kept at the centre.
Job restrictions
Other constraints on sensible fiscal management can also be lifted.
Constitutional provisions guaranteeing the jobs of government employees for
life and providing them with unequalled benefits during work and retirement
should be abolished. Those restrictions, which are holding up the
privatisation of state-run companies, should be repealed. While they are
about it, legislators might also consider lifting the restrictions on
foreign investment in some industries - in particular mining.
Ideally, any constitutional revision would go much further. The system
inherited from the military which grants disproportionate say in Congress to
the small north-eastern states should be revised. Powers to tax and spend
should be devolved to the states, after which the poorest states should be
helped by transparent and explicit transfers from Brasilia that depend more
on genuine need than on influence-peddling. A far-sighted assembly would
also take steps to consolidate the country's fragmented political system.
There are 18 political parties in Congress and the votes of all the deputies
from the four largest are required to obtain a simple majority in the lower
house.
Unfortunately, it may be too much to hope that a radically simplified and
rational constitution will emerge at the end of this process. But if
Brasilia's notorious political rivalries kill off even those modest
proposals that would help get a grip on inflation, those responsible could
well rue the day.

The Yorkshire Bank has stumbled on a novel way to gauge staff satisfaction.
'Straight, friendly bank seeks like-minded customers for long-standing
relationship' goes the advertisement that has been running for a while in
areas where the northern bank has been opening new branches.
But the slogan has suddenly started to elicit the wrong sort of attention.
Complaints have reached the bank, as well as the letters column of the
advertising industry journal Campaign, that this supposedly demonstrates
anti-gay prejudice.
'We're quite surprised,' says a spokeswoman. 'Frankly, we are all gay here,
meaning we are very happy at our work'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After attending a company-sponsored concert which included Schubert's
Unfinished Symphony, a management consultant writes to the chairman of a
European car manufacturer as follows:
The four oboists, who were idle for lengthy periods, should be disposed of
and their work spread over the rest of the orchestra.
In each of the heavily staffed string sections, the players were all playing
identical notes. Headcounts should be cut across the board, peak demands for
volume being met by amplifiers.
Much skill and energy were expended on playing demi-semiquavers. This
excessive refinement should be dropped and notes rounded up to the nearest
quaver, allowing use of lower-grade operatives and making an interval
unnecessary.
Passages played by one section, such as the strings, were frequently
repeated by another. If such wasteful repetitions were also eliminated, the
concert-time would fall from two hours to, at most 40 minutes, even if the
symphony were played to a conclusion.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was only going to be a matter of time before one or other of the UK
Treasury's panel of 'seven wise men' was called away to impart his wisdom in
another corner of the globe.
Retired Cambridge professor Wynne Godley will be ensconced for at least the
next year at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute in New York state, and has
advised the Treasury that he cannot afford the air fare to the London
meetings, tomorrow and next week, of the panel of outside economists.
But the engaging Godley, who has foretold the UK's economic travails better
than most, has no intention of stepping down voluntarily.
He intends to communicate by fax, a decision which may not go amiss with
Treasury chief economic adviser Alan Budd, who chairs the discussions and
has on occasion had to use all his charm to put a lid on the simmering feud
between Godley and fellow wise man Tim Congdon.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke may, however, seek more commitment from the panel
he is to meet for the first time tomorrow week. So, should he want to boot
out the Cambridge gloomster, where should he turn?
Flicking through the diary to October 14, Clarke will see he is meeting
Andrew Dilnot, bright young director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies,
who will be arguing the case for increased taxes in next month's Budget.
What better opportunity to impress the cabinet minister on a subject
supposedly dear to his heart?

Whilst lunching alone at a restaurant near the House of Commons, shadow

A man sitting nearby promptly introduced himself as a director of a company
recently acquired by Anglo-American conglomerate Hanson.
Infuriated by what he saw as the new owner's policy of cutting investment,
he had naturally relished the opportunity to wine, if not dine, the senior

FT  04 OCT 93 / Observer: Chasing a larger union?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was never going to be easy for IG Metall, Germany's mighty engineering
workers' union, to find a replacement for Franz Steinkuhler, its charismatic
former boss who resigned after allegations of insider dealing back in May.
At an extraordinary congress in Mainz on Saturday, the carefully
orchestrated process of passing the baton to Steinkuhler's former deputy,
Klaus Zwickel, almost came unstuck when a member from Wuppertal stormed onto
the platform, denounced the leadership, and suggested the previous chief
should return.
For a couple of minutes, the hall was in uproar, until Steinkuhler himself
strode to the rostrum.
'You cannot turn back the pages of history,' he said, declining the
nomination. 'We need to make a new start.'
Steinkuhler himself has not been letting the grass grow under his feet, it
would seem. Indeed, Observer can reveal that he is using part of his
enforced leisure time to learn English, an intensive four hours every
morning.
Which lends a little extra credence to rumours that the ex-union leader
might just be lining himself up as one of the German candidates for the new
European Commission next year.
Such a move would certainly be welcome in Brussels, where a strong and
articulate German commissioner would represent something of a turn-up for
the books.
Steinkuhler has certainly always enjoyed surprisingly good relations with
one rather crucial ally in the nomination process, namely Chancellor Helmut
Kohl himself.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Euro airline alliances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Match-making in the European airline industry is at fever pitch. Later
today, Germany's Lufthansa is expected to announce a far-reaching alliance
with United Airlines, the second biggest US carrier. At the same time,
negotiations between Scandinavian Airlines System, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,
Swissair and Austrian Airlines about forming a new force in the European
market have reached a critical stage. Both initiatives are, in part, a
response to British Airways' recent acquisition of a 24.9 per cent stake in
USAir as part of its strategy of converting itself from national
flag-carrier into global airline.
The wave of mergers, joint ventures, co-operation agreements and the like
presents both opportunities and dangers for Europe's airline passengers.
Theoretically, it could sweep away national monopolies and replace them with
competing global carriers. In the process, economies of scale could be
achieved, fares cut from excessive levels and passengers offered the
convenience of choosing between a number of one-stop shops capable of flying
them almost anywhere in the world.
The downside risk is that the industry will turn itself once again into a
global cartel. The industry's monopolistic traditions are certainly cause
for concern. So is the recession, which has cost Europe's airlines Dollars
3bn in the past three years. Several European state-owned airlines are
already trying to avoid the consequences of the European Community's
recently implemented open skies policy by pleading for further injections of
state aid. There has also been a call for a return to old cartel practices.
Fortunately, the Commission has so far said no, but political pressures are
strong.
It might seem that the Commission should guard against cartelisation by
taking a hard line against alliances. But this would not be the optimal
policy. The current patchwork of national carriers is not an efficient
industry structure but a testimony to the industry's monopoly past.
Restructuring on global lines will, in many cases, produce a more rational
structure.
Opening markets
A better antidote to cartelisation would be further opening up of markets.
Despite recent liberalisation, substantial barriers to entry remain. The
Commission and national governments should focus on three areas. First,
enabling new entrants to get access to take-off and landing slots at
congested airports. In part, this will involve increasing the overall supply
of slots by improving the infrastructure in air and on ground. But it will
also be necessary in some cases to remove slots from dominant players. The
European Commission has proposals on these lines, but they are so
controversial that they have yet to be put to member states for approval.
Second, a crackdown on unfair competition. Central to this should be a
continued hard line by the Commission on state subsidies. But it will also
be increasingly necessary to prevent predatory behaviour as the industry
consolidates into a smaller number of larger groups. Dominant players must
not think that they will be allowed to drive new entrants out of the market
by pricing below costs or engaging in other underhand tactics.
Free competition
Third, freeing up competition on transatlantic and other intercontinental
routes. The current bilateral pacts between national governments are in
general highly restrictive, often underwriting back-door carve-ups of
markets between established players. Such anti-competitive measures are
reinforced by laws preventing non-EC groups owning more than 49 per cent of
an EC airline and parallel restrictions in other jurisdictions.
Further opening up of airline markets in Europe would certainly be painful
for many of the established players. Some of them would certainly not
survive in their current form, which would cause political difficulties
given the emotional attachment most countries have to their flag-carriers.
But the current alliances must go hand in hand with a further dose of
liberalisation. Otherwise, the industry will merely find a new way to cling
on to its cartel practices. That would be bad for passengers and probably
against the industry's long-term interests too. Governments and the
Commission must act.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Emu not a discredited objective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SZEMEREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his very sound article 'More Maastricht to come' (September 27) Ian
Davidson errs in referring to 'the old (and discredited) objective of
European Monetary Union'.
He should not fall into the trap of mouthing excuses thought up by
politicians whose policies have failed and who, like a bad carpenter, either
blame their tools or pretend that the objective was wrong.
No, sir. European Monetary Union is still very much on the cards. And why
not? There has been a British Monetary Union in the UK for years. No-one
challenges or questions that. Its advantages are so obvious that it is taken
for granted. Why should not the countries of the European Community enjoy
similar advantages?
Monetary union will facilitate the free movement of people throughout the
European Community and it will be a major boost to community-wide trade.
The difficulty is how to get from the present situation of each EC country
(except Belgium and Luxembourg, which already have a monetary union) having
its own currency and its own economic and monetary policies, to the target
situation of the European Community having one currency. And this
accompanied, as it must be, by one economic and monetary policy. The ERM is
one means of getting from the status quo to the target situation. Britain's
prime minister, John Major, has himself suggested another (the 'hard Ecu').
And there are others.
What is needed now is an objective assessment of what went wrong with the
ERM and either the modification of the ERM to ensure that similar monetary
disturbances do not happen again or the replacement of ERM by some other
system that avoids the identified pitfalls. Then full speed ahead to Emu.
We should not fool ourselves by believing the excuses of politicians who
have failed.

Supporters as well as opponents of freer world trade have been bemused by
the much repeated figure of Dollars 213bn as the annual gain to world income
resulting from a successful conclusion to the Gatt negotiations.
This figure is a bona fide estimate, which underestimates the likely gains.
It comes from a joint OECD-World Bank study, which has appeared in a variety
of forms culminating in the present study; and the net effect has not been
user-friendly. For, like so many modern researchers, the authors find it
terribly difficult to strike a middle way between exhaustive technical
description and excessively short executive summaries, in which numbers are
thrown out on a take-or-leave it basis.
The first and simplest question is: to what does the figure refer? The more
precise estimate of Dollars 213bn is the difference between world real
income in the year 2002 based on the projecting of existing trends, and
world real income assuming a successful conclusion of the Gatt round - all
expressed in dollars of 1992 purchasing power. Is it a high or low number?
If you want to make it seem high you can say that it is about half the
present income of China. If you want to make it seem low you can say that it
is about three-quarters of a per cent of estimated world GNP in 2002.
A fractional increase of this size is not in fact small. It is nearly a
third of a normal year's growth in a typical OECD country. Moreover it is
completely wrong to compare it, as some politicians do, with a monetary or
fiscal boost, or business cycle spurt, of comparable magnitude. It is an
efficiency gain which gradually accumulates over a decade; and unlike a
short-term boost, is unlikely to be reversed.
The study assumes that a successful Gatt round is roughly equivalent to a 30
per cent cut in effective protection both for agriculture and for industry.
But because the agricultural barriers are now much higher than industrial
tariffs, the bulk of the gain comes from freeing agriculture.
There are some subtleties in the analysis. For the greatest early gains are
associated with increases, rather than decreases, in the world price of
cereals and other main temperate products. This is because subsidies and
other distortions artificially depress prices on international markets, but
often raise those at home. For example, the domestic price of cereal crops
in the EC is 50 per cent higher than the world one. This difference, which
some economists call 'the wedge', was 250 per cent for Japan, largely due to
the heavy protection of indigenous rice producers.
Many of the initial gains will come from removing such price distortions,
which discourage consumers from spending their income in a way which
reflects the opportunities open to them in the international markets.
Ultimately the producer gains will follow too, as resources are switched
from, say, uneconomic European farms to products in which European countries
have a true advantage.
In the EC, the average consumer paid in 1992 Dollars 450 for agricultural
protection. In the US he paid Dollars 360 and in Japan Dollars 600. It is
because these losses are so high that the greatest gains are shown to these
parts of the world. The main losers are a few developing countries which are
also heavy food importers; but they have loyally supported the trade talks.
Why is the study an understatement? Most obviously, because it excludes
services and industrial import quotas, which are difficult to quantify but
feature largely in the Gatt talks. Moreover most such studies concentrate on
essentially locational changes in the composition of consumption and
production and cannot really quantify the possibly large dynamic gains as
those emerging from more competition for sleepy producers.
One benefit which the authors do try to quantify is the beneficial effect on
jobs from higher real income. The idea is that if real incomes are boosted
by lowering protective barriers at given rates of wages, European workers
will be less likely to insist on pushing wages above market clearing levels;
and economies will be able to run with lower reserves of unemployment
without incurring runaway inflation. But because the forces behind
unemployment are so controversial and little understood, the authors wisely
leave out such effects from their main projections.
Meanwhile it is a reflection on the cramping influence of pressure group
politics and bogus rural romanticism that the countries which would gain
most from freer agricultural trade are proving most obdurate in the current
talks.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFF ARNOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was disappointed to read the quotes from Roger Key, partner at
consulting actuaries, R Watson and Sons, in your story 'Goode report strikes
a fine balance' (October 1) and in the Lex column ('Goode intentions') in
reaction to the Goode report recommendation on a 90 per cent solvency floor
test for a final salary pensions scheme's wind-up position.
They were, respectively, that 'many actuaries are likely to recommend that
schemes switch their investments to gilts which historically have yielded
less than equities' and that 'heavier investment in gilts would surely
result'.
By the judicious use of derivatives (one market-leading investment house has
a Guaranteed Fund, which gives a 90 per cent guarantee on the value of
equities purchased based on previous years price highs) the potential
problem subsequently becomes an attractive opportunity.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Search for wealth in the waste: Bronwen Maddox assesses the
economic case for the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fierce debate about whether the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in
Cumbria should get the go-ahead moves a step further towards resolution
today, with the end of a two-month public consultation.
One of the tasks of the consultation is to weigh up whether there is an
economic case for the plant. Responses have poured in from both sides of the
debate, and officials at the UK Department of the Environment's damp-stained
1970s tower block in Westminster must now weigh up the arguments. A final
decision on the plant's fate is expected later this year.
Meanwhile, British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, waits to find if its
10-year project, which has consumed Pounds 2.8bn, has a future. The plant is
designed to take used fuel rods from nuclear power stations and separate out
the reusable plutonium and uranium, leaving a smaller amount of unusable
radioactive waste. Its engineers are now testing the plant with small
amounts of uranium to ensure that the gleaming steel pipes and the tiers of
computer screens are ready to start immediately if the government grants a
licence.
The decision about whether to approve the plant is one of the most
controversial industrial decisions facing the government. Greenpeace, the
environmental pressure group, has already taken the government to court,
though it failed to block testing of the plant. BNF, which has no other
source of long-term business, has said Britain's international reputation
for nuclear expertise will be irrevocably damaged if the plant is abandoned.
The government has said that it is 'minded' to give the go-ahead on the
basis of an earlier public consultation this year, which concluded that
there were no environmental or health risks. But the attorney-general said
in May it also had to consider the economic case for the plant, as well as
the issue of the proliferation of nuclear weapons capability. If the plant
makes a loss, taxpayers will foot the bill. If Thorp saddles UK nuclear
power companies with higher costs than other methods of disposing of fuel
rods, electricity consumers will pay.
Assessment of the economic case, however, is far from easy. At the heart of
the debate is BNF's claim that, if the plant is abandoned, the UK will lose
at least Pounds 950m in profits over the first 10 years of the plant's life.
The UK might also have to pay back some of the Pounds 1bn-odd of foreign
customers' money used to build the plant.
BNF's claim takes account of the revenue that would be lost if Thorp were
abandoned, the savings from not having to run the plant or decommission it
at the end of its life, and the expense of building alternative stores for
the fuel.
Thorp's critics have attacked the Pounds 950m figure - which has not been
audited by the government - on several grounds. The revenue from Thorp, they
say, will not be as high as BNF predicts. Although Thorp has Pounds 9bn of
contracted orders for its first decade, critics question whether customers
will honour the contracts.
The reason for doubt is that reprocessing now looks more expensive than
other methods of treating used nuclear fuel, such as 'dry storage' - storing
the fuel for years without separating its components before a final decision
about how to dispose of it. Greenpeace argues that reprocessing is about
twice as expensive as dry storage, based on figures from Scottish Nuclear
Fuels and the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee.
A second reason for questioning the Pounds 950m figure is that customers,
mainly German and Japanese power utilities, may prove reluctant to take back
the uranium, plutonium and radioactive waste produced by reprocessing. Their
contracts require them to take it back, but public opinion at home may be
hostile to the radioactive shipments. Mr William Walker of the Science
Policy Research Unit at Sussex University has argued that, because this may
dissuade customers from sending fuel to Thorp, the plant is unlikely to run
at full capacity.
A third line of criticism is that the plant's costs could be higher than
budgeted, and that customers, even though it is stipulated in their
contracts, may refuse to pay the increased costs.
BNF has responded to all these points by arguing that its profits are
protected by the customer contracts. Under tough penalty clauses, customers
are obliged to absorb extra costs, and would have to compensate BNF entirely
if they wanted to cancel their contracts, it says.
These claims and counterclaims, which have been set out in reams of reports
from BNF and its critics throughout the year, are impossible to prove at
present. Partly, the answers lie hidden in the details of the customer
contracts, which BNF and its shareholder, the Department of Trade and
Industry, have refused to disclose on grounds of customer confidentiality.
But they are also dependent on future political pressures in Japan and
Germany, and on how their current debates about nuclear power progress. The
UK government's relations with those countries is also vital: would it
choose to enforce every clause of the contracts, at risk of offending its
trading partners?
In spite of these obstacles, the government will have to make a judgment
soon on whether Thorp will be profitable for Britain. A short answer is yes,
probably. The main customers have recently and publicly pledged their
support, and an early attempt to break the contracts seems unlikely. There
are, though, reasons to find BNF's projections too optimistic, because of
the uncertainty of customers' behaviour a decade from now.
Officials in the Treasury and DoE share the conclusion that there is an
economic case for the plant, although it is perhaps not as strong as BNF
suggests. DTI officials express more confidence that BNF's projections are
sound.
If the plant is likely to be profitable, giving the go-ahead would be
acceptable to the Treasury. However, that does not mean it is economically
the best solution for the UK or for Thorp's customers. The UK might make
more money from abandoning Thorp but offering to keep customers' fuel in dry
storage, Greenpeace has suggested in its response to the public
consultation.
Although this is regarded by BNF as a near-unthinkable option, it has been
considered briefly by the government. Early this year, in confidential
discussions organised by a cabinet committee, Treasury officials questioned
whether it might be mutually advantageous for the UK and for Thorp's
customers to abandon the plant if all parties were released from penalty
clauses in their contracts. Customers would gain from being able to choose
cheaper options such as dry storage of fuel. The UK would gain if it could
charge them for running that storage.
Officials christened this scenario the 'win-win' option. They also noted
that Britain and Thorp's customers might be caught in a 'prisoner's
dilemma': a branch of economics called 'game theory' describes the way that
each party, acting in self-interest, reaches a worse economic outcome than
they would if they were able to collude. Dry storage might offer the way
out.
But the 'win-win' option was put aside by the cabinet committee in
subsequent discussions. It would be too difficult and time-consuming to
raise the question with Thorp's customers, officials decided, and the
outcome would be hard to predict. Britain might be forced by Thorp's
customers to pay penalties itself if it suggested it did not want to go
ahead with the plant.
If the government's response to the public consultation sticks to a narrow
brief, it will simply weigh up whether the plant will make a profit or
whether it will pose any risk of saddling the taxpayer with losses. But the
government now has another chance to examine, before the button is pressed,
whether Thorp is really the best and most profitable way forward for Britain
to dispose of nuclear waste.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Ludicrous for US to impose high
textiles tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J A NIGHTINGALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am delighted that your leading article 'End game in the Gatt'
(September 29) highlights the need for reductions in the high US tariffs on
apparel and textiles to levels comparable to those of the European
Community.
It is quite ludicrous that the US, one of the world's strongest economies,
continues to impose tariffs which, on some textile products, can exceed 40
per cent.
The tariff-cutting formula agreed in Tokyo in July requires these tariff
peaks to be reduced by half, but the US administration has so far failed to
carry this agreement into effect. Its latest offer would still leave peak
tariffs of almost 30 per cent - a totally unacceptable position.
Of course, even the tariffs imposed by the US are low compared to the 100
per cent-plus tariff rates found in many developing countries, often
accompanied by wide-ranging import bans.
These other countries must be persuaded to play their own part in reducing
trade barriers in apparel and textiles - but a revised offer by the US
incorporating the agreed Tokyo formula is an essential preliminary.

Sir, I was most surprised to read that Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of
British Midland, had complained about my speaking in French to the EC
Committee of Wise Men ('Pardon', September 23). May I say that I never heard
such a complaint from him while I was there. There is no reason to deliver a
speech in English to an EC committee meeting in Brussels, where, moreover,
most of the members are French-speaking. To my knowledge, English is no more
the official language of the European Community than French.
I would like to add that an English translation of my speech was available
at the time and that I answered in English every question asked in English.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Firm stand must be made to 'open
skies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK PRENTICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your excellent editorial on the EC's programme of air liberalisation
correctly points out that it is consumers who stand to lose most if the
Community's laudable 'open skies' policy is stalled ('Clouds in EC open
skies', September 28).
Three waves of deregulation over the last six years have hardly stirred the
web of air cartels which, with the blessing of the majority of EC
governments, criss-crosses the European skies. Such cartels, operated mainly
by state-owned or dominant airlines and those to whom governments granted
monopoly or special rights, amount to little more than institutionalised
plunder of passengers' pockets.
This state of affairs must not be allowed to continue. The prospect of true
competition terrifies the likes of Air France and the Belgian national air
line, Sabena; but in the face of massively funded vested interests, and a
common front challenged (to their credit) only by the UK and Netherlands
governments, consumers have historically had little opportunity, except
through the vociferous clamour of national, European and international
groups, to object. And while consumers have been, to use the vernacular,
'stitched up', airlines and governments have together, irritatingly and
erroneously, claimed that they have been 'acting in the consumer's best
interests'.
Sir Leon Brittan has publicly stated that 'competition must continue to be
the driving force (in the promotion of airborne free enterprise)' and that
the whole effort to open up the skies and relax government restrictions on
airlines 'would have little effect if we were to allow airlines to
reintroduce these restrictions by private action'. He is right.
The EC must stand firm against those vested interests within industry and
government which would undo half a decade's progress - what little there has
been - towards a free market in the air.
If Brussels loses its nerve at this critical point, the benefits for
consumers could be lost for ever.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Arts: Experience the divine Bette Midler - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the Broadway theatre season still a few weeks off, Bette Midler is
about the only show in New York these days. She is playing a six-week stint
at Radio City Music Hall, where her famously loyal following is paying up to
Dollars 100 per ticket to Experience the Divine, as the concert is called.
(Though the run, which ends October 23, is ostensibly sold out, there are
returns available at Radio City most evenings).
Midler has not appeared in a major concert for 10 years - she has been busy
becoming internationally famous - and there was much speculation about which
Bette we were going to see: the raunchy, raucous 'Divine Miss M', who got
her start singing in gay bathhouses in the 1970s, or the kinder, gentler
1980s Bette, she of Disney films (Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Beaches)
and treacly top-10 pop songs (From a Distance, Wind Beneath my Wings).
Experience the Diviney mixture of both Bettes. Alternately brassy and coy,
loud and girlish, belting and crooning, Midler owns the stage; she is simply
one of the best live entertainers around (two of America's other great divas
 -Shirley MacLaine and Liza Minnelli - were in the audience, adding to the
starry frisson). Platinum blond and slender, Midler has never looked better,
and she knows it; one of her first songs is a playful rap called 'I Look
Good'. She is well into her forties, but her asides about 'being too old for
this' are clearly disingenuous; the show lasts three hours, and Midler's
energy never flags.
Midler knows that her ballads are what the audience - mostly middle-aged
suburbanites - wants, and she works through them all, backed with
appropriate lushness by a seven-piece band. But the concert's divinest
moments are when she is in high-attitude mode; she hits her stride halfway
through the first set with her torchy old hit 'Delta Dawn' ('This song's
from the 70s . . . as are most of you. Hell, so am I]')
The brassy spirit of Sophie Tucker, the legendary vaudeville performer and
Midler's idol, hangs over the concert, and Midler conjures her directly in a
series of bawdy jokes she delivers as 'Soph'. Midler's onstage identity,
like Tucker's, has much to do with her Jewishness, and she gets a lot of
comic mileage out of the recent High Holy Days and out of current political
events ('Oy] This food] If Yassir Arafat knew what our food was like, this
treaty would be off in a second]'). She finishes off the first set with a
rousing 'Rose's Turn' from the classic Jule Styne musical Gypsy, a nifty
piece of advertising for a television version of the musical that she is
starring in this autumn.
The second set veers quickly into high camp, with a routine that Midler
aficionados found hilarious but which mystified me - the performer was in
the guise of Dolores Delago, a blue-tailed mermaid in a motorised wheelchair
who spouts self-help palaver.
While the band and backup singers (who Midler calls 'The Harlettes') make
their way through a ukulele number (a tribute, perhaps, to Midler's roots;
she was born and raised in Hawaii), Midler changes into a sophisticated
beige cocktail dress and then offers a particularly committed rendition of
the classic wailer, 'Stay With Me, Baby'.
An old-fashioned entertainer, Midler ends the concert with old-fashioned
good manners, coming out after the final encore to wish the audience
good-night and tell them they are fabulous. So is she.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Arts: Britain writ large on the South Bank - Theatre /
Malcolm Rutherford watches 12 hours of David Hare at London's Olivier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Hare and the Royal National Theatre go together. Without Hare, the RNT
would be hard put to find a contemporary British dramatist writing about
contemporary British subjects on an epic scale. Yet without the RNT's
massive staging resources, Hare's recent plays would be less worth seeing.
The spectacle is bigger than the texts.
For someone who believes, as Hare manifestly does, that Britain is a country
failing to live up to its potential, it is not surprising that some of the
defects should be reflected in the national theatre. If there were a new
young radical playwright following in the Hare tradition, he might satirise
the RNT just as Hare derides other, older British institutions.
But does Hare deride or not? That is the question. After spending more than
12 hours watching his trilogy in the Olivier Theatre - the RNT's biggest
stage - on Saturday, one is tempted to conclude that he is a whacking great
conservative.
There can be no complaints about the running time. The trilogy consists of
revivals of his earlier plays Racing Demon, (about the Church of England),
Murmuring Judges (about prisons, the Bar and the police) and the premiere of
The Absence of War which centres on the defeat of the Labour Party at last
year's general election. One could have stayed for more. Indeed it would
have been welcome to have seen a fourth play, bringing some of the
characters together and summing it all up. For unless one takes Hare at his
face value and accepts that everything that is wrong with Britain is to do
with class and anachronisms, it is not always clear what he is saying.
The staging is magnificent. Those who have seen the earlier plays will
remember the splendour of the way the Savoy Hotel is reproduced in Racing
Demon and the Royal Opera House in Murmuring Judges. Nor is it all just
show. Almost the dominant character in the Savoy scene is the head waiter,
who doesn't speak but keeps a discretely watchful eye in case the customers
should get out of hand. This is the power behind the scenes.
Absence of War goes further. The first scene is at the Whitehall Cenotaph.
Although I suppose it must be smaller than the real thing, it doesn't look
like that. There is a switch to the central lobby of the House of Commons at
Westminster. The scene looks remarkably convincing. There is the same
impression as there was at the Savoy of clerks and lackeys, and the pull of
tradition, keeping behaviour in order.
All of that is a triumph, perhaps cumulatively even more so than in the
individual plays, in sets by Bob Crowley. But what else? It is notable that
all the great set-pieces, all the great designs, take place broadly within
the same square mile. Possibly that is Hare's view of how power is
exercised. Yet, even on that narrow interpretation, there is not much
subtlety. Does anyone seriously think today that the Church of England is
one of the great agents of the British establishment, even if the
establishment had been defined in the first place?
On Saturday quite the best of the three plays looked to be Absence of War,
especially in the second half. One suspects that is because it is the most
topical, dealing with a subject that people still talk about. Yet it is
still a curiously hybrid piece. Hare did a lot of research on the Labour
Party election campaign, just as he did earlier on the church and the law.
The result is that he knows a certain amount about the Party from inside.
Much more puzzling is what he is trying to do with his knowledge.
Absence of War is neither documentary nor fair comment; nor is it
particularly imaginative. John Thaw, who plays the Labour leader, the Rt Hon
George Jones MP, does not look like Neil Kinnock. Perhaps he is meant to be
a mixture of all past Labour leaders rolled into one: physically there is a
touch of Harold Wilson, though without the Wilson intellect. Even then, some
very strange references are inserted, such as the Labour leader having a
preference for war and admiring the military machine. There is one
remarkably odd character called Vera who might be intended as Barbara
Castle. If so, like so much else, she doesn't quite fit.
Yet, as the plot unfolds, it is plain that the 1992 campaign is the subject,
the party accepting defeat from the jaws of victory and the leader
regretting that he has abandoned his old Bible and Shakespeare quotations
for the language of the public sector borrowing requirement 'and', as his
deputy says, 'all that bollocks, whatever it is'. There is also a strong
suggestion that the leader was not fully supported by his shadow chancellor,
the Rt Hon Malcolm Price MP, played as a rather distant figure by Richard
Pasco.
Two scenes reach the heights. One is a debate, close to election day, in an
aircraft factory between the leader and the shadow chancellor about how the
party should be led. (Hare's duologues between men are better than those
between the sexes, where he tends to be trite.) The other is the leader
being put through it in the television studio where, in the manner of
British broadcasting, the interviewer (one Linus Frank played by Robin
Bailey) takes over the programme.
Nothing else in Absence of War lives up to those exchanges. In the trilogy
as a whole the outstanding performance and the outstanding part is Mark
Strong as Detective Constable Barry Hopper in Murmuring Judges. No one could
accuse Hare of being biased against the lower levels of the police. He
clearly prefers them to barristers.
As a writer, Hare, you will observe, is not very good on feeling. His
characters tend to be flat and his jokes written much in the style of the
comedy programmes on the old BBC Home Service. Still, no other dramatist is
writing about Britain on this scale. The direction is by Richard Eyre who
has backed Hare all the way, and it would be very foolish not to go just
because there are defects. This is the national theatre.
The trilogy is sponsored by Amerada Hess Limited.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Arts: Tamerlano
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a few weeks Opera North will be 15 years old. The company has performed
almost 100 operas since its inception, and the new season demonstrates the
high quota of unusual works in its repertoire, including this staging of
Handel's Tamerlano at the Grand Theatre, Leeds.
Dating from 1982, it was originally a co-production with Welsh National
Opera, produced and designed by Philip Prowse. There is a 'designer opera'
feel about it. The single set, subtly lit, is very arty - an imposing vision
of a civilisation in decay, dominated by two stone horses, looking down on
carefully arranged piles of debris, bricks and corpses thrown together, all
sprinkled with a layer of dusty grey.
The plot would have us believe this to be a grand and ruined city of the
Ottoman empire after its sack by the Mongols, but there is another way to
read it, too. Opera producers of the late 20th century seem intent on
telling us that Handel's operas are museum pieces, written in a style that
is defunct. It is a small step from there to set this opera in the remains
of a great civilisation, its splendour gone, its social order in ruins.
The question is: could Opera North blow off the dust for this revival?
Tamerlano is highly regarded for the quality of its music, but it is not one
of those bold and daring operas in which Handel sweeps aside the conventions
of his day in the white heat of inspiration - at least not until the closing
quarter-of-an-hour. The singers must work to bring it alive.
In the title-role, Christopher Robson came close to turning tragedy into
farce. This was the murderous despot Tamburlaine turned into a spiteful,
preening peacock. A ring in his ear, a ridiculously long, brocaded cloak
trailing behind him, he was made to strut around the stage like a walking
parody of a Baroque castrato. The voice lacks authority and the way in which
he spat out the words belittled the character's stature.
For naturalness of expression Rosa Mannion was the most convincing, making
all of the soprano Asteria's slow music hold the attention. Graham Pushee,
the second counter-tenor in the cast, brought a bright and forward vocal
manner to Andronicus (his duet with Asteria was the evening's most stylish
piece of singing). Patricia Bardon ennobled Irene with an old-fashioned
Handelian contralto; Geoffrey Dolton made the words count as Leone.
With Roy Goodman persuading Opera North's musicians to adopt
pseudo-authentic musical practice, there was a fair amount of forward
impetus. I regret only his decision to restore the numbers near the end cut
by Handel before the first performance. For at this point Philip Langridge
had just seized centre-stage for Bajazet's death scene. He may not be the
most stylish Handelian tenor, but he shattered the tedium, blew away the
camp, left words and music burning with intensity, as though he believed
Handelian opera to be a living thing. Then the dust settled again.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Arts: Damp squib Zola - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Faced with something as spirit-sappingly dim as Therese Raquin - the new
Zola opera by Michael Finnissy which the Garden Venture is this month
touring across southern and middle England - the critic committed to
encouraging new work and living composers would naturally prefer to draw a
veil over the whole subject. But in this case unavoidable issues are raised.
After all, the record of the Garden Venture, the Royal Opera's five-year-old
forcing-house for (in its own words) 'the writing and performance of new
opera and music theatre in all their possibilities', is hardly encouraging;
the annual programmes of short operas have regularly aroused criticisms as
to overall quality and purpose, and the Venture's previous full-length
opera, the 1992 Biko, was a thudder.
Now comes this damp squib of a Zola adaptation, which for 90 unbroken
minutes - for heaven's sake, why? an interval is desperately needed] -
meanders ineffectually along the margins of a melodramatic, rawly effective
19th-century novel. At what point, one begins to wonder, in the generation
of new Garden Venture projects should questions of 'quality control' be
asked? With hindsight wisdom from Friday's premiere at the deliciously
intimate Theatre Royal in Bury St Edmunds, I feel that, in this case, the
answer is very early indeed.
In the past, one of the more unpredictable, livelier and prolific figures of
the English avant-garde, Finnissy (b1946) made a stirring impact with his
first opera, The Undivine Comedy (Almeida Theatre, 1988). That was a
turbulently original, questing piece of music-theatre. Its idiom, mixing
lyrical fluency and expressionist angularity, had an often unadorned
vividness that carried one over awkward or verbose patches. If I didn't know
better, I would swear that the two works had been written in reverse order -
that Therese Raquin was Finnissy juvenilia which deserved to be left in
kindly obscurity.
The composer has drawn on both the novel and its later play adaptation for
his libretto, a seven-movement structure for four singers and piano. The
removal of subordinate characters and party scenes and the alteration (for
the worse) of Zola's sensational double-suicide ending matters a certain
amount - to my mind the novel more readily suggests operatic treatment on a
scale comparable to Shostakovich's of Leskov's novella, Lady Macbeth of the
Mtsensk District.
But what matters much more is that the 'private' quality of Finnissy's
chosen musical idiom comprehensively fails to engage the audience in his
chosen dramatic scheme. In the programme he alerts us to its 'period'
touches and quotations, and warns us that the piano part is written to exist
in a 'parallel universe' to the words, not as their accompaniment. In spite
of the tireless playing of Christopher Willis, its effect most of the time
was of an enervated pianistic key-tickling while the four singers were left
to get on as best they could with their largely colourless, ungrateful,
obstinately undramatic vocal writing.
The single-set production (by Wilfred Judd, Garden Venture chief) is
capable, although the absence of carefully defined breaks between scenes
results in awkward pauses for scene-changes. The four singers were the
soprano Heather Lorimer in the title role (she needs to press her words home
much harder), the mezzo Linda Hirst (Mme Raquin), the counter-tenor Andrew
Watts (Camille, who has the work's few moments of vocal interest) and - in
the only rounded characterisation on stage - the baritone Richard Jackson as
Laurent.

A glum start to the week for parents unless they are lucky or foolish enough
to have blind confidence in their little darlings. In Watchdog about
children and smoking (BBC 1, 7.30), we learn that one in five children aged
15 is a regular smoker. World in Action (ITV, 8.30) investigates children's
sex lives and the high level of teenage pregnancies. If only our society
would redefine its concept of childhood by copying the Romans for whom it
ended at 14, matters would seem less dismal.
Among the ingredients of racial prejudice is the belief that blacks have
genes to make them sports champions. In Will to Win; Myth and Reality (BBC
2, 7.40), academics cast doubt on the idea and point instead to the social
factors that take blacks to the top in some sports but not in others.
The Late Show (BBC 2, 11.15) has always been uneven. Last week it served up
an account of an architectural competition that was boring and pretentious.
Playwright David Hare ought to be good material but much depends on whether
the programme's silly-pretentious tendency has been kept in check.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Management: No less than rebirth - Companies must do more
than just restructure, argues Christopher Lorenz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's most innovative multinational, 3M, has for years had a target
that 25 per cent of its annual revenues must come from products which did
not exist five years before. It has just replaced it with an even tougher
goal: 30 per cent in four years.
As one of the means of achieving this, 3M is sticking steadfastly - despite
recession - to its traditional policy of giving staff 15 per cent
'bootlegging time' to work on projects of their own choice. They can go to
several alternative sources of internal funding if their own divisions fail
to see the potential of the new ventures they create. But this risk is
minimised by keeping 3M business units as small and entrepreneurial as
possible.
Anchored in an unusually creative culture, these and other measures have
helped 3M re-invent itself repeatedly over the past 91 years. From its
beginnings in abrasives, it has added layer after layer of related skills in
order to move into adhesives (from Scotch tape to Post-It notes), chemicals,
video tape, computer disks and other products.
At the age of 54, Hewlett-Packard has a creative culture almost as developed
as 3M's. It reminds staff constantly that it needs to operate 'with the
nimbleness of a start-up'. It tends to succeed: over half the value of its
orders in 1992 were for products launched since 1991.
Motorola performs almost as well. In many ways it is the most impressive of
the three. While 3M and HP have sustained their creativity since birth,
73-year-old Motorola has only recently transformed itself into a model of
creativity and innovation, in mobile communications and other fields. As
recently as the 1970s it was sliding into oblivion, like many companies of
its age group.
Few mature large companies now in that painful position have much hope of
emulating Motorola's rebirth. At best, they may merely delay their decline.
This is not for want of trying. Vast numbers of western companies are
undergoing drastic change, or about to do so. In the US they include Digital
Equipment, General Motors, IBM, Kodak, Sears and Westinghouse. European
examples include Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen, Siemens and several British
banks.
But far too many companies are focusing almost exclusively on better
management of their existing assets, in the form of 'restructuring' (through
downsizing and delayering) and the 're-engineering' of processes such as
product development and order fulfilment.
These are only two of four overlapping steps necessary for the complete
regeneration of a company. The other two, in the jargon of two
California-based academics, are 'reinventing strategy' (Gary Hamel) and
'reinventing the organisation' (Richard Pascale).
The latter - a very complex undertaking - will be examined in a later
article. It amounts to transforming companies from sluggish
consensus-machines, like GM and IBM, into what Pascale calls 'engines of
inquiry', like 3M, HP or - these days - Motorola.
On step three, the 'reinvention' of strategy, a packed audience wastreated
by Hamel to a trenchant analysis last month at the annual conference of the
Strategic Management Society.
Restructuring was necessary, since it made companies smaller, said Hamel. So
was re-engineering - it made them better. But without the reinvention of
strategy, they would not become different. So far, Westinghouse had become
smaller but not better, and Xerox better but not different. By contrast,
their main respective rivals, General Electric and Canon, had become better
and different.
In mathematician's terms, companies were constantly encouraged by investors
to improve the efficiency of their current operations and resources - 'to
attack the denominator'. They were not being stimulated to 'increase the
nominator': to create new products, markets and even industries.
As a result 'more and more clusters of unimaginative, denominator-focused
competitors are engaged in successive rounds of downsizing,' said Hamel. 'We
have an epidemic of corporate anorexia.'
Nor was it enough to play catch-up, as the western motor industry is
constantly trying to do with the Japanese, and as vast tracts of industry
have done in the wake of more innovative western companies over the past 30
years.
The only way a company can get ahead is to foresee the next round of
competitive advantage and evolution in its industry, and to create it. Hamel
continued: 'The biggest rewards ultimately go to companies which transform
their industries, change the rules of the game, redraw industry boundaries
and establish fundamentally new competitive parameters.'
Thus the primary goal must be to become the architect of an industry's
transformation - not just once, like Canon, CNN, Intel or Virgin, but
repeatedly, like 3M and HP. To do that, as Hamel pointed out, companies have
to challenge not just the orthodoxies of the incumbents in an industry, but
also their own - which is far harder.
It remains to be seen whether Microsoft, Intel and Wal-Mart (in US
retailing) are up to the task.
Hamel sees three key barriers to 'reinventing strategy':
Perceptual: the lack of 'genetic variety' in top teams. Too many come from
the same industries, companies, disciplines and cultural backgrounds. This
blinds them to new opportunities.
Political: the most powerful people are usually those whose knowledge is
most out of date.
Practical: it is difficult to reinvent strategy in an ill-defined, still
emerging industry (such as digital communications) or sub-sector (such as
electronic publishing), where existing industry boundaries are shifting.
Part of the answer, Hamel suggested, is to concentrate on a set of core
competences which will be valuable no matter which way the industry evolves,
such as Apple's user-friendliness or Sony's skills in miniaturisation.
Then, like Motorola with its ambitious 'Iridium' project for a global,
satellite-based cellular communications network, one can have a hand in
creating the future.
Significantly, that project was the brainchild of a middle manager whose
immediate bosses turned it down, but who took it to top management and won
their backing. He could easily have worked for 3M.
This is the first of several articles on corporate creativity.

FT  04 OCT 93 / People: Racing world goes turbo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lee Richardson is swapping one mode of transport for another in his drive up
the career ladder.
Currently a senior marketing executive with Hertz, the world's largest car
rental and leasing organisation, Richardson, 36, has just been appointed
marketing director of the British Horseracing Board. He joins the BHB on
November 1.
Richardson qualified as an engineer with General Motors in 1979 and joined
Hertz in 1981. He was Hertz's European marketing manager for the company's
continental Europe Leasing Division in 1986 and spent two years in Brussels.
He returned to London and took over as marketing and sales director for the
UK Rent A Car operation in 1990.
Last year he was made director of market planning, covering Europe, the
Middle East and Africa.
Soon to finish his MBA from the University of Strathclyde, Richardson is a
member of the Chartered Institute of Marketing.
He says that as a life-long enthusiast for the turf he will be bringing a
'consumer's understanding for the product' and that his central task will be
to 'develop a sustainable long-term marketing strategy for the Board'.
The Board was set up this year to raise the profile of an industry which
currently employs some 100,000 people in the UK.
Betting turnover is about Pounds 6bn annually, and about 5m people go to the
races each year.
Its purpose is to secure the finances for the industry, attract more
sponsorship and general ensure it becomes more commercially-minded.
But Richardson believes the sport is perhaps in danger of failing to attract
a younger group of consumers, and that is one important issue which he
intends addressing by using marketing skills.
'This is a marketing job first and foremost,' says Richardson, ready for the
off.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Management: Be direct, but don't preach or complain - Tips
from the top / Christopher Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, offers
advice on how to handle the press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER HASKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A free press has two main responsibilities
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
to present information accurately and to challenge the people in power who
naturally favour authoritarianism.
The efficient exercise of power frequently jeopardises the democratic
process and a free press must ensure this does not happen. One of the first
actions of an aspiring dictator is to muzzle the press.
Businessmen share government ministers' views on the press. In an ideal
world they would prefer that journalists did not exist. But, in reality, we
find ourselves dependent on them. The press remains the most effective way
for politicians to communicate to the voters and company chairmen to
influence their shareholders.
Being both vain and insecure, we rejoice when the notices are favourable and
are enraged when they are critical. Businessmen, in common with most British
institutions, are paranoiac and secretive. It is a peculiar British weakness
and stems from the culture of patronage and elitism which remains endemic in
our society. It does not, however, promote good relations with the media.
A good journalist must treat secrecy with suspicion, assuming that it is
being used to distort the truth. Mostly, his suspicions are correct, and he
must strive to expose the secret.
A sensible business person knows that there are few reputable secrets in
life and should be accessible to journalists. Where possible, the chairman
should not hide behind a press office, but speak directly to the press. This
disarms the latter, as well as making them self-important. They, too, are
not without vanity.
However, there are occasions when confidential 'off-the-record' discussions
can help both sides. I have never been betrayed by a journalist in these
circumstances, although there is always a risk of an accident or a
misunderstanding as John Major discovered recently. Or, perhaps he actually
wanted his 'off-the-record' comments to reach the public domain.
Businesspeople constantly complain that they are inaccurately reported. A
good reporter respects accuracy and will be glad to ensure that quotations
and attributable comments are checked.
The trick is to identify the bad journalist, and handle him with care.
Businessmen themselves should take care with their comments, and ensure that
they are accurate. On occasion, probing journalists need to be handled like
policemen and lawyers - answer the questions precisely, but offer no more
than is being requested.
Never try to over-influence journalists, preach at them, or complain about
them to their editor. More often than not your case will be a bad one, and
even if it is not, journalists, like all professional people, are protective
of each other when they are under fire.
A good relationship with the press can transform a problem into a success,
just as the proper handling of a complaint can result in increased customer
satisfaction. Two examples spring to mind.
A few years ago the press was convinced that most chilled food manufacturers
were a danger to society. We chose to invite our most vigorous critics to
our factories to explain our position. We ended up with an enhanced
reputation.
On another occasion, a speculative discussion with a reputable journalist
almost certainly saved the company from a hostile and damaging predatory
bid. Lushing up journalists is an expensive, wearisome and ineffective
pastime. The good ones either do not participate, or else take the goodies
but do not return the favours.
Those who are seduced tend to be corrupt themselves and, therefore, in the
long term of no use to you. Journalists who are 'pliable', such as those who
are prepared to produce newspapers which reflect the prejudices of their
owners, should be treated with great suspicion.
Finally, recognise that journalists are strange characters: loners,
anarchic, insecure and suspicious. But they are also gossipy,
anti-establishment and entertaining, and usually wise enough not to take
themselves too seriously. They are on the whole good company, and add colour
to the drudgery of our daily life.
Next Monday: Eric Nicoli, chief executive of United Biscuits, on how to
produce an annual report.

FT  04 OCT 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics group run by the ever-colourful Mr Alan
Sugar, reports its full-year results tomorrow. The group, which reported a
Pounds 71m loss last year, should have broken even at the trading level -
but there may well be exceptional costs of about Pounds 25m mainly related
to the closure of its Spanish operations.
Most interest will be focused on the new corporate strategic plan which
Amstrad's chairman has also promised to unveil and which will probably
involve a move away from personal computers towards new growth areas like
telecommunications products. The Amstrad board is also in the process of
selecting a new chief executive.
Tomorrow also sees the interim results of Silentnight Holdings. Projected
profits of about Pounds 5m pre-tax will be an improvement on last time's
Pounds 4.1m and will be thanks to the US and German operations performing
better.
Bank of Scotland reveals its interim figures on Wednesday. Estimates of
pre-tax profits vary from Pounds 80m to Pounds 97m, up from last time's
Pounds 74m. This would be in line with general banking industry trends, with
levels of bad debt provisions falling. Its location has made it less exposed
to the downturn in the London property market.
Further vigorous growth is expected at Lloyds Chemists, the expanding
retailing chemist which reports its final results on Thursday. Pre-tax
profits as high as Pounds 50m are anticipated, compared with Pounds 36.9m
last time.
Also due on Thursday are the interim results of Etam, the clothing retailer.
Forecasts range between Pounds 1.9m and Pounds 2.5m, against Pounds 1.7m in
the previous first half. It is thought that both sales and margins will have
held up well, though the seasonality of the business makes predictions
untrustworthy. The interim dividend should rise to 1.75p (1.65p).

FT  04 OCT 93 / The Week Ahead: US employment figures likely to encourage
hopes of an upturn - Economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES about the strength of the US economy may be allayed later this week
by jobs data which are expected to indicate a pick-up in economic demand
during September.
The financial markets expect a 155,000 rise in non-farm payrolls during the
month, after the 39,000 fall in August. News to this effect when the figures
are published on Friday would almost certainly boost the dollar, which in
the past week has looked somewhat lacklustre against the D-Mark.
Other indicators from the US due to be published during the week include the
latest data on home completions and vehicle sales.
The financial markets will also be given the September unemployment data for
both the former east and west Germany, new manufacturing orders for west
Germany and industrial production.
The interest in these figures rests on whether they will indicate some signs
of upturn in the German economy after the recession which has depressed the
economic outlook for Europe as a whole.
In Japan, the government will announce its estimate of the August trade
surplus, in data which may shed light on whether imports are starting to
rise as a result of any faint stirrings in domestic demand.
At the German Bundesbank, Mr Hans Tietmeyer has his first council meeting as
president, after replacing Mr Helmut Schlesinger, who retired on Friday. The
Thursday meeting is not expected to result in any change in interest rates.
In Britain, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will deliver his views on
economic policy to the Conservative party conference on Thursday.
At the Treasury tomorrow the government's panel of economic advisers meets
for the first time since Mr Clarke took over as chancellor in May. Fans of
Professor Wynne Godley, the maverick Cambridge economist who is one of the
'seven wise men', will be disappointed that he will miss the meeting as he
is on a research posting in the US.
Foreign exchange and stock traders will follow news of political
manouverings in Russia where the recent crisis has periodically pushed down
the D-Mark and European bonds on worries that any conflagration could harm
the European economy.
The following gives the highlights of the week. Figures in brackets are
median market predictions provided by the MMS financial information company.
Today: UK, M0 measure of money supply for September (up 1 per cent on month,
4.3 per cent on year), consumer credit growth in August, excluding mortgages
(Pounds 200m).
US, August spending by construction industry.
Tomorrow: UK, Treasury panel of outside economic forecasters meets Mr Alan
Budd, Treasury chief economic adviser, rise in official reserves during
September at underlying level (Dollars 50m).
Spain, rise in official reserves last month (Dollars 46.3m).
US, August home completions, September 21-30 car sales (6.9m), September
21-30 truck sales.
Canada, September level of foreign reserves (unchanged), New Zealand, second
quarter gross domestic product data.
Australia, August retail sales.
Japan, August current account figures and foreign bond investment.
Wednesday: Canada, help wanted index (87).
Thursday: UK, Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, addresses Conservative party
conference.
Germany, Bundesbank council meeting, west German unemployment (29,000 rise
during September), September vacancies and short-time working in west
Germany, September rise in unemployment in east Germany.
US, initial claims for week ending October 2 (325,000), state benefits for
week ending September 25, August wholesale trade, August consumer credit
(Dollars 2.8bn), monetary data for week ending September 27.
Friday: US, September non-farm payrolls (up 155,000), manufacturing payrolls
(down 10,000), hourly earnings (up 0.2 per cent), average workweek and
unemployment rate (6.7 per cent).
Canada, September unemployment rate (11.5 per cent), August car sales (down
0.7 per cent on month), July labour income (up 2.2 per cent on year),
September housing starts (153,000).
During the week: Germany, August industrial production and manufacturing
output (unchanged on month in both cases), August manufacturing orders (down
0.6 per cent on month), July trade surplus (DM4.9bn) and current account
deficit (DM1.6bn), September cost of living data.
Spain, August trade balance, July producer price index (up 2 per cent on
year), July industrial production (down 5 per cent on year).
Switzerland, September unemployment rate (4.8 per cent), September consumer
prices index for Zurich.
Denmark, August unemployment rate (12.3 per cent).
Netherlands, May trade balance.
Belgium September unemployment rate (14.2 per cent).

FT  04 OCT 93 / Handcuffed Howard aims to crack the whip: As the Tories try
to regain the initiative on law and order FT writers look at the crisis in
the criminal justice system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, ROBERT RICE and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the home secretary, has an unenviable task when he
replies to the debate on law and order at the Conservative party conference
on Wednesday.
He will be under intense pressure from constituency representatives to
regain the ground which has been lost to the skilful campaigning of Mr Tony
Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman.
Opinion polls show that after 14 years of Tory government, public confidence
in the police and criminal justice system is low.
According to Mr Robert Seabrook QC, vice-chairman of the Bar, the reasons
for public unease include a succession of miscarriages of justice, concern
about the integrity of the police and a feeling by victims that the police
are uninterested in their fate.
But righting these matters will involve far-reaching changes which are
unlikely to produce quick results.
Take the Sheehy report on police pay and conditions. Many of the 272
recommendations in Sir Patrick's report are uncontroversial, but the
introduction of fixed-term contracts and performance-related pay have
produced an outcry among police.
While Mr Howard may be prepared to give ground on the more controversial
recommendations, the comfortable relationship between the police and the
Conservative government has been weakened. Implementing even a watered-down
version of Sheehy will make it harder to win police co-operation for a more
effective drive on law and order.
The courts are no less of a challenge. Mr Howard has on his desk the report
of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, which produced 352
recommendations in July.
Chaired by Lord Runciman, the commission was set up in 1991 after a series
of well-publicised miscarriages of justice. When it reported public concern
had shifted from miscarriages of justice to what was seen as the inability
of the courts to convict criminals.
Steps that make miscarriages of justice less likely now need to be balanced
by measures to ensure that the guilty do not escape justice. However,
sending more people to prison would add to Mr Howard's troubles in
accommodating the growing prison population.
Sentences are already increasing, according to Mr Stephen Shaw, director of
the Prison Reform Trust. He said: 'The number of prisoners has been rising
at 500 a month this year.' The prison population would top 50,000 by 1995,
not the end of the decade as had been projected.
The growth has been accelerated by the repeal in May of elements of the 1991
Criminal Justice Act that promoted the use of community-based penalties
rather than custodial sentences. Mr Charles Elly, vice-president of the Law
Society, said that the speed with which this had been done would be
regretted.
The act had been too rigid, he said, but 'the government's complete
volte-face has gone too far the other way - they need to get into
equilibrium'.
The temptation for Mr Howard at Blackpool will undoubtedly be to announce
something new to an audience hungry for action.
However, his hands are tied on the Sheehy report, on which he has promised
to say nothing until the government publishes its response at the end of the
month.
Measures to make prison regimes 'more austere' would be a risky option. The
leaking of a Home Office memo in August setting out such wishes was widely
blamed as a factor in the prison riot at Wymott jail in Lancashire, which
caused Pounds 20m of damage. Mr Shaw said: 'The prison system is more
volatile than at any time since the Strangeways riot. Officials will have
advised him that if you play party politics with the prison system, you're
likely to come unstuck.'
Lord Williams QC, a former chairman of the Bar and Labour's legal affairs
spokesman in the House of Lords, said the government needed to recognise
that short-term policy responses had created even greater problems.
The Dangerous Dogs Act, the Bail (Amendment) Act and the Aggravated Vehicle
Taking Act to outlaw joy-riding had all been expensive white elephants.
Lord Williams added that having to review the 1991 Criminal Justice Act just
seven months after its introduction said it all.

                      CRIMINAL JUSTICE - THE AGENDA
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  COURTS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Main recommendations of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice were:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
End defendant's right to choose jury trial
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shorter sentences to those who plead guilty through formalised plea
bargaining
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Disclosure of defendants' case before trial
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Closer liaison between police and Crown Prosecution Service at the
investigation stage
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Continuous video recording at police stations
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
More caution about confessions but no requirement for supporting
evidence
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Independent review of miscarriages of justice
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 POLICE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Main recommendations of Sir Patrick Sheehy's report were:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ten-year contracts for new recruits, subsequently renewable every
five years
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance-related pay
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lower starting rates for new recruits
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ending of many overtime payments and allowances
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Retirement age up from 55 to 60 and full pensions after 40 years
instead of 30 years
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abolition of ranks of chief inspector, chief superintendent and
deputy chief constable
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The home secretary also plans to change disciplinary procedures and to
cut local authority representation on police authorities
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  PRISONS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Prison Service Agency is creating a private-sector market in prison
management by increasing the number of privately run establishments to
12 - about 10 per cent of the total.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Derek Lewis, the agency's chief executive, intends to shake up
state-run prisons by:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
More day-to-day responsibility for governors
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Changing work and staffing practices - possibly through more
market-testing. This would undermine the power of the Prison Officers'
Association
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Improving the quality of prison life through initiatives like
better family links and work programmes, in line with the Woolf report

<TEXT>
IT WAS, said Mr Ronald Bartle, the deputy chief metropolitan magistrate, a
fairly average day at Bow Street Magistrates' Court. A steady stream of the
sad, the slightly mad and the just plain bad.
A drunk and disorderly, a licence application and 20 remands - for
sentencing, for committal and for variation of bail.
A young man, unemployed, accused of attempting to steal 47 books worth
Pounds 250 from Dillons. Why? To feed a drug addiction.
A Scot accused of assault on the underground. Defendant was begging. Offence
'committed in drink'.
Another drug addict accused of 'going equipped' with a foil-lined carrier
bag to steal from shops in Covent Garden. Unemployed, 16 previous
convictions.
A young woman accused of stealing a handbag in Harvey Nichols. Temporarily
homeless, attending the psychiatric unit at Guy's Hospital.
Mr Bartle does not think social conditions are largely responsible for
rising crime. He said: 'I think crime is largely a matter of choice.'
In court his actions belie his hard-boiled image. While he remarked several
times that 'drug addiction cannot be a permanent excuse for crime', he
deferred sentence for six months on one addict to give him a chance to get
off heroin. And the woman accused of stealing the handbag was given 'one
last chance' and put on probation.
He is doubtful about the deterrent effect of tough sentencing - blaming the
high crime rate on a low level of detection.
'In the magistrates' courts you get a lot of sad and inadequate people with
awful problems and it is wrong to be tough on them if anything else might
help,' he said.
Much of the day was spent on committal proceedings. The Royal Commission on
Criminal Justice recommended that they should be abolished - and Mr Bartle
agrees. 'They are mainly fishing expeditions by the defence,' he said.
He is not worried that that would leave magistrates with little to do. There
would still be all the minor offences to try. He also believes stipendiary
magistrates should have the power to sentence people to up to two years in
jail. That would substantially increase the number of cases they could deal
with, relieving pressure on crown courts.
Does he favour abolishing the right of the defendant to choose trial by
jury? 'Yes, as a matter of principle I don't see why the defendant should
choose where he is tried.
'Only 20 per cent of those who elect jury trial actually contest the case at
the crown court. It's a waste of time and costs.' In the event, the one
person who had the opportunity during the day to choose decided to be dealt
with by Mr Bartle there and then.
Mr Bartle said: 'I would never suggest abolishing the lay bench, but there
should be greater use of professional magistrates. Also there should be
strict rules about the academic qualifications of jurors.'

PAY awards across the whole economy were running at 2.3 per cent in the
three months to August 1993, with private-sector awards at 2.5 per cent, the
pay analysts Industrial Relations Services said. Private-sector rises
averaged 4 per cent at the same time last year.
About two thirds of all awards in the past three months have been above
August's 1.7 per cent rate of inflation, with one in four worth 3 per cent
or more.
Separately, the Reward management salary survey for September shows
management pay awards averaging only 2.9 per cent in the past 12 months  -
the lowest it has ever recorded.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Users 'want gas monopoly ended'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE out of four consumers want to see an end to British Gas's monopoly of
the domestic market, according to opinion research published today, David
Lascelles writes.
The report was commissioned by 12 gas companies trying to persuade the
government to remove barriers to the gas market following the inquiry by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The government is now considering the
recommendations that British Gas should be broken up and its monopoly ended.
The opinion poll, carried out by ICM, showed that 83 per cent of consumers
believe gas prices would fall as a result of the introduction of
competition. Nearly eight out of 10 respondents saw competition as the most
effective way to improve service standards. Nine out of 10 agreed that
enabling the supply of cheaper gas was the most important priority for the
gas industry, but felt that there should be a strong regulator.
The Department of Trade and Industry is holding a public consultation on the
commission's report until the end of this month.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Lord Chief Justice backs curb on right to silence: As the
Tories try to regain the initiative on law and order FT writers look at the
crisis in the
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSIAL govern-ment proposals to curb a suspect's so-called right to
silence have won the backing of Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice.
Under the government's plans, trial judges would be able to comment to the
jury on a defendant's failure to answer reasonable questions put to them at
a police station.
The right to silence has existed in its present form since 1855. At present,
judges have to tell juries that a defendant's refusal to answer police
questions should not be a factor in deciding guilt or innocence.
The move would necessitate a change in the police caution to suspects. The
police would have to say that although a suspect is not obliged to answer
questions, failure to do so might be the subject of adverse comments by the
judge at the trial.
Speaking at the Bar's annual conference in London at the weekend, Lord
Taylor said he supported change. 'I feel there are circumstances in which it
should be open to a judge to comment on the defendant's failure to respond
to questions.'
He said it was important that it be left to the judge to decide in each case
whether comment should be made.
But later he said the position in Northern Ireland where since 1988 judges
have been able to comment on a refusal to answer questions at any stage of a
police investigation made 'a great deal of sense'.
Lord Taylor confirmed his opposition to abolishing the defendant's right to
a jury trial in cases that can be tried by magistrates or at a crown court.
That was the most controversial of the 352 recommendations made by the Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice in July. But it is thought that opposition
from the judiciary has persuaded Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, not
to attempt to introduce it at this stage.
Last week Mr Robert Seabrook QC, vice-chairman of the Bar, told the Labour
Party conference that multiple cautioning and a cut in in the budget for
part-time judges meant that crown courts in parts of England and Wales were
lying idle.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Stiffer parking fines for London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTORISTS who park illegally in any of three London boroughs face stiffer
penalties from today under parking laws due to spread throughout the capital
over the next 10 months.
Hammersmith and Fulham, Bromley and Lewisham have taken over routine parking
enforcement from the police by becoming 'special parking areas'. The
boroughs will employ their own parking attendants who will be able to issue
a new type of ticket known as penalty charge notices. These carry a fine of
Pounds 30 to Pounds 60 depending on the area. There will be a 50 per cent
discount for motorists who pay within 14 days.
Persistent offenders with outstanding fines will be clamped - and from next
year will not be released until they have paid what they owe. The declamping
fee will be Pounds 38. Where illegal parking obstructs traffic, cars will be
towed away rather than clamped.
Revenue from the scheme will go to the local authority which can use it to
cover the cost of the scheme, provide extra parking and improve public
transport.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Flexible working safeguards urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY workable model for full employment has to embrace the realities of
Britain's increasingly flexible labour market, says Full Employment UK, the
employment think tank.
In its submission to the Commons employment committee's inquiry on full
employment it says: 'It is becoming increasingly apparent that the familiar
notions of a 'job for life' and 'employment security' are outmoded. Real
security lies . . . in the acquisition of skills and training.'
While other submissions have concentrated on macro-economic stimulus or
employment subsidies, Full Employment UK advocates working with the grain of
recent labour market trends. Labour market flexibility, the submission
states, is bringing obvious advantages to the economy in the improved
competitiveness of UK goods and services. But, it adds, there is a
disadvantage of 'widespread job insecurity'.
Arguing for 'security of employability', as opposed to security of
employment with a particular company, Full Employment UK says that the
government must back 'supported flexibility'. That means the state must
underpin the workings of a flexible labour market by supporting people with
'individual-centred' provision. People need assistance to develop 'personal
financial and self-investment' strategies to overcome the irregularities in
income forced on them by flexible employment.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Regions see 40% rise in finance jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOBS have continued to be created in financial services outside London in
spite of recession, according to research by Leeds University.
Regional employment in the industry leapt by more than 40 per cent between
1981 and 1991 to reach more than 250,000. While London was hit by recession,
growth continued almost everywhere else. Only in Birmingham and Bradford did
it stall. Birmingham - which may have suffered from relative proximity to
London - still emerged from the 1991 census with more than 30,000 financial
services jobs, as did Edinburgh and Manchester.
Bradford's stalled growth almost certainly reflects a local shift to its
neighbour Leeds. In the census Bristol, Leeds and Glasgow recorded more than
25,000 each, but Leeds has been showing the fastest recent growth - 19 per
cent between 1989 and 1991.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Surgical glove to help reduce risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURGICAL GLOVE designed to reduce risks of cross-infection is being
launched today by London International Group.
The glove has two layers. If the outer one is punctured and the inner one
exposed to fluid, such as blood, it shows up green, alerting the surgeon to
the puncture.
LIG, which also makes condoms and toiletries, is putting emphasis on new
products at a time when group profits have been hit by losses at its
photo-processing subsidiary.
Last month Mr Tony Butterworth, LIG group executive, took early retirement
after Mr Alan Woltz, chairman, warned that profits in the first half of 1993
would be 'very substantially lower'.
Studies suggest that surgeons cut their gloves in 40 per cent of operations.
Often they do not realise they have done so, exposing both surgeon and
patient to risk of infection, such as from HIV or hepatitis.

JAGUAR, the luxury carmaker, is to enter the Chinese market with the aim of
establishing a network of distribution and service centres in cities
throughout the country, Kevin Done writes.
The company , a subsidiary of Ford of the US, is appointing Inchcape, the
UK-based international services and marketing group, as its exclusive
importer/distributor for China. Inchape is the Jaguar importer/distributor
for Hong Kong, the carmaker's fastest-growing market, and for Macao.
Jaguar China is to be set up as a division of Inchcape Pacific with the aim
of starting Jaguar sales in China before the end of the year.
Mr Nick Scheele, Jaguar chairman and chief executive, said that China was
set to become one of the company's most important development markets.
Jaguar said that it expected to sell 40 cars in China this year rising to
100 in 1994.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Whitehall misses market-testing deadlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST a third of the planned programme for opening up government services
to bids from the private sector had not been completed by the deadline last
week.
Officials admitted that departments had failed to finish the exercise of
testing government activities against the private sector in the case of
about Pounds 500m-worth of Whitehall functions in a programme intended to
cover Pounds 1.5bn of services.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, is due to announce the
next tranche of the market-testing programme on Wednesday in his speech to
the Tory conference.
Details of the departmental results are still being compiled by the Cabinet
Office, but Mr Waldegrave's officials emphasise that departments which have
not completed the allotted share of the programme by the deadline will have
to finish them in the coming weeks, as well as pressing ahead with the
second tranche.
The delays are attributed to the procedures to be followed rather than a
lack of enthusiasm in Whitehall. There are already signs, however, that the
second tranche of the market-testing programme has been scaled back.
Originally the second tranche was intended to affect up to Pounds 2bn of
services, but the signals now are that it will be closer to Pounds 1bn.
The first year's programme has suffered from a lack of momentum, although it
represents a significant increase in private sector options to compete for
government activities.
Earlier this summer Mr Waldegrave had to call on Mr John Major, the prime
minister, to put pressure on up to a dozen departments that were falling
behind, and confusion over the impact of regulations designed to protect the
rights of workers in takeovers and mergers has also bedevilled progress.
To mark the deadline for the first tranche of the programme Ms Majorie
Mowlam, shadow public services minister, said that information from the
Civil and Public Services Association showed that only a fraction of the
exercises originally in the programme for the first tranche had been
completed.
She said that, for example, both the benefits agency and the Department of
the Environment had yet to complete any market testing exercise.
Labour is also likely to highlight the costs of the programme. By the end of
June the Department of Social Security had spent Pounds 3.2m, the Home
Office Pounds 1.4m and the Department of Health Pounds 870,000.

The writ claims the ambulance service, which covers Tyne and Wear and
Northumberland, breached National Health Service agreements by unilaterally
trying to change working hours for 37 staff.
The service, which was one of the first to become an NHS trust, said it
could not comment as it had not received the writ.
The legal move is the latest in an increasingly acrimonious battle between
Unison, backed by Labour MPs, and Mr Laurie Caple, chief executive of the
trust.
Critics have attacked Mr Caple over his income-generation schemes, which
range from car servicing to security advice, and his management style.
Mr Jonathan Upton, a Unison official, said: 'This latest imposition of
increased hours for no pay is an attempt to recoup money lost on speculative
commercial ventures from the pockets of dedicated ambulance workers.'
The trust's 1992-93 report shows the schemes making a net surplus of Pounds
14,857, but critics argue the Pounds 30,000 fee paid to an agent in the
United Arab Emirates to promote its services should be deducted from this
figure.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Peugeot Talbot to set up 'fast-fit' service chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT TALBOT, the UK subsidiary of the French car group, is to follow Ford
and Vauxhall in establishing a national 'fast-fit' replacement parts and
service chain.
Peugeot Talbot aims to help dealers recapture business worth more than
Pounds 1bn a year which has been progressively lost to aggressive
independents such as Mr Tom Farmer's Kwik-Fit Euro and Halfords.
A small number of Peugeot Talbot's 405 dealers are starting a pilot
programme for the chain, called Xpress Fit. Results will be assessed next
year and the network is expected to be extended over the following three
years.
Mr Charles Greenland, Peugeot Talbot's director of parts and service, said
that the network is expected initially to be made up of about 50 outlets,
concentrated in urban centres.
Xpress Fit centres will aim primarily to provide parts and service for the
1.1m Peugeot models on UK roads.
Ford and Vauxhall - whose operations are called Rapid Fit and Master Fit
respectively - conceived them as 'all makes' operations but have also
decided to concentrate on their own brands. Ford has calculated that the
'fast-fit' business for the 6m Fords up to 10 years old on UK roads is worth
about Pounds 400m annually.
Although Vauxhall was first into the field three years ago, Ford's operation
seems to be enjoying most success, with 187 of its nearly 1,000 dealers
operating or preparing Rapid Fit outlets.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Large fall in off-job training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIME employees spend on off-the-job training has fallen dramatically in
the recession of the past three years, according to Department of Employment
figures to be released today.
The number of people undergoing training has dipped only slightly since
1990. But the figures reveal how little training they have done. The number
of hours of off-the-job training fell last year to just over 25m, from 40m
in 1990.
The figure, which is based on a survey of 4,000 employers, casts doubt on
the government's claims that training levels have held up through the
recession.
Officials point out that the sharp drop in training hours relates only to
off-the-job training and also excludes any training paid for by the
employee. One official said: 'It looks bad but it may just signify that
training courses are becoming more intensive.'
However, off-the-job training is the largest component of corporate
training, according to the survey. Department of Employment statistics
published last week showed that 14.5 per cent of the UK's 20.8m employees
had gone through some kind of training in the four weeks before the survey
was conducted.
Of those, 4 per cent received on-the-job training, 8.6 per cent off-the-job
training and 1.9 per cent training on and off the job.
Women are now more likely to be receiving training than men, a reversal of
the position in the mid-1980, and training activity tends to be highest in
management and professional occupations.
About two-thirds of all medium to large establishments, have training plans
although less than half have formal written statements. The number with
plans has fallen over the last two years. The most common site for
off-the-job training is a college or further eduction establishment.
Training experts lend some support to the idea that courses are becoming
more intensive. Mr Peter Ashby of Full Employment UK said: 'A lot of
colleges and private providers are doing now in one or two day courses which
used to take a whole week.'
Mr Tony Cann, chairman of East Lancashire Training and Enterprise Council,
said that if training had been cut more than previously realised during the
recession it was not because of the 'poaching' of newly skilled workers.
In the latest issue of Personnel Management he writes that the poaching
claim 'is just an excuse hiding the real causes of insufficient training. A
company that does not train its employees will find that the better ones
leave even more quickly'.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Lloyd's reinsurer may cut payouts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWCO, the reinsurance company being set up by Lloyd's of London to ring
fence old liabilities, may ask some claimants to accept smaller but earlier
settlements to cut costs for both sides.
Large American pollution claims dating from before 1986 would be the most
likely candidates for this type of arrangement, known as commutation. The
claimant would be persuaded to accept a lump sum of less than the entire
claim before the full payment becomes due, and could then invest it to make
up the shortfall.
Such deals would be sought 'for the sake of certainty and finality', a
Lloyd's spokesman said. They could also save both sides the considerable
legal bills incurred in long court disputes.
Plans for the reinsurer's operation are now becoming more detailed after the
appointment last week of Ms Heidi Hutter as project director for the
creation of NewCo, which is expected to be operational from January 1996.
Commutation of claims has not been common practice at Lloyd's before now,
because the kind of claims for which it is appropriate would usually have
been underwritten by a large number of syndicates, which would all need to
agree before an approach could be made to the claimant. NewCo will take
responsibility for all pre-1986 liabilities, and so will have greater
flexibility in such negotiations.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Wise counsel courtesy of the credit industry: Ian Hamilton
Fazey on a scheme to help debtors back into the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXPERIMENTAL debt counselling service has found hundreds of people in and
around Leeds with multiple debts totalling about Pounds 15,000 each. The
money is usually owed to a mixture of eight or so finance houses, retail
chains and credit card companies.
The figure has shocked credit card and reference agencies, the main backers
which have put up Pounds 300,000 for the experiment. They believe it
indicates a similar problem throughout Britain. They were expecting an
average of about Pounds 10,000. The worst case so far has been Pounds
35,000, owed by an executive who had lost his job.
The Consumer Credit Counselling Service was set up in March by sponsors
including Barclaycard, Registry Trust, Leeds Permanent Building Society,
Time Retail - part of the Kingfisher group - Yorkshire Bank, Girobank and
two credit reference agencies - Equifax and CCN, a Great Universal Stores
subsidiary.
It has seen more than 700 people so far, nearly all of them local. About
two-thirds needed advice on how to manage their finances better and help in
negotiating with their creditors.
The rest needed more formal support. The service has agreed manageable
payment schedules - running over an average of about four years - with them
and their creditors. Debtors pay a set sum each month, which the service
then disburses pro rata to creditors.
In return, unsecured lenders - such as hire purchase, retail store or credit
card companies - freeze interest, while reducing the debtors' credit ratings
to zero to prevent further borrowing. They pay the service - a non-profit
making organisation - 15 per cent of the payments they receive to help with
running costs.
Profligacy and fecklessness have rarely been the cause of debts mounting,
Mrs Jan Smith, one of eight counsellors, said. The vast majority got into
trouble simply because their income fell. Recession is largely to blame,
through couples losing one or both of their jobs, bonuses being missed, or
overtime earnings wiped out. Problems were often then compounded by the
borrowing of more money to pay off the most pressing creditors.
Barclaycard is the biggest sponsor of the experiment, having put in Pounds
100,000. Mr Nick Cobban, who is monitoring the experiment for the Barclays
group, said: 'We were all shocked at the level of individual multiple debt.
'But it is not in our interest to have people lose the roof over their heads
or end up in prison for not paying their community charge or council tax.
That way we get nothing back.'
Mr Malcolm Hurlston, the chairman of Registry Trust, which keeps records of
all court judgments for debt in Britain, said: 'There is clearly a great
need for this sort of safety net. We now want to extend the experiment to at
least six other cities and eventually establish a national network of about
20 counselling centres.'
The Leeds counsellors went to the US as part of their training to see a
similar service at work in Houston. They have no special qualifications
other than skills demonstrated in previous work. Their previous occupations
include policewoman, fireman, building society lending officer, local radio
employee and financial services worker.
There are still teething problems. Secured lenders such as building
societies are benefiting from the service and referring people in debt to
it, but have not agreed to pay 15 per cent of what they recover to help
support the centre. Mr Cobban said talks were under way, possibly to agree a
flat yearly fee for each person counselled successfully.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Lang attacks Tory rebels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the prime minister's closest allies yesterday attacked Tory rebels,
urging them to back Mr Major.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, said the prime minister had delivered
all that was required of him and more.
'I hope those whose esteem for themselves outweighs their loyalty to the
party will be told . . . to unite behind the prime minister.'
In a speech to be delivered in Glasgow, he went on: 'He has seen us through
the bad days. Let us make the most of the better days that lie ahead.'
A MORI poll for the BBC's Panorama indicates it is government policies
rather than the prime minister's personality which has done most to lose the
party support.
Examining voters in the south-west who supported the Conservatives in 1992,
41 per cent said they no longer support the party and almost a third said
they will not vote Tory next time. Forty-two per cent said removing Mr Major
as leader would not make any difference to their voting intentions.

FT  04 OCT 93 / IRA welcomes Ulster talks
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRA last night gave its first reaction to the Hume-Adams talks on
Northern Ireland, saying they could provide the basis for peace.
In a statement released in Dublin, the IRA leadership said it 'welcomed this
initiative'.
The IRA statement said: 'We are informed of the broad principles which will
be for consideration by the London and Dublin governments.
'It is unfortunate that the British government reaction to this initiative
so far has been negative, fuelling unionist reaction. Nonetheless if the
political will exists or can be created, it could provide the basis for
peace.'
The statement added that the IRA, its members and supporters had a 'vested
interest' in seeking a just and lasting peace in Ireland.
But it stressed that they had not budged from their desire for an
all-Ireland solution to the Ulster violence.
The controversial talks between Ulster's Social Democratic and Labour party
leader Mr John Hume and Sinn Fein leader Mr Gerry Adams gained momentum at
the weekend after Mr Adams said he is prepared to present peace proposals to
the IRA.
He told the Irish Times: 'I am quite prepared to go to the IRA with a
package if one can be produced.
'I would of course seek a package, which would allow me to make definitive
proposals to the IRA in relation to the future conduct of its campaign.
Whether I can do that or whether indeed the outcome would be acceptable to
the IRA is a matter for all of us to apply ourselves to.'
Last week Mr Hume and Mr Adams said they believed a broader negotiating
process could begin which could lead 'to a stable and lasting peace'.
A report by the two party leaders, containing a number of proposals, is to
be discussed with the Irish government later this week when Mr Hume visits
Dublin. The Irish government is expected to discuss this later with the
British government.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Tories look at rules on leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POWERFUL 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers is to consider
Baroness Thatcher's suggestions for changing the rules governing Tory
leadership contests as a matter of priority.
Dame Jill Knight, the vice-chairman of the 1922 executive, said last night
she was sure the committee would look at the issues raised by Lady Thatcher
'as soon as possible'.
But she indicated there was probably not enough time to head off a possible
leadership challenge to Mr John Major, the prime minister, this autumn by
rewriting the rules in line with Lady Thatcher's proposal.
'I would imagine it would be too late to alter the rules for this year,'
Dame Jill, the MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said.
Lady Thatcher told The Sunday Times yesterday that existing rules for
determining when a leader could be challenged should be discontinued during
periods when the Conservatives were in government.
The former prime minister said: 'I do not think the prime ministership of a
nation should be determined by some leadership rules that were fashioned for
being in opposition.
'I think the existence of them can actually destabilise the government of
the day - the party really must think again.
'I think they must think about this very carefully and ponder very deeply on
whether an election for the leader of the party should apply during a time
when that leader is also prime minister.'
Under current rules - modified in 1991 as a result of Lady Thatcher's own
removal as leader - a leadership contest could be triggered if 34
Conservative MPs wrote to Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922, within 14
days of the start of a new parliamentary session to say such a step was
warranted.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, yesterday welcomed Lady Thatcher's
proposals, saying he was 'very much in favour of the sort of changes she is
suggesting'.
But the response of members of the 1922 executive was mixed. Dame Jill said
Lady Thatcher had a 'strong point' in asserting that a sitting prime
minister was different from a leader of the opposition. But Sir Marcus said
he was wary of the proposals.
Another senior member of the executive said the proposed change would not
help Mr Major since it would be seen as a sign of weakness.
The 1991 rule change had 'tipped the balance rather against stalking horse
candidates anyway,' he said.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Arguments over taxation rage among rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARGUMENT over tax and spending reached a new pitch yesterday as the
leading Tory protagonists fired their final salvoes before this week's party
conference in Blackpool.
With the government's plans to extend value added tax to domestic fuel
expected to be attacked by some grassroots representatives, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, said his predecessor Mr Norman Lamont had been quite
right to include the measure in his last Budget package.
Mr Clarke, writing in the Conservative party newspaper Newsline, said the
'British habit' of zero-rating many goods had created anomalies in what was
'otherwise a fair tax'. But he did not rule out changing Mr Lamont's
proposals by levying VAT at a lower rate than 17.5 per cent.
The chancellor - who will address conference under the watchful gaze of
Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, on Thursday - urged the
government's critics to hold their fire until the package of measures to
help the less well-off pay their fuel bills was unveiled.
But he sought to lower expectations of what this package would include,
saying that increased benefit payments 'already exceed the extra costs on
VAT on fuel' for some households.
'There is no reason at all why the better off should not pay VAT on their
central heating,' he said.
Among the government's right-wing critics, the Thatcherite Conservative Way
Forward yesterday advised Mr John Major, the prime minister, that a pledge
not to increase income tax in next month's Budget would 'work wonders for
party morale'.
Mr Lamont was also on the attack, saying it would be 'wrong if all the
contribution to deficit reduction came from increased taxes'.
'We were not re-elected to raise taxes and action must be taken on
spending,' he told CWF's quarterly magazine.
Contradicting a number of cabinet ministers who have argued that next year's
public expenditure could not be reduced below existing pre-set levels, he
said there was 'nothing sacrosanct' about the 'tight' spending targets
agreed under his chancellorship.
'Action in the first instance ought to be on the spending side,' he said.
Mr Michael Portillo, the Thatcherite Treasury chief secretary, spoke of the
need to 'minimise the size of the state', in an article for CWF focusing on
the longer term.
'The government spends too much of the citizens' money,' he argued. 'Too
large a proportion of government spending will lead to an oppressive level
of taxation . . . Borrowing merely shifts the burden to a future
generation,' he said.
Lord Tebbit, the former Tory chairman, said tax increases were inevitable
because of the need to get the deficit down and the government's
determination not to cut public expenditure below pre-set levels.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Health trusts cautious on deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY a fifth of National Health Service trusts have introduced some form
of local pay for small groups of workers, such as cleaners and healthcare
assistants, according to an internal government review recently issued to
health authorities.
The report is the first by the NHS Management Executive on how the 154 first
and second-wave NHS trusts have exercised their new powers over pay and
conditions. Trusts have the power to develop local pay and conditions
packages for new staff although staff who transferred into trusts are
entitled to keep the central arrangements of the Whitley Councils and the
pay-review bodies.
Trusts have been cautious in moving towards local packages, particularly as
many want to do full job evaluations of all their staff first. The report
shows a higher than previously assessed number of trusts moving towards
local packages. It is likely that the chancellor's demand that total wage
bills in the public sector must be frozen next year, and that all pay
increases must be funded by productivity gains, will lead to an acceleration
of local pay arrangements within trusts.
According to the government's Human Resource Survey 18.5 per cent of
respondents had introduced some form of local pay, but this was mainly for
small or self-contained groups such as cleaners, healthcare assistants and
senior managers. A further 33 per cent said they intended to introduce it in
some parts of their organisations in one to two years.
Ambulance services were the most advanced in moving towards local pay and
conditions, accounting for four of the eight trusts which had comprehensive
local pay and reward schemes in place.
Northumbria Ambulance Service will today be served with a High Court writ by
Unison, the public-sector union, challenging alleged increases in hours
without extra pay for some ambulance staff.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Higher education quality 'at risk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER education expansion has not been fully funded and educational quality
is at risk, says a report published today by university vice-chancellors.
Government policy has increased the number of students in higher education
by 46 per cent in the past four years.
Universities have taken measures to increase their income; funds raised from
industry for research have risen by 70 per cent in real terms over the past
seven years.
But the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals, publishing its annual
statistics, said other figures showed that funding was inadequate.
Libraries have suffered a 16 per cent spending cut in real terms over the
last seven years, and there are now 28,000 too few library study spaces.
Even if student intake stays at its present level, another 55,000 library
spaces will be needed in the next two years.
Several universities have also endured sharp drops in liquidity. According
to the most reliable measure, Exeter University's total liquid assets would
only pay for total expenditure for two days, while Keele could continue for
four.
St David's in Lampeter, Dyfed, and Heriot-Watt, Glasgow, are shown as having
negative liquid assets.
The London School of Economics, which earlier this year suggested that
funding cuts might force it to raise 'top-up' fees from students, has seen
its liquid reserves fall from 111 days of expenditure in 1989-90 to only 17
days in 1991-92.
The figures also confirm a rise in graduate unemployment and a slight
increase in the proportion of students completing their degrees, from 86.9
per cent to 87.1 per cent.
Unemployment rates were lowest for medicine (0.2 per cent), and highest for
librarianship (28.9 per cent) and architecture (23.1 per cent).
Once the mix of subjects was taken into account, Birkbeck College, London,
had the lowest rate of unemployment, followed by Oxford. Eleven universities
had a lower rate of unemployment than Cambridge, including Belfast,
Lancaster, Hull, Nottingham and York.

CONFERENCE'S first full day on Tuesday could start uncomfortably, with the
spotlight firmly on Europe, the issue at the heart of the party's civil war.
Tension is unavoidable no matter how soothingly foreign secretary Douglas
Hurd urges the party to come together.
Mr Major's main headaches will not be confined to the hall. On the fringe,
Euro-sceptics Bill Cash, Nicholas Budgen, Richard Shepherd and Teresa Gorman
will all be in action, with Mr Cash launching a new Euro-sceptic
secretariat: the European Foundation.
Lord Tebbit's first appearance of three, at a lunchtime meeting organised by
the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward, may produce more problematical
headlines.
Tuesday is also railway day - when transport secretary John MacGregor may be
called to account over the controversial rail privatisation plans.
WEDNESDAY
THIS could be Mr Major's most comfortable day. His main misfortune is to be
deprived of the incapacitated Michael Heseltine to rally the troops before
lunch.
There may be troubling moments over the government's plans for pensions, tax
and public spending in the debate addressed by Peter Lilley, the rightwing
social security secretary.
On the fringe, the shadow of James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader,
could haunt Mr Major. It is still not clear what, if anything, the Unionists
expect in return for supporting the government in July in a crucial
Maastricht vote.
The right-left divisions in the party could be highlighted again by Lord
Tebbit who will talk to the right-wing Selsdon Group, while two right-wing
ministers - Neil Hamilton and Michael Forsyth - will be closely listened to
for wayward words when they address Conservative Way Forward.
John Biffen, the respected former cabinet minister who is known for speaking
his mind, might set the cat among the pigeons at another fringe debate as
might Christopher Gill, a Euro-sceptic leader.
THURSDAY
PROMISES to be the trickiest day so far.
No sooner will chancellor Kenneth Clarke have sat down after replying to a
debate likely to include calls to rethink plans for VAT on fuel and rule out
Budget tax increases altogether, than Norman Lamont, his predecessor, will
be on his feet and possibly on the attack.
Mr Lamont's appearance is the fringe event the leadership is most fearing,
after the former chancellor's criticism of government policy.
Baroness Thatcher will also visit the conference, to an adoring welcome from
many of the faithful, with her memoirs waiting in the wings.
Michael Portillo, the rising star of the right, in fringe appearances on
Wednesday and Thursday is expected to map out his agenda on Europe and
public spending, which may be different in tone and substance from that of
the prime minister.
The evening will end with a bust-up to savour: Kenneth Clarke goes
head-to-head against Lord Tebbit in a Sunday Telegraph-sponsored debate on
the future of Conservatism.
FRIDAY
THE prime minister's big day.
After the divisions of the week over Europe, tax, and the welfare state, Mr
Major must give the speech of his life to save his leadership.
The prime minister - who is planning to speak without an autocue - is
expected to focus on enduring Conservative values such as living within your
means and law and order.
He is not expected to try to modify his pedestrian style; it is unlikely
there will be any rabble rousing.
A dutiful standing ovation is guaranteed. But what matters is what the
faithful will mutter about his efforts as they munch their sandwiches on the
trains home.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Skills and training 'key to security'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY workable model for full employment has to embrace the realities of
Britain's increasingly flexible labour market, according to Full Employment
UK, the employment think tank.
In its tough submission to the Commons employment committee's inquiry on
full employment it says: 'It is becoming increasingly apparent that the
familiar notions of a 'job for life' and 'employment security' are outmoded.
Real security lies . . . in the acquisition of skills and training.'
While other submissions have concentrated on macro-economic stimulus or
employment subsidies, Full Employment UK strongly advocates working with the
grain of recent labour market trends.
Labour market flexibility, the submission states, is bringing obvious
advantages to the economy in the improved price competitiveness of UK goods
and services. But, it adds, there is a disadvantage of 'widespread job
insecurity'.
Arguing for 'security of employability', as opposed to security of
employment with a particular company, Full Employment UK says that the
government must back 'supported flexibility'.
That means the state must underpin the workings of an increasingly flexible
labour market by supporting people with 'individual-centred' provision.
People need assistance to develop 'personal financial and self-investment'
strategies to overcome the irregularities in income forced on them by
flexible employment, and to facilitate 'portfolio working' - juggling
several part-time jobs at once.
Support outside the labour market is required in the form of a work-based
safety net to 'outlaw long-term unemployment' and guarantee individuals
temporary work experience with the state accepting responsibility as
'employer of last resort'.
The think tank urges the government to popularise the message of lifetime
learning with 'individual learning accounts'. These accounts would help
individuals to pay for their learning by instalments and share the costs
with their employer or the government. The aim should be that within the
next five years every adult should have their own individual learning
account.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Ministers hint at retreat over BR franchise bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday signalled the possibility of a retreat over its
plans to exclude British Rail from bidding for passenger franchises once
privatisation of the network is under way.
Ministers acknowledged that it might now prove impossible to overturn in the
House of Commons an amendment passed by the Lords allowing BR to bid for
franchises. More than a dozen Conservative MPs had indicated they were
determined to support the amendment, wiping out the government's majority
among MPs.
But ministers are to explore at this week's Conservative conference in
Blackpool the possibility of a deal with the rebels which might restrict the
conditions under which BR - as opposed to BR managers - could compete.
When the Lords amendment was first passed in the summer, ministers warned
that it could wreck the whole basis of the planned privatisation - turning
it effectively into a process of compulsory competitive tendering.
With a majority in the Commons ranged against them, that message has been
gradually toned down. One minister said yesterday that the government
remained determined that the arrangements for BR managers to bid should
remain in place but that did not exclude the possibility of separate BR
bids.
One Tory backbench MP said yesterday there were signs the government might
move towards the rebel position. Sir Keith Speed, the rebel leader, had met
ministers during the summer to discuss the way ahead. But Sir Keith, the
usually loyal Conservative MP for Ashford, is to spend conference week in
Qatar, where he is on a parliamentary visit.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Regions show jobs growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOBS have continued to be created in financial services outside London in
spite of recession, according to research by Leeds University.
Regional employment in the industry leapt by more than 40 per cent between
1981 and 1991 to reach more than 250,000. While London was hit by recession,
growth continued almost everywhere else. Only in Birmingham and Bradford did
it stall.
Birmingham - which may have suffered from relative proximity to London  -
still emerged from the 1991 census with more than 30,000 financial services
jobs, as did Edinburgh and Manchester.
Bristol, Leeds and Glasgow recorded more than 25,000 each, but Leeds has
been showing the fastest recent growth, 19 per cent between 1989 and 1991,
representing 4,000 new jobs, when 11,000 were being lost in the sector
nationally. More than 40 per cent of these new Leeds jobs, however, appear
to have been part-time ones.
Bradford's stalled growth almost certainly reflects a local shift to its
neighbour Leeds. Leeds now has six of the 20 largest regionally-based law
firms, including three of the top five. Legal services jobs more than
doubled between the 1981 and 1991 censuses. There are now more than 3,600 in
Leeds and 1,800 in Bradford, where some Leeds firms send back-office work.
Armed with the new research, Leeds Financial Services Initiative will be
launched today to promote the city as an all-round financial centre. Mr Tony
Grant, northern regional partner at Coopers and Lybrand, the accountancy
firm, will be chairman.
More than 60 companies or professional firms have joined the initiative,
which intends to join the Association of European Financial Centres.
Edinburgh and Manchester are already represented through equivalent
professional bodies. Mainland European members include Barcelona, Bilboa,
Lyons, Stuttgart and Turin.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Milan judges recover funds in Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAGISTRATES in Milan have recovered more than L100bn (Pounds 41.4m) placed
in Swiss banks by Italians involved in corruption scandals.
The magistrates have gained access to these funds by devising a scheme that
is quick and avoids Swiss sensitivities about accounts being opened to
foreign investigators.
It is based on the tactic, already widely used by the city's magistrates, of
plea-bargaining with those accused of bribery and corruption. When
confessing, the accused are asked to identify illicit funds held outside
Italy and then to sign a power of attorney for them to be collected.
Until now, Italian magistrates claim to have faced resistance by Swiss
authorities in tracing and gaining access to funds alleged to be held in
Switzerland. The Swiss judiciary has blamed Italians for overloading it with
unnecessary and poorly edited documents. The new procedure has speeded
investigations by avoiding the need to send bulky documentation to the Swiss
authorities.
At least six people are thought to have co-operated thus. Among them is Mr
Duilio Poggiolini, a former senior civil servant in the health ministry, who
last week told magistrates he had SFr11m (Pounds 5m) in Switzerland and an
estimated L200bn in gold at one of his Italian properties.
The Swiss funds are being collected by lawyers for the accused, then
deposited in an escrow account in Milan. The magistrates are reported
confident of recovering more, which raises the issue of the real ownership
of the money once it is proved to have been obtained illicitly. Some
citizens' rights groups have already suggested claiming the money on the
grounds it belongs to the taxpayer.
Milan magistrates are also believed to be negotiating the return to Italy of
Mr Enrico Braggiotti, a former chairman of the state-controlled Banca
Commerciale Italiana, in the hope they can gain access to an alleged sum of
Dollars 50.2m (Pounds 33.3m).
An international arrest warrant was last month issued for Mr Braggiotti, for
alleged corruption related to the Enimont affair - the reorganisation of the
Italian chemicals industry involving Eni, the state oil concern, and
Ferruzzi's Montedison, then headed by Mr Raul Gardini.
According to usually reliable extracts of transcripts of evidence, leaked to
the weekly magazines L'Espresso and Panorama, Mr Pino Berlini, in charge of
the Ferruzzi family's offshore finances, arranged for a total of Dollars
50.2m to be paid to Mr Braggiotti in 1989-90. The funds are alleged to have
come from offshore Montedisdon monies and were transferred on the orders of
the late Mr Gardini in return for favours granted by Mr Braggiotti at Banca
Commerciale.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mario Segni, leader of the referendum movement in Italy, called at the
weekend for a new pact among Italy's reformist forces, after his split from
Democratic Alliance, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
His departure from AD, a loose political grouping, was formalised on Friday
and has opened the way for a fresh arrangement of the alliances at the
centre of Italian politics. Speaking at a rally near Catania in Sicily, Mr
Segni said he was seeking to form 'a broad pact for national renewal' that
would focus on a full constitutional overhaul.
As the political parties prepare for municipal elections in many major
cities next month, Mr Segni has cut free to stake his claim to lead the
centre.
The former Christian Democrat made clear at the weekend that he wanted to
act as an alternative to Mr Umberto Bossi's populist Lombard League on the
right and to Mr Achille Occhetto's Party of the Democrat Left (PDS).

FT  04 OCT 93 / Patten to hold key meeting in November
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, will fly to London early next month
for a ministerial meeting which is expected to decide whether Britain will
'go it alone' on the introduction of limited democracy in the colony.
Mr Patten will be in London between November 8 and 11 and ministers have
pencilled in November 11 - when the full Cabinet meets - for the critical
meeting.
Since late April Britain and China have conducted 12 rounds of negotiations
in an attempt to reach agreement on how to conduct elections in 1995 for the
colony's Legislative Council (LegCo), its lawmaking body. But the sides
remain divided, with Britain arguing for a broad franchise and China for a
limited one.
British officials said that if, by the November meeting, there were no
prospects of agreement Mr Patten would recommend to ministers that he push
ahead with plans for limited democracy. It has not been decided if Mr Patten
would re-submit his original plans to LegCo, or the compromise plan the UK
has already made to China.
Between now and November there should be three more rounds of Anglo-Chinese
talks, raising the possibility that China might offer a compromise. But few
are hopeful.
According to one British official: 'The only way to get agreement is to do
as China wants. They want a rigged election and we cannot agree to it. We
couldn't defend it in London and we couldn't defend it in Hong Kong.'
Officials said a meeting in New York last Friday between Mr Douglas Hurd, UK
foreign secretary, and Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, produced
little sign that Beijing would respond to the UK's compromise. In TV
interviews Mr Qian restated China's intention to recover Hong Kong before
1997 if there were 'disturbances' in the colony.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, said last night he had instructed
the army to continue its intensified hunt for violent Palestinian activists
in the occupied territories, thus ignoring protests from the Palestine
Liberation Organisation, writes David Horovitz in Jerusalem.
Two members of the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement were killed by the army
on Saturday, in a big offensive in the Gaza Strip that prompted a letter of
complaint to Mr Rabin from Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman.
Mr Rabin said that Israeli troops would continue to target 'all terror
forces'. He added that the army and security services had recently
uncovered, on the West Bank, three other Hamas cells believed to be
responsible for having killed two soldiers and three Jewish settlers.
The army's operation at the weekend involved hundreds of soldiers and
curfews being extended to large areas of the Gaza Strip.
Mr Arafat's letter complained that the offensive - which followed the
capture of six pro-PLO fighters in the West Bank earlier last week -
violated the spirit of the peace deal between Israel and Palestinians.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S trade account remained stubbornly in the red in the first eight
months of the year in spite of efforts to boost exports and curb imports,
writes Tony Walker in Beijing.
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation reported that the
country's trade deficit to August reached Dollars 5.7bn (Pounds 3.8bn), with
imports up 27.3 per cent to more than Dollars 58bn. Exports grew by only 4
per cent to more than Dollars 52bn.
Beijing has set as a target for this year a balance between imports and
exports, but it seems this will be virtually impossible to achieve.
China recorded a modest surplus on its trade account in 1992 of slightly
more than Dollars 4bn, half that of the previous year. It last registered a
trade deficit in 1989.
A stabilisation programme introduced in June, aimed at calming an
overheating economy and reducing pressure on imports, has achieved some
success. Credit curbs have slowed import growth, but China's export
performance this year has proved sluggish.
The English-language Business Weekly quoted a ministry official as saying it
would be 'difficult to repeat last year's trade surplus'.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Tokyo plans cuts in import barriers: Proposals will be in
line with Hosokawa's drive to scrap costly regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government is expected to unveil on Thursday proposals to
reduce import barriers, in response to growing pressure from foreign trade
partners and domestic industry.
The proposals are the work of an advisory panel which is chaired by Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, and which includes officials from the
central bank, Japan's export-import bank and the Keidanren business
federation.
According to details leaked to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun business newspaper,
the proposals include tax incentives to encourage more foreign companies to
invest in Japan, where existing overseas investors have been big importers.
A government inquiry into non-tariff barriers, such as attempts by Japanese
businesses to squeeze out competition, is also expected. The newspaper said
other proposals included the abolition of tariffs and import curbs where
they served only to protect local industries, and a review of public
procurement to make it more open to foreign competitors.
This is in line with Mr Hosokawa's strategy of scrapping costly official
regulations, to improve economic growth potential at a time when Japan is
facing its worst recession in 20 years.
The latest measures will be welcomed by business lobbies even though they
would, if effective, increase competition in the short term.
Big business groups like the Keidanren believe any attempt to reduce the
record current account surplus will help curb the rise of the yen, which has
driven most Japanese export operations into loss this year. Japan's current
account surplus hit Dollars 117.55bn (Pounds 78bn), or 3.2 per cent of gross
domestic product, last year and is estimated to be heading towards 4 per
cent in 1993.
Like Mr Hosokawa's other deregulation plans the latest proposals would, if
turned into specific measures, be challenged by entrenched interests in the
public administration and parts of industry that would suffer.
The latest example of the strains imposed by the yen's rise came over the
weekend when Mitsubishi Motors, the vehicle group, was reported to be
planning increased production of small leisure trucks in Thailand, in search
of lower production costs.
It currently assembles 24,000 one-tonne trucks a year at a joint venture in
Thailand, using imported parts.
NHK public television said Mitsubishi would start to build up full
production there, using locally made parts, from the middle of next year and
import trucks from Thailand to Japan. That would make Mitsubishi the first
of the six Japanese automotive groups with truck plants in Thailand to begin
imports to Japan.

Abu Dhabi, the biggest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates, yesterday
agreed to double its gas exports to Japan, Reuter reports from Dubai.
The Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company signed an agreement with Tokyo
Electric Power to export 5m tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year over the
next 25 years.
Adgas said the signing in Abu Dhabi formalised a 1990 accord between the two
companies. The exports will begin in 1994, when expansion of Abu Dhabi's
liquefied gas plant on Das Island is completed.

The French government has paved the way for a relaxation of the country's
Sunday trading laws by allowing local authorities in tourist areas to decide
whether shops in their region may open on Sundays, writes Alice Rawsthorn in
Paris. The change follows a review by Mr Michel Giraud, employment minister,
of the trading ban, which dates back to 1906. However, Mr Giraud and Mr
Edouard Balladur, the centre-right prime minister, successfully opposed a
call from some MPs to introduce a shorter working week as part of their
employment reform package.

INDIA received its first foreign shipment of disaster relief aid since
independence in 1947 when a US cargo plane carrying tents and shelter
material touched down at Bombay airport yesterday, Reuter reports from
Bombay. The aircraft also carried US President Bill Clinton's personal
envoy, Mr Ray Flynn, who will assess India's aid needs following Thursday's
earthquake.
Meanwhile, the death toll in the country's worst natural disaster since
independence is probably far less than the 30,000 earlier feared. Police and
rescue workers had estimated the number of dead and missing at 30,000. But
Mr Sharad Pawar, Maharashtra chief minister, put the total number of bodies
recovered so far at 9,349, and officials said the final figure was unlikely
to be much more than double that.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Referendum pits Mubarak against apathy

<TEXT>
EGYPTIANS are likely today to guarantee Mr Hosni Mubarak's presidency to the
end of the millennium, by endorsing in a referendum the 65-year-old leader's
candidacy for a third six-year term.
The state-owned Akhbar el-Yawm newspaper yesterday published opinion polls
indicating Mr Mubarak would win backing from 93.7 per cent of voters, with
an 80 per cent turnout.
However, independent surveys last week showed only 30 per cent of voters had
bothered to register for the poll - which offers a straight yes or no vote
on Mr Mubarak's unrivalled candidacy.
Although there is no alternative candidate, and the result has been a
foregone conclusion since the National Assembly rubber-stamped Mr Mubarak's
candidacy for the referendum in July, the government has been straining to
portray the exercise as one of 'deepening citizenship and the concept of
participation'.
TV commercials, posters and banners have assaulted the Egyptian public for
weeks in an attempt to whip up the democratic spirit. But the campaign
appears more to demonstrate the depth of official concern that few Egyptians
will see the point in appearing at the polling stations.
If a carefully stage-managed 'Yes to Mubarak' rally this weekend in the poor
Zenhom district of Cairo is any guide, it is a real fear. Organisers put the
crowd at 10,000, but it was no larger than an end-of-season, mid-table third
division soccer match - 2,000 at most - and about as enthusiastic. Repeated
attempts by the speakers to raise pro-Mubarak chants, or songs praising the
president, fell flat and the crowds began drifting home half an hour into
the two-hour event.
Mr Mubarak has even shown a glimmer of embarrassment over this east-European
style campaign.
In a recent interview he conceded he did not wish to receive a 99 per cent
endorsement. 'I do not like it, because perfection belongs to God alone,' he
said.
'The most important thing is that every citizen goes to the polls, because
democracy grows by practice.'
For a growing number of critics of the present government, however, today's
referendum is the wrong sort of practice - one which results from a
constitution drawn up in 1971 on essentially east-European socialist lines.
Moreover, although the former air force general who replaced President Sadat
in 1981 cautiously introduced a modicum of democratic opening into the
system during his earlier term, he has also ruled the country under a
12-year-long state of emergency.
'The essence of democracy is choice,' said one liberal intellectual. 'This
right is totally abolished under our present system. Is it any wonder people
lose interest?'

<TEXT>
THE BOSNIAN government came under fresh attack from its own people
yesterday, as the confrontation between President Alija Izetbegovic and his
rival, Mr Fikrat Abdic, leader of the north-western enclave of Bihac, turned
violent.
Forces loyal to Mr Izetbegovic stormed a radio station held by forces loyal
to Mr Abdic and shot dead a local policeman. A UN forces spokesman said
thousands of pro- and anti-government demonstrators had taken to the streets
at Bihac.
Mr Abdic, long an opponent of Mr Izetbegovic, was sacked from Bosnia's
collective leadership after he declared that the enclave, which is
surrounded by Serb territory, would be independent of Sarajevo.
Mr Ejup Ganic, a member of the Bosnian government, Mr Rasim Delic, Bosnian
army commander, and the Moslem Iman of Sarajevo are to meet Mr Abdic for
UN-sponsored negotiations today.
In another blow to Bosnia's Moslem-led government, the Bosnian Serb leader,
Mr Radovan Karadzic, confirmed that his Serb assembly had withdrawn the
offer to hand over land seized in the 18-month war.
The Bosnian Serb assembly, on Saturday night in Banja Luka, the
north-western Serb stronghold, voted to withdraw all concessions to its
outgunned Moslem rivals, following the rejection by the Bosnian assembly of
proposed maps.
The assembly of the self-styled Bosnian Serb state, dealt another death blow
to the Geneva peace process, making clear its opposition to despatch of
foreign troops, including Nato forces, to Serb-held territory. Deployment of
US and Nato troops is seen as crucial to the enforcement of any peace plan.
But, as a sign of pressure on the Bosnian Serbs from Belgrade, which is
eager to reach a settlement to lift the UN sanctions on Serbia, the Serbs
said they wanted to remain part of the peace process.
In spite of fears that the latest breakdown in peace talks would set off
more fighting, the UN said Bosnia remained relatively calm, with a ceasefire
around Mostar apparently holding. But troops were reported massing in the
Serb-controlled enclave of Krajina in Croatia, where the mandate for the UN
peacekeepers patrolling the region is due to run out tomorrow. Croatia says
the UN peacekeepers should disarm the Serbs or withdraw entirely.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Hunger bites in squabbling Serbia: Laura Silber finds a
country groaning under international economic sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN ATTEMPT to prevent the total collapse of the Serbian economy,
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia is desperately seeking an end to
sanctions.
He is faced by much deprivation and has shown himself ready to fulfil UN
conditions for an end to Serbia's economic isolation, in spite of an earlier
vow that sanctions would not be lifted via concessions by Belgrade. Even
rival Bosnian Moslem leaders, during the Geneva peace talks last month,
called Mr Milosevic the most flexible of all the Serbian politicians.
As a step towards convincing the west of Serbia's good intentions, and
making room for manoeuvre in the domestic political arena, Mr Milosevic's
ruling Socialist party (SPS) last week turned on Mr Vojislav Seselj, the
powerful ultra-nationalist leader.
The Serbian Radical Party, once the socialists' unofficial coalition
partner, controls a quarter of the seats in the Serbian parliament and has a
paramilitary wing. But Mr Seselj seems to have outlived his usefulness. Mr
Milosevic's socialists are now blaming Mr Seselj for Serbia's isolation,
calling their former puppet a fascist and even hinting he is guilty of war
crimes.
State-run television broadcasts public denounciations of Mr Seselj and tries
to brighten the economic picture. Belgrade officials claim to have slowed
Serbia's economic decline after monthly inflation had dropped to 660 from
2,000 per cent.
Cooking oil returned to grocery store shelves. but eggs, milk and flour did
not. Meat was available, but for most people unattainable. The price of an
average basket of shopping still amounted to thousands of dinars. Earlier
last week, it had been in the thousands of billions, before the move to
strike six zeroes off dinar notes' face value.
The state propaganda machine, although it seems to have the field to itself,
has failed to mask the sudden impoverishment of the inhabitants of Serbia.
Prices of burek, traditional Balkan breakfast fare, now rise twice in one
morning. The Belgrade daily Politika reported that prices increased every
ten minutes at one restaurant. Pensioners, their faces tearful, comb
markets, able to afford little on their monthly income equivalent to DM10
(Pounds 4.08), which buys 10 kilos of potatoes.
Mr Milosevic's hopes for easing the sanctions and staving off economic
collapse were dashed last week when the Bosnian parliament rejected the
latest Serb-Croat proposal for Bosnian partition.
Belgrade's Bosnian Serb proxies at the weekend stoked the fires of the
Bosnian war, voting to withdraw their territorial concessions if Moslem
leaders refused to back the proposed maps.
In the event of a settlement, they said, foreign soldiers, including those
of Nato, would not be allowed to enforce the plan on Serb-held territory.
But the Bosnian government in Sarajevo has made clear that endorsement of
the plan hinges on US and Nato engagement.
As the Geneva talks on Bosnia unravel, international attentian has focused
on the rumbling Serb-Croat conflict. The UN this week will reconsider the
prospects for carrying out the Vance peace plan, signed in January 1992.
Croat authorities, frustrated by Serbian intransigience, are insisting that
the lifting of sanctions on Belgrade be tied to the return of a third of
Serb-held land to Croatian control.
Mr Milosevic has sent signals that he is ready to hand over Knin, centre of
the self-styled Serb state in Croatia. But first he must get rid of the
hard-line nationalist opposition, such as Mr Seselj.
Mr Milosevic may be willing to make concessions but it is unlikely sanctions
will be lifted soon, forcing him to deal with an economic deluge.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mario Segni, leader of the referendum movement in Italy, called at the
weekend for a new pact among Italy's reformist forces, after his split from
Democratic Alliance, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
His departure from AD, a loose political grouping, was formalised on Friday
and has opened the way for a fresh arrangement of the alliances at the
centre of Italian politics.
Speaking at a rally near Catania in Sicily, Mr Segni said he was seeking to
form 'a broad pact for national renewal' that would focus on a full
constitutional overhaul.
As the political parties prepare for municipal elections in many major
cities next month, Mr Segni has cut free to stake his claim to lead the
centre.
The former Christian Democrat made clear at the weekend that he wanted to
act as an alternative to Mr Umberto Bossi's populist Lombard League on the
right and to Mr Achille Occhetto's Party of the Democrat Left (PDS).
Mr Segni's divorce was provoked by his refusal to see the AD ally with the
PDS. He feared the movement would be manipulated in the former communists'
desire for power.
He is now free to move back towards his former colleagues in the Christian
Democrat Party. Many observers felt that his departure from it in March was
temporary. Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the party secretary, has made no secret of
his desire to see Mr Segni back in the fold.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Argentine mid-term poll shows lead for Peronists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RULING Peronist party in Argentina took an estimated 40 per cent of the
votes yesterday in mid-term Congressional elections.
Early indications showed the voters having given the Peronists a lead of
about 10 percentage points over the opposition Radical party.
This points to a new Chamber of Deputies little different to that shaped by
the polls of 1991 and so the government's 45 per cent share of the 257 seats
in the chamber is likely to be much as before.
Therefore, President Carlos Menem's bid to change the constitution - so as
to allow himself to stand for a second successive term, in a presidential
election late next year - has not been greatly aided.
The government needs a two-thirds majority in both the Chamber of Deputies
and the Senate to begin the complex process of amendment.
Mr Menem says he will call a plebiscite of Argentina's 21.5m voters next
month on the issue, hoping the result of such a sounding, albeit not binding
on Congress, will increase pressure on legislators to amend the
constitution.
An attempt last month to pass a motion, calling for constitutional reform,
failed in the Peronist-controlled senate when two Peronist senators
abstained.
More detailed data on the voting yesterday will only be available today or
tomorrow. The government was expected to sweep the Peronist heartland in the
province of Buenos Aires, the country's most populous and most productive,
but the vote was too close to call in the Radical bastions of Cordoba, in
the centre of the country, and the city of Buenos Aires.
If the Peronists were to carry these two cities, that would represent a
weighty victory over the Radicals.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NERVOUSNESS about the outcome of Canada's general election on October 25 has
helped push the Canadian dollar down to its lowest level in six years.
The currency closed at 74.71 US cents on Friday, more than a cent below its
level a week earlier and about 10 per cent below its peak of 83 US cents in
November 1991.
In another sign of pre-election jitters, the gap between US and Canadian
long-term bonds has widened in recent weeks from 1.35 percentage points to
about 1.7 percentage points.
Markets have been especially unsettled by the strength of the separatist
Bloc Quebecois. Recent opinion polls show the bloc could hold the balance of
power in the next parliament, with 40-50 seats in the 295-seat House of
Commons.
Mr Lucien Bouchard, bloc leader, has pledged not to be a disruptive force in
parliament, but the BQ platform is based on the premise that Quebec gets
less than its fair share from the federal system.
The two main parties, the ruling Progressive Conservatives and the Liberals,
are still optimistic that the bloc's popularity will wane as election day
draws closer. They hope to persuade Quebec voters that they do better to
support a party with a chance of controlling the purse-strings and patronage
of the federal government.
The fall in the Canadian dollar has also been linked to concerns about the
creditworthiness of the country's provinces, which are heavy borrowers on
international capital markets. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating
agency, warned last week that it may downgrade Ontario's debt for the third
time in three years.
The Bank of Canada has done little so far to brake the slide in the
currency. The economy remains weak and the central bank appears to be giving
higher priority, for the time being, to holding down interest rates.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Kenya sees early pact with IMF over reform: Finance minister
welcomes World Bank role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA EXPECTS to reach agreement soon with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on a three-year economic reform programme which would form the basis
of an appeal for renewed aid at next month's meeting of donors, Mr Musalia
Mudavadi, Kenyan finance minister, said in London at the weekend.
An IMF mission is due in Nairobi this week to finalise terms of an extended
structural adjustment facility, the minister told the Financial Times. He
was passing through London after talks with IMF officials in Washington.
He described last week's announcement by the World Bank that it would chair
a consultative group meeting of donors in Paris as 'the critical step for
the restoration of normality in (Kenya's) donor relations.' Aid to Kenya has
been sharply reduced after the last official donor conference in Paris, in
November 1991. Donors sharply criticised the country's economic and
political record, and made further financial support conditional on reform.
The combination of multi-party elections last December and economic policy
measures over recent months seem to have been enough to meet donor
conditions. Donor officials estimate that aid 'sanctions' over the past two
years have cost the country well over Dollars 500m. As a result of the
shortfall in foreign exchange receipts, arrears on the country's Dollars 8bn
external debt now exceed Dollars 300m.
Government officials say they have yet to set a figure for the support they
will be seeking from donors at the Paris meeting, due to open on November
22. But Mr Mudavadi said Kenya would argue that its record showed the
government 'means business'.
'The exchange rate has been devalued three times, we have liberalised the
private sector's access to foreign exchange through the commercial banking
system, and we have moved against the weak financial institutions' - a
reference that includes action against a group of banks which made unsecured
loans to politicians.
The government also plans to reduce the size of the civil service by about
16,000 posts a year, 'over the next few years, giving a leaner, more
efficient administration'.
In March, President Daniel arap Moi, angered by a cautious donor response to
a spate of economic adjustments, accused the IMF and World Bank of forcing
'dictatorial and suicidal reforms' on Kenya, saying he would 'no longer
accept any form of economic arm-twisting from any quarter.'
As the aid squeeze took its toll, though, government and donors grew
alarmed. High inflation and fuel shortages threatened the security of the
government, and both sides became anxious to end the impasse.
Members of Kenya's opposition parties, however, remain sceptical about the
government's change of heart. They argue that Mr Moi has skilfully exploited
western concern, doing enough to lure back the donors and ease the foreign
exchange shortage, but without commitment to sustained reform.

FT  04 OCT 93 / The search for both more and better jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1993, says the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) from the International
Monetary Fund, unemployment in industrial countries is expected to surpass
32m, 3m more than in 1982, the trough of the previous recession.* The social
and economic costs of this are enormous.
Little wonder, then, that the Clinton administration is planning a summit on
global unemployment this autumn. Little wonder, too, that the European
Community, whose overall unemployment rate is projected by the IMF at close
to 12 per cent in 1994, is engaged upon its own analysis of the obstacles to
employment.
Yet we already know something about both the employment problem and the
possible solutions. First, as is emphasised in the WEO, the growth of
unemployment since the early 1970s, particularly in the EC, can be explained
neither by accelerated productivity growth nor by faster growth of trade
with developing countries.
Second, the relationship between the growth of output and employment has
varied enormously across the leading industrial countries (see chart).
Third, those differences in labour-absorption have, as could be predicted,
been inversely related to growth of real wages. Last, differences in the
performance of overall employment have not had equivalent effects on the
unemployment, still less on the non-employment, of unskilled males.
The trend growth of labour productivity has fallen from 5 per cent a year in
the EC of 30 years ago to a little over 1 per cent a year now. Nevertheless,
unemployment has risen almost continuously, from 2 per cent of the EC labour
force in 1970. Similarly, the growth of trade with developing countries has
been insufficient to explain rising unemployment and deteriorating unskilled
male employment. The failure has been the poor capacity of these economies
to generate new jobs in place of those that are lost.
Between 1972 and 1992, real gross domestic product rose by 61 per cent in
the US, by almost exactly the same proportion in France and Germany, by a
little more in Italy, and by a little less in the UK. Yet employment rose by
43 per cent in the US, and by very little in France, Germany, Italy and the
UK (see chart).
If output growth is the same, while employment growth is very different,
increases in real wages will, failing implausibly large shifts in the share
of wages in value added, also differ. Between 1972 and 1992 US average real
wages fell by about 10 per cent. Over the same period, French real wages
rose by some 76 per cent, Italian wages by 68 per cent, British wages by 48
per cent and German wages by 43 per cent. It is not difficult, therefore, to
see why Americans voted for a man who promised them more 'good jobs'.
Where the two different patterns seem to give roughly the same unhappy
result is for male non-employment. As Edward Balls pointed out, in this
space on September 6, male non-employment has risen almost everywhere.
Unskilled men will not take, or are not offered, the new jobs created in a
US-style deregulated labour market, while there are few new jobs of any kind
in the more regulated ones.
One response might be for unskilled males to be told firmly that their
expectations are unrealistic, with employers neither needing brawn nor
offering long-term, full-time employment to the unskilled. Quite a different
possibility would be to provide job subsidies specifically for unskilled
males.
The best possibility, however, would be to imitate the Japanese. Between
1972 and 1992, Japanese GDP rose by 119 per cent, Japanese employment by 25
per cent and Japanese real wages by 41 per cent, while unemployment remained
negligible. The Japanesesolution was the highest rate of formation of
physical and human capital in the industrial world, combined with a labour
market that gave new job opportunities to outsiders and job protection to
insiders. This is the only route towards the magic trio of higher output,
higher employment and better jobs.

     INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS - PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all
data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100.
Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production
show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the
previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The
unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force.
Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Malawi president taken to hospital in S Africa

<TEXT>
DR Hastings Kamuzu Banda, Malawi's elderly life-president, has been flown to
South Africa for medical treatment, it was learnt last night, prompting
opposition parties to prepare to help fill a possible power vacuum.
Full details of the president's condition have been withheld from the
public. Malawians have been told only that Dr Banda, thought to have
suffered a heart attack last Thursday, had been confined to bed.
However, Mr John Tembo, a senior minister long tipped as Dr Banda's
successor, confirmed in an interview with the Financial Times that the
president was in South Africa: 'I do not know what is wrong but I hear he is
doing better down there'.
President Banda's exact age is not certain, but he is thought to be in his
mid-90s. He failed to attend the annual convention of the ruling Malawi
Congress Party (MCP), in the capital Lilongwe, yesterday. His opening
address, which advocated close working relations with opposition parties in
the transition to democracy now under way, was read by a minister.
This is the first time in Dr Bandas 29-year presidency that he has been
officially acknowledged to be in ill health.
Opposition parties, believing a power vacuum is about to arise, are anxious
about the consequences Dr Banda's death might have for the democratic
process which has gone smoothly since last June, when a decisive majority of
Malawians voted in favour of political pluralism and an end to the country's
one-party system.
A National Consultative Committee, on which opposition representatives hold
a majority, has been drawing up a new electoral law and a timetable for
elections. It has been expected that their recommendations would be endorsed
by the ruling Malawi Congress Party in parliament in October.
The two chief opposition groups are Mr Chakufwa Chihana's Alliance for
Democracy (Aford), associated with the north of the country, and Mr Bakili
Muluzi's United Democratic Front (UDF), associated with the south.
Aford officials say they would prefer the Congress Party to appoint an
interim president, if necessary, until a general election.
The UDF is likely to press for an election earlier than the proposed May
1994 date.
Mr Muluzi last night called for 'all the parties to play a role in selecting
a caretaker president, if necessary'.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Treuhand head administers a painful cure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'NO POLITICIAN in the world could have taken our decisions,' says Mrs Birgit
Breuel, head of the Treuhand agency that three years ago was charged with
privatising and restructuring eastern German industry following German
unification.
The 57-year-old former finance minister of Lower Saxony manages one of the
world's largest holding companies, with 13,175 enterprises and 27,000 land
and housing titles. The agency has already privatised 8,224 companies,
liquidated 2,957, secured job guarantees for 1.48m and got investment
commitments exceeding DM181.6bn (Pounds 74bn).
But the job has been a messy one. 'We had no tools. No rules. Not even a
list of the companies which we were responsible for,' she says.
At the same time, with 1.7m or 15.4 per cent of workers unemployed in east
Germany, the agency was axing jobs. 'They were so horrified about what
happened to them. They thought the Treuhand was res-ponsible for all their
grievances in the world,' she said. 'Our bad reputation resulted from our
job to reduce their jobs. Whatever we did, whe-ther we privatised, or
restructured, or closed down companies, jobs had to be reduced. Nobody in
eastern Germany can like us for doing that.'
That mission, says Mrs Breuel, in turn allowed the politicians in Bonn to
blame, hide behind and use the Treuhand as a scapegoat. 'This was the idea
of our job - to have distance between the politicians and the Treuhand
enterprises.'
The early days did see mistakes, however. 'Maybe it was a mistake that we
did not realise earlier that there were too many investors who bought but
were only interested in the real estate,' she explains. 'It took us a couple
of months to find out. Then we forced them to give some sort of guarantees
for jobs and investments. The thinking behind the guarantees - apart from
preventing speculators - was to convince east Germans we were working for
them, for their enterprises and jobs, and that this was the only chance for
the companies to have a future.' The Treuhand is now relying on western
German and foreign investors to take up where it has left off to assure that
future.
'Our enterprises have really improved their quality. What they need is
orders. As soon as they receive orders, they increase their productivity
immensely. But the (size of the) orders they receive are linked to the
recession. If western German companies do not give orders to eastern German
companies, the transfers (which this year will total DM180bn) will have to
go on for a long time. They will have to be paid by taxes.'
The logic is impeccable. But can orders alone help move eastern Germany
towards a self-sustaining economy? 'It depends on how fast the recession
ends in western Germany,' she says.
But she added that 'mental unification will take longer than economic
unification. We have been separated for 40 years. But (the mental
unification) is not true for the people living or working here in eastern
Germany.'
Despite the high levels of unemployment in eastern Germany, it is often
surprising that there have been no mass demonstrations, no major strikes, no
signs of social unrest. 'What has surprised me most is the people living
there,' says Mrs Breuel. 'After all they have been through they are still,
to a certain extent, optimistic. They are highly motivated and realistic.
They are our greatest asset.'

FT  04 OCT 93 / Brittan seeks swift dumping probes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR EC trade officials want to speed up the Community's investigations
into 'dumping' of non-EC products on the European market, writes Andrew Hill
in Brussels.
Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, will today sound out foreign ministers
from the 12 member states on the possibility of introducing a nine-month
deadline for the imposition of provisional anti-dumping duties.
Dumping occurs when products are exported to the EC at unfairly low prices,
compared with the price on the producer's domestic market. Duties are
imposed if EC producers have suffered 'injury' as a result, but
investigations can take more than 18 months.
Sir Leon also wants to improve transparency and efficiency by providing more
information to interested parties and splitting up the inquiries into
dumping and injury, as in the US. EC officials say this would require more
staff.
Sir Leon's proposals, which have yet to be put to other EC commissioners,
may help relaunch debate on the more sensitive question of whether to change
procedures for voting on anti-dumping decisions. An earlier plan, which
would give the Commission more power to push through duties, has been bogged
down for a year.
National officials believe concessions on the issue could help persuade
France - which wants to strengthen the EC's arsenal of trade weapons - to
sign up to a world trade deal, provided the problem of agricultural
subsidies can be settled.

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S engineering workers at the weekend set themselves on a collision
course with their employers, as the new leader of IG Metall, the country's
largest trade union, ordered his members to prepare for a strike next year.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, confirmed in the most powerful union position in the land,
picked up the gauntlet thrown down by the engineering employers last week
when they unilaterally served notice of termination of current pay and
holiday contracts in the 4m-strong industry.
'Agitation is now our first responsibility,' he declared to the
extraordinary union congress, summoned to elect a successor to Mr Franz
Steinkuhler, who resigned over allegations of insider dealing. 'We must
prepare immediately for strikes and lockouts in any form.'
And yet the union response to the employers appears to be dictated more in
sorrow than anger, as top officials made it clear they did not want open
confrontation at a time of recession and drastic job cuts. They accused
Gesamtmetall, the employers' organisation, of bowing to the aggressive
instincts of their small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, who are being
squeezed by rising costs and falling order books.
Mr Zwickel rejected a call by employers for preliminary talks on the
forthcoming wage round, even before formal claims have been submitted in
each region. He warned that the union would be 'mercilessly tough' if
employers insisted on pressing for real cuts in pay and holiday bonuses.
'Gesamtmetall has determined on a course of confrontation,' he said. 'Their
termination of the wage contracts makes a mockery of the social state.'
Yet at the same time his address was a passionate defence of the German
tradition of social partnership and consensus, suggesting an understanding
of the sharp downturn in the country's engineering, electrical and motor
industries, and a willingness to seek a common union-management response.
Job security was the union's highest priority, Mr Zwickel said, and he
called for a national moratorium on further job cuts. The union was not
intending to seek any pay rise beyond the likely increase in prices and
productivity in 1994.
He agreed that short-time working, and any other forms of voluntary cuts in
working hours, should be used to protect jobs.
The 3.25m-strong engineering workers' union - still reeling from the shock
resignation of Mr Steinkuhler, job losses in the sector running at 30,000 a
month, and a 10 per cent loss in its membership since 1991 - closed ranks at
the congress, with more than 90 per cent supporting Mr Zwickel's election.
His deputy, Mr Walter Riester, the Stuttgart regional union leader
responsible for negotiating the final wage deal in the industry for the past
three years, won 88.5 per cent.
The one moment of anxiety for the leadership came when a delegate from
Wuppertal sought to nominate Mr Steinkuhler as leader once again, insisting
his resignation should not have been accepted.
Mr Steinkuhler strode up to the rostrum and graciously declined to accept
the nomination, to the relief of the entire platform and a good part of the
delegates.
'History cannot be turned back,' he said.

FT  04 OCT 93 / EC hunts for unity on Gatt
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers will try in Luxembourg today to ease
some of the sense of crisis swirling around the Gatt world trade reform
talks. They intend to focus on areas in which they broadly agree, rather
than on the farm trade chapter where a threatened French veto risks the
collapse of the seven-year-old negotiations.
In sharp contrast to the September 20 'jumbo' council of EC foreign,
agriculture and trade ministers - devoted almost exclusively to
consideration of French insistence on a better farm trade deal than the
Blair House EC-US accord negotiated last November - the 12 want to
concentrate on areas such as textiles, financial services, steel and
aviation.
Part of the plan is pedagogic - to place up front what will be lost in
expanded trade were the Uruguay Round talks to fall apart as a result of the
French veto on agricul-ture.
The 'jumbo' meeting was marked by a sharp confrontation between Sir Leon
Brittan, chief EC trade negotiator, and Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign
minister, and clouded by alleged UK threats to boycott the Community if the
farm trade issue sabotaged an accord.
Senior French diplomats made clear last week that Paris was anxious to avoid
further confrontation today, while Mr Juppe recently warned a Gaullist
audience of the dangers of protectionism.
Senior UK officials, for their part, say there will be 'very little
shoot-out atmosphere' today, and have back-tracked on the dubious boycott
threat. What British officials said outside the September 20 meeting -
insinuating the UK might adopt the 'empty chair' policy used by General
Charles de Gaulle to boycott the EC in 1965-66 - went well beyond the
measured gravity of what Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said inside
the meeting.
Mr Hurd warned his colleagues of an internal EC crisis by saying: 'I cannot
conceive how the EC will continue with the normal transaction of business if
it were seen as causing the collapse of the Uruguay Round.' Though this
marked a hardening of Britain's position, a senior UK official said that
'what Hurd was saying was that a Gatt crisis would drive everything else off
the (EC) agenda'.
He was not threatening a boycott.
Sir Leon put France's farm demands on the table at a meeting in Washington
last week with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. The two
negotiators are to discuss the issues in substance in Brussels on October
13.
But with 10 weeks to go to the December 15 Uruguay Round deadline, the EC
appears to be gearing up to try to resolve the farm trade issue at a special
summit of heads of government on October 29.

The German chemicals industry has sent clear signals to its workforce that
there will be little on offer in pay negotiations due to start next month,
writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt.
About 30,000 jobs would be lost this year and more would follow in 1994,
according to a newsletter from the industry's employers' association. It
pointed out that gross pay rates had increased 15.5 per cent between early
1990 and the first half of 1993, while productivity had risen only 6 per
cent.
Prices were falling, unit labour costs were rising in spite of job cuts, and
overall production fell 4.5 per cent in the first seven months of this year,
the letter said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'I BELIEVE in our common sense and our strength,' declared President Boris
Yeltsin as he mustered support to put down yesterday's turmoil. 'We have a
great deal more of these than those adventurers who are shooting at
Muscovites,' he said in a statement read out for him on television.
He said he had ordered the dismissal of Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi,
who had spurred the revolt on. He had also dismissed the Afghan war hero
from the armed forces.
'Today the fate of Russia and the fate of our children is being decided. The
forces of civil war will not succeed,' he said, adding: 'We will triumph.'
In another address to Muscovites, First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar
warned that a 'bloody, brown curtain' of fascism would fall on Russia if the
revolt succeeded. Much depended on the support of the population, he said.
'If today we let into power those who are grasping for it, if we place the
keys of government in their hands, they are capable of bringing a bloody
brown curtain down over the country for decades.'

FT  04 OCT 93 / The Russian Crisis: Voices on fringe rise to a roar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APART from being holed up in the White House, a monarchist priest, an
unemployed Communist, and a black-shirted fascist had one thing in common
yesterday morning: unwavering certainty in their victory over the 'Yeltsin
regime'.
Victor, a priest in black robes with a monarchist flag pinned on to his
chest, explained that he was opposed to the forces of evil represented by Mr
Yeltsin. Young men with fascist insignia on their camouflage uniforms
guarded the offices of parliamentary leaders. Yuri, an unemployed dancer
signed up with the Cossacks paramilitary force, was watching a demonstration
on how to operate an automatic weapon in the parliament's coat-room.
'What unites us is a desire to make Russia a good, rich, just country.'
The fact that Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, and
Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi came to be defended by society's 'loony
fringe' only added to the apparent hopelessness of their cause.
But by evening, after a blockade of thousands of troops and police around
the parliament was overrun by demonstrators who took over the mayor's office
and the television station, their desperate conviction had turned into
shocking prophecy.
Earlier in the day, Mr Rutskoi, installed as acting president by parliament
two weeks ago, said: 'The only possible compromise is for Yeltsin to resign
. . . If we do not win, we will condemn Russia to a century of
dictatorship.'
He poured scorn on Russia's mainstream politicians who had deserted him, and
said there was nothing wrong with the National Salvation Front which had
rallied to his defence. Mr Rutskoi also attacked the army's high command for
its 'so-called neutrality', the media for their biased coverage, and the
intelligentsia for 'remaining silent'.
Asked whether he was not worried by threats from Mr Rutskoi to punish troops
and police who supported Mr Yeltsin's coup, a police captain parked outside
the parliament building replied with a smile: 'We are all part of the same
nation. Nothing will happen to us, we'll just go on working as usual just
like we did after the last coup.'

FT  04 OCT 93 / The Russian Crisis: Yeltsin's opponents focus anger on
biased coverage by media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE conflict among the Russian people has gone too far,' were the prophetic
last words of the broadcaster before one of Russia's main TV channels came
off the air at 7:42pm last night.
The Ostankino TV centre, which broadcasts for both Russian and Commonwealth
television, was the most coveted of prizes for President Boris Yeltsin's
opponents who stormed the building last night.
If they had one justifiable complaint, since President Yeltsin won the April
referendum with the active support of the media, it was that of biased
coverage.
For the journalists themselves have openly taken sides in Russia's political
battles, either out of economic necessity or political conviction. Threats
by one parliamentary leader before last night's events to 'hang journalists'
played a considerable role in forcing them to choose sides.
Last night Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, warned
journalists they would otherwise be held responsible for 'crimes against the
nation'.
In the past two weeks, television has contented itself with bland reports of
Mr Yeltsin's decrees and his efforts to end the siege of parliament
peacefully. There has been little room for the views of those holed up
inside the White House and their supporters. A programme called Red Square
was taken off the air last week by the head of the Commonwealth television
station, on the grounds it could incite violence.
Red Square's producer, Mr Alexander Liubimov, himself a pro-Yeltsin deputy,
says he was prevented from informing the public 'of what is happening in
society' as a result of television's dependence on state subsidies.
'I don't blame Ostankino as such. I blame the people who exploit this
economic situation for political motives.' The state-owned Russian
Television company, for instance, receives Rbs30bn in state subsidies a
year, compared to just Rbs400m in advertising revenues.
The tragedy of Russia's media has been that in being forced to take sides
they have helped precipitate a backlash against them.
'Although I am not delighted by either side, Yeltsin is the lesser of two
evils,' Ms Svetlana Sorokina, the charming 36-year-old presenter of Russian
television news who has freely mixed the news with her pro-Yeltsin
sympathies, said in an interview before last night's events.
On Saturday night she concluded her broadcast with words echoing Mr
Yeltsin's calls for a peaceful end to the siege of the Russian parliament.
'Let us not give into passions, and let us chase hatred from our hearts.'
When Mr Yeltsin's mother died just as he was being driven into a corner by
parliament last April, Ms Sorokina exclaimed: 'Hang on in there, Boris
Nikolaevich.'
The day after Mr Yeltsin dissolved parliament, the board of Russian TV
issued a statement voicing unanimous support for his decision.
Mr Sergei Skvortsov, the suave deputy head of Russian Television, agreed in
a recent interview that Russian journalists' overt involvement in politics
could badly backfire against media freedoms in future. 'In theory you're
right, but this is Russia. If you look at the people in the White House, the
journalists' reaction is a natural response to the situation.'
The same voluntary bias is true of many newspapers. Izvestiya newspaper's
staunch support for Mr Yeltsin has been partly due to Mr Khasbulatov's
attempts to turn it into a parliamentary newspaper. But in publishing a
psychiatrist's statement declaring the occupants of the White House to be
mentally unsound, Komsomolskaya Pravda, the former Communist youth paper,
made a bizarre journey into the past - when both psychiatry and journalism
were under the thumb of the authorities.
Fears that unless the bias in television is corrected, Russia will be unable
to hold free and fair elections for a new president and parliament remain as
true today as ever before. 'Today, many people understand that under such
political pressure, television will be unlikely to secure objective coverage
of the election campaign,' warned Nezavisimaya (Independent) newspaper at
the weekend. It urged the creation of a body to enforce media impartiality
in the run-up to the elections.
'Both sides have been trying to get the media on their side while true
democrats want the media to be on the side of the people,' warned Mr Mikhail
Fedotov, the former information minister forced to quit last month by the
president's more interventionist aide for the media, Mr Mikhail Poltoranin.

Moscow confrontation will be deep and lasting

WHEN Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, appealed last night
for popular support to prevent Russia being turned into 'a giant
concentration camp for decades to come,' he was right to be worried.
Having traded threats with each other, Russia's leaders on either side of
the barricades embarked on a struggle for their own survival.
President Boris Yeltsin, warning that the 'fate of our children is at
stake', last night said his opponents had overstepped all acceptable limits.
He sacked his vice-president, General Alexander Rutskoi, and can be expected
to punish his opponents by the full measure of the law if he wins.
He urged popular support for democracy and market reforms, saying his
opponents would not allow free elections. But he will probably pursue more
oppressive policies at home if he wins the confrontation.
Similarly, Mr Rutskoi said Mr Yeltsin must be held to account for the
collapse of the Soviet Union, of the Russian economy, and of the army.
He vowed to punish corrupt and unpatriotic officials whom he accused of
selling Russia out to western interests. He threatened to try senior
officers who continued to support Mr Yeltsin and expressed his contempt for
most of Russia's mainstream politicians, including former allies such as Mr
Arkady Volsky, the head of the industrialists' union, and his former
ideologue, Mr Vassily Lipitsky.
Mr Rutskoi praised 'patriots' in the National Salvation Front, whose members
have advocated variously a restoration of the Soviet Union, a return to
communism, and a more nationalist foreign policy.
For the former Soviet republics, the issue is one of life-or-death. Having
supported Mr Yeltsin, they could face a return to power of politicians who
want to reconstitute the Soviet Union.
Just as the failed 1991 coup precipitated the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the outcome of this battle could determine whether Russia sticks together as
one country. Russia's provinces, having waited on the sidelines to see which
side would win in Moscow, could be forced to take sides.
With local administrations supporting Mr Yeltsin and the heads of local
councils supporting parliament, there will also be retribution against those
local officials who have backed the losing side.
Despite Mr Yeltsin's appeals for support, the increasing popular
indifference to politics which allowed the president to dissolve parliament
less than two weeks ago could also play against him.
Just like the Russian army, the Russian people are haunted by the memory of
the brutal civil war which ravaged the country seven decades ago. The army,
which has vowed to stay 'neutral' in the current conflict, could begin to
fall apart at the seams if its commanders take sides and if the troops
refuse to obey orders.
The events of the last 24 hours have pushed Russia to the brink of civil
war. If President Yeltsin manages to restore order, the wounds of the
confrontation - due in large part to the folly of politicians - will be deep
and lasting.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Yeltsin acts to quell revolt: 21 die in battles for key
Moscow buildings - Troops and tanks move on capital / Rebels prepare to
defend White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TROOPS with armoured vehicles moved into Moscow streets early today as
President Boris Yeltsin sought to quell the hardline rebellion that brought
fierce gun battles to the city yesterday.
At least 21 people were reported killed and hundreds injured in the
uprising.
With a troop crackdown expected, about 2,000 rebels last night strengthened
barricades around the White House, the parliament building. Others gathered
around the main television centre, which they had earlier attacked and
briefly put off the air before being repulsed in savage fighting with
pro-Yeltsin soldiers from elite units.
Mr Yeltsin, who declared a state of emergency in the capital, vowed he would
triumph over the 'adventurers' backing parliament, which he dissolved in a
decree 12 days previously.
The revolt confronted Mr Yeltsin with an agonising decision he had tried to
avoid in his stand-off with defiant deputies - whether to use force to back
up his decree and clear them and their weapons out of the White House.
As a showdown loomed, Mr Yeltsin's rebellious vice-president, Mr Alexander
Rutskoi, declared an overnight 'curfew' inside parliament. He banned all
movement from floor to floor or along corridors in the darkened building.
Mr Rutskoi, named president by the defiant parliament in the wake of Mr
Yeltsin's decree, yesterday spurred the demonstrators into their violent
actions.
Trouble flared as 15,000 anti-Yeltsin protesters smashed through a security
cordon to link up with deputies at the White House. With passions rising and
guns distributed, demonstrators attacked the mayor's office and raced to the
TV complex, storming inside in a hail of bullets.
Armed supporters of Mr Rutskoi, who was last night dismissed by Mr Yeltsin
from his post as vice-president and from the army, also tried to take over
two Russian news agencies but left without a struggle.
Although gunfire still crackled around the TV centre early today, an
official said: 'For the moment it is quiet.' He said troops arriving in
armoured vehicles were disarming the rebels. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
prime minister, said in a televised address that troops were being brought
into Moscow to restore order. 'Despite all the difficulties of the
situation, the government is in full control,' he said.
Two divisions of paratroopers loyal to Mr Yeltsin were due to enter Moscow
early today, First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Shumeiko said. He said one
division, normally at least 5,000 strong, was coming from the city of
Ryazan, about 110 miles south-east of Moscow.
Mr Strobe Talbott, the US ambassador at large with responsibility for the
former Soviet states, said he had been told by Mr Yeltsin's aides that
troops loyal to the president were taking up positions round parliament and
the TV centre and would retake both 'very shortly'.
Everything seemed to depend on the willingness of the incoming troops to
join battle. After reports that some commanders were wavering in their
loyalty earlier in the day, the Interfax news agency reported late last
night that the chief district commanders, meeting in the praesidium of the
Ministry of Defence, had agreed to back the president. General Pavel
Grachev, the defence minister, was said to be preparing an address to
servicemen - the sympathies of many of whom could be expected to be with the
White House defenders.
However, the determined resis-tance put up against the rebels by the few
troops at the TV centre halted what looked like a serious challenge to
central power.
In the statement read for him on TV, Mr Yeltsin said the attacks had been
'planned in advance' and had been deliberately aimed at destroying
negotiations over the weekend under the aegis of Alexei II, patriarch of the
Russian Orthodox church.
Mr Yeltsin said that 'from different corners of Russia came forces from
pro-communist organisations carrying out their black deeds beneath red
flags. . . Today, the fate of Russia and of our children is being decided.
The forces of civil war will not succeed'. Mr Yegor Gaidar, deputy prime
minister for economic reform, appealed to ordinary citizens to show their
support for democracy at this 'hardest hour'.
'Today we cannot dump responsibility for democracy and our freedom on police
and military forces alone . . . we appeal to you not to allow our country to
be turned into a giant concentration camp for decades to come'.
Mr Chernomyrdin has called Russia's regional leaders to Moscow this
afternoon. The Democratic Russia movement, which held a rally of between
1,000 and 2,000 supporters of the president in central Moscow in the early
evening, appealed for rallies to be held round the country in defence of Mr
Yeltsin.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Lonrho board faces big changes
</HEADLINE>

LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, will take a big step towards
becoming a more conventional public company this week by appointing its
first non-executive directors for two decades.
The company's directors received a proposal at the weekend for the
appointment as non-executives of Mr Peter Harper, a director of Hanson, the
Anglo-American conglomerate, and Mr Steven Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher,
the food processing and distribution group.
They have been recruited by Mr Dieter Bock, who at the beginning of the year
acquired an 18.8 per cent stake in Lonrho and was then appointed joint chief
executive with Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's guiding force for 30 years.
Mr Walls and Mr Harper - whose remuneration will be Pounds 30,000 a year -
are expected to set up Lonrho's first audit committee, to review its
financial performance.
Mr Rowland, who has been opposed to non-executives since 1973 when the
so-called 'straight eight' directors, led by Sir Basil Smallpeice, then
deputy chairman, tried unsuccessfully to remove him as chief executive. Mr
Rowland is not expected to try to block this week's appointments because Mr
Bock made it a condition of his investment in Lonrho that non-executives
should be appointed.
Mr Bock is expected soon to recruit one or two other non-executives. In the
long term, he is likely to seek to reduce the number of full-time executives
on the board from the present 12.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Clinton and Major back Yeltsin: Clinton gives full support
to Yeltsin

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday threw his weight behind Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and blamed the 'significant violence' in Moscow on the forces
of vice-president Alexander Rutskoi and parliamentary speaker Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov.
Speaking on the White House lawn, Mr Clinton said Mr Yeltsin had 'bent over
backwards to avoid the use of force.'
'We cannot afford to be in the position of wavering at this moment or
backing off or giving any encouragement to people who want to derail the
election process,' he said, adding that he did not expect President Yeltsin
'to be deposed' since the Russian people supported the president more than
the parliament.
The support was echoed, albeit more slowly, in the UK where prime minister
John Major said that President Yeltsin had his 'sympathies and support in
dealing with a difficult situation'.
He said: 'Those who mounted today's ugly attacks in Moscow have no respect
for civilised and democratic behaviour,' stressing that Mr Yeltsin had
received a democratic mandate.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, is expected to urge the other
European allies to follow US support for Mr Yeltsin at the meeting of the EC
foreign ministers in Luxembourg today.
As concern mounted yesterday about the security implications of the unrest.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, warned that the situation was
'extraordinarily serious' and said that if the army interfered in the
conflict there could be civil war.
Neighbouring Finland echoed the concern, noting that the crisis was 'very,
very alarming'.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, yesterday said he supported Mr
Yeltsin and condemned the use of violence.
Hesitation in the European response appeared to reflect both unease about
the prospect of bloodshed in Russia and concern in some diplomatic quarters
that Mr Clinton's faith in Mr Yeltsin's ability to regain control could
prove unfounded.
Most diplomats were still deeply fearful about the implications were
President Yeltsin to lose control, and insisted that Mr Yeltsin remained the
best vehicle for economic reforms.
