THE CROSSING PLACE: A JOURNEY AMONG THE ARMENIANS by Philip Marsden
HarperCollins Pounds 16.99, 250 pages
A young writer walking in eastern Anatolia stumbled on a piece of bone
which, so a nonchalant shepherd told him, was human.
Thus began Philip Marsden's voyage round the Armenian diaspora. When he
reached the desert town of Ras ul-Ain in northern Syria, however, the place
where thousands of Armenians were corralled and massacred in 1915-6, he
found nothing, felt nothing. 'I had thought that seeing the places might
make it easier to understand. It hadn't; it had made it harder.'
Here is an observant writer armed with a rich theme: the long aftermath of
the Turkish genocide whose details were for years suppressed by perpetrators
and victims alike. Marsden writes vividly, sometimes sublimely (there is a
river whose 'bulbous eddies twist and spin', an old cobbler whose fingers
are 'long and arthritic and bent sideways like the bristles of an old
brush.')
If he does not in the end succeed in illuminating either the story or the
character of the Armenians, that, I suggest, is because his method stands in
the way of his purpose.
For it is a hectic, insistently first-person narrative. There are numberless
encounters and endless details of a six-month journey through 20 contiguous
countries which leave the reader tired and out of breath. One longs for the
author to sit still and reflect; for then his eyes are sharpest, his objects
clearest and his writing at its least self-conscious. Marsden is a writer
who could be in the Leigh Fermor mould were he to play to his literary
rather than reportorial strengths.
As things are, every character and incident gets equal treatment and a
breakneck story peters out inconclusively with sporadic gunfire at night on
a hillside above the Armenian-Iranian border. The result is a travel book,
or a book about a research trip, but never quite what one had hoped for: a
portrait of an extraordinary race.
On the boat to Cyprus early in his journey, Marsden met a Jewish
antique-dealer who asked him what he was doing. 'I'm on my way to Armenia'.
'Armenia? What are you going to find there?' 'I have no idea'.
Unfortunately, Marsden spoke more truly than he knew.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Books: Fantasist of great rigour

THE ROAD TO SAN GIOVANNI by Italo Calvino, translated by Tim Parks Jonathan
Cape Pounds 12.99, 150 pages
If in adult life you are going to become a writer, San Remo on the Italian
Riviera seems to be as good a place to be brought up in as any other. This
posthumous book reveals how well it served Italo Calvino (1923-1985) as a
playground for childhood and adolescence. It makes one ask whether San
Remo's role as a holiday resort, as a fun place, accounts for some of the
fantastic invention, the ludic element taken to extremes, that is so
ubiquitous a feature of Calvino's fiction.
Up to now San Remo has been little more than an entry in Calvino's
curriculum vitae, along with the fact that he was actually born in Cuba of
Italian parents, both of whom were scientists, while always regarding San
Remo as his 'real' birthplace. His experience during the second world war as
a partisan in the Italian Resistance in the surrounding countryside is
reflected in his early work. After the war when Calvino was still in his
early twenties he graduated at the University of Turin with a thesis on
Conrad and then began a career in publishing combined with writing.
Calvino's creative talent was recognised by Cesare Pavese who promoted his
work, and with the publication of tales like Il visconte dimezzato (The
Cloven Viscount) in 1952, Calvino's reputation as someone who could sustain
a far-fetched fantasy with the logical rigour of a mathematician was secure.
Comparisons with Lewis Carroll as well as Borges abounded. Throughout the
1960s and 1970s, thanks to sensitive translators like Archibald Coloquhon
and William Weaver, Calvino's work acquired a considerable following in the
UK and the US.
In trying to explain the nature of his fiction to English-speaking readers,
Calvino once made the interesting linguistic point that: 'There are two
different words in English, novel and romance, for what in Italian is always
called a romanzo'. It is romance given the surface gloss of realism that is
his favourite form. The writer in our tradition to whom Calvino felt
especially close was RL Stevenson. The 'Cloven Viscount' is a medieval
version of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
But now with the publication of these short pieces composed at various times
as The Road to San Giovanni, we have a direct attempt on his part to
reconstruct the world of his childhood in the manner of Proust. If as a
novelist Calvino occupies a frontier between fantasy and reality, he reveals
in the title-piece that the family house where he was raised also looked two
ways. It 'was situated, in an area once known as 'French Point', on the last
slopes at the foot of San Pietro Hill, as though at the border between two
continents'.
Below was the town with the seafront and harbour offering escapism; above
were the hills and the land cultivated by his father, a botanist and a
farmer. When the hobnail-booted Calvino senior ascended the rugged path to
his fields he had the air of a man entering his kingdom. The boy Italo would
toil along after him, already conscious that his domain lay not among the
mountain flora whose names he could never remember, but down below, oriented
on such landmarks as the cupola of the Prince Amadeus Municipal Theatre.
The immemorial estrangement between father and son is seen in this essay
through landscape and townscape. It is complemented by the next one - 'A
Cinema-Goer's Autobiography' - where the writer describes how he did manage
through constant truancy to inhabit his own chosen space peopled by the
stars of pre-war Hollywood. This was before the days of Technicolor and the
monochrome effect enhanced the magic.
It all came to a stop in 1938 when Mussolini banned American films. But by
then the cinema had fulfilled its function of confirming him in his
commitment to the imagination as a way of life. He was to return to the
cinema as an adult during its post-war renaissance in Italy, and he honours
his debt to Fellini as a source of inspiration.
Before that there was the war and Calvino dredges up some painful 'Memories
of A Battle' when in retreating from a village in the Maritime-Pre-Alps one
of his comrades was killed. Then in 'La Poubelle Agreee' the scene switches
to post-war Paris where Calvino now a successful man of letters is living
with his wife. His contribution to the domestic equilibrium is to empty the
rubbish every day into la poubelle agreee: it is left untranslated because
it defies an accurate rendering - 'the pleasing or approved rubbish-bin' -
the point being that no rubbish will be collected unless it is deposited in
such a poubelle.
The regulation sets in train a meditation on western civilisation in which
garbage disposal (including the junking of early drafts of literary work) is
seen as its essential ritual. Finally 'From the Opaque' carries this
Calvinoesque exploiting of a master-metaphor into the realm of the cosmos
where shadow and sunlight are presented as over-riding all other conditions
of being. The translation of this poetic piece must have presented Tim Parks
with his greatest problems; but the whole book reads most elegantly; it
represents a series of charming footnotes to the work of a major modern
writer.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Sailing in the wake of Ernest Shackleton: Roderick Dunnett
reports on a voyage to retrace one of the most heroic sea journeys of the
century
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK DUNNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Roaring Forties and the Storming Fifties. Not exactly paradise for the
sailor of a small boat. The seas around 55 degrees south, off Cape Horn, are
some of the worst in the world. The swell rolls west to east almost
unchecked. It is hurricane-torn, even in summer.
This month, four British yachtsmen plan to retrace one of the most arduous
survival stories in maritime history: the voyage of Sir Ernest Shackleton
and five others from the northernmost point of Antarctica across perilous
seas to South Georgia, to fetch help for 22 colleagues marooned on barren
Elephant Island - an attempt that succeeded and all survived.
The re-created voyage, in a specially designed 23ft replica boat named the
Sir Ernest Shackleton, will benefit from the long days of the Antarctic
summer. But it will not be plain sailing.
'If we miss the island,' says the group's leader, Trevor Potts, a
43-year-old water sports development officer from Tyneside, 'there's no
turning back: it's South Africa here we come]'
But why should anyone want to retrace Shackleton's boat journey at all?
'It's been at the back of my mind for years,' Potts explains. 'After all, it
was one of the greatest survival stories ever. To bring anyone back alive,
let alone the entire party, against all the odds, was an amazing feat.
Shackleton was an unusual leader.
'He undoubtedly made mistakes; yet he was the brains, behind not just both
expeditions (six years earlier, Shackleton and three others came within 97
miles of the Pole), but the rescue as well.'
Shackleton's ship, Endurance, sailed south in August 1914, just as war broke
out. His plan involved a crossing of the continent, from the Weddell Sea to
the Ross Sea via the South Pole. But in January 1915, Endurance became
trapped in the pack ice. She was borne 1,000 miles northwards before
sinking, crushed by enormous pressures. For four months the party camped on
floes, then fled in lifeboats as the ice broke under them.
That they reached Elephant Island, in appalling conditions, was a miracle.
The James Caird, largest of the three lifeboats, in which Shackleton made
his dash for help, was 23ft long and 6ft in the beam. On the ice two strakes
had been added, giving her a freeboard of 2ft 2in. Before the journey she
was decked with packing case lids and covered with canvas, stretched over
sledge runners. A spare mast had been bolted to the keel to stiffen her.
Rocks and bags of gravel and rocks served as ballast.
The group's only reachable source of help, South Georgia, was a mere speck
in the ocean, 800 miles distant. Had it not been for a superb navigator,
Frank Worsley, the Endurance's New Zealand-born skipper, James Caird might
never have reached her destination.
What followed was an epic battle - against continuous, freezing gales and
mountainous seas, drenched clothes, salt water sores, ice and frostbite -
plus on day nine, at midnight: 'The huge crest of an enormous 90ft wave, the
most gigantic I had ever seen,' wrote Shackleton. 'It was a mighty upheaval
of the ocean: we baled non-stop, like men fighting for dear life.' Their
sleeping bags shredded; salt leaked into their fresh water. Worsley had few
glimpses of the sun to check their position; his navigational tables were
soaked and almost illegible.
What saved them in the end was a mixture of luck, tenacity and hot food:
concentrated 'hoosh', and scalding milk at four-hour intervals, boiled on a
rickety primus.
When they sighted South Georgia 15 days later, they were faced by an
iron-bound coast - a lee shore in a hurricane. They were nearly dashed to
pieces. Disaster threatened when they almost lost their mast. It was 36
hours before they made a safe landing, tacking precariously into a cove in
King Haakon Sound. A 500-ton steamer from Buenos Aires, they later learned,
was lost that night with all hands.
Potts is no stranger to adventure. His log of a single-handed voyage to
Falmouth from the Azores, when his 25ft boat was almost overwhelmed, won the
Dugon Prize in 1986. Soon after, he and another party member, Robert
Egelstaff, made a journey by kayak, in near-zero temperatures, across the
Bering Strait from Alaska.
On that trip, the party got separated by fog, missed an island and ended up
being arrested by Russian coastguards. When we met in Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
in Tyne and Wear, he had problems locating a nearby pub and mislaid the only
female member of the party - Victoria Brown, a qualified yachtmaster and
navigation specialist. 'Don't worry,' Potts reassured me. 'Vicky will be
navigating, not me.' The Sir Ernest Shackleton has been built to his designs
by McNulty's, the South Shields shipbuilder, where he was a workshop
manager.
Is it really a replica? 'We kept her dimensions as near as we could to the
James Caird,' says Potts. She has a similar sailing ability. But we've made
her stronger and more watertight. We've added four bulkheads. Our hull,
strip-planked, is glass fibre- and epoxy-sheathed, and laid on laminated
frames; and has been strengthened with steel so she won't buckle. Our
cockpit is smaller but, like the James Caird, she's not high enough in the
water to self-drain. So we expect to do a fair bit of pumping and baling.'
The new boat is ballasted not just with lead, but with water beneath the
cabin bunks. Perhaps most important, she has a tiller. With his 'accursed
mizzen' - as Worsley termed it - forming an obstruction, Shackleton was
forced to steer with yoke and lines.
There is no room for a life-raft, but an Inmarsat satellite transceiver,
backed up by VHF and GPS (global positioning system), should keep Potts's
team on course and in touch. 'Still, we plan to navigate by traditional
means part of the time,' explains Vicky Brown, 'to get some idea of the
problems Worsley faced.' If their GPS breaks down (as it might), they will
have no choice.
Their main advantages over Shackleton will be temperature and daylight. 'But
winter conditions are actually more settled,' Trevor Potts points out. 'In
the Antarctic summer there's a good chance of strong crosswinds and high
swells - a north-easterly right up our nose. If we get a hurricane, things
could definitely be as bad. But Shackleton had huge problems with ice; we
don't anticipate that.'
No photographic record exists of the boat journey or the other epic that
followed, and which the group also plans to retrace: a treacherous climb by
Shackleton, Worsley and Irishman Tom Crean over the glaciers, snowbound
ridges and bleak mountains of the uncharted interior of South Georgia to
reach the Norwegian whaling stations on the other side.
The skills of the fourth expedition member, Chris Smith, a mountainering
expert from North Wales, could well be needed.
With a scrap of German chart and a pair of compasses, Shackleton's trio
covered 40 miles (22 as the crow flies) in 36 hours, scarcely pausing to
rest. Trapped on a ridge, they glissaded 1,000ft into the unknown, hunched
together on a coiled rope, and landed in snow, descending next day via a
waterfall to Stromness. Their luck never waned. The moonlit conditions were
the best in weeks. Next day, the blizzards closed in.
Will Potts and his companions manage? 'My experience is that when the going
gets hard you become stronger, not weaker,' says the leader, who suffers
from rheumatism and arthritis (Shackleton himself went through agonies due
to because of sciatica). 'None of us is a giver-up,' puts in Vicky Brown.
'Shackleton hated it when things eased off,' Potts adds.
The James Caird (named after Shackleton's main sponsor, a Scottish
industrialist) survived both the journey home and a second world war flying
bomb. Restored by the National Maritime Museum, it is displayed at Dulwich
College, to which it was presented after the explorer's death on his last
Antarctic expedition - a planned circumnavigation - in 1922.
The building of the Sir Ernest Shackleton has been sponsored by the Gryphon
group of companies: Aran Energy, Clyde Petroleum, Kerr McGee and Santa Fe,
with additional help towards equipment and clothing. Further sponsorship is
welcome.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Wall-to-wall challenges: Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As I puffed and panted my way down the lower section of Gentianes, one of
Verbier's longest and least relenting runs, I was aware of another skier
having a similar battle not far away. We both paused, using our chance
encounter as an excuse for a breather.
'Wow]' he said. An American. 'Quite a run]' 'Certainly is,' I said. 'How
does this compare with the Rockies?' I asked, knowing perfectly well that
America had nothing to touch Verbier for long, tough, uncompromising skiing.
'Never skied there,' he said. 'I'm from Alabama.' No wonder he was tired.
The only ski resort in Alabama is Cloudmont (50 miles from Chattanooga)
where the vertical drop is just 150 feet. Gentianes alone has a vertical
drop more than 20 times as much.
There is a large amount of challenging skiing in the Swiss resort of
Verbier. In other places you might screw up the courage to ski the difficult
runs, and then once you have done so a couple of times you can relax knowing
that you have done your brave deed for the day. But Verbier has wall-to-wall
challenges.
Mont Gele and even Mont Fort are occasionally closed because of blizzards
and avalanche danger. In 1950, when Verbier's first proper chairlift to the
Croix-des-Ruinettes was erected, the installations were delayed by bad
weather in spite of Verbier's reputation as a sun trap. (The first lift -
the 1946 'Funiluge' - was a giant sledge powered by a combustion engine
accommodating 12 skiers.)
British skier Konrad Bartelski had told me that the back of Mont Fort was
spectacular but not a good place to fall. I had always been petrified that
one day I would find it open and have to ski it. This year that moment
arrived.
There are no two ways about it, I was frightened: as much for the skiers
perched perilously above me in the severe opening couloirs, as for my own
skin. However the elation at getting down safely was unforgettable. After
skiing the back of Mont Fort, the front - steep as it may look - will never
seem as threatening.
Mont Gele in good, fresh snow is also spectacular - with the opportunity of
plenty of good turns in powder before you need to put the brakes on - but
nowhere near so intimidating as the back of Mont Fort unless you attempt the
steeper side which is fraught with danger.
Verbier, of course, is not just for strong skiers, although they probably
get more out of it than beginners and intermediates, who also have to cope
with busier pistes and longer queues caused by Verbier's somewhat inadequate
lift system. One of the advantages of skiing the back of Mont Fort is that
it takes half a day and does not attract crowds. Even more conventional runs
like Gentiane - too tough for inexperienced skiers - will keep most skiers
busy for long spells in between lifts.
Trying to evaluate Verbier is an exasperating affair. In many ways it has
some of the most exhilarating skiing in the world. But a modern French lift
system of multi-person gondolas replacing its more antiquated, ponderous
cable-cars would take away some of the angst involved in trying to reach the
slopes more quickly.
This day-time undercurrent of frustration dissolves by night into irritation
with the resort's Hooray Henries. Rather like Verbier's lift system they are
irritating rather than infuriating. Surely the original Hoorays must have
grown up by now - or have they? Anyway, fresh supplies seem to arrive each
year.
Even the Farm Club, considered an upmarket nightspot, suffered during my
visit. After two chalet girls danced topless, five young Englishmen took to
the dance floor and stripped off their clothes. No-one seemed to object, but
it was not my idea of a fun night out.
The following evening, on our chalet girl's night off, we and our Flexiski
host Neal Manuel enjoyed a much more entertaining - and cheaper (Manuel paid
) - evening in a local bistro. Like quite a few small tour operators, Manuel
started out working for someone else. He was a ski guide with Don Kremer's
Snowtime operation, based in Meribel.
Flexiski (049084-446) operates in just two resorts: Courchevel and Verbier.
It offers a chalet in each resort, chalet apartments in Courchevel's central
Forum complex and the rest of its accommodation is in three- and four-star
hotels: four in Courchevel, including the four-star Annapurna, Bellecote and
Hotel des Trois Vallees, and one in Verbier, the Hotel Vanessa.

FT  18 DEC 93 / As They Say in Europe: The Liberal Democrat menace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some years ago, when I was in the Basque country, I got talking to a woman
whose father had played a large part in the Spanish civil war. He was, of
course, on the Republican side which lost. I asked the woman what party her
father had belonged to. 'He was a Liberal Democrat,' she said.
'What on earth did that mean?' I asked.
'It meant,' she replied, 'that he shot everybody who wasn't'
That seemed to me at the time to be an idiosyncrasy of traditional Spanish
politics. But historic Spain and Russia have curious parallels. The two
possess the only folk dancers worth a damn, and the best folk music. And in
neither is there a tradition of seeing the other chap's point of view.
So, today, we see those old Liberal Democrats resurrected, at the other end
of Europe and the other end of the political spectrum. Vladimir
Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats seem prepared to embark on the same course
as that of his Basque predecessor.
In the west, the rise of this unsavoury grouping was greeted with alarm. In
Russia, things are different. As I have noted before, the papers there seem
to be able to take most developments in their stride. Irony provided one
approach: 'Everything possible has been done for Zhirinovsky to achieve a
success. All conceivable errors have been made.'
It was rare in the west to read of Russia's democratic leaders being at
fault, but in Moscow there was little else. Pravda was grimly jubilant,
saying that the leader of the Liberal Democrats had reached 'a height
unattainable for many of his rivals, above all because the executive branch
of state power and its propaganda services were busy inspiring Russophobia
intensively, importunately and consciously.'
In what I might have called the liberal-democratic press, but cannot any
longer for fear of misunderstanding, there was a more sympathetic account of
what I might have called Russia's choice but cannot for fear of etc etc. It
was noted that the Russian people had a 'predilection for confident leaders
who promised a rapid change to be brought about without great difficulties.
This time it is the turn of Vladimir Zhirinovsky . . .' The next day, in a
nice touch, the same writer argued: 'The electorate got sick and tired of
traditional promises by both communists and democrats.' These traditions go
all the way back to 1990.
Here we must confront an odd fact: Russia has shown itself capable of
following in the footsteps of west Europeans. Last Sunday's vote provided a
sort of re-run, in an extreme form, of what happened in Italy and, to a
lesser extent, Brandenburg the week before. Ruling centre parties cannot win
anywhere these days. But Russia possesses newspapers which can be described
as expressing the views of far right communists, and their leading light is
Sovetskaya Rossiya which clings to its anachronistic appellation for
ideological reasons.
It noted that one Communist party leader had expressed confidence that his
group would achieve 'considerable mutual understanding with an absolute
majority of blocs to which peace in the country and well-being in every home
are the supreme value.' (That was a blow at President Yeltsin who, in
certain circles, has not been seen as an apostle of peace since his forces
shelled the Moscow parliament building.)
The next day, Pravda announced 'the collapse of the democratic myth and the
renunciation of the western Utopia'. The communists prefer the nationalists,
or fascists, to the democrats. And many shared the view that the Liberal
Democrats now had a right to have their opinions respected and should be
reckoned with in the formation of a new cabinet.
It all looks curiously like Germany in 1932. Then, the economy was in a
total mess. There had been great inflation. Recommended western models were
not working. The middle ground was squeezed and the communists did
everything possible to ensure Hitler took over in 1933. There is always one
comfort: historical parallels always turn out to be wrong.
Yet, it is a curious fact that, 60 years ago, the name National Socialists
had a rather reassuring ring (better than International Socialists). The
original party of that name had been a moderate Czech grouping in the last
days of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Will all Liberal Democrats now be
imbued with an air of menace? From Tokyo to their British stronghold in
Yeovil, there must be many who are wondering if Russia has dealt them an
unfortunate card.
Russia's Liberal Democrats do seem, however, to have learnt one lesson from
western practitioners. The one-time populist governor of Louisiana, Huey
Long, said it would be easy to start a fascist party in the United States.
'You would just have to call it an anti-fascist party,' he said.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Property: Treat yourself to a festive forest - Gerald
Cadogan suggests that acquiring woodland makes sense as an investment this
Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why buy a Christmas tree when you can buy a forest? As a bulk purchase, they
are cheaper. They can give pleasure and profit for generations to come. They
are free of income and capital gains tax and qualify for 100 per cent
business property relief from inheritance tax. And, if they are conifers,
you have Christmas trees in perpetuity.
A voucher for a forest is a gift with a difference. It means a minimum
investment of Pounds 50,000 in Britain, says management firm Fountain
Forestry, or Dollars 250,000 to invest in hardwoods in the United States.
Around Dollars 95m will buy a whole 400,000-acre (160,000-hectare) forest in
the US from agent John Clegg.
Thanks to the influence of the Gulf Stream, Britain's climate is ideal for
growing trees, especially such softwood varieties as pines. Native deciduous
(or broadleaf) hardwoods take at least twice as long to mature but look
better and belong in the British countryside - besides which, they attract
higher goverment grants.
These are paid under the woodland grant scheme. Planting grants for conifers
range from Pounds 615 a hectare (one hectare equals 2.47 acres) for more
than 10 hectares, to Pounds 1,005 for less than one hectare. For
broadleaves, the grants range from Pounds 975 to Pounds 1,575, paid 70 per
cent on planting, 20 per cent after five years and 10 per cent after 10
years.
Then, the woodland management grant takes over for conifers 11-20 years old
(Pounds 10-Pounds 15 a hectare per year), and broadleaves 11-40 years old
(Pounds 25-Pounds 35). For woods of special environmental value, annual
management grants offer Pounds 35-Pounds 45. An alternative scheme pays for
natural regeneration.
Two extras are the better land supplement (Pounds 400 or Pounds 600 on
planting) for using arable land or improved grassland, and the community
woodlands supplement of a flat Pounds 950 for woods close to towns or cities
that are open to the public for recreation. These two grants can apply also
to the farm woodland premium scheme. This has similar planting grants but
its annual payments (Pounds 60-Pounds 250 a hectare) are for using farmland.
If more than half the trees are broadleaves, the payments run for 15 years;
if less than half, for 10 years. That explains the many newly-planted
(usually hardwood) spinneys in the corners of fields which give cover for
game to shoot and for other wildlife, make the farm look 'natural' and will,
eventually, produce timber.
The years are over of planting swathes of sitka spruce in straight lines
over the hills of Scotland with no regard to the contours - 'carpets of
Scandinavian gloom,' as they were called by the late Hugh Fraser MP.
Certainly, a British timber supply was a top priority after both world wars
(indeed, the Forestry Comission was founded in 1919). That is why it had
such remarkable reliefs against tax, and still offers good pickings. But
official wartime attitudes - aimed at planting lots of trees, quickly,
without much regard to sensitivity - continued afterwards. Only now, spurred
by environmental groups, do foresters have to mix the types and ages of
trees and follow natural boundaries.
The return on timber depends on the likely future price. While that is hard
to assess, there are long-term bullish factors. Fountain Forestry says UK
prices follow the changes in gross domestic product and that the present
forestry yield, in real terms, beats real interest rates. Timber prices are
on the up.
Then include the tax exemptions, which make it attractive to buy woods
planted after the war that are now ready for felling in order to harvest a
tax-free income; or to plant broadleaves for future generations of family to
look after, while enjoying the IHT relief.
To qualify, the woods must be 'in hand,' which includes managed woods but
not let woods (which have 50 per cent relief). Future markets are certain,
provided the felled trees can be moved easily to the processing plant
(grants for forest roads are one proposal before the government's Forestry
Review Group, due to report early next year). Or, the plant should be
brought to them. Huge investment in UK plants by Scandinavian and north
European companies is a high mark of confidence. Since 1988, however, when
the government ended a system whereby the wealthy could save tax by buying
woodland and setting forestry expenses against all other income, new
plantings and grants for them have been less than hoped.
The target was 33,000 hectares a year, but it was 29,500 in 1988/89 and has
fallen steadily - doubtless affected by the recession - to 17,300 hectares
in the year ended March 31 1992, the last available figure.
Another reason for this could be that the present system of farm grants
under the EU's common agricultural policy makes a lot of land seem too
valuable for mere trees. Take away farm grants and it would be a different
story. A further reason - and a major grumble in forestry - is that you
cannot plant trees in set-aside land - that which is taken out of use by
farmers in return for payments from the EU.
To new investors, broadleaves look best. But to ensure they reach perfection
in 150 years needs planning down the family line, plus faith. And Pounds
50,000 buys few of them, with a price for 20-year-old semi-mature trees of
Pounds 900-Pounds 1,000 (Dollars 1,350-Dollars 1,500) an acre.
In the US, however, hardwoods cost about Dollars 250-Dollars 300 an acre,
and they abound in the north-eastern states. Black cherry, especially,
flourishes in these forests - an excellent wood for furniture which gets
good prices, especially if it is veneer quality (the best).
Hardwood prices In the US have risen 50 per cent recently and, with the
difficulties of managing broadleaves of such quality or quantity in Europe,
Fountain advises European investors to go west. It manages forests for them
from its office near Concord, New Hampshire, and also runs a hardwood forest
in eastern Kentucky. But it will find you a forest in Britain, too.
Clegg has several UK forests for sale, mostly in Scotland. Since its recent
British sales have tended to go for above the guide price, be bold and pop
some woodland under the Christmas tree now.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Motoring: Diesels hit the heights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The year of the diesel car breakthrough: that is how 1993 will go down in
the annals of British motoring. Sales rose so fast - to their present 26 per
cent of registrations - that industry forecasts at the beginning of the year
were overtaken by events.
A year ago, it was agreed generally that 200,000 diesel cars would be sold
in Britain in 1993. I had a gut feeling this was a considerable
under-estimate; 250,000 would, I thought, be nearer the mark. Even this was
not optimistic enough. An educated guess puts year-end UK sales of diesels
at more than 300,000 in a total market expected to be just under 1.8m.
Two years ago, when only one new British-registered car in 10 was a diesel,
anyone suggesting that kind of figure for 1993 would have been told he was
hallucinating. Now, it is hardly fanciful to suggest that next year's total
could be nearer to 400,000, with one new car in three (against this year's
fewer than one in four) having a diesel engine.
There is no simple explanation for why it has happened. It is not as though
diesel fuel suddenly has become a lot cheaper than unleaded petrol, as it is
in France where close to half the new cars sold are diesels. Probably, it is
down to a combination of factors.
The economic and environmental benefits of diesel cars are now appreciated
widely. They have become as pleasant as their petrol equivalents to drive,
while the price differential between a diesel car and a petrol car with fuel
injection and catalytic converter has narrowed, even disappeared.
The cost of filling a car's tank has increased, and will continue to go up
faster than the rate of inflation for the foreseeable future. So, for
company car fleet managers, if not yet for all who drive them, fuel
consumption has become a matter of practical rather than academic
importance.
For years, the French PSA Group (Peugeot-Citroen) has made most of the
running with diesel cars in Britain. Now, although its products are as good
as ever, they no longer enjoy a monopoly of excellence.
Ford has pulled itself up by the bootstraps. Its Escort and Mondeo
turbo-diesels have gained so much power and refinement that they can now
hold up their heads in the company of, say, the VW Golf, Citroen Xantia and
Peugeot 405. The latest Granada/Scorpio turbo-diesel, with an Italian VM
2.5-litre engine and very tall gearing (90 mph/145 kmh at only 3,000 rpm),
wafts along motorways with the silence of the chairman's limousine.
Vauxhall, using turbo-charged engines made by Isuzu, General Motors'
Japanese associate, first doubled and then trebled its diesel sales this
year. So, too, did VW-Audi, which is now offering the super-economical
direct injection diesel, once exclusive to Audi, in the latest VW Passat
models.
No car has made a better impression on me this year than the BMW 325tds SE I
have been driving lately. The turbo-charged and inter-cooled six-cylinder
diesel combines muscle with finesse. Push it hard and it goes (indeed, even
sounds) like a sporty BMW - but it pulls fifth gear silkily at less than 30
mph/50 kph and will yield 40 mpg (7 litres/100km) on a journey.
Among other competent and pleasurably driveable European-made diesels and
turbo-diesels are Fiat's Tipo, the Renault 19, Seat's new Ibiza
(exceptionally keen value), the urbane Mercedes-Benz C-Class and E-Class,
and Rover's Montego turbo-diesel estate - which must be one of the most
under-rated cars around.
The Peugeot-engined Rover Metro, 200 and 400 diesels are well-built and
finished with care. But it is a pity that Rover has not yet produced a
turbo-charged and inter-cooled 600 diesel for the company fleet managers who
are abandoning petrol engines to cut costs.
Land Rover has shown that the inherently rather noisy (but exceptionally
frugal) direct-injection Rover diesel engine can be quietened significantly.
The latest Land Rover Discovery automatic, with a 2.5-litre version of this
engine, is a class leader for refinement, driving ease and modest fuel
consumption.
One large gap in the diesel car market remains. Where are the automatics?
Diesel engines and automatic transmission are a natural fit, but the
majority of makers are reluctant to offer two-pedal models. They think the
greater cost of automatic transmission, plus the slight loss of performance
and economy, would deter most buyers.
Citroen - a welcome exception - has two-pedal, non-turbo ZX diesels at
Pounds 735 more than their manual gearbox equivalents. The XM turbo-diesels
have automatic transmission as standard, but a two-pedal Xantia diesel is
still a little way off.
Automatics are available either as standard or at extra cost on all
Mercedes-Benz diesels as well as the Audi 80 and 100 TDIs, BMW 3-Series and
5-Series, and Volvo 940. Other makers really should follow. An automatic
Ford Granada/Scorpio or Rover 800 turbo-diesel must appeal to managers
turning to diesel for their company fleets and looking for something
suitable to offer executives.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Sport: The rise of a young champion - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is time once again to produce the annual FT World Rankings, necessary
because the men's and women's computer rankings are unfairly weighted. The
ATP Tour system counts only a player's best 14 results (bad losses can be
ignored) and does not offer the four Grand Slam Championships their full
value. The WTA system protects the higher ranked players who do not drop
quickly enough after poor performances.
No-one would question that the 22-year-old American Pete Sampras and
Germany's Steffi Graf, now 24, have been the outstanding players of the
year. These two fine athletes head my lists in which there are five men who
were not in last year's list and two newcomers among the women.
With two of the four Grand Slam titles (Wimbledon, US Open) among his eight
tournament victories, Sampras has enjoyed the best season of his young life.
He has won 85 of the 101 matches he has played and pocketed Dollars 4.58m to
lift his career earnings to Dollars 11.5m. It now seems likely that Sampras
will fulfil the potential he had shown in 1991 when, at 19, he became the
youngest US Open winner. Only in this year's two climactic events - the
IBM/ATP Tour finals in Frankfurt and the Compaq Grand Slam Cup in Munich -
has Sampras looked vulnerable. First, Michael Stich, with brilliant serving,
and then Petr Korda, with superb returning of the serve, halted his advance.
In the absence since April of the reigning world champion Monica Seles,
following the knife attack by Gunter Parche in Hamburg, Graf has dominated
the women's year with 10 tournament wins. The only real challenge to her
supremacy on the important occasions came from Jana Novotna who should have
won their Wimbledon final after leading by a set and 4-1. However, she did
not, and Graf added a fifth Wimbledon title to the third French crown she
had just acquired and then went on the win the US Open for the third time.
For good measure Steffi also claimed the Virginia Slims Championship, her
79th career title, to end the year with 76 wins and six losses, all of which
earned her prize money of Dollars 2.8m, a record for women.
The men's year was notable for the return to form of the 1991 Wimbledon
champion Stich who re-enters the list after a year's gap. Stich finished the
season strongly winning the ATP Tour championship, leading Germany to
victory in the Davis Cup and reaching the final of the Grand Slam Cup.
But Stich does not displace Jim Courier from the No 2 spot (which he did on
the ATP computer) because of his failures on the four most important
occasions of the year. In Melbourne he lost to Courier, who went on to win
the title; in Paris he lost badly to Goran Prpic in the fourth round while
Courier lost narrowly in the final; at Wimbledon, where Courier was also a
finalist, Stich lost a dramatic quarter-final against Becker; in New York,
Stich was beaten in the first round by Henrik Holm while Courier lost in the
fourth round to Cedric Pioline, his only bad loss. It was chiefly that
performance which earned the stylish Frenchman ninth place in my list.
Pioline had a marvellously consistent year with three other appearances in
finals.
Sergi Bruguera's feat in winning his first major title in Paris, was
considerable. The Spaniard also reached eight other finals, winning four of
them.
After a mediocre year by his standards, Stefan Edberg drops to No 5. His
best performances were to reach the final of the Australian Open and the
Wimbledon semi-final where Courier beat him both times. Only one tournament
fell to this great attacking player in 1993: ironically, the clay court
event in Madrid.
Andrei Medvedev, only just 19, made a great impact with three wins from five
finals plus an appearance in the French Open semi-final. Michael Chang, with
five tournament wins, had his best year since winning the French Open as a
17-year-old in 1989. Goran Ivanisevic could not reach a Grand Slam final as
he had done at Wimbledon in 1992 and slips four places while the Austrian,
Thomas Muster, comes in as the winner of six titles - all on clay.
At first sight it may seem curious to have ranked Seles at all. However, the
world champion did win the year's first great title in Australia with a fine
win over Graf. It was one of the season's best matches. Furthermore, she did
win another tournament before being forced out of the game with an extended
bout of 'flu. Hamburg was her comeback event. I have no doubt about the
quality of her tennis at the time of the attack and her achievements must be
recognised.
No-one else in the women's game achieved anything notable. True,
Sanchez-Vicario, in winning four tournaments, did play more matches than
anyone else (91), and she won more too (77) but she did lose 14 times. Her
fellow Spaniard, Martinez, won five tournaments and did well to reach her
first Wimbledon semi-final. Although Mary Joe Fernandez was equally
impressive in winning the year's most exciting encounter, a comeback against
Sabatini in Paris, she was disappointing elsewhere with only one tournament
to her name.
It is a pleasure to see Anke Huber at last emerging from Graf's shadow and
sad to say farewell to Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere who retires officially
after next month's Australian Open. The eldest of the three Bulgarian
sisters, Manuela went out on a high note with a victory over Navratilova in
the final of the European Indoor Championships in October, her 18th career
title.

FT  18 DEC 93 / The Nature of Things: Forecasters find cash in chaos theory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Meteorologists suffer more than other scientists from people's selective
memories. We remember their past sins - above all, in the UK, the failure to
predict the October 1987 hurricane - while failing to notice how much more
accurate their routine forecasts are becoming. A forecast five days ahead
today is likely to be as accurate as a two-day forecast 20 years ago.
But chaos theory, the new science of order and disorder, places a
fundamental limit on meteorologists' ability to issue accurate forecasts for
a particular time and place indefinitely into the future. The dynamics of
the atmosphere are so sensitive to small changes in the starting conditions
that even a forecaster with an infinitely powerful computer could not
predict the details of the weather a month ahead. The famous - if
far-fetched - example is that the fluttering of a butterfly's wings over the
Amazon could determine whether a storm develops over New York several weeks
later.
As meteorologists began to understand the implications of chaos during the
1980s, their initial dismay was replaced by determination to take advantage
of the theory's mathematical insights. Quietly they are developing a
powerful technique called ensemble forecasting, which is based on chaos
theory.
The UK Met Office is leading the way. Its researchers routinely use the
ensemble method for 30-day forecasts. These are much more accurate than they
used to be when long-range forecasters relied on statistics and climatology,
finding similarities between the current weather pattern and past years -
and hoping it would develop in broadly the same way over the next month as
it did then.
The Met Office ensemble forecaster runs the supercomputer model of the
global atmosphere nine times, deliberately varying the starting conditions
on each occasion. From the distribution of different outcomes, he or she can
estimate the likelihood of various weather patterns over the coming month.
If all nine runs give the same pattern - say, dry settled weather - the
forecaster is more confident than if six predict a long settled spell and
three end up with wind and rain.
In practice, the Met Office then combines the ensemble result with more
traditional statistical analysis to produce its final forecast. This does
not predict detailed weather on any particular day but gives likely trends
of temperature, rain / snowfall and sunshine over the month.
Using a technical measure of forecasting 'skill' on which zero means no
better than chance, temperature predictions have improved from 10 per cent
to 25 per cent since the 1970s. That means today's 30-day forecasts are
about half as accurate as those for the next five days.
Sadly, only big businesses are benefiting from this work. The Met Office
stopped publishing its monthly weather prospects in the 1970s because they
were then only a slightly better guide than tossing a coin. And it has no
plans to resume publication now that they have improved. Instead it sells
the forecasts on a confidential basis to large corporate clients in
industries such as energy, water and retailing, for whom the commercial
benefits far exceed the Pounds 5,000 a year subscription fee.
The official Met Office line, expressed by Julian Hunt, the chief executive,
is: 'The results are not yet reliable enough to issue to the public, who are
not really interested in a forecast that is reasonably correct only about
seven times out of 10.'
Even if the Met Office is right to take such a condescending view of the
public's meteorological sophistication, what about small businesses and
farmers for whom Pounds 5,000 is a prohibitive fee? Why, for instance,
should independent shops not be able to adjust their ice-cream stocks in
response to a forecast of hot or cold weather when the big supermarket
chains can?
At least part of the answer lies in the commercial pressure on the Met
Office to reduce its demands on the public purse, by making as much money as
possible selling services. Indeed Prof Hunt notes the irony that 'the fact
the 30-day forecast is not brilliantly accurate means that we make more
money out of it.'
Surely, however, it could still make money by selling a more elaborate or
specialised 30-day forecast to commercial customers - as it does with daily
and weekly forecasts - while making the basic prospects more widely
available. The Met Office is one British scientific institution that is
still a world leader in its field. How sad that it no longer believes in
fair weather for all.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Sport: Put through the ringer - Rugby Union / Tom Fort once
smuggled an All Black star into his Sunday team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the sights of the recent All Blacks' tour of Britain was the mighty
winger, Vai'aiga Tuigamala, a terrifying man, who felicitously combines the
destructive potential of a medieval battering ram with intelligence and
finesse of the highest order. Even in the All Blacks' sole defeat, by
England at Twickenham, there was one moment to savour.
The victim was the younger Underwood. As he took a high kick outside the
England 22, he was picked up by Tuigamala, in the manner of a splintered
tree trunk being shifted by a JCB. He finally hit the turf 15 yards back,
and tottered away, ruefully massaging his flanks.
Had the International Rugby Board's regulations on national qualification
been other than a standing joke, Underwood would not have had to suffer so.
For Tuigamala is hardly more of a New Zealander than I am a Frenchman. He is
a Samoan. He is not alone. The ranks of the two great southern hemisphere
sides are bursting with South Sea islanders. Apart from Tuigamala, the All
Blacks have Frank Bunce, Steve Bachop and Eroni Clarke from Samoa. Australia
have the indestructible Tongan, Willie Ofahengaue, and the Fijian flanker,
Ilie Tabua.
The Europeans are not above such shenanigans. Remember the hoots when former
Aussie Brian Smith pulled on the green shirt of Ireland - which turned to
howls when he left his adopted country in the lurch just before the World
Cup. By name, Damien Cronin may sound like a resident of Tannochbrae. But by
any meaningful criteria, he is English, as are his fellow Scots, Andy Reed
and Neil Edwards.
Nigel Redman, Jonathon Callard, Stuart Barnes and Simon Halliday of England
are all Welsh born. Tony Copsey of Wales is an Essex man with a 'Made in
England' tattoo.
Whatever the contortions over birthplace, citizenship and grandparental
domicile, these men are - to employ a colloquialism - ringers. And as the
longtime organiser of a rugby team which was ever oppressed by the need to
find 15 players, I am all for them. Gather thy bodies wherever thou mayest
is my motto - with one proviso, which I shall come to later.
Of course, there is a limit to the influence a ringer can wield. If the team
is useless, he will not be able to transform it into something else. One
Sunday, many years ago, the Welsh and British Lions winger, Clive Rees, was
strolling around the pitch on which we were about to play formidable
opposition. As usual, we were deficient in numbers, and the obliging Rees
was talked into helping out. I suspect he regretted it. We lost 54-0, and
not once were we broken-winded, clapped-out forwards able to secure the ball
for him to use of his greyhound pace.
I prefer to recall another occasion. We had progressed from the Rees era,
and were a reasonable side. But our opponents were better, and knew it. We
longed to puncture their air of superiority.
We had a Kiwi playing for us that season. He was called Rex Smith, and he
had played for Otago and was well-connected. We told him how keen we were to
beat this outfit for the first time, and he said he would speak to some
mates. On the evening in question he produced his two recruits. One
introduced himself as Earle - Earle Kirton, the former All Blacks number
eight (and currently the assistant coach). The other was called Sapsford. He
was a prop, 18st plus, and could run faster than anyone in our back
division.
It was he who did the damage. He took the ball, and thundered at them like a
buffalo with a mission. Their defence was demolished like brushwood, leaving
casualties stretched out on the ground. We scored. They kicked off, Sapsford
caught the ball and off we went again. It was murder, and the greatest fun.
The atmosphere in the bar afterwards was charged. They were subdued, we were
riotous. There were recriminations, which became increasingly bitter when
Kirton was identified. Our sportmanship was questioned, the future of the
fixture put in doubt. But the crosser they became, the more we smirked. They
had never thought much of us, but the worm had turned, and we had - to put
it crudely - stitched them up.
And that brings me to the condition I mentioned earlier. Yes, I believe the
game is richer for ringers, and it has been a privilege to see Tuigamala in
his pomp. But life is undoubtedly more comfortable if you make sure that
they are on your side.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Exciting wines at razor sharp prices - Jancis
Robinson scours the high street for the best value bottles in the second
part of her seasonal round-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A brewer's group of specialist off-licences is offering the widest range of
wines, although those interested in price above quality are best served by
supermarkets.
Limited distribution wines are marked (LD). Star ratings denote corporate
commitment to wine quality.
SAINSBURY***
Prices have always been razor sharp, but the range is noticeably more
exciting than a year or two ago, although some of the best wines enjoy only
limited distribution (LD).
WHITES
Chardonnay Vin de Pays d'Oc 1992 Pounds 2.99. Extremely keen price for a
wine in which the lees-flavoured appeal may fade rapidly but is rarely
associated with this price bracket.
Do Campo Branco Pounds 2.99. Portuguese white blended by Australian Peter
Bright from Fernao Pires grapes which has settled down in bottle to become
an attractive, if simple, fruity dry white.
Gyongyos Esztergom Country White 1992 Pounds 3.35. Lively, dryish Semillon
from Hungary.
Argentinian Torrontes Pounds 3.49. Scented, lively aperitif blended by
Trapiche from Argentina's white grape speciality.
Chardonnay delle Tre Venezie Pounds 3.59. Still one of the best-value whites
available in the UK, blended by Angela Muir.
Riesling QbA 1989 von Kesselstatt Pounds 4.65. Someone has been working very
hard to place a wine from this ambitious Mosel producer in every major chain
and we should benefit from the attractive prices while they last. This is a
snip, a declassified Kabinett from a very good vintage and already shows
some maturity. Sprightly, for once this really is 'liquid refreshment'.
Gentil Hugel 1992 Pounds 4.95 (LD). Hugel's new Alsace blend sounds so much
better than Edelzwicker and tastes both soft and lively. It would make a
please-all holiday house white, especially good for serving without food.
Lindemans Bin 65 Chardonnay 1993 Pounds 4.95 (available elsewhere).
Displaying admirable quality considering the quantity made.
Menetou-Salon 1992 H Pelle Pounds 6.45 (LD). Better value than most
Sancerres on offer. Fine.
REDS
Jumilla Altos de Pio 1989 Pounds 2.99. Plums, life, good powerful aroma.
Slightly tough but there is fruit too.
Faugeres Pounds 2.99. A good, vigorous, if light example of this appellation
in the hills of the Languedoc from the ubiquitous Domaines Virginie. Drink
slightly cool, with leftovers?
Castel Pujola Tannat 1988 Pounds 4.75 (LD). Basque immigrants brought the
Madiran grape to - Uruguay] Powerful, concentrated, well-balanced wine in a
nicely labelled bottle. Worth seeking out.
Ch Beaumont 1990 Haut-Medoc Pounds 5.95. A special Christmas price for this
good vintage of a respectable cru bourgeois.
Penfolds Bin 389 Cabernet Shiraz Pounds 7.45. Well-blended classic South
Australian.
Mercurey 1990 Domaine de la Grangerie Pounds 7.95 (LD). Scented and fruity
with an attractive suggestion of licorice. Good with turkey.
TESCO***
Great activity to some interesting effect. The rivalry with Sainsbury
continues. Many Tesco or International Winemaker labels.
WHITES
Uvas del Sol Argentinian White Pounds 3.49. Big, powerful, dry, exuding
flavour from a blend of Chenin and Ugni Blanc with some aromatic Torrontes
grapes, made by LA Agricola. The Torrontes 1992 (more limited distribution)
is worth the 20p premium over the Sainbury example (Waitrose has the 1993).
Dry but scented.
Australian Colombard/Chardonnay Pounds 3.75. Lemon and lime. Well blended
from Murray river-irrigated fruit.
Domaine de la Jalouisie Chardonnay 1992 Pounds 4.99 (LD - very). Yves
Grassa, best known for his Cotes de Gascogne, plays to extremely good effect
with the white burgundy grape and some top quality barrels.
Viogniers Pounds 4.99 and Pounds 5.49 (LD). Both of these Vins de Pays d'Oc
are full, almost blowsy examples of this most fashionable grape. The Domaine
St James (from Etang de Colombes in the Corbieres) is so peachy it's almost
commercial air 'freshener'.
REDS
Merlot del Piave Pounds 2.99. Full, lively, north Italian soft red. Serve
cool.
Uvas del Sol Argentinian Red Pounds 3.49. Robust blend of Italian Sangiovese
and Bonarda with Malbec.
International Winemaker Syrah Vin de Pays d'Oc 1992 Pounds 4.99. Modern,
cool-fermented Languedoc wine. Very deep purple. Young, simple, powerful,
drink now]
Yarra Glen Pinot Noir 1992 Pounds 5.99 (LD). A second label from Tarrawarra
in the Yarra Valley, widely regarded as Australia's natural Pinor Noir
habitat. This seems better value than the Pounds 9.99 first label to me,
although it may be best served very slightly cool.
Penfolds Bin 128 Shiraz 1990 Coonawarra Pounds 6.99. Oaky, dense mouthful.
FORTIFIED WINES
Halves of sherry. Tesco sherries have always good but not always this well
packaged. A useful half of lively, palate-whetting Manzanilla is Pounds
2.99, while the even more tingly, fuller Palo Cortado is Pounds 3.99.
THRESHER/BOTTOMS UP/WINE RACK****
This Whitbread-owned off-licence group is waving the specialist flag most
vigorously at the moment with some thoughtful buying and useful literature.
It seems to be trying to hook us out of curiosity rather than price-cutting.
WHITES
Sauvignon Nouveau 1993 Fortant de France Pounds 3.99. Lively, fruity, jolly,
if simple.
English wines from the Harvest Wine Group. The exciting range of well-made
wines from the English winemaker described in the Weekend FT a few weeks
ago, in the Pounds 4 to Pounds 6 range and well worth it.
Bridgewater Mill Riesling 1993 Pounds 4.99. Petaluma's second label, a full,
lively Riesling from South Australia that is drier, and therefore more
useful, than most.
Villa Maria Riesling 1993 Pounds 5.49. Spine, acidity, spritz, off-dry New
Zealander.
Casablanca Sauvignon Blanc 1993 Pounds 5.99. Real pizazz. Off dry richness.
Long Chilean.
Scharzhofberger Riesling Kabinett 1990 von Hovel Pounds 7.15. Lovely, light,
pure, palate-sharpener.
Gewurztraminer Hengst 1990 Alsace Grand Cru Pounds 9.99. Good, meaty,
savoury yet full, persistent white that can be drunk with all sorts of red
wine foods.
Puligny-Montrachet 1990 Louis Carillon Pounds 15.99. Lovely pure stuff with
great nerve and density. Great that a mass market chain actually lists this
(although you may have to order it).
REDS
Redondo 1991 Pounds 3.29. Loose, juicy red from a Portuguese co-op. House
wine, for serving with or without food.
Quinta de Lamelas 1992 Pounds 3.69. First-class concentrated red from the
Douro valley, made at Quinta de la Rosa. Too cheap.
Cotes-du-Rhone Tradition 1991 St Esteve d'Uchaux Pounds 4.79. Full, supple,
smooth. A good southern Rhone at a fair price.
Palliser Estate Pinot Noir 1991 Pounds 9.99. Light, but perfumed, slightly
sweet, and well structured for drinking with this year's festive fowl.
Mountadam Pinot Noir 1991 Pounds 9.99. If the above is New Zealand's answer
to Beaune then this is Australia's answer to Nuits, a much more substantial
yet still lively riposte to red burgundy.
VERY STICKY
Seppelt Old Trafford Tawny Pounds 7.49. Tooth-rotting sweet fortified wine
with more than a hint of rancio and zabaglione.
Stanton &amp; Killeen Liqueur Muscat Pounds 5.49 a half. Australian sticky par
excellence. Christmas pudding was created for this.
VICTORIA WINE**
A name to watch in 1994, although for the moment it is left at the starting
post by rivals Thresher.
WHITES
Gaillac Blanc 1992 Labastide de Levis Pounds 3.29 (available elsewhere).
Amazing transformation from the dried-up apple peel of previous vintages to
a characterful fruity mouthful, yet still recognisably the Mauzac grape.
Australian winemaking is the answer - yet again. Good house white.
Cape View Sauvignon Blanc 1993 Pounds 4.29. South African fruit, New Zealand
winemaker, lively wine.
Charles de France Chardonnay 1992 Boisset Pounds 4.69. A marginal bargain,
this basic white burgundy, but worth seeking out just to see which cards a
commercially astute Burgundian chooses to play. Answer: heavy Dom
Perignon-like bottle, heavy French branding, and the claims 'oak aged' and
(to trump New World producers) 'hand picked'.
REDS
Jumilla 1990 Carchelo Pounds 3.59. Another well-packaged wine. New wave red
Spanish. Rich, desperately trying to hide its naturally high alcohol.
Vina Pilar 1990 Felix Callejo Pounds 4.99. Another bargain from Ribero del
Duero in north west of Madrid. Heavy oak but lots of ripe fruit.
Ch Carignan 1990 Pounds 6.99. Well made, plummy, vigorous yet accessible
petit chateau claret.
Colle del Talo 1990 Pounds 6.99. Well-made Tuscan vino da tavola from
Vicchiomaggio. Concentrated Sangiovese grapes given oak ageing. Substantial
wine that can already be enjoyed.
WAITROSE***
Solid selection with some interesting bees in its bonnet.
WHITES
Santa Julia Torrontes 1993 Pounds 3.75. Judiciously young, fragrant
Argentinian aperitif wine. Tesco and Sainsbury also stock a version.
Ch Haut Rian 1992 Pounds 3.99. Distinctly superior dry white bordeaux which
packs much more of a punch than many of its more expensive peers. Ch
Chaubinet 1992 at Pounds 3.95 is almost as good.
Jacquere 1992 Vin de Savoie Pounds 4.55. Alpine refreshment but with more
fruit than in many years.
Avontuur Chardonnay 1992 Pounds 4.99. Extremely good value for a well-made,
relatively savoury, mealy South African.
Tokay Pinot Gris 1992 Blanck Pounds 5.25. Gorgeous. Serious, full, smoked
bacon flavours. Very long and substantial.
Ch Bastor-Lamontagne 1990 Sauternes Pounds 7.75 a half. Waitrose has long
sold this fine value sweet white bordeaux. Deep, rich, long, from a fine
vintage. This wine could be drunk now but it should also repay cellaring
until the turn of the century.
REDS
Ramada Pounds 2.39. Yet another underpriced offering from a Portuguese
co-operative. Hints of sweet chestnuts. Tiring after a while but look at the
price . . .
Cotes du Ventoux 1992 Paul Boutinot Pounds 2.99. Juicier, lighter version of
red Cotes-du-Rhone; good value.
Avontuur Cabernet/Merlot 1993 Pounds 3.99. Jolly, powerful South African
blend from Stellenbosch.
Teroldego Rotaliano 1991 Gaierhof Pounds 4.25. Amazingly deep colour with
deep, full, soft fruit flavours and a hint of bitterness at the end. Good
with cheese.
Last week, Marks and Spencer's two-star rating was omitted.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: The secrets of Speyside - Giles MacDonogh on
why a great malt can't be made in a bath tub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speyside malts have a cachet which is denied to other whiskies. The
concentration of so many famous distilleries along the banks of the rivers
Spey and Livet, in a region circumscribed by the rivers Findhorn and
Deveron, creates a geographical image of quality every bit as tangible as
Pauillac or the Cotes de Nuits.
Whisky is not wine, though. To a large extent, it is created by the
engineers who design the stills. Even so, the influence of geography and
geology cannot be written off. As Bill Crilly, a chemist who manages the
Tamdhu distillery, puts it: 'If it were just about engineering, you'd be
able to do just as good a job in your bath tub in Islington.'
Clearly, water is important; otherwise, they would not have built so many
distilleries along the fast-moving Spey. But the water for the mash comes
from wells and springs, not the river. In general this is pure, soft water -
although Glenlivet uses a hard water, which runs over limestone, in its mash
tun. Crilly told me that you could not make good whisky from hard water. I
mentioned Glenmorangie. He smiled.
There are mixed views, too, about the sort of barley you use. At the
Macallan, they insist that the blend is 75 per cent Golden Promise and 25
per cent Halcyon, a winter barley from England. Others pour scorn on this
exclusiveness: they say the quality of the barley is measured by its yield
alone and that you cannot taste the difference from one whisky to another.
Frank Newlands, at the Macallan, disagrees: 'We had some disgusting stuff
called Tyne once. We couldn't use it.'
You can taste the difference in a beer; and whisky, essentially, is
distilled beer. In the distillery, this beer goes by the name of wash. Some
washes smell (and even taste) better than others. Distillers set great store
by the friendly bacteria which live in the big, wooden washbacks. They also
create flavour in the whisky.
Like a lot of wine, the wash undergoes two fermentations: first tumultuous
(or 'alcoholic' ) and then malolactic. The more vigorous the first, says
Crilly, the better the whisky.
Then, there is the crucial factor of the stills, where size and shape are
all-important. The usual line is that large, formless stills make dull
whisky. They should be small, with bumps called 'boil pots', or with a wide
head to give the whisky complexity.
The most important of the two stills is the wash still in which the whisky
has its first distillation. Here, the sweet esters are created. The whisky
should not be made too quickly: about 10 litres a minute is a good rate.
Some distilleries run their stills too quickly - an operation known as
'thrashing'. At 35 litres a minute, you will get nasty flavours in the
spirit and it can smell of old dishcloths. One or two commercial malts on
the market have this odour.
The spirit which leaves the second still will be around 66 per cent alcohol
on Speyside. This will be broken down with spring water and run into casks.
Here is another important factor: the quality of the wood. There is a lot of
rotten stuff about, created by the enormous demand for whisky in the 1970s
and '80s. Highland distillers are rather sensitive about wood. Casks which
do not appear to marry up with the spirit are marked DNR (do not re-use) and
thrown out.
Age has much to do with quality, too. The youngest whiskies on the UK market
are eight-year-olds, such as Glenfiddich and Tamdhu. At this age, there is
not a lot of complexity to be had.
Quality begins with malts 10 and 12 years old. In the old days, it was said
that whisky got 'oily' or 'woody' or 'heavy' after 15 years; but this was
true only if the whisky had been matured badly. There are enough
25-year-olds around now to prove how false this argument was.
Responsible distillers try to put out their malts at the optimum ages. Glen
Grant tends to be rather one-dimensional so that, even at 10 years, it is a
pale whisky which smells of little more than honeycomb. Both it and
Glenlivet belong to the giant Seagrams group, which has been hiding some of
its greatest Speyside treasures in blends such as Chivas Regal, 100 Pipers
and Passport.
Strathisla is a gem of a distillery in the town of Keith. Its dumpy stills
produce a heavy, nutty whisky at 12 years, with vanilla flavour coming from
bourbon barrels.
Longmorn has long been a favourite among blenders, but outsiders have had
little chance to savour the rich delights of its honey and flowers bouquet
at 12 or 15 years. There is some good news, however. Seagrams has decided to
launch four new bottlings from its Speyside distilleries next year:
Benriach, Glen Keith, Strathisla and Longmorn.
In the case of Longmorn, this is long overdue: here, elements combine with
that little touch of sweetness to make the quintessential Speyside malt.

<TEXT>
KARL FRIEDRICH VON RUMOHR: THE ESSENCE OF COOKERY
Translated by Barbara Yeomans Prospect Books, Pounds 12.50, 212 pages Karl
Friedrich von Rumohr (1785-1843) enjoyed a certain reputation in his day as
an art historian. What was possibly less well-known at the time was that
Rumohr was the first German to make something like a systematic study of
what we eat, writes Giles MacDonogh. To some extent this obscurity was
intentional: in the high-minded world of German art history, it might not
have done for a scholar to show an interest in anything so frivolous. Rumohr
therefore published his book on food - Der Geist der Kochkunst - under the
name of his cook: Joseph Konig.
The question is, how does Rumohr compare to his French contemporaries,
Grimod de La Reyniere and Brillat-Savarin?
Rumohr was one of the first advocates of what we now call 'healthy eating'
while both Grimod and Brillat had an unabashed French tendency to the
over-elaborate. Some thing of Rumohr's approach derives from his knowledge
of the ancient world: he wanted to feturn to the simplicity of the Homeric
Greeks and the Augustan Romans. The nearest he could see to this in the
modern world was England. He appreciated the simplicity of the English roast
at a time when the French still boiled their meat, and thought the English
would recreate the Roman fish sauce, or garum, which was splashed on to
Roman food in the way that the Americans apply tomato sauce.
He is fascinated by what is now (only stupidly) called the 'Mediterranean'
diet which he encountered on his trips to Italy. He liked olive oil and
tomatoes and thought the latter should be introduced in Germany. He would
not have enjoyed listening to Frank Sinatra in restaurants: 'Playing music
during meals tends to stupefy people and is therefore reprehensible.'
Where Rumohr really is interesting is in his early adoption of the
socio-anthropological approach. He hears of the Maori hangi and he goes off
and cooks it; he samples all the dishes he hears about from travellers and
is far more ready to experiment than his smug, French contemporaries. That
is the chief revelation of this book. The chief drawback is the translator's
introduction which is largely irrelevant and ill-informed.

FT  18 DEC 93 / How to Spend It: Fake is fine for that Christmas sparkle -
From old gold to modern costume jewellery, there are plenty of pretty
baubles to put under your tree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST

<TEXT>
I have not met a woman yet who has complained of having too much jewellery.
Not enough, perhaps, or even too much that is too cheap but too much per se?
Never.
If in doubt when seeking to please your nearest and dearest, just think
small. Think of an intimate little packet, exquisitely wrapped, that comes
charged with meaning, that speaks of love and caring, of forethought and
generosity. These may be the days of equal opportunity, when so many women
buy their own jewellery. Even so there is nothing finer than a piece bought
by He Who Cares.
There are those, diminishing in number, for whom the only jewellery that
matters is real. Apart from the grand joailliers, the Boucherons and
Cartiers, the Garrards and Chaumets and Bulgaris, there is now a group of
jewellery designers which has realised there is a market for those who want
their jewels real but up-to-date. The grand soirees of yesterday have been
replaced by a raft of business meetings. The need for a sculptured brooch or
carefully-chosen necklace which can see today's working woman through from
the school-run in the morning to the dinner party has grown. Jewellers such
as Kiki McDonough are sought after because they have intrinsic value, a
reasonable price and are wearable in a modern context. Although they are far
from rock-bottom, they are infinitely more affordable than those at the
traditional haut joailliers.
Kiki has a host of fashionable customers who like her jewellery because it
is real but does not shout. As Juliet Hambro, one of her devoted fans, says:
'I wear Kiki's necklaces and earrings all the time because it adds a
finishing touch to an outfit and yet it never clamours for too much
attention. In my job (financial investment consultant) I often have to
travel all day and attend luncheons, meetings and dinners. I can wear Kiki's
ebony and gold ear-rings or her haematite necklace from morning until
night.'
At Kiki McDonough there are lots of gifts at under Pounds 1,000 - 18-carat
gold and malachite ear-rings, for instance, bold and stylish at Pounds 495,
simpler nine-carat gold earrings for Pounds 295.
Boodle &amp; Dunthorne is an old-established jewellers from Liverpool which this
year opened a grand new store in Regent Street. There are antique pieces but
also lots of choice for those who need a brooch to enliven a working suit,
some earrings to add a little glamour to an all-purpose coat. Choose from
bold earrings in gold (Pounds 455) or a mixture of silver and gold (Pounds
300) or some of Leo de Vroomen's strong enamelled pieces (Pounds 3,450).
More strong pieces are to be found at Tiffany (and, of course, there is
something deliciously enticing about those turquoise blue little boxes).
Avoid, unless you come into that category of never having to inquire about
the cost, the ones in the brochure which are marked 'prices upon request'.
Turn instead to more affordable items - such as Tiffany's own signature
collection, Paloma Picasso's pink tourmaline earrings (Pounds 1,575) and
Elsa Peretti's sculpture sterling silver pieces which start at Pounds 50.
There is also a delicate gold chain with a floating diamond which at Pounds
315 would make a lovely present for a favourite god-daughter.
Those for whom these prices would cause Micawberish unhappiness should not
be downhearted. Fake these days is fine. In the real world even those women
who have beautiful inherited pieces often mix them with fake. Countess
Alexander of Tunis, for instance, is a great fan of the reproduction
jewellery of Fior. 'I work as a special events organiser and when I did this
for Chaumet I used to have access to their splendid real jewels. Now that
they have closed down their London operation I miss it. I often mix pieces
from Fior or Butler &amp; Wilson with real pieces. Buying costume jewellery
enables one to have much more variety - for instance: I have long 'pearls',
short 'pearls', 'pearl' chokers,' she says.
Besides Fior and Butler &amp; Wilson, many an aristocratic lady who lunches is
actually glinting away in inexpensive costume jewellery sold by each other
to each other. Becky Blandford, for instance, mother to the future Duke of
Marlborough, sells the Caura range of jewellery designed by Eric van
Peterson to her well-connected friends.
From the Caura catalogue bold gold earrings (base metal dipped in 22-carat
gold) sell for Pounds 19.15 a pair, a necklace of 'gold' baubles for Pounds
60, three rows of 'pearls' for Pounds 33 and some fashionably classical
'gold' and 'amethyst' ear-rings for Pounds 19.15. There is much more in
similar vein.
I have seen Agatha's earrings adorning some very aristocratic lobes indeed.
It is a very clever costume jewellery enterprise brought over from Paris. It
has all the fashionable icons of the day - the 'pearl' cross (Pounds 19),
the plain bold 'gold' ear-rings (Pounds 17), the big, bold ring with
classical overtones (Pounds 19), the 'amber' heart-shaped pendant (Pounds
12) and the 'ebony' cross (Pounds 10). So take heart: it really is the
thought that counts.
Kiki McDonough is at 77c Walton St, London SW3 2HT. Telephone: 071-581-1777.

Sally Burton, widow of Richard, loves jewellery but her tastes have changed.
'I always think about big jewellery that you need a man to buy it for you
and a man to undo it at the end of the day. Obviously there was a time in my
life when I used to wear the big stuff which was bought by Richard and which
now sits in a vault in the bank. Now that my life has changed I still like
real jewellery but I go for quieter, more subdued ranges.
'I also like costume jewellery such as Chanel's great big earrings and I
collect pieces from Merola in Walton Street - all the beautiful 20s stuff. I
have dress-clips in diamante and dangly Bakelite earrings - most of the
materials are intrinsically inexpensive but it is the design that appeals.
'I have been collecting pieces from Garrard's One One Two collection for
some time. Almost every day I wear bangles from the range and on Christmas
day I will almost certain be wearing them together with these wonderful big
looped ear-rings and the necklace. As I shall be spending the day with
four-year-old twin nephews who are hugely excitable I shan't be wearing
anything grand.'
The One One Two collection has gold rings from Pounds 370, bangles from
about Pounds 1,000.
***
Shebah Ronay is a 22-year-old actress and daughter of Edina Ronay, the
designer, who will shortly be appearing on TV in a new series of House of
Eliott and Love Hurts.
When it comes to jewellery she likes it simple.
'Often I make my own - I buy beads from a shop called Hobby Horse and make
necklaces and bracelets. There are two rings that I always wear - a heavy
gold wedding band which was a present from my grandmother and a ruby ring
that I bought for myself. Many of the pieces I own have been given me as
Christmas presents but I am lucky in that my mother has the most amazing
collection of costume jewellery which she has collected from places like
Merola and antique shops and so I often borrow from her when I'm going out.'
For Christmas Eve she will be wearing a maroon velvet jacket designed by her
mother (Pounds 425 from Edina Ronay, 171 King's Road, Chelsea, London SW3).
'I love its long cuffs and lapels,' says Shebah. 'It is subtle, yet
glamorous in a classic way. There are trousers to match (Pounds 225) but I'm
actually going to wear them with some viscose trousers also designed by my
mother.'
She is photographed here wearing it with the sort of jewellery she likes:
'very simple and yet complementing the clothes'.
The gilt and pearl earrings are Pounds 75, the bracelet is Pounds 85, both
are from Celine, 6f Sloane Street, Knightsbridge, London SW3 and 28 New Bond
Street, London W1.

Chloe Annett, who stars in Jewels, this week's infinitely forgettable
mini-TV series, is young and pretty. And since the plot required her to wear
lots of baubles she has become interested in jewellery.
Fior, the Knightsbridge and Bond Street jewellers which specialises in
making finely-crafted costume pieces that look like the real thing, and
Buccellati, the Italian jewellers, have between them supplied all the jewels
for the series.
To Chloe Annett it was a revelation seeing just how well-made some modern
costume jewellery can be.
'I thought the jewellery was wonderful. Until then I had mostly worn pieces
given to me by my grandmother - I might attach them to lengths of velvet and
wear them as a choker. I have a large mother-of-pearl cross which I would
wear, for instance, with my Kenzo dress with the shorts underneath. I also
have a lovely gold and platinum ring with two tiny diamonds given to me by
my boyfriend.'
She is photographed here wearing what she intends to wear on Christmas Day -
a black Lycra-velvet mini-dress (Pounds 295) by Michele Holden of 42
Beauchamp Place, Knightsbridge, London SW1. Michele Holden is a dressmaker
who (unusually) combines a made-to-measure business with ready-to-wear. With
the dress she is wearing a set of necklets (Pounds 235.50), bracelet (Pounds
185) and ear-rings (Pounds 39.95) worn during filming. All are rhodium
plated, hand set with diamante and synthetic rubies and all come from Fior,
27 Brompton Road, Knightsbridge, London SW3 or 31, New Bond Street, Mayfair,
London W1.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Fashion: Catwalk style for kids - Avril Groom searches the
clothes racks for fashion gifts for youngsters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The gap between what children want to wear and how their elders would like
them to dress is bigger than you think. Searching recently for some
civilised clothing to tempt an 11-year-old, whose idea of chic is an outsize
man's T-shirt and black jeans artistically holed at the knee, I suggested
the casual but classic combination of a denim shirt and chinos. 'Yuk]' came
the outraged reply, with a look of deeply affronted dignity, 'That's what
dad wears.'
Now, in the interests of family unity, what you do not need on Christmas
morning is a reaction like that from your little darling when he/she opens a
parcel from grannie or great-aunt, especially if said elderly relative is
there beaming fondly.
So, if grannie likes to indulge your children with clothes, a little prior
consultation is a good idea. The world's most wonderful smocked silk dress
is a disaster if it is banished to the back of the wardrobe by a disdainful
child.
Babies are easy to cater for. The only person likely to complain at the gift
of a white satin, hand-embroidered romper suit is the mother, as she
visualises it splattered with pureed apple. The traditional source of such
delights is The White House, but another name to look for is Heather Brown
whose hand-embroidered and smocked, washable styles are available at Fortnum
and Mason, Pollyanna of Fulham Road and New Arrivals of Banchory.
Little girls are normally delighted with any full-skirted party frock but
where you would prefer it in sober navy taffeta or dark tartan they like
sugar-almond pink. This objection is easily overcome, however, with a stiff
net under petticoat and a skirt full enough to 'twirl'. A tiny matching bag
and hair band are other inducements - Young England, Trotters and Bambino
have dresses with matching sets. The smocked silk dress is still a winner
and Daks' new children's range includes a white-collared style in dark or
neutral checks that is beautifully made and not over-glitzy.
Small boys look sweet in cords, smart shorts and Fair Isle jumpers but over
four they find velvet knickerbockers, Peter Pan collars and bow-ties pretty
hard to take. Any grannie coming up with the Little Lord Fauntleroy look
probably deserves rebellion. But traditional style is reasserting itself in
the market and pragmatic parents, who do not wish a small fortune to be
spent on something that will be shortly outgrown, could suggest Debenhams,
Marks and Spencer, BhS and Children's World as sources of tasteful,
good-looking childrenswear with unguessable price tags. Laura Ashley, who
regard traditional style as their forte, also have a particularly good
Christmas range.
Older children are more tricky. The strictures of school uniform create a
healthy disregard for formality on high days and holidays. Boys seem to
reject anything other than denim, though a navy blazer is one classic
acceptable to most, anything from Burberry's sharply-cut version to Marks
and Spencers' soft moufflon style, about Pounds 50.
A fun alternative is a waistcoat - plain, velvet or damasked. These also
find favour with girls, who respond surprisingly early to adult trends. A
waistcoat over a long white shirt, big, bright knits with leggings, and
velvet (especially black) are ideas that have gone straight from the catwalk
to the under-tens. Velvet is your best weapon in persuading an older girl to
wear a traditional party frock - she will think it immensely sophisticated.
Harrods has crushed velvet waistcoats, long flutey skirts and organza shirts
among their more traditional offerings. At chainstore level, BhS has
fetching velvet or cotton embroidered or beaded waistcoats and long, silk
skirts. Debenhams can supply boys with dark, washed-silk shirts.
The best small present for a girl this year is, without doubt, a squashy
velvet hat. This will be accepted with gratitude and worn everywhere. And
that is the greatest compliment a grandparent could possibly receive.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Fashion: Clothes for the 'petite'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is she, like most of the female population of Britain, under 5ft 5in tall?
If so, she may well have difficulty in looking good in many of her favourite
designer's clothes. Laura B, who sells her own brand of glamour dressing to
a host of sophisticates about town, has made a speciality of always having a
supply of sophisticated clothing for those who are kindly called 'petite'
and less kindly just plain short.
She has her designs specially made in Paris on a petite last and uses many
of the same fabrics as many a high-profile designer name. Her black wool
crepe suit with the white lapels has been a winner this winter -
the perfect lunching outfit at Pounds 495 whilst her chic striped black and
beige trousers (Pounds 265) are blissfully comfortable.
The black wool jacket (Pounds 375) ought, of course, to go with plenty of
other things already lurking in the wardrobe. If a complete outfit is not
what you had in mind there are stunning belts of leather with gold tarnished
buckles at Pounds 65 - Pounds 95, soft angora wool sweaters (Pounds 85) with
matching shawls and a wonderful white lace blouse with pirate sleeves and
frilly jabot (Pounds 195). Laura B is at 25b Walton Street, London SW3 2HU.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Gardening: Festive planting, no need to panic - A few simple
preparations mean you can enjoy your Christmas celebrations before braving
the elements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The weather is wonderfully unpleasant but the Christmas holidays loom and,
in my mind's eye, I see Weekend FT readers as planters, wading into the
thick of it with a sodden newspaper and a pair of designer gumboots. The
coming break gives us all a chance for replanting and improvements. But what
do you do if you cannot face the elements on the morning after the plants
arrive?
It depends where they come from. If you have bought them at a garden centre,
you could well have paid over the odds but you will be under less pressure.
The plants will be potted-up already and can wait for your convenience. They
can wait quite a while; indeed, several peonies have been waiting for my
convenience since June.
They are none the worse for the interval but the one danger is a severe
frost. If it works down into a pot, it might turn the plants into pulp when
it starts to thaw. Last year, I lost several agapanthus, rotted by a thaw
which I had not anticipated. A hard winter costs nurserymen as many plants
from rotting as from freezing. If you foresee trouble, move any plants
bought in pots into a shed or under cover.
If you have ordered roses, shrubs or trees from a nursery, you can expect
delivery any time now after a slow start to lifting during the frosts in
November. Among our bigger nurseries, my favourite remains Scotts of
Merriott, Somerset, now in the third generation of family ownership.
Most of its business is by mail order and it is not alone in believing that
this form of retailing is making a comeback, just after many small nurseries
pronounced it impossibly expensive and gave it up. The reason is that the
parcels of plants go nowhere near the well-meaning fumbles of the post
office. The new express delivery firms now carry many of the nursery's mail
orders of shrubs and trees, along with the various goods of other home
shopping catalogues.
As a result, orders arrive within two days of despatch at a cost which is
way below the price of the post office's friendly meander. It is no longer
prohibitive to order trees, fruit and roses by mail from a catalogue. If
mail order revives for the nursery trade, will we all want to pay an extra
30 per cent or more to buy similar plants at our local garden centres?
One view is that garden centres will narrow down and become plant centres;
the big DIY stores will sell garden extras more cheaply and will offer a
simplified range of clean, attractive plants to impulse buyers. Keen
gardeners will revert to specialist nurseries, using their Plant Finders to
put them in touch with the new potential of mail order, delivered outside
the national postal network.
If they do, they will be glad for advice on planting from Scotts. For
instance, what do you do with a straw-wrapped parcel if it arrives when you
are up to your ears in work and parties? The answer is refreshingly simple:
leave it alone for a few days until you are ready for it.
If you are only half-ready, you can loosen the string and allow air to
circulate while burying its lower length in the ground. If the ground has
frozen already, keep the package in a cool, dry place. The one fatal mistake
is to bring it indoors or buy a heater so as to keep it warm.
In short, a sudden pre-Christmas delivery is no cause for panic. If you have
ordered fruit trees or roses, they will probably arrive with bare roots.
When you unpack them eventually, soak the roots in a bucket of water before
planting them or covering them over in a temporary trench outdoors. They can
wait until mid-March, but I have reverted to the older view that roses, at
least, are best transplanted before the new year.
When you plant them, harden your heart and do what most amateurs tend to
avoid: prune the new arrivals, removing at least half of the upper stems of
the old-fashioned varieties, and reducing climbers and ramblers to no more
than 2 ft. This pruning sounds extreme, but it is the way to avoid weak
roses later.
As for those plants that arrive in pots or fresh out of them, the growers at
Scotts have a useful tip. The roots may well have started to run round in a
circle and chase their tails in a tennis ball of peat compost. Unpot them
and run a sharp knife down one side of the root ball in order to scuff it
and encourage new roots to face outwards, not inwards, into the circular
tangle.
If you cut one side of a new plant in this way, the experts believe it is
more willing to develop roots away from its peat compost and into the
surrounding soil of a new home.
For similar reasons, there is now a definitive answer to the old question of
whether the roots of a tree are better when planted in a circle, not a
rectangle.
The answer is a rectangle: a round hole encourages roots to run round it and
not to leave the central ball of soil in which they have become pot-bound or
previously tended. In a rectangle, the roots are encouraged to run outwards
and join their new home, instead of becoming introverted.
If mail order is going to make a comeback, these little matters of treatment
will need to be remembered.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Fashion: Wrap up your shopping list - A chic scarf makes a
good gift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are still wandering around with a distraught air, wondering what to
buy for your nearest and dearest this Christmas, the fashion must-haves for
women this winter are squashy hats, an important shirt, and scarves,
scarves, scarves. If in doubt, head for a chic emporium where the taste is
impeccable and all you need do is select the price bracket.
Londoners could pick up a crinkly silk scarf (or better still, three or four
in assorted colours to be worn together, Pounds 39 a time), an Equipment
silk or, more Christmassy, a velvet shirt or a Prada handbag at Joseph.
At Harvey Nichols you will find one of the best costume jewellery counters
in town. If her tastes are more avant-garde it is not as well known as it
should be that Liberty now has one of the best modern designer floors around
(Issey Miyake, Koji Tatsuno, Sophie Malig, Vivien Westwood et al).
There is hardly a forward-thinking woman who would not give her eye-teeth
for one of Issey's crinkly wraps or skirts, one of Koji's cob-webbed vests.
If you can't run to those prices then Whistles and, amazingly enough, C &amp; A
and Warehouse, do very passable versions of crinkly gear all their own.
Less expensive, but just as desirable, are the crochet-edged cardigans
(Pounds 37) at Agnes B, at 111 Fulham Road, London SW3. (Mail order tel:
071-225-3477).
And, if you are still flummoxed, let me assure you that nobody ever had too
many absolutely plain cashmere sweaters. Brora has round-necked, V-necked
and polo-necked sweaters and cardigans for men and women for Pounds 99.50 a
time in most classic colours. If you order today (tel: 071-731-7672) it will
be despatched in time for Christmas if it has the colour in stock.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Travel: Taken for a ride in the Wild West - Hilary
Rubinstein experiences the spectacular scenery of Wyoming, and the joys and
hazards of life on a ranch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY RUBINSTEIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
God Spends His Vacation Here' is the claim inscribed on the ashtrays of the
Rustic Pine, Dubois, Wyoming.
It is a bar that might have been lifted out of any classic Hollywood
western: a hugely long counter, wooden cubicles on the side, lots of elk and
moose heads, a pool-table out back and square dancing on Tuesdays.
On the street, with its many log buildings and wooden sidewalks, the Rustic
Pine makes another resonant boast with its neon-lit board: 'The World's Most
Unique.'
With their long, straggling main streets, their depressing line of motels,
supermarkets, gas stations, shops selling American-Indian tat, trailer homes
and camper parking lots, there must be scores of places like this scattered
all over the American West.
Dubois offers all these eyesores, but it has some redeeming features - most
notably, spectacular country in every direction, all of it strangely
familiar from dozens of movies.
To the north lie the Absaroka mountains, tree-covered and alpine on their
lower slopes, rising to snow-covered peaks even in July. To the east and
west are the vivid rose-red and yellow badlands.
Passing close to the town is the lovely, sinuous Wind River, famous for its
variety of trout. Take a dirt road for half a dozen miles and you will be on
the threshold of the Wind River mountains, Wyoming's premier back-packing
area, with its many lakes and peaks rising to almost 14,000 ft. And two
hours' drive away you can reach Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks.
For most of the past century, Dubois has lived off its cattle rearing and
logging, but now the riding, trekking and fishing communities have begun to
wake to its tourist attractions.
There are no decent hotels or restaurants yet; they will come in time.
Meanwhile, if you are content to eat beef - especially prime rib - you will
not lack for calorific intake.
All along the Wind River valley, guest ranches are springing up, sometimes
attached to a working cattle ranch. Accommodation tends to be in rustic log
cabins with wood-burning stoves. Some have all the amenities of a good
hotel: pools, saunas, hot tubs, decent cooking.
My party comprised seven geriatric dudes - dude being a term of contempt for
some, but in these parts a neutral description of city folk holidaying on a
ranch. Six of us were in our mid-60s to mid-70s and only one of us had done
any serious riding before.
Were we nervous? You could say so. One so-called friend told us of an
article by Clement Freud who had come out to do some riding - he's an
experienced horseman - but had fallen off on his first day. The horse fell
on him and he broke a limb and wrote a funny piece about his hospital
experiences.
We were advised before leaving to bathe in vinegar to minimise our saddle
sores; to buy a stock of Arnica ointment for the abrasions we would surely
get along our thighs; and to be prepared for ticks, leeches, snakes and
mosquitoes.
Our ranch had sent us in advance a list of recommended items: riding boots
and lightweight walking boots (bought locally for a fraction of the price
they would have cost in Britain); powerful sunblockers and chapstick; lots
of warm clothing and sleepwear (the nights can be bitterly cold); and
mosquito repellent (another must).
We did not encounter the leeches or the snakes, but were given instructions
for dealing with the ticks which, we were told, like to attach themselves to
private parts and can give you a nasty disease if you don't quickly light a
match, blow it out and apply the hot end to the little beast.
As for the riding, it was for all of us wonderful. We trotted and cantered;
we hacked through beautiful scenery; and on an all-day expedition rose
effortlessly up precipitous slopes from 7,500 ft to a summit of over 11,000
ft.
After eight hours in the saddle we were exhausted, but exultant to have
stayed so long on our mounts without aches or sores.
How do I account for our painless initiation? First, the high quality of our
wranglers, those in charge of the corral, and their helpful instructions.
Second, the sure-footed confidence of our horses and their tolerance of our
inexperience. Finally there were those wonderful western saddles, with
pommels in front as an extra security and a back moulded to the human
buttock.
The pleasures of our ranch holiday were not confined to the riding. We went
for long treks; canoed up river creeks - magical at dusk when nocturnal
birds and beasts came out to drink; swam in glacial lakes. We even took
ourselves to Dubois one evening for the weekly square-dancing.
It seemed absurd to have travelled so far and not seen anything of the two
great national parks in the vicinity. So, at the end of our fortnight at the
ranch, we decamped to Jackson, an up-and-coming mini-Vail of a resort, 100
miles to the west, where we spent a morning white-water rafting, and then
drove to Yellowstone.
We were told that nearly a third of the US population has visited
Yellowstone, and each year another 2.5m tourists swell the total.
Yellowstone has many marvels, but we were determined to see one of its
best-known attractions, the Old Faithful geyser, which, every 75 minutes or
so, spews up 11,000 gallons of scalding water to a height of 180 ft. It is a
fine sight, even if you have to share it with hundreds of fellow-gawpers and
endure the bumper-to-bumper chain of campers and trailers on the long,
monotonous drive.
For climbing, we preferred the Grand Tetons, a staggeringly impressive range
of peaks that rears up from a flat plain and comes replete with canyons,
waterfalls and lakes, and also, if you are lucky, bears and elks.
Others were more fortunate in that respect than we were (though we did eat
elk steaks, even more boring than venison), but in our brief visit we
notched up plenty of wildlife sightings - moose, buffalo, coyotes, beavers,
badgers, marmots and chipmunks, plus many blue herons, pelicans, bald-headed
eagles, hawks and ospreys.
For most of us it was one of the most energetic out-door holidays we had
ever taken, and we were naturally chuffed that in advanced middle-age we
could derive such unremitting pleasure from our exertions. Would we go
again? Emphatically yes.
Recommended ranches in the Dubois area: all four ranches are personally run
by resident owners, with superior home cooking, and are flexible about
guests' requirements. (With acknowledgment to Nancy Debevoise, and the Rocky

FT  18 DEC 93 / Travel: Aloha Bond St-sur-mer - Sara Webb finds tourism is
taking its toll in Hawaii
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arriving in Hawaii is like stepping back into childhood.
The last time I wore garlands of flowers around my neck I was six, playing
with daisy chains. In Hawaii you are decked out in leis, or garlands, as
soon as you land, and waft along in a cloud of frangipani and rose. Then you
notice that everyone is wearing them - people arriving, people departing,
people celebrating a birthday or going to a party.
Then there is the language, which to the newcomer sounds like baby-talk:
great slabs of vowels and apostrophes, with the rare consonant thrown in
(there are only seven in use, which must make Scrabble a challenge). People
pepper their conversation with odd words of Hawaiian, in particular Aloha,
which seems to mean 'hello,' 'goodbye,' and 'lots of love'.
After that, you notice the outlandish clothes: men with splodges of colour
across their chests, decked out as brightly as reef-feeding fish, and women
in equally colourful muumuus, the invention of the missionaries who,
displeased at the sight of happy girls in grass skirts, forced them to wear
what look like particularly nasty C&amp;A nighties, circa 1970.
For many tourists, muumuus and Aloha are about as much as they see of
Hawaiian culture. It is enough for the sun-and-surf seekers in their day-glo
and ponytails; for the designer fashion victims heading for the Chanel,
Louis Vuitton and Celine boutiques where assistants tot up your spending
power as you walk in and throw you an air-conditioned glare once they
realise you are only browsing; and for the young Japanese couples who tumble
out of white stretch limos for a quick wedding photo-session on the luxury
hotel lawn.
If they want a beach in Honolulu, they go to Waikiki, where surf-boarders
zip back and forth along the waves and men patrol the sands with metal
detectors in the hope of finding some rich woman's rock-encrusted jewellery.
Apart from the risk of losing your diamonds in the surf, Honolulu seems a
pretty quiet, safe place. The streets are spotless, thanks to a Dollars
1,000 fine.
The real debate is whether the 50th US state should become independent and
perhaps reinstate its monarchy. As royals go, the Hawaiian contingent seemed
to know how to enjoy themselves - the king and queen even had their own
surfing beach. Perhaps the Hawaiians are unaware of the hazards of a
modern-day monarchy, or perhaps it is just a canny way to pull the crowds
and boost tourism.
While Hawaii once thrived on whaling and then on agriculture, nowadays
tourism is seen as its salvation. One feels apprehensive: Honolulu has
already been spoiled and turned into a sort of Bond Street-sur-mer. One can
only hope that the other islands do not suffer the same fate.
On the island of Lanai, tourism has only just been introduced. Lanai, owned
by the Dole food company, once depended on its pineapple plantations. But it
could not compete with cheaper exporters, and the last pineapple crop was
harvested this year.
It is a sleepy one-town island. You drive past rugged mountains and moorland
until you reach the inappropriately named Lanai City, which consists of a
few neat rows of bungalows and a main square with a police station, bank,
theatre, and cafe overlooked by a tiny hostel.
Now, the islanders work as waiters and laundry staff in two luxury hotels
built by Dole, rather than in the pineapple fields. 'The new crop is
tourism,' laughs Sol Kahoohalahala, a director of cultural resources on the
island who is striving to preserve its culture and environment, much of
which has changed because of overgrazing by animals brought in by early
ranchers.
Hawaiians will tell you that each of the eight main islands has its own
character. Lanai is still a relatively unspoilt innocent. Big Island (known
simply as 'Hawaii') is 'very spiritual, lots of Californians go there to
meditate,' one woman told me. 'You can feel the energy as soon as you step
off the plane.' All I could feel was a blast of heat.
While much of Hawaii is rooted in the 20th century, Hawaiians still tend to
talk about its myths, legends and superstitions. On Big Island, with its
live volcanoes, people talk about Pele, the goddess of fire, and warn
visitors never to take any lava home because it will bring bad luck.
Every year the authorities receive post-bags full of chunks of lava returned
by tourists who regretted the consequences. In places, the lava is studded
with petroglyphs, drawings of stick people giving birth or sailing, as well
as dots and squiggles which are thought to represent messages about journeys
undertaken centuries ago.
Then there are the old burial sites. Some hotels have had to redesign their
buildings because foundation-digging has unearthed human bones. Priests have
to be called in to bless the site and settle the spirits.
Centuries ago, if you broke the law or committed something which was taboo,
you would be killed unless you could escape to the 'place of refuge' on Big
Island. For some, this involved running miles across land; for others, a
swim across shark-haunted waters.
Today there are no taboos, but thousands of athletes face an even worse
ordeal - the annual Ironman contest or triathlon, which combines a 2.4-mile
ocean swim, a 112-mile bike race and a 26.2-mile marathon.
Dominated by Californians, it can take anywhere from eight to 15 hours to
complete, after which the contestants usually collapse into the spiny
embrace of an intravenous drip to be rehydrated. It makes the earlier race
for the place of refuge sound easy.
Sara Webb travelled to Hawaii with American Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines.
She stayed at the Halekulani Hotel in Honolulu; the Manele Bay Hotel on
Lanai; and the Royal Waikoloan, Kohala Coast, Big Island.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Novelties have not worn off -
Clive Fewins visits a family business that has been big in party hats for 40
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They were in turmoil at Gaffney of Tiptree over what to wear at the family
party for Ted Gaffney's 70th birthday. Should it be the fireman's hats, or
the glitter crowns, Father Christmas masks, or stars and stripes bow ties?
Perhaps a combination of all these might be more suitable . . .
'In the event we'll probably settle for plain suits and dresses,' said
grandfather Gaffney, managing director of party novelty specialists Gaffney
of Tiptree. 'We don't like to be too outrageous - not in public, at least]'
The family business has specialised in the outrageous since the end of the
second world war when Bow-born Arthur Gaffney, then 47, had to find
something to make instead of pumps to remove the water from air raid
shelters.
The only material to hand was plywood. There were tons of off-cuts, scrap
from a local company that had made wooden wings for aircraft. Arthur started
making toys. he was joined in 1946 by his three sailor sons, Arthur, now 72,
Ted, 70, and Reg, now 67.
The quartet moved the business twice before moving 50 miles north of London
to a former builders' merchant's 16 acre site on the edge of the Essex fruit
growing village of Tiptree 18 years ago.
There they decided to concentrate on novelties. 'Cheap imported toys were
making our products less and less competitive. We had been building up our
stock of party lines and knew there was a good market for many of them,' Ted
said.
The workforce, full and part-time, numbers 120, and there are 200
outworkers.
'The quiet patch after the Christmas boom does not usually last very long,'
Ted said.
'At the end of November we had a rush for fairy wands and tiaras to be
delivered to theatre gift shops in advance of the pantomime season. As soon
as Christmas is over we shall have to gear ourselves up for Valentine's
Day.'
The Gaffneys supply many British stores with seasonal novelty items. They
claim to be the only UK company with an automated line manufacturing party
streamers, and their warehouse usually stocks 100m balloons.
'At peak times we pack 1m balloons a day,' said Ted. 'All our balloons come
from Mexico. They are among the 10 per cent of our lines that we import, but
they account for about 20 per cent of our turnover. Most other products we
make here, but because they are mostly cheap items, made of cardboard and
plastic, our profit on turnover is low - we aim at about 12 per cent.'
Last year was the best in the company's history. Turnover was Pounds 2.75m.
'In times like the present people often don't have the money for large items
such as holidays and cars, so they often spend their money on small
inexpensive things like our novelties,' Ted said.
'There is scarcely a day when we are not working on some new line,' said
Reg, who is chief ideas man and works closely with his son Raymond, 38, to
develop products.
The Gaffneys have lost count of their total lines, but a glance at their
multi-coloured catalogue reveals at least 500, if you can be bothered to
count. These all sell in shops under the Galaxy brand name, but a high
proportion of the output also sells under the own brands of many of the big
high street chains.
'Our association with Woolworths goes back 52 years. It was 1941 and the
bombs were dropping when a Woolworths buyer knocked on the door of dad's
original factory in Walthamstow to ask if there was anyone in the area who
made things for kids,' Ted said.
The brothers do not know what proportion of their products end up overseas,
except in the case of punchboards. They manufacture several hundred
different designs of these under the brand name Money Makers. These are
fund-raising devices used in clubs and by charities all over Europe, and are
made in nine languages.
In the late 1960s, when the Gaffneys were trying to get into punchboards
(originally a US idea), they had problems working out how to insert the
tickets into the boards. Ted went to Chicago and bought machines built in
the 1920s by associates of Al Capone. They are still functioning in the
Gaffney factory, and are lovingly maintained by the fifth male Gaffney in
the business, 43-year-old Paul, son of Arthur.
Irene, who is married to Ted, supervises the payroll and Arthur's wife
Louise, looks after the accounts.
Hats and other novelties form about 50 per cent of turnover. Of the other
novelties three of the biggest lines are tooters, blowouts and bubble kits.
The bubble filling department is one of the biggest in the factory. At peak
times there is a staff of 12, stirring the magic brew - there are 17
separate ingredients in the secret recipe - and packing the tubs into boxes.
'There used to be about 10 companies making bubble tubs in this country. Now
there's just us and one small competitor,' said Ted. 'We keep a careful eye
on him.'
Bubbles are a big spring line. Early in the new year a number of the
Gaffneys' staff will move into the bubble department to form a double shift.
'It is one of our lines that seems to just grow and grow,' Ted said.
'Sometimes we wonder when the bubble is going to burst.'

FT  18 DEC 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Programs to work out your taxes -
Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If self-assessment of income tax arrives as promised in 1996, we can be sure
that a clutch of helpful computer programs will follow. Some are already
with us. On the other hand, some of the software houses to which we might
expect to look for help, such as Intuit and Sage, hesitate to get involved
with this murky subject. I can see why.
A tax practitioner was quoted in the Weekend FT recently as saying: 'It is
amazing how intelligent people seem to have difficulty with their tax
returns.' Perhaps I might explain.
Sorting out the paper work and filling in a tax form is not particularly
difficult. Deadly, but not difficult: rather like doing the ironing. But
understanding a tax inspector's thought processes when the assessment comes
home, now that's another matter. Few of the figures on the assessment seem
entirely to match the ones I submitted. Why? What has happened to the
covenants? Why has part of my husband's personal allowance been transferred
'elsewhere', away from PAYE?
A tax accountant told me that his professional estimate of a client's tax
liability never turned out to correspond precisely with the official
assessment.
Similarly, when I tested five personal tax programs using the figures I had
submitted with our most recent tax returns, no two of them produced the same
answer.
Self-assessment is not going to work until the tax rules and their
application, however extensive and complicated, are as unambiguous as the
London street map or the rules of chess; and until a way is found to make
straight the paths leading from the tax return to the assessment.
The available computer programs fall into two categories: cheap and
expensive. The cheap ones cost Pounds 50 or less, the expensive ones about
three times as much. The difference lies in the greater sophistication of
the expensive ones, and in the fact that they have share portfolio modules
which will calculate capital gains tax as well as manage the lists of
dividends and tax credits.
A cheap program, the Consumers' Association's TaxCalc, came closest to the
right answer for our own tax liability (I think).
This program does not always get the press it deserves, because the
Consumers' Association will not send out review copies, and journalists do
hate paying for anything.
TaxCalc leads users in commendably clear fashion through the tax return. I
am sure its success at getting the answer stems from that clarity. It also
sets out its results clearly, and prints a report which you can sign and
submit as your return. An extra bonus: it runs from a single floppy disk.
There are drawbacks: you cannot update TaxCalc; next year, you will have to
buy it all over again. And you cannot enter the particulars of your income
in this program. You will have to go through the printed report at the end
and fill in the name and address of your employer and your building society,
the recipients of your charitable covenants and so forth. If you have a
substantial share portfolio, adding the names of the individual shares
afterwards to TaxCalc's list of dividends is not really practicable. But
even in that case, this program is an excellent way to check your tax
assessment.
PC Tax Adviser is another of the cheap programs. It does allow you to list
the sources of your income. They will be printed in the report, and you can
carry them forward to next year. I liked the way the program was set out.
But I had some trouble tailoring our information to fit Tax Adviser's
expectations - for example, we received both taxed and untaxed bank interest
in 1992-3; Tax Adviser did not like that.
The same problem arose with interest on gilts. This program still might be
worth a look if you have a share portfolio and your other tax requirements
are fairly simple.
Digita's Personal Tax Planner did somewhat better on categories of income.
It, too, will run from a single floppy disk. But the dull screens are hard
to use, and look at least five years out of date. Digita invites users to
classify income as 'Self', 'Wife' or 'Joint'. I am surprised the politically
correct have not caught up with them for that.
TaxCalc allows you to enter a figure for capital gains, and gives some
guidance on where to get advice on the subject. The current versions of Tax
Adviser and Personal Tax Planner leave capital gains tax out altogether.
The expensive programs are edging towards the sort of thing an accountant
might use. Vital Software's Tax Reckoner is an old friend; I have
recommended it before. A Windows version is planned for next year.
Microhelp's personal tax program is a newcomer, hived off from a suite of
programs developed for accountants.
Both are good; both are aware of the odder by-ways of the tax system, such
as the Rentaroom scheme; both produced answers quite close to the figure
TaxCalc and I judge to be right; both will keep track of share portfolios
from year to year, calculate capital gains, and relieve you of the dreaded
chore of typing lists of dividends and tax credits.
Microhelp will sell you a cheap version which will prepare the schedules to
attach to your income tax return, but will not calculate the tax due. That
could be a very good way to look at the program and decide whether you want
to go further.
If your affairs are complicated and you dislike turning the job over to a
professional adviser, you should consider one of these programs. But the
price does represent a considerable outlay, and, as with any tax program,
you will have to buy an annual update.
The small companies which market them do not offer the sort of security you
might have with a large software house - but then, there is not really much
security anywhere in the computer world.
All the programs mentioned run on IBM and compatible computers. All the
prices mentioned include VAT.
TaxCalc costs Pounds 19.99 to members of the Consumers' Association, Pounds
24.99 to everyone else. Tel: 0800-252-100.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Bequest might be too big
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife and I have no close relatives and are considering leaving our
estates to a small Baptist chapel of which we are members. But I am
concerned that the amount - roughly Pounds 275,000 - might be an
embarrassment because of the chapel's lack of experience in handling sums of
this size.
Would forming some sort of trust, to provide income, be the best way to
proceed? Are there any obvious difficulties to such a plan?
We understand that you are proposing to write your will so that all assets
pass to the surviving spouse, with the chapel receiving all the estate on
his or her death. Under these circumstances, there should be no inheritance
tax payable on the first death and, so long as the bequest is made to a
registered charity, no IHT would be payable on the death of the survivor.
In your wills, you could leave the estate in a trust on the death of the
surviving spouse. The trust could be a charitable one and would need to be
registered with the Charity Commissioners, having as its aims the provision
of income and capital, where necessary, to the chapel.
Selecting the trustees is crucial. Their duties include investing the
capital and paying income to the chapel. Also, they can be empowered to
advance capital to the chapel if authorised. Thus, it is important you are
satisfied the trustees would act responsibly.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wrong advice by tax office
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My tax office says the expiry of an unexercised traded option is not allowed
to be counted as a capital loss. But LTOM's Book of Traded Options implies
clearly that, for tax purposes, a capital loss arises on the date of expiry
of the option. Could you clarify this?
Your local tax office is talking nonsense. The rules for traded options
changed more than 13 years ago, in section 84 of the Finance Act 1980. The
present law, as re-enacted in section 144(4) of the Taxation of Chargeable
Gains Act 1992, says: 'The abandonment of . . . a traded option . . . shall
constitute the disposal of an asset (namely of the option).'
For the benefit of other people who may believe what taxmen tell them, you
should write to the District Inspector (marking both your letter and the
envelope 'For the attention of the District Inspector') asking him to draw
section 144(4) of the TCGA to the attention of the officer who misinformed
you.
On the expiry day, you had an allowable loss equal to the cost of the option
indexed from the month of purchase to the expiry month. This is also true
for London Stock Exchange traditional options. Because of Budget changes,
there will be no indexation relief for options expiring after November 29.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Reclaiming income tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife and I have established a discretionary trust, with our grandchildren
as the beneficiaries.
One of our sons works for an EU institution abroad and his children have
visited Britain only on holidays.
When they get income from the trust, can they claim back the income tax
already deducted from it, as their UK-resident cousins can do? If so, where
should their father apply for such repayment?
It appears that your grand-children are British citizens no matter where
they live. Thus, they are entitled to their annual personal allowance for
income tax.
It should be possible for them to claim back the tax deducted on payments
from the trustees. In order to do this, the trustees should supply the
children with a certificate showing tax deducted. This should be submitted
with a letter requesting a refund to Claims Branch, St John's House, Merton
Road, Bootle, Merseyside L69 9BP.
You will need to check the way in which the income distribution is taxed in
the country where the children are resident.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Peps: hijack or robbery?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GILBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are managed personal equity plans a good deal? Statistics suggest Pep
providers get more from running schemes than investors are receiving in tax
breaks.
Whitehall estimates the exchequer will lose only Pounds 150m in revenue from
Peps this financial year - cash which, largely, represents the savings to
investors from receiving company dividends tax-free. The savings are made up
of basic-rate tax credits which City institutions reclaim on behalf of their
Pep customers, plus the freedom from any further income tax enjoyed by those
who are 40 per cent taxpayers.
The amount seems small when set against the Pounds 14bn now estimated to be
invested in all Pep schemes, but it reflects two simple phenomena. The
dividend yield on ordinary shares is very low at present: those in the FT-SE
100 are yielding only 3.8 per cent gross. And the tax credit reclaimable on
company pay-outs is now only 20 per cent.
Shares worth Pounds 14bn now generate around Pounds 532m in gross dividends,
on which reclaimable tax credits amount to Pounds 133m. Take into account
the extra tax savings to higher-rate taxpayers and the Pounds 150m estimate
looks reasonable.
Around Pounds 7bn, half of the Pounds 14bn, is held by Pep investors
directly in company shares although the cash has to be channelled via a Pep
provider in a so-called 'managed Pep' rather than through unit and
investment trust Pep schemes. So, it is reasonable to assume that Pounds
75m, or 50 per cent of the Pounds 150m tax saving, flows to direct Pep
investors.
These select shares for themselves or allow the provider to do it for them.
Either way, providers levy an annual management charge - typically, 1 or
1.25 per cent of portfolio value (which makes many such Peps worthless for
basic-rate taxpayers now the tax credit has been cut). It is not hard to see
that, on the Pounds 7bn held by these investors, providers reap a handsome
harvest - revenues of Pounds 70m to Pounds 87.5m in annual fees alone.
The bounty hardly stops there. The Pep industry sometimes charges fees for
opening Peps, closing them, making cash withdrawals . . . just about
anything it can think of. According to some estimates, providers of direct
Peps get Pounds 100m in annual revenues while the investors who pay these
fees collect Pounds 75m in tax savings. Hijack or daylight robbery?
As for the other Pounds 7bn held via unit and investment trusts, many
managers make great play of charging no extra to Pep investors. Those in a
unit trust pay the same, via annual management charges and the bid-offer
spread, as a non-Pep investor. But if, as the providers always argue, Peps
are costly to administer, then are their non-Pep customers subsidising their
Pep clients?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors still choosing between business expansion schemes should be wary
of being caught by the end-December deadline. The Inland Revenue says that
for an investment to qualify for tax relief, the shareholding must be
entered on the company's register of members on or before December 31.
Investors who leave things to the last minute will depend on the efficiency
of the sponsors to ensure this is done. But since the amount raised has
accelerated in the past week, it suggests there are still many investors.
Industry analyst BESt Investment said Pounds 70m was raised last week and
Pounds 35m the week before. It estimated yesterday that arranged exit
schemes worth Pounds 120m were still available, of which Pounds 80m were top
quality.
It could be safer to send your cheque by courier or express service. Best
BES Advice, published by the Allenbridge Group, suggests checking first if
the issue has raised its minimum subscription: 'If an issue fails to reach
its minimum subscription, it will be unable to issue shares. By the time you
are notified, it may be too late to invest elsewhere in the BES market.'
Some sponsors have made special arrangements and many are keeping their
offices open this weekend. Johnson Fry will take telephone bookings up to
noon on December 31 but chairman Charles Fry expects all issues to be sold
out by then. The company launched its second Mortgage Express Super Growth
scheme on Thursday and had raised Pounds 2.5m of the Pounds 10m issue by
yesterday lunchtime.
The contracted exit price of 120p after five years for every 100p invested
equates to an annual return of 14.49 per cent to a higher-rate taxpayer
investing at the 99p subscription price up to December 23. The scheme will
acquire mostly repossessed properties from Mortgage Express, a subsidiary of
the TSB Bank, which is to fulfil the buy-back obligations of Mortgage
Express if ME does not. Minimum investment is Pounds 3,000.
MMI is running a BES collection service for investors in its schemes from
December 23 until December 30. This is available to those investing at least
Pounds 5,000. Close Brothers is also running a BES hotline.
Bristol Residences Companies, sponsored by Hodgson Martin, will finance
accommodation to be let on assured tenancies to students and staff of the
University of Bristol. The fixed exit price is 122p, equating to 14.3 per
cent to a higher-rate taxpayer. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
For further details of these schemes, ring Best BES Advice (071-409-1111)
and BESt Investment (071-936-2037).

FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: A new world of opportunity - John
Cuthbert looks at the mounting attractions of international growth unit
trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN CUTHBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years, buying an international growth unit trust meant geographical
diversification, with a dollop of Far East exposure thrown in for spice. Not
any more. Technology, increasing global competition and emerging stock
markets have shaped a new world of investment opportunity.
These changes have transformed the character of the international growth
sector. Trusts now come in three broad shapes and sizes: global growth,
emerging markets and specialist (from small companies to bio-technology).
The differences between the investment objectives, the managers' constraints
and the risks of these different types of international trust are now so
great that investors must take them into account when assessing past
performance. The best way to do this is to treat each of these three types
of separate classifications in their own right. For these reasons, we will
be reviewing the international growth sector in two parts*, starting with
global growth funds and following with emerging market and specialist funds.
This division also helps to redress the domination of the cumulative total
return tables by emerging market and specialist funds - a situation which
obscures the existence of a number of global growth performances of equal
worth.
The main aim of this review is to spotlight the funds with the best
historical performances. To do this, we have adopted three performance
standards. The first is the FT-A World ex-Japan index, which acts as our
benchmark for selecting the best performances. Only funds that have
outperformed this index in the four years to November 30 1993 are worth
considering.
We have selected the World ex-Japan rather than the FT-A World because the
high weighting and poor performance of the Japan market has acted as a
considerable drag on the World index. Thus, managers could have beaten the
FT-A World simply by underweighting Japan alone. How managers have reacted
to Japan is an important measure of their asset allocation skills but should
not be the overwhelming one.
A global growth fund could just as easily have beaten the benchmark by
exposure to the emerging markets. In fact, this is exactly what many funds
have tried to do, with trusts increasing their emerging markets holdings.
Baring Global, for example, has maintained a 25 per cent emerging market
weighting. Martin Currie International Growth has opted for even more. For
these reasons, performance assessment has to take risk into account. So, our
second performance standard is the ratio of a fund's risk to its return. The
figure for the FT-A World ex-Japan index is 0.21. Good fund managers must
aim to beat this.
This approach has produced dramatic results. Strong total-return performers
like Baring Global, Templeton Global, GAM International and GT
International, which are otherwise well-managed, are excluded from our
'magnificent seven' list because of their higher than average risk profiles.
On the other hand, Martin Currie and Framlington International Growth have
achieved high risk/return scores in spite of their higher risk. This is
evidence of managerial ability.
The final standard is consistent outperformance of the chosen benchmark.
Each fund's performance has been divided into four year-on-year total
returns. It is paramount that performance should be assessed in this way,
rather than on a cumulative basis.
In the past four years, most global funds have been very wrong on Japan. But
a four-year cumulative total-return figure does not show this because many
global funds also have a heavy UK weighting. The explosive performance of
the UK market in the past year has allowed many managers to catch up all
they have lost in the previous three.
Consistency is a way to measure the success of the manager's asset
allocation strategy. Like our other two measures, consistency is a measure
of manager ability.
In all, the international growth sector has 159 funds. We have surveyed the
80 or so of these which qualify as global growth funds with four-year
records, and the seven best performances are shown in our main table.
To these seven could have been added a further four. Rock Asset Managed,
Cannon Global, GA Growth Portfolio and GT International have all beaten the
benchmark on a total return and risk/return basis. In addition, there are
younger funds with risk/return performances that would have merited
inclusion here were it not for their youth. The best of these are Clerical
and Medical UK and Overseas, Newton General, Prosperity Global PEP, and
Smith &amp; Williamson Thorobred.
Although our top seven have been ranked on the basis of risk/reward scores,
these figures reflect different strengths and weaknesses. Framlington and
BOI Worldwide Opportunities, for example, have made their way into the top
seven despite their high risk ratings. But that is about all they have in
common.
Whereas BOI Worldwide has the most distinguished record of outperforming the
benchmark consistently, Framlington's stock-picking history has been a
roller-coaster ride. Interestingly, Framlington's strong 1991 performance
was the result of quality stock selections in the US market where most other
managers have failed to make headway.
BOI, by contrast, has done well in Hong Kong, another market where many
managers have fought shy. Also, it has maintained a very high exposure to
emerging markets; hence the high risk rating. Investors have been rewarded
for this risk; hence the high risk/return score.
Martin Currie International's calamity was to have been exposed to Latin
America when the Bolsa turned belly-up, and its 1991 record suffers as a
result. Otherwise, this is a slight blemish on a record which stands out for
many reasons - including getting Japan just about right.
The tactical emphasis of Scottish Equitable's Worldwide Tactical performance
trust is at once both the fund's strength and an insight into the sector's
most troubling weakness. Whereas most international growth funds maintain
some exposure to a core group of markets regardless, Scottish Equitable buys
only in those markets which it deems attractive.
The most striking statistic is the 1990 return of the Perpetual PEP Growth
and Income fund; that year, the World ex-Japan index lost 19.35 per cent and
the international growth sector followed suit. But Perpetual PEP Growth made
money out of a highly defensive UK equity strategy.
Indeed, like BOI British and Overseas and Newton, Perpetual maintains a
minimum proportion of the fund in UK equities. In part, its high risk/return
rating results from the UK's strong performance, but its steadiness is
helped also by success in the US and the Far East.

KEY TO TABLE: Years are November-to-November. NB The four year total is
based upon monthly percentage changes so does not sum to the four
year-on-year totals. The Benchmark column shows the arithmetic
difference between the fund's return and the index's return. The BM or
benchmark ratio expresses the percentage outperformance by the fund
over the four years. Risk is total risk or volatility. Total risk is
measured by the monthly standard deviation over four years to November
30. Risk relative to sector is each fund's standard deviation divided
by the sector's average standard deviation of 4.52. Risk/return is the
division of the four year average monthly total return by the four year
monthly standard deviation. Return data is offer-to-offer, net income
reinvested. Source: Hardwick Stafford Wright. Other calculations: J

FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Trapped in a company flat - The
Leasehold Act is creating a two-tier property market. Caroline Garnham looks
at dangers for some owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, was designed
to give people the right to buy a 90-year extension of their lease and the
right to band together with other tenants to acquire a building's freehold.
These rights are available if (1) you qualify under the Act; (2) the
property is a flat; (3) the rent is low; and (4) the lease is long.
Unfortunately, if you do not qualify under the Act, and your lease obliges
you to seek consent from your landlord for a sale or assignment, you could
discover that not only are these rights denied you, but also your lease may
be less marketable - and consequently less valuable - than you had thought.
What happens if the lease is owned by a tenant, such as a company, which
does not qualify under the Act, and this company wishes to sell the lease?
If the lease requires the landlord's consent on a sale, and the sale is to a
tenant who does qualify under the Act, such as an individual, then the
landlord can prevent the sale by refusing to give consent.
In most leases, landlord's consent cannot be withheld 'unreasonably'.
However, court decisions under earlier similar legislation have decided that
a landlord who withholds his consent in these circumstances may not be
acting unreasonably. For example, the landlord could reasonably argue that
giving consent would reduce the value of his interest in the building.
According to my colleague, George Littler, 'if landlords are able to
withhold consent in this way, the marketability of residential leaseholds
owned by corporate tenants will be restricted. This could depress their
values significantly in certain areas and could create a two-tier market in
residential leasehold property'.
But why would anyone wish to buy their flat through a company in the first
place?
Take Joe, for example. He was born and brought up in South Africa. He is
therefore treated as a non-UK domiciled person for tax purposes. This is a
particularly advantageous status which Joe was advised to maximise with
careful tax planning.
Inheritance tax, which is chargeable at 40 per cent on death, is charged
only on UK assets for people such as Joe. Although any flat he buys in the
UK is a UK asset, it can easily be converted into a non-UK asset if it is
bought through a non-UK registered company such as a Jersey company. This is
why Joe was advised to buy the 65 year lease of a flat in Chelsea through a
Jersey company.
When the flat was first bought, Joe's visits to the UK were well under 90
days a year and he had full time employment abroad. He was therefore
technically not resident in the UK, and the only tax he was advised to plan
to avoid was inheritance tax. His circumstances, however, changed a few
years later when he became UK resident. Because of his South African
origins, he remained non-UK domiciled and continued to retain a favoured tax
status.
He was then advised that as a UK resident he could become liable to capital
gains tax and income tax, but as a non-UK domiciliary, he could avoid these
taxes by putting his Jersey company into an offshore trust, which he did.
Joe wants to move. His trustees are happy for him to do so and have
instructed the Jersey company to sell. An English woman called Sally wants
to buy the flat but the lease requires the landlord's prior consent. The
landlord has refused this because, after Sally has occupied the flat for
three years, she will be entitled to buy an extended lease, and after she
has occupied for 12 months she would be able to participate in the
collective acquisition of the freehold.
What can they do? The landlord could not normally refuse consent if Sally
bought the flat through a company herself. However, if she did that she
could create for herself the following tax liabilities:
an income tax liability on the benefit of being provided accommodation by a
company. This charge is quite onerous especially if the purchase price is
more than Pounds 75,000;
if the acquiring company is a UK company, she will have created a double
capital gains tax charge. Tax will be charged once on the gain made by the
company and for a second time, when she liquidates, or sells, the company to
recover her funds. The tax would be based on the increase in value of her
shares. This could have been avoided if the flat had been bought by her as
her main, or her only, residence;
if the company is resident offshore, again she could have a double charge to
tax, under anti-avoidance legislation, and
she will not have improved her inheritance tax position.
Given these tax consequences, is there anything Sally could do?
Depending on the terms of the lease, it may be possible for Sally to buy
Joe's company or to form a company to buy the flat. Immediately thereafter,
the company could execute a declaration of trust to hold it on trust for
her.
The sale to Sally's company should not be refused consent by the landlord
because it is to another company, which will not qualify under the Act. The
subsequent declaration of trust is probably not an event which requires
landlord's consent, although a careful review of the lease will need to be
made to be sure.
Under this arrangement:
there will be no income tax charge under the benefit in kind legislation;
if the house is her main or only residence there will be no capital gains
tax charge on sale, let alone a double tax charge;
if Sally is not keen enough on the Chelsea flat to go to these lengths, she
would be well advised to look for another property, either a property owned
by a qualifying tenant or where the landlord's consent is not required.
In some areas of central London the corporate tenant market may be large
enough to ensure that the value of residential leasehold properties, such as
Joe's flat, is not greatly depressed. However, it may have an adverse effect
on property owned by a corporate tenant which is not in an area popular with
foreign buyers.
The Act will not, however, stop people like Joe planning to avoid tax since
problems created by the Act can quite easily be avoided by buying the flat
in your own name, as nominee for your tax efficient offshore company.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: When shoppers feel the pinch -
Bethan Hutton looks at the highs and lows of store credit offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With seven shopping days before Christmas, and only slightly longer to the
winter sales, the bank balances and credit card limits of dedicated shoppers
are feeling the strain already. As a result, customers may eye with special
interest those signs proclaiming: 'Open an account - spend Pounds 500
today]' or 'Buy now, pay July.' Store credit offers abound - but are they
worth it?
Retail credit falls into two main categories: store cards and loans. Store
cards are essentially in-house credit cards - you receive a monthly
statement and either pay the balance in full, avoiding interest charges, or
pay part and incur interest - but there are a few differences from cards
issued by banks and building societies.
First, no retailer has yet dared to charge an annual fee for its card,
although most credit cards these days cost around Pounds 10 a year. But
store cards make up for this by charging generally higher rates of interest.
So, if you always pay the balance in full, store cards are free to use.
If, however, you have a choice between using an ordinary credit card and a
store card, and you think you will not be able to pay in full first time,
you could be better off using the credit card - check the comparative
interest rates. Barclaycard charges 1.585 per cent a month but Burton's
store card charges at least 2 per cent.
Retailers also offer card-holders various incentives to stay loyal and
continue shopping in their outlets. New card-holders get 'welcome' offers,
such as a package of vouchers or 10 per cent off the first purchase with it.
Card-holders may also be invited to late-night shopping evenings and sale
previews, or get extra discounts at certain times. Such offers are obviously
designed to encourage more spending, but they can be valuable if used
intelligently.
Customers at two large retail chains, Marks and Spencer and the John Lewis
Partnership, have another reason for applying for a store card: neither
accepts credit cards, although John Lewis does now accept Switch debit
cards.
Some shops offer two types of card: option and budget. Option cards are
similar to credit cards; with budget cards, you agree to a certain monthly
payment and your credit limit is a multiple of that. If budget cards are
used as intended, you almost always pay interest, so they can be an
expensive way to shop.
Non-card credit offers by shops take several forms. Some are standard
personal loans: you borrow a certain amount at a fixed interest rate and
agree to pay it back over a period of months or years. These compare
directly to bank or building society loans, and you should shop around to
get the best deal before signing up for a shop's in-house offer.
More attractive are the 0 per cent finance and 'buy now, pay in July' type
of deals. It is difficult to find any objection to interest-free credit
offers (so long as the product to which they are attached is priced
competitively), but buy now, pay later schemes can have hidden drawbacks.
Basically, you pay a deposit and then nothing more until the balance is due
several months later. But you often have to fill out a credit agreement form
so that, if you do not pay the balance, monthly amounts become due and
interest is racked up at quite a steep rate. Make a note in your diary of
when the payment is due - you might not get a reminder.
These are some of the main store card groups (cards may bear the name of any
shop in the group):
Burton Group: (includes Debenhams, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Top Shop, Top
Man, Principles, Champion Sport). Charges 2 per cent monthly (APR 26.8) for
direct debits, 2.2 per cent (APR 29.8). Extra 10 per cent off for all or
part of sale period.
Dixons/Currys: Budget card charging 2.07 per cent a month, APR 27.8 for
direct debits; 2.37 per cent a month or APR 32.4 otherwise. Occasional
offers such as free videotapes with other purchases.
Harrods/House of Fraser: 2.2 per cent, APR 29.8. Late opening nights for
account-holders, gift vouchers if you spend a certain amount, and an extra
10 per cent off on the first day or first Saturday of the sale.
John Lewis: Lowest interest rate of all the storecards: 1.5 per cent a
month, APR 19.5. No special privileges for account-holders.
M&amp;S: 1.7 per cent (APR 22.4) if you pay by direct debit, 1.9 per cent (APR
25.3) otherwise. Card-holder evenings; free magazine (normally Pounds 1). No
extra discounts.
Sears (Selfridges, Miss Selfridge, Warehouse, Wallis, Richards; lots of shoe
shops including Dolcis and Saxone; Olympus sports shops; Adams childrens
wear etc). Direct debit payments 2.1 per cent (APR 28.9); otherwise 2.2 per
cent (APR 29.9). Holiday club with discounts for card-holders, plus special
events. Also separate Selfridges Gold card with lower interest rates.
Storecard: (BHS, Mothercare, Habitat, Richards, Blazer). Direct debit
payments 1.95 per cent a month (APR 26), otherwise 2.15 per cent (APR 29).
Periodic discount offers, special evenings for card-holders etc.
Timecard: (Comet, B&amp;Q, Woolworths, Next, among others). Direct debit
payments 1.7 per cent (APR 22.4), non-direct debit, 1.87 per cent (APR
24.9). Discount vouchers and other offers.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The five-year price chart for Betterware is a technical analyst's dream.
Having risen strongly and steadily through 1991/92, shares levelled off and
went sideways until August this year, since when they have collapsed
dramatically. The period of underperformance came not long after the Cohen
family sold 13.3m shares at 230p, having previously indicated it was
unlikely to reduce its stake. This factor, and the fact that UK growth
clearly is slowing, gave the bears an ideal opportunity to hit the price.
At the beginning of November, managing director Andrew Cohen bought 400,000
shares from fellow director John Lloyd at 196p, but this did little to stem
the flow. The recent purchases were made by three directors, including the
chairman and finance director, at 142p. Between them, the Cohens retain more
than 45m shares.
Regular readers will recognise the name of Richard Peskin, chairman and
managing director of Great Portland Estates, one of the UK's larger property
companies. He has been a consistent and regular supporter of his shares. His
first purchase dates back to August last year: just 104p for 115,000. Since
then the price has recovered strongly, and Peskin is now selling 750,000 at
225p. Although he retains 2.1m, there is little doubt that the move to take
profits in the property sector is gathering pace.
Nor is it particularly surprising to see profits being taken at SG Warburg
Group: chairman Sir David Scholey has sold 112,000 shares at 884p. The price
has more than doubled since September last year on the back of strongly
rising equity markets, not just in the UK but internationally. Brokers have
been raising forecasts for Warburg and many of its peers in the merchant
bank sector, and expectations are running high.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Now Ernie could make you a million -
Premium bonds respond to lottery challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN

<TEXT>
Ernie could be creating the fastest millionaires in the west (or east) when
April comes around. The top monthly premium bond prize, selected by the
Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment, is to be quadrupled to Pounds
1m.
The change is seen widely as a response to the threat of the national
lottery (although this is denied by National Savings, which runs Ernie; it
claims the change was a necessary updating of the system). The lottery, due
to start late in 1994 or early 1995, is expected to offer prizes of several
million pounds.
From April, Ernie will have no weekly draw. The monthly draw will include
two prizes of Pounds 100,000, three of Pounds 50,000, four of Pounds 25,000
and 10 of Pounds 10,000. There will be no change in the distribution of
smaller prizes (from Pounds 50 to Pounds 5,000).
The annual yield on the fund rises slightly from 5 to 5.2 per cent,
increasing its attraction for those who can buy the maximum holding of
Pounds 20,000. Premium bond winnings are tax-free. In addition, the waiting
period for bonds to enter the prize draw is being reduced from three months
to one month. Bonds bought in January and February will qualify.
Meanwhile, following the base rate change, National Savings is reducing the
rates offered on its savings products The main changes are:
A new 41st issue of fixed rate certificates, paying 5.4 per cent tax-free if
held for five years. The same rates apply to the Yearly Plan. The old 40th
issue paid 5.75 per cent.
The 7th issue of index-linked certificates will pay a tax-free return of
inflation, plus 3 per cent, if held for five years. The 6th issue offered
inflation plus 3.25 per cent.
First option bonds will pay a taxable 6 per cent if held for 12 months.
Those who buy more than Pounds 20,000 of bonds will get 6.4 per cent. The
old rates (which will continue to be paid on bonds bought before December
16) were 6.34 per cent and 6.74 per cent respectively.
A new Series H of capital bonds will pay a taxable 7.25 per cent if held for
five years. The old Series G paid 7.75 per cent.
Issue F of children's bonus bonds will pay 7.35 per cent tax-free if held
for five years. Issue E paid 7.85 per cent. The new maximum holding limit is
Pounds 1,000 which can be bought on top of holdings in previous issues.
From January 1, the investment account will have three tiers: a taxable 5.25
per cent for deposits under Pounds 500; 5.75 per cent for Pounds 500 to
Pounds 24,999; and 6 per cent for Pounds 25,000 and above. Old rates varied
from 6.25 to 6.5 per cent.
From January 29, the income bond will pay a taxable 6.5 per cent or 6.75 per
cent for holdings over Pounds 25,000. The old rates were 7 and 7.25 per cent
respectively.
Finally, the general extension rate, which applies to matured certificates,
falls again, to 3.51 per cent. Investors should remember to withdraw their
money, or re-invest in new certificates.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Grim litany of pension faults
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pilot study of the way in which pensions were sold to people
transferring out of employers' schemes, published this week by the
Securities and Investments Board, makes grim reading. It shows a
disturbingly widespread failure by advisers and sales agents to get enough
information - particularly about the employers' schemes - to be able to give
good advice.
Overall, the report found fault with nine out of 10 pension transfers. KPMG
Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm which carried out the study, found just
one in 20 files to be satisfactory in cases dealt with before regulators
issued guidance about how to conduct the business properly.
The guidance, issued by different regulators between July 1992 and March
this year, did lead to some slight improvement. Even so, the fact that
four-fifths of cases still failed to meet regulatory standards underlines
the scale of the problem.
This does not mean that four-fifths of the 500,000 pension transfers carried
out over the past five years or so came from bad advice: in some of these
cases, at least, the right advice could well have been given - even though
there is no sign now that proper information was sought on which to base it.
Since the extent of the problem became clear, the SIB has been urging people
who transferred out of employers' pension schemes not to panic. Chairman
Andrew Large said many people had been in touch with the regulators and
emphasised that an urgent review was under way. All those who had lost out
because of bad advice would be compensated fully.
Large added: 'Unless people particularly wish to do so, there is no need to
take any action now. If you do feel anxious and wish to take some action,
you can write to the compliance officer of the firm from which you bought
the pension transfer, or the adviser who arranged it, stating your
complaint.'
While it could well take a couple of years to review all the cases where
people may have been advised wrongly, all should be sorted out well before
most retired.
The SIB's action is also directed at preventing such abuse in future. But in
the couple of months or so before new rules and standards are in place,
sales agents and advisers can continue to carry out pension transfer
business if they want to - and, more to the point, if anyone wants to buy.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Your starters for '94 - Philip
Coggan asks stockbrokers for their trust predictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stockbrokers can be right after all. Last year, the Weekend FT asked four
private client brokers to select three unit or investment trusts for 1993.
All picked portfolios which outperformed the All-Share index, even allowing
for dividend income, and three beat the sector average for investment
trusts.
It was a very good year for owners of investment trust shares. The FT-A
investment trust index has risen 39.2 per cent to date, benefiting from a
narrowing discount and the strong performance of overseas stock markets.
Even so, our experts, who produced returns ranging from 26.8 to 58.1 per
cent, did extremely well. Thus encouraged, we asked them to repeat the
exercise for 1994.
Paul Killik, of Killik &amp; Co, was the top performer for 1993. He says:
'Having focused on the UK market for 1993, I am introducing a stronger
international flavour for 1994. With higher income trusts looking expensive,
I have given income a lower priority.
'Once again, I am leading with Law Debenture. The trust offers an attractive
combination of a yield only slightly below the market, a broad international
spread of investments with 37 per cent overseas, and a first class record of
asset growth. The published premium to asset value is misleading as it
places no value on the company's fiduciary business. The trust, managed by
Henderson Touche Remnant, is Pep-qualifying.
'Pantheon International Participations would be classed as a higher risk
holding because it involves investment in unquoted companies. However, as
the trust invests in other venture capital funds, rather than directly into
the companies themselves, the assets are very broadly spread. With 47 per
cent in the UK and 45 per cent in the US, I consider Pantheon an attractive
vehicle in which to participate in the recovery of smaller unquoted
businesses.
'The ordinary shares of TR Technology are a more speculative investment as
they are considerably geared. The trust invests in international high
technology companies and has 47 per cent in the UK and 43 per cent in the
US. It is due to be wound up in 1998, and zero and stepped preference shares
have first call on the assets, at a cost of Pounds 258m. The whole trust is
valued at about Pounds 265m and the excess is available on wind-up to the
36m ordinaries' (ie around 20p per share at present).
The selections of Edwin Lilley, of Bell Lawrie White, have produced a return
of 52 per cent. Lilley says: 'I have a curious sense of deja vu as I look
forward to 1994.
'Most of our hopes for 1993 have yet to be fulfilled - Japan and large
tracts of Europe are in recession, while the improvement in the US and UK
has been sluggish at best, and real interest rates are still too high.
Against this background the selections for last year could still do well in
1994.
'However, my selections start with Monks Investment Trust. It is difficult
to ignore the large generalists and Monks remains among my favourites.
Baillie Gifford comes across as a fairly conservative house but it is
prepared to take big bets within Monks, both at the stock and country level.
Intelligent use of gearing has also consistently enhanced the growth in
assets and has helped on the revenue side. A sound core holding.
'The emphasis in Murray Smaller Markets has been switched back to smaller
and less accessible markets, with exposure to Japan and the US now almost
negligible. The smaller markets in Asia and Latin America now account for
nearly half of the portfolio. It almost falls into the emerging markets
category, but the manager has the freedom to move back into larger markets
if circumstances dictate. This flexibility gives the trust a distinct
advantage over the emerging market specialists.
'Fleming Far Eastern provides exposure to the Far East, including Japan. It
invests, therefore, in some of the most dynamic regions in the World. Japan
is a problem area, but one cannot discount the possibility that the
authorities will take further measures to stimulate the economy. Fleming has
an established reputation for investment in this area.'
Brian Tora, of Greig Middleton, whose selections rose 45.1 per cent, feels
inclined 'to play the geographic game, backed with management I feel I can
rely on.'
Tora says: 'If Europe does come out of recession next year, then the
continental bourses may have further to go, so I would plump for Fidelity
European Values. In Anthony Bolton, it has one of the most respected
European fund managers. The fund has large concentrations in the more
familiar markets of France, Holland and Germany but is also invested in
peripheral areas, such as southern Europe, and has a heavy weighting in
Scandinavia.
'The recently issued Fleming Chinese Fund could also be added to a
portfolio, providing the investor has either banked some of the gains
achieved last year or is able to sit out the short-term fluctuations that
might arise. If like me, you believe the capitalist revolution in China is
unstoppable, then this has to be an integral part of any long term growth
portfolio.
'Finally, for those with a nose for special situations, the Sphere
Investment Trust income shares look interesting at their price of 41p. The
trust yields 9.5 per cent, so at least it should pay its way. If the stock
market continues its upward path, there could be a useful gain from the
gearing element. Of particular interest, however, is the fact that the trust
has only 18 months left to run. Already, we are seeing an increasing number
of restructurings as fund managers seek to retain the money they have been
managing. It would not surprise me if something similar happened to Sphere.
'
The first pick of Nigel Sidebottom, of Gerrard Vivian Gray (who managed 26.8
per cent from his 1993 picks), is a Lloyd's vehicle, Premium Trust, which
was launched in December in parallel with its sister company, Premium
Underwriting. Sidebottom says: 'Premium Trust raised Pounds 19.8m but
benefits from a Pounds 12.2m free loan from Premium Underwriting. In return
for the loan, PT's capital is pledged to Lloyd's to enable PU to increase
its underwriting capacity.
'The attraction of this arrangement for PT is the benefit of the interest
free loan. The effective cost of the loan is the risk that the capital will
be called to cover Lloyd's losses incurred by PU. However, shareholders in
PT can be comforted by the fact that PU will reserve a third of underwriting
profits against future losses.
'PT will be managed by Martin Currie, which will pursue a similar investment
strategy to that adopted for Securities Trust of Scotland - namely, an
international portfolio providing an above average income. PT is trading on
a wider discount than Securities Trust.
'The market is, therefore, putting no value on the interest free loan,
despite the yield enhancement of around 3-5 per cent and the gearing effect
if assets rise. In my view, the shares should trade at a premium to asset
value.'
For his second choice, Sidebottom picks the zeros of Gartmore Shared Equity.
'With interest rates still falling, net returns from cash deposits and gilts
hold little attraction. Zero dividend preference shares are still a must for
taxpayers who are not making full use of their annual CGT allowance, and are
wary of committing too much money to the equity market.
'The Gartmore zeros redeem on April 30 2002 at a price of 198.8p, and the
final redemption value is already covered over 1.2 times. If held to
redemption, the shares will provide an annual compound growth of 7.9 per
cent. The trust's underlying portfolio would have to fall by 17 per cent
between now and April 2002 before the return from the zeros would be
diminished.
'Emerging market funds had an excellent run in 1993 but still have plenty to
offer. With individual markets highly volatile, one should select a well
managed global fund such as Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets.
'At the year-end, the trust had 37 per cent in the Far East with the largest
holdings being in Malaysia, South Korea and Hong Kong, the latter being used
primarily as a means of gaining exposure to China. Around 36 per cent of the
portfolio was in Latin America, with the largest holdings in Mexico and
Argentina.
'The shares trade at a premium to asset value but alternatives, such as
Templeton Emerging Markets, are on even greater premiums.'

FT  18 DEC 93 / Markets: Dow surges on while others languish - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The good economic news keeps coming, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
keeps setting new record highs, but anxiety on Wall Street about the
condition of equity markets continues to cast a shadow over the final weeks
of 1993.
The economic fundamentals remain positive, with this week's statistics
suggesting that growth is steadily accelerating. Industrial production in
November rose 0.9 per cent, a stronger than expected gain and the six
straight monthly increase in the output numbers. Also, housing starts rose
3.9 per cent last month, weekly unemployment claims fell in early December,
and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported that manufacturing activity in
its region has been extremely robust lately.
This array of confidence-boosting data propelled the Dow to an all-time high
of 3,764.43 on Monday. That, however, was not as impressive as it looked.
Gains in just two stocks - IBM and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing -
accounted for almost half of the day's 24-point gain, and three other
stocks, Alcoa, International Paper and Du Pont, contributed the rest.
Moreover, while the Dow was reaching new highs, the rest of the market was
languishing. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, a much broader measure of market
performance, rose less than two points on Monday and remained below its
record peak, while the Nasdaq composite index fell.
This divergence between the large-capitalised stocks that make up the Dow
and the rest of the market - in particular the indices that track the
performance the shares of small-and medium-sized companies - is cause for
concern among analysts. Some believe that the market has been undergoing a
corrective phase for the past two months, but that it has escaped almost
everyone's notice because the Dow has performed so well.
Since mid-October, the Dow has climbed 3 per cent, and regularly moved into
previously unexplored territory. Yet, over the same period, the S &amp; P 500
has fallen about 1 per cent, the Nasdaq composite almost 4 per cent, and the
Russell 2000 index 3.5 per cent. All three remain below their all-time
highs. In the past, when the Dow has continued to rally to peaks while
other, broader indices have lagged, it has been the sign of an exhausted
bull market.
The weakness in secondary stocks has taken its toll on the market for
initial public offerings, or company flotations. This week several IPOs of
small, growth-oriented companies were postponed at the last minute, with
underwriters citing 'unfavourable market conditions' as the reason for the
hasty withdrawal.
Although a rash of pulled IPOs might be viewed as evidence that the market
has overreached itself (the theory being that conditions in the IPO market
have deteriorated because investor accounts, already full-to-the-brim with
new stock, are being much choosier about which new issues they should buy),
there may be another explanation for all the postponements.
The underwriting calendar, which is normally quiet at this time of the year,
has remained unusually active this month, and underwriters are finding that
there are simply too many IPOs for investors to handle. So companies have
been shelving flotation plans, but most will probably return to the market
in early 1994, when they expect demand from investors to remain strong.
If a deterioration in the IPO market is not on the cards, what might be
lurking around the next corner that could trigger the sharp correction in
the Dow that the weakness in secondary stocks has suggested may be imminent?
Perhaps a foreign political crisis? Although the Dow set a record high on
Monday, it fell 50 points in the next two sessions, and traders blamed the
losses on nervousness about the situation in Russia, where
ultra-nationalists won a large share of the vote in last weekend's
parliamentary elections.
The nationalist party's leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, has pledged to rebuild
Russia's armed forces, has talked of reviving the nation's expansionist
ambitions and has made threatening comments about Russia's neighbours. This
kind of talk makes US investors nervous, even if the far right in Russia is
unlikely to hold the reins of power in the new parliament.
And if developments in Russia do not trigger a panic, the situation in North
Korea, which continues to make belligerent noises about South Korea, could,
if it deteriorates any further, prove sufficiently disturbing to set off a
stampede of selling. This may not be a particularly festive thought, but for
the stock market Christmas has often been the season - the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan, the start of the Iran-Iraq war - of nasty external shocks.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Markets: The Bank flexes its muscles - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the season of hopefulness. A time to believe in fairy godmothers,
Father Christmas and a brighter future. If there be cynics among us, let
them wait until the new year to mutter 'humbug'.
So let us suspend our disbelief and look to a golden future, when Tiny Tim
does not die and the Footsie index reaches 3,500 by the end of January.
It has been an extraordinary week. The chance of peace in Northern Ireland,
a Gatt agreement which offers the prospect of growing, harmonious world
trade - unless you happen to be a South Korean rice farmer - and economic
numbers appearing to promise that disinflationary growth can be a reality.
And the Footsie rose 75.8 points over the week to close at another record,
3,337.1. Inflation for the year to November is steady at 1.4 per cent with
the underlying rate at 2.5 per cent, the lowest for 25 years.
Unemployment has fallen again, to its lowest level for 15 months. The
Confederation of British Industry asserts that order books are improving.
On top of all this, there are hopes of a base rate cut in everyone's
Christmas stocking, with the prospect of more to come in the new year.
No wonder then that the Footsie index has reached new highs, breaching the
3,300 mark and promising to carry on upwards. Many strategists are looking
for the index to reach 3,500 by the summer. If that becomes the consensus
view, the market will get there much sooner.
But, wait. What is this grim spectre rattling his chains, padlocks and money
boxes. Not Jacob Marley, but Rupert Pennant-Rea, deputy governor of the Bank
of England.
Pennant-Rea raised the spirit of Christmas Past - our old enemy,
stagflation. That ugly combination of a stagnant economy and high inflation.
If the spirit of Christmas Future is to be disinflationary growth - and some
economist needs to think up a catchier name for this cheerful idea - then,
Pennant-Rea warned industry this week, it should not raise prices but go for
volume growth instead.
The penalty of not doing as he asks could be a rise in base rates.
Pennant-Rea was flexing the Bank's semi-independent muscles.
Perhaps he was observing the 1.8 per cent drop in manufacturing input prices
in the year to November and the 3.6 per cent rise in output prices over the
same period.
The gap might suggest a little margin rebuilding has been going on. But with
demand in the economy weak, price increases in the UK will be hard to
achieve - even if exporters do appear to have taken advantage of sterling's
weakness to raise prices.
In the longer term, though, industry will refrain from increasing prices
only if there is a huge cultural change after such a long spell of
inflation. After years of recession companies want or need to widen margins.
And after years of cost-cutting, price increases are the attractive option.
If cost-cutting and investment to improve efficiency are to be the means of
raising margins, then unemployment could remain high.
If the economy truly is entering a new, golden era of low inflation and
growth, perhaps margins do not need to be as wide as they have been in the
past. But the market will need some convincing.
One sector which has embraced the Pennant-Rea philosophy already is food
retailing. Prices have been cut to try to increase volume, although there is
little evidence that the trick has worked.
Profits are under pressure - as Asda admitted yesterday - and, as the chart
shows, the sector is one of the worst performers of the year. So much, says
the market, for going for volume and not price.
By contrast, the merchant banks are one of the best-performing sectors. They
have managed to increase volumes without cutting prices. And a look at the
Trafalgar House rights issue this week - that unhappy company's third in two
years - shows just how lucrative the business is. Of Pounds 425m raised,
Pounds 404m went to the company itself. The other Pounds 21m was swallowed
by 'expenses.'
While merchant banks prosper, so do investment managers.
Results from M &amp; G for the year to September showed funds under management
rose by 45 per cent. Shareholders benefited, too, with a 36 per cent rise in
the final dividend planned. Net assets at Electra, the venture capitalists,
rose by 23 per cent over the year.
Shareholders in regional electricity companies have also seen a continuation
of the trend to big rises in interim dividends, although many companies have
warned investors that at least part of the rise was to re-balance the two
half-yearly payments.
Elsewhere, the trend of corporate news has been bad. As well as Trafalgar
House's miseries - a loss of Pounds 347m after property write-downs and
exceptional costs totalling Pounds 397m, and a cut dividend - Fisons, the
pharmaceutical group has been in the wars again.
There have been a number of boardroom departures. Chief executive Cedric
Scroggs was sacked this week after refusing to resign. Patrick Egan,
chairman, said instead of profits forecast at Pounds 100m the company would
only break even.
Dorling Kindersley, the publisher which floated last year, issued its second
profit warning in a fortnight and waved goodbye to its managing director.
Pentos, the Dillons bookshop group which last month replaced Terry Maher as
chairman with Sir Kit McMahon, former deputy governor of the Bank of
England, warned of 'substantial losses.'
But corporate gloom need not dominate. The real world takes a while to catch
up with what the market anticipates. And the market clearly believes in a
golden future.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Markets: Three cheers for the good guys - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The press spends so much time criticising the financial services industry
that it is nice, for once, to be able to give an unreserved welcome to a
change in business practice.
Two building societies, the National &amp; Provincial and the Leeds, committed
themselves this week to transfer all savers in obsolete accounts into
up-to-date accounts, paying higher rates of interest. The transfer will
occur automatically and should be completed by March (at N&amp;P) and May (at
the Leeds).
The naive might have assumed that this practice would be commonplace; after
all, building societies are supposed to be owned by their members. But when
the subject comes up, most societies tend to mutter darkly about the costs
involved.
There are two elements to these costs. The first is the administratively
burdensome business of writing to all depositors to tell them when new
accounts are opened, and of writing to holders of obsolete accounts to
persuade them to transfer.
National &amp; Provincial has been through this process already. In 1991, it
established a 'Bee Guided' initiative with a freephone line giving advice
and information; it also wrote to every saver.
The certainly results were impressive. When the initiative started, an
amazing 64 per cent of N &amp; P savers had obsolete accounts; by December 1993,
the number had fallen to 25 per cent.
The second element of the cost is the extra interest which must be paid to
those who switch accounts. This is a hefty bill. According to N&amp;P, some
Pounds 20bn is invested in obsolete accounts, saving banks and building
societies around Pounds 800m a year in interest.
N&amp;P says it has around Pounds 380m in such accounts, spread across 600,000
savers; at the Leeds, 1m customers have Pounds 450m in out-of-date accounts.
And some of these accounts are very long-standing indeed; the Whitehaven Old
Series, for example, pre-dates the second world war and pays 0.5 per cent a
year gross to its 13 savers.
All the account-holders who are transferred will be better off, either by
receiving a higher interest rate or better terms and conditions. Savers can
keep special features of old accounts, such as the ability to pay standing
orders. The Leeds says savers can even keep their old passbooks, if they
wish.
These changes will be expensive for the two societies involved: Leeds said
it would cost Pounds 4.5m in the year to end-September 1994 and Pounds 6m in
the following year; N&amp;P said it would cost up to Pounds 5m a year in extra
interest.
So, what about these costs? The first thing to note is that this change is
providing a benefit to some (but not all) of a society's members, which
seems to be the point of running a building society in the first place.
Furthermore, cost does not deter societies from expensive, generic
advertising campaigns which are of dubious benefit to their members.
It is possible to argue that, by attracting new savers through advertising,
the society might benefit from economies of scale; but it is by no means
true that the size and efficiency of societies are correlated directly.
What is much more likely is that a larger society means larger salaries for
the executives involved.
One could also argue that, without public name awareness, societies might so
dwindle in size that the safety of depositors' money could be affected. But
other factors - such as poor judgment of loan risk - are likely to be far
more important.
The low rates on obsolete accounts are, of course, used by the societies to
subsidise the rates paid to other depositors. So, it could be argued that,
if all societies followed the lead of N&amp;P and the Leeds, savings rates would
have to be cut for the mainstream accounts.
Why, after all, should those savers who do keep track of their money be
penalised in order to reward those who cannot be bothered?
It is certainly true that many of the obsolete accounts will involve small
sums (800,000 of those at the Leeds have less than Pounds 10 deposited).
People probably have moved house and forgotten about the old account; or
they have died and their relatives are unware that it exists.
Nevertheless, some of the account-holders will be the elderly or disabled
who may not be able to make regular trips to their branches to keep up to
date with account changes. They may depend heavily on the interest they earn
from their savings.
Furthermore, building societies have such a good public image that some
people may honestly believe that 'those nice folk at the society' would not
allow them to be disadvantaged.
Such savers deserve to be protected and one can only applaud 'those nice
folk' at the N&amp;P and the Leeds for taking the right action.
If other societies follow suit, and savings rates do fall marginally across
the industry, at least savers have the option of switching their funds into
National Savings or unit trusts.
They should even consider the obscure-sounding (but lucrative) world of zero
coupon shares, which offer yields of 7-8 per cent, tax-free, for those
people who do not use up their annual capital gains tax allowance.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Markets: A slip from the leading edge - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Becoming one of the stock market's glamour stocks can be a double-edged
experience - as Peter Gill, finance director of Dorling Kindersley Holdings,
freely concedes. The publisher, which produces illustrated reference books
and futuristic multi- media products, had seen its share price more than
double from last October's flotation price of 165p. However, the shares
dropped nearly 30 per cent on Wednesday, after the group announced the
departure of its managing director and gave its second profits warning
within a fortnight. So what has gone wrong with this former wonder stock?
The company blames continuing computer problems at its distributor, Tiptree
Books, which is owned by Random House, the US publisher, and a slow take-off
for DK Education, which supplies teaching packages to schools. Tiptree says
deliveries are now up to date and it will contest the legal claim which
Dorling Kindersley is preparing. Whatever the outcome of litigation, there
is no doubt that Dorling Kindersley did suffer - along with other book
publishers - after Tiptree installed a new computer in July. Dorling
Kindersley can hardly be criticised for using Tiptree, which was named
distributor of the year at the British Book Awards in February - at the same
time Dorling Kindersley was named publisher of the year. However, the group
seems to have been slow to grasp the seriousness of the problem, and is
still unable to quantify its impact.
Although Peter Kindersley, chairman, said it would be wrong to blame Dorling
Kindersley's problems on Richard Harman, the departing managing director, it
was significant that he emphasised that Harman's successor, Rod Hare, was 'a
particularly effective hands-on manager, with a thorough knowledge of the
business.'
Even if the group was guilty of taking its eye off the ball, Dorling
Kindersley's biggest problem this week has been the puncturing of inflated
expectations. This particularly related to its pioneering role in
multimedia, using CD and computer technology to combine text, images and
sound.
Analysts - and journalists - are intrigued, while financial institutions are
keen to have some stake in what could clearly be the next information
revolution. Unfortunately, there are few quoted vehicles in this field, so
Dorling Kindersley's flotation could scarcely have been better timed.
The fact that a 20 per cent stake in the group is held by Microsoft, Bill
Gates's US computer software group, did nothing to lessen City interest.
The intermediaries element of last October's offer was six times
oversubscribed, and 12 months later the shares were selling on an incredible
multiple of 35 times historic earnings. Such a sky-high rating leaves no
room for disappointment, and the market's reaction to recent bad news has
been predictably dramatic.
Gill, who joined as finance director in August, says the group understands
its core books business well and can reliably predict future revenue, in
spite of a one-off problem such as Tiptree, which in any case only handles
about 20 per cent of group sales. The unpredictability arises in its new
businesses such as DK Education, which has been slower than expected to take
off, and - above all - in multimedia.
Dorling Kindersley says about 10m computers capable of running multimedia
programmes will be delivered worldwide next year. DK's first title, Musical
Instruments, published by Microsoft last year in the US and now selling for
Pounds 49 in the UK, has already won four international awards. The
potential is clear, but Gill says it is difficult to tell when revenue will
arrive.
This week's warning that pre-tax profits for the year to next June would be
less than the Pounds 9.65m achieved last time puts the shares, after a small
recovery, on a forward multiple of 23 times earnings - still hefty premium
to the market.
Many investors have been attracted by DK's beautifully illustrated books and
high-tech potential, but have baulked at the share price. For brave hearts
who like quality and can afford a punt on information trends, this week's
fall offers a buying opportunity.

The Guinness Mahon private banking group is issuing its customers with
cheques incorporating a hologram as a security feature, the first bank in
Europe to do so. Holograms prevent the cheques being copied on colour
photocopiers, a tool increasingly used by fraudsters. Other security
features, including tamper-proof inks, will help prevent alteration of

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 36 per cent increase in the final dividend meant that the results of fund
management group M&amp;G were well received by the markets this week. The group
has benefited from the strength of world stock markets and from a revival in
its own relative investment performance, since sterling left the Exchange
Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday. M&amp;G follows a value approach to
stock-picking which does badly in recessions. However, the company's
consistency is reflected, not only in the performance of its unit trusts,
but in its dividend paying record; the payout has increased eightfold since
1984.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock market index continued to soar, hitting record

FT  18 DEC 93 / A life of sex, food and fighting: Cock-fighting is legal,
with a mass following in many places. Nicholas Woodsworth meets breeders and
punters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bobby Fernandez, Rolly San Juan and I were sitting at the back of the
Country Chicken Restaurant in Pasonanca, a suburb of Zamboanga City in the
south Philippines. Bobby's wife owns the place, so we were doing pretty much
as we pleased: telling stories, helping ourselves from a bottle of Johnny
Walker sitting on the table, and working our way through huge plates of
fried chicken.
Rolly is a columnist for the Zamboanga Morning Times, and gets around. He is
a keen political observer, an inveterate sports addict, a gambler, an
admirer of women and a collector of anecdotes. He was telling us about the
first time he had seen the infamous 'Henny' in action in a cock-fight in
Cebu. A new breed of fighting cock imported from the US, the Henny had taken
Filipino cock breeders, punters, and especially the cocks themselves, by
surprise.
'The local champion struts into the pit, and what does he see?' said Rolly
with a smile. 'Not the usual opponent with neck flexed and hackles
bristling, but what appears to be a docile grey hen staring at him with
lovestruck eyes.'
'Naturally he completely forgets that he is a total killing machine, strolls
around behind the Henny, and prepares to do what cocks do best after
fighting. And then - POW] - like lightning the Henny turns round, sidesteps
him, and sinks three inches of steel into his ribcage. The champ keels over
stone dead. The Henny is not a hen at all, but a cock bred by the Americans
to look like a hen.'
Bobby Fenandez laughed, but he and Rolly sat mulling over the story, a
perfectly true one, with more than casual interest. It is not because his
wife runs a chicken restaurant that Bobby will sit up night after night with
friends discussing the finer points of man's feathered friend. Like Rolly,
like thousands of inhabitants of Zamboanga, like millions of enthusiasts all
over the Philippine archipelago, Bobby is a 'cocker' - a keeper, trainer and
fighter of game cocks.
Basketball may be the Philippines' national sport, but cock-fighting is its
national passion. Many Filipinos, even those living in urban areas, keep a
few fighting cocks simply for the pleasure of having them around. Rolly
keeps a dozen, and fights them in a local Zamboanga cockpit on Sundays. But
he spends a good deal of time with them every day, holding and stroking
them, talking to them, admiring them - Filipinos, he assured me, are often
more interested in their cocks than their wives.
Bobby Fernandez is in a different category altogether. As we chatted in the
restaurant late into the night, we were not alone; on the broad green lawns
that surrounded us outside, more than 60 fine fighting cocks sat roosting on
perches in the dark. On Bobby's breeding and training farm in La Paz, 3,000
feet up in rugged, jungly mountains behind Zamboanga, were 200 more.
Fighting cocks are not just a consuming passion for Bobby, but a profitable
living as well.
In most parts of the world cock-fighting is regarded as a cruel and barbaric
sport, and is banned. Although highly popular in England from medieval
times, it was outlawed by Queen Victoria in 1849. In the western hemisphere
today cock-fighting is legal only in Mexico, Panama, Ecuador, Guatamala and
certain US states generally regarded by the liberal establishment as
'redneck' - Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and the like. Even
there the sport is conducted behind closed doors and far from prying and
critical eyes.
Nor, juridically at least, is cock-fighting any better regarded in the East.
Although illicitly practised in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and
much of the rest of Asia, only in the Philippines does it have a legal, mass
following.
Here it is a thriving, multi-million dollar industry supported by
enthusiasts ranging from rickshaw drivers to federal congressmen. In the
Manila area alone there are more than 20 cock-pits, some of them seating
15,000 spectators, hosting more than 30,000 fights a year. Cock-fighting is
actively supported by the government, at times even subsidised by it, for
the simple reason that the state takes 10 per cent of the gate in tax.
But cock-fighting is more than just a way of trying to cut back the budget
deficit - its honourable and respected status on the islands is inevitably a
reflection of Filipinos and their national character.
All around the Philippines the half-dozen 'tiger' economies of east Asia are
surging ahead at breakneck pace - for more than a decade now hard work,
single-minded discipline and personal sacrifice have allowed places such as
Singapore and Taiwan phenomenal rates of growth. The picture in the
Philippines is different - merely to provide reliable energy for industrial
production has so far proved an unconquerable challenge.
There are scores of possible explanations. But, if allowed a little
generalisation, I would put it down to cock-fighting. Filipinos do not like
phrases such as 'single-minded discipline' and 'personal sacrifice'.
Industriousness and determination are not ideas to which they are naturally
given. Production is anathema to them. They like friends and talk, good
times and excitement. Given a little money in their pockets, they like a bit
of a flutter. They like cock-fighting.
I say all this by way not of disparagement, but of compliment. I too 'enjoy'
sitting round wasting time and talking about inconsequential things such as
cocks that look like hens. It is an enormous relief from the rest of the
Asian continent's obsessive and increasingly unbalanced concern with
economic growth. In Singapore, for heaven's sake, gum chewing has become
illegal because it is messy and unproductive.
I am no more pro-bloodsports than I am pro-gum-chewing. But I would rather
live under a government that permits cock-fighting than one that feels
threatened by Juicy Fruit. And after you have met a cock or two, the moral
questions that surround the sport seem to fade in significance.
'There are three things that cocks like more than anything in the world,'
Bobby explained to me as we drove in his jeep across the jungle lowlands
towards La Paz. 'They are food, sex, and fighting.'
So far cocks sounded pretty much like human beings to me, and I said so.
'Yes, but the thing about the cock is that given the choice of the three, he
will choose fighting every single time.'
Perhaps there, I had to admit, was the difference with human beings - given
the choice, a lot of us would spend a great deal of time dickering over the
decision. But not the cock. 'It is territoriality, it is the protection of
his hens,' Bobby said. 'The fighting instinct is so deep he cannot help
himself. What we do at La Paz is provide the perfect environment of food and
sex - it is the cock himself who develops his fighting form to perfection.'
As training camps go, it sounded pretty good to me.
And Bobby was not exaggerating. Two and a half hours later, after having
climbed 3,000 feet over some of the steepest and roughest dirt roads I have
ever seen, we arrived in what could only be described as cock heaven.
Far below lay the heat and high humidity of the tropical lowlands, the
stink, noise, and dirt of urban Zamboanga. Here, in the cool and misty
uplands, was a hidden valley surrounded by tropical hardwood forests, stands
of giant bamboo, groves of pine and banana trees. And as far as one could
see up the valley itself, tethered to roosts spread evenly over a smooth
undulating surface of meticulously kept lawns, were fighting cocks - not
dozens, not hundreds, but thousands of cocks, each strutting, crowing,
preening and thinking himself the finest cock in the world.
Bobby, of course, was not the owner of all these acres and all these
chickens. He is just one of 36 members of the Zamboanga Game Fowl Breeders
Association, who in producing more than 6,000 top-rate cocks a year have put
Zamboanga firmly on the Filipino cock-fighting map. Today the quality of La
Paz cocks rivals that of Bacalod, the country's cock-fighting capital in the
central Philippines, where 50,000 game birds are raised annually.
The La Paz cockers have come to this isolated valley for its ideal climatic,
breeding and training conditions, and also for its security. Surrounding La
Paz are tall observation towers equipped with high-powered searchlights for
night surveillance. At the entrance is a barricade manned by a guard toting
an M-16 assault rifle.
'A necessary precaution,' sighed Bobby. 'We used to have a lot of losses.
It's no wonder - not one of the cocks raised here is worth less than 5,000
pesos, more than Dollars 175 - that's more than six month's salary for many
Filipino workers. The Zamboanga Whites bred here are each worth many times
more than that.'
But Bobby's big concern that day was his on-going conditioning programme for
a fight just three weeks hence. It was a big fight, a seven-cock derby in
Lapu-Lapu City with a top prize of 4.25m pesos, more than Dollars 150,000.
'You can't actually 'train' a cock to fight,' Bobby told me when I asked if
he thought cocks had any intelligence. We were sitting beside a covered
sparring ring watching assistants tie two sets of miniature gloves over the
spurs of a pair of cocks.
'Game birds have more instinct than reason - some people would call them
just plain stupid,' he added. 'If they had any brains they would take one
look at the three-inch steel slashing blade attached to their opponent's
left leg and run the other way. But no, they rush into what for one is
certain death - few cocks survive more than two or three fights. Five- or
six-time winners are exceptional.'
'What you can do, though,' he said, 'is prepare them for a fight, develop
those qualities which make winners - fighting spirit, leg strength for
cutting power, attacking speed, timing, body conformation.' We watched the
cocks warily circle each other, side-stepping, feinting, then suddenly
diving down on each other with legs slashing away in a blur of motion.
'It is just like boxing,' Bobby added, watching the cocks approvingly.
A few days later, I witnessed the culmination of all this work. It was just
an ordinary Sunday hackfight in a local Zamboanga cockpit with a minimum
entrant's bet big enough to feed a whole family for a couple of months, but
a small sum by today's fight standards.
The atmosphere, though, was electric. Down by the ringside the town's
wealthier bettors were instructing the pit's hordes of bookmakers on larger
amounts for posted bets. High up in the cheaper bleachers the town's poor
were making smaller side bets with each other. So noisy and jammed do the
pits get that bettors and bookies rely on a system of hand signals - fingers
pointing upwards to indicate tens of pesos, sideways for hundreds, down for
thousands. Presenters with microphones, bright lights, referees in white
shirts and bow-ties, punters bellowing and gesticulating - Bobby was right;
it was a lot like boxing.
But there are no bouts in this sport, no point scoring, no final-round
re-evaluations, no technical victories. There is just one round, a single,
quick, fatal encounter. A few feathers fly, a blade hits a vital organ, the
crowd roars and a cock lies dead in the sand on the pit floor. It usually
lasts no longer than 30 seconds. After so much care and preparation the
whole thing, in fact, seemed to me rather anti-climactic. Certainly it is no
more cruel than the fate met out daily in the world's abattoirs to millions
of industrially-raised chickens.
Give me La Paz any day, I would say, if I were a chicken. Enjoyable
surroundings, plenty to eat, and stimulating company. I have just one
proviso: when the big day comes, don't match me against a Henny.

FT  18 DEC 93 / The Long View: Profits of gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the London stock market, 1993 is positively roaring towards its close.
Since the Budget on November 30, the All-Share index has added 6 per cent
and the total return for the full year (capital gain plus gross dividend
income) is now 25 per cent.
But the star turn in the UK securities markets has been provided by gilts.
The yields on long-dated UK government securities have tumbled from 8.75 to
6.5 per cent and, in the extreme case of the irredeemables (such as War
Loan) the total return has been 41 per cent.
Looking back at what I was saying in this column at the beginning of 1993,
it is clear that I was too cautious. Surveying the equity market, I judged
that large capitalisation stocks such as those in the FTSE-100 index would
find it hard to make progress in 1993, although there would be money to be
made in recovery stocks and second-liners.
Certainly, the smaller stocks did their stuff - the new SmallCap index has
achieved a return of 36 per cent - but even the market leaders managed a
decent turn of speed in the second half-year.
Nevertheless, I got some things right. I was correct to believe that the
prevailing economic consensus - which, a year ago, suggested no more than 1
per cent growth for the UK in 1993 - was overdoing the pessimism. Growth
will certainly turn out to be 2 per cent, and perhaps 2.5 per cent or more
when the final numbers are added up.
I also resisted the common tendency to be too pessimistic about gilts: at
least two of the big securities houses (tactfully, I won't name them) were
forecasting that gilt yields would have to go to 10 per cent before the
government would be able to finance its Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement.
The gilts problem could be solved, I said in January, so long as short-term
interest rates were cut; the government were to embrace so-called
underfunding (finance through banks); and, most importantly, if the
government were to raise taxes so as be able to to promise a lower borrowing
requirement in 1994-95.
Eventually, the government got all of this right, although the faltering
approach of Norman Lamont, then the chancellor of the exchequer, in the
spring meant that the main positive response came only in the second half of
the year. Indeed, by the middle of it, the market leaders in the Footsie
index were showing scarcely any progress.
By then, however, I was changing my forecasts, recognising the possibility
of a liquidity-driven surge in the market. The second half of the year, I
said at the beginning of July, would prove more exciting, at least until US
interest rates were raised late in the year. Of course, the tightening by
the Federal Reserve has not yet happened so the background has remained
serene.
Two factors, global and local, have given new impetus to London's markets in
the past few months. First, money flooding out of the US at the rate of
Dollars 100bn a year from international mutual funds and diversifying
pension funds has sent nearly all the bond and stock markets around the
globe much higher (the exception being the Tokyo equity market).
This surplus of international liquidity has rendered positively laughable
all those concerns early in the year that the British goverment, through its
excessive demands for finance, might place the domestic capital market under
undue pressure. Domestic and foreign investors have not only lapped up all
the gilts - they have eagerly swallowed Pounds 12bn of UK equity issues as
well.
Secondly, the positive domestic factor has been the adoption of a tough
fiscal policy by the government. It was in April that I first began to dwell
on the possibility of a gilt-edged bonanza as yields tumbled from the then
ruling 8.4 per cent to perhaps 6 per cent. Unfortunately I could not really
believe it.
When Kenneth Clarke became chancellor at the end of May, however, I argued
that he had a great opportunity to get a grip on the budget and turn the
tables on the markets: investors, instead of sitting back comfortably in the
knowledge that they could deal on a take-it-or-leave-it basis with the
endless supplies of high coupon paper heading their way, might be panicked
into chasing a declining supply of gilts on rapidly falling yields. It
seemed a fantasy at the time, but it is now happening.
Against this background of tumbling bond yields, the equity market has been
pulled higher, although the fundamental valuations are stretched. Company
profits are showing reasonable growth this year, and earnings per share
could be 15-20 per cent higher for 1993, although the picture is very patchy
as various recent individual company profits warnings have shown; dividend
growth has been predictably poor and was damaged further by the unexpected
tax hit on pension fund dividend income in the spring, as a consequence of
which dividends on the All-Share index have actually fallen by 2 1/2 per
cent this year.
In international terms, the UK equity market, despite its recent
acceleration, has not performed very well this year. The global pattern has
confirmed once again the old rule that you should buy shares in recessions,
not in conditions of decent economic growth.
It looks as though 1993 will have turned out to be the most depressed year
for the industrialised global economy (excluding the US) ever recorded by
the OECD, which is estimating zero growth. But the FT-Actuaries World ex-US
index is showing a gain of 28 per cent (in dollars); even the wobbly Tokyo
market has provided good returns for unhedged foreigners, thanks to the
super-strong yen.
On the other hand, Wall Street has lagged. The US economy, with nearly 3 per
cent growth, might have glittered in a dismal global environment but
American equities are up only about 6 per cent on the year (the
narrowly-based Dow Jones Average glamourises the general trend). Buy the
recovery story, sell the fact.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Steelmakers angered as EU approves state aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's big steelmakers reacted angrily last night when the European Union
cleared the way for restructuring its ailing steel industry after more than
a year of often bitter wrangling over state subsidies.
Industry ministers unanimously approved a series of state aids for public
sector steel producers in eastern Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal worth
nearly Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.33bn) and involving more than 5m tonnes of capacity
reductions.
The deal is the most far-reaching attempt by the Union to resolve the
deep-seated problems of Europe's steel industry since the restructuring
carried out under the Davignon plan of the early 1980s. Without agreement on
state subsidies, the entire industry faced sliding into further heavy losses
next year.
The European Commission and the Belgian presidency of the EU said it was now
up to non-aided steel producers to carry out their side of the bargain and
cut production by almost 25m tonnes, easing problems of overcapacity.
But the deal was immediately criticised by these unsubsidised private sector
producers, raising the possibility that they will be reluctant to offer
their own capacity cuts.
'This is a compromise, driven by political expedience,' said British Steel.
Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German Steel Federation, called it
'pure window dressing for the gullible' and predicted dire consequences for
Germany's private steelmakers. The ministers issued a strong political
declaration renouncing further state subsidies for the companies involved.
Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, said: 'The importance of
today's agreement is exactly that it is a road without a return.'
Mr Savona had been accused by the Commission and the Belgian presidency of
blocking an overall deal on state subsidies at the November meeting of
industry ministers. But the agreement on restructuring Ilva, the state-owned
Italian producer, was reached without detailed discussion yesterday.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, British industry minister, also had to abandon UK
resistance to the restructuring of Ekostahl, the east German producer. But
Britain and Denmark won commitments that Riva, the private Italian company
planning to buy Ekostahl, would limit new capacity to 900,000 tonnes over
the next five years, and 'significantly below 2m tonnes' up to 2004.
Mr Sainsbury also stressed that most of the restructuring packages would
involve an element of privatisation which, he said, would lead to 'much
fairer trading for steel in the Community'.
Yesterday's agreement is subject to formal parliamentary scrutiny in Denmark
and Britain.
The Commission has already won agreement from ministers for other elements
of its rescue plan: Ecu240m of financial support to ease the pain of more
than 50,000 redundancies; monitoring of the steel market; and safeguards to
limit cheap imports of steel from central and eastern Europe.

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK shares hit another new high as growth hopes are boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in London closed last night at another record high, fuelled by
economic statistics during the week which boosted hopes of steady economic
growth next year with inflation staying weak.
Government bonds - or gilts - also continued their good run, with prices
driven up by low inflationary pressures and expectations of a cut in UK
interest rates early in the new year.
The mood on the UK markets was buoyed by firm trends on continental European
bourses, with both Paris and Frankfurt closing higher on speculation that
the German Bundesbank would ease monetary policy before the spring.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading stocks climbed 25.9 to finish at 3,337.1, for
a 76-point rise on the week. Since the day before the Budget on November 30,
share prices have gained 7 per cent.
In the second half of the year, the index - after falling slightly between
January and June - has so far climbed 17 per cent. Investors have in recent
weeks given short shrift to theories that the large tax rises due next April
will harm the recovery.
Long-dated gilts climbed  1/2 a point yesterday for a rise of 1 1/2 points
on the week and about 7 points since the Budget. Yesterday's rise in UK
government bonds was helped by strong buying interest from continental
Europe and the US, where investors are impressed about the UK's relatively
good economic prospects for next year. The week's gains on share and bond
markets were helped by underlying retail-price inflation in the UK hitting a
26-year low, a sharp drop in unemployment to 2.81m and indications that
steady output growth would continue.
Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg Securities, London
stockbroker, said the 'benign' news of low inflation had convinced the
markets that base rates, now at 5.5 per cent, could be cut to 4.5 per cent
by mid-1994.
Much of the stock market rise yesterday was due to frenetic technical
trading linked to the expiry of the December FT-SE 100 futures contract.

FT  18 DEC 93 / British Gas unveils radical changes in regional make-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas yesterday announced a sweeping corporate reorganisation to
prepare its UK operations for future competition.
The changes will lead to the break-up of its traditional regional structure
and create five specialised business divisions.
Mr Norman Blacker, director responsible for the UK gas business, said the
plan would lead to 'the most fundamental changes in organisation and culture
. . . for more than 40 years'.
The restructuring announcement was to have followed a government decision on
the future of the gas industry. But Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, yesterday failed to make an expected statement to parliament
before it rose for Christmas.
The government was thought to have reached agreement on the industry's
future as early as Wednesday. But last-minute objections, said to have come
from Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, apparently
delayed the announcement. The DTI said a decision might still be announced
next week.
British Gas has made no secret of its frustration over the uncertainty that
has surrounded the company since the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
report on the industry was published in August. Mr Heseltine must decide
whether to accept or modify MMC recommendations that British Gas's trading
arm be sold off by 1997, followed within three to five years by the lifting
of its monopoly in supplying 17m mainly residential users.
British Gas yesterday said the new structure, to be implemented next March
and phased in over two years, could be 'adapted' to any government decision.
The restructuring plan stems from a 1992 agreement with the Office of Fair
Trading and a commitment to the government that British Gas would introduce
greater transparency into its operations. It also conforms to an MMC
recommendation that the company construct Chinese walls between the various
operating groups to enhance competition.
The five new business units are:
Public Gas Supply, which will cater to residential and small business users;
Contract Trading, which will sell gas to industrial and commercial customers
using more than 2,500 therms;
Transportation and Storage, through which gas will be shipped from shore
terminals to meter outlets;
Retailing, overseeing a remodelled and re-styled network of shops selling
gas appliances; and
Service and installation of gas central heating.
Company officials say the restructuring will make it easier to implement the
20,000 job cuts the company plans over the next three years.
The restructuring does not affect the worldwide exploration and production
division or Global Gas, the other main international arm specialising in
distribution and gas-fired electricity generation.

FT  18 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Metallgesellschaft
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Just ten days ago, Mr Hilmar Koppar of Deutsche Bank advised people to be
more relaxed about Metallgesellschaft. It is difficult to be so now. Seldom
do German banks axe virtually the entire top management from a company they
effectively control. Seldom, too, does a supervisory board complain that
management has deliberately withheld information. A special audit of the
group's US activities, a revision of the latest annual accounts which showed
a loss of DM347m, and explicit reference to the need for a capital
restructuring all suggest problems extending beyond mere over-trading of US
oil futures.
Two things stand in Metallgesellschaft's favour. First, it is difficult to
imagine the banks allowing such an important company to go to the wall.
Second, Mr Kajo Neukirchen, who they have brought in to run it, has a strong
reputation as a troubleshooter, having already sorted out KHD, Hoesch and
Kugelfischer. But yesterday's statement shows that even the supervisory
board has no clear idea of the task he faces.
Quite apart from the German recession, which has made Metallgesellschaft's
expensive investment in pollution controls look singularly ill-timed, the
omens are not good. Unlike other German companies, Metallgesellschaft
refuses to break exceptional gains out of its profit figures. That raises
doubts about the underlying returns from the extravagant acquisition
programme of the late 1980s. To raise cash, Mr Neukirchen may be forced to
sell off valuable assets like Lurgi and Buderus, while the looming rights
issue could be substantial. The market's initial inclination to treat the
management change as a portent of recovery looks premature.

FT  18 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Building materials
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sniff of interest rate cuts has intoxicated the building materials
sector, stimulating a further 9 per cent outperformance against the market
over the past three months. On Goldman Sachs' forecasts, the sector is now
trading on 13.5 times 1996 earnings. That demonstrates a remarkable degree
of far sightedness, leaving no room for error.
The main exception to the trend has been Redland, which has under-performed
the sector by 7 per cent over the past three months. The news that finance
director Mr Gerald Corbett is leaving to join Grand Metropolitan has not
helped Redland's share price - nor, curiously, that of GrandMet.
Furthermore, Redland's tax charge will inexorably rise if UK earnings do not
rebound strongly enough to resolve its ACT problem. There are also concerns
about the sustainability of demand in the west German housing market.
Changes to tax incentives may suck forward sales of Redland's roofing tiles
into 1994, but demand could fall sharply thereafter.
The big cloud over the whole sector's earnings prospects is the difficulty
of making price rises stick in a disinflationary climate. Pilkington has
already had to unwind an 8 per cent price rise for glass. Downward price
pressure will continue for many products as mainland European manufacturers
divert surplus stocks into the UK. If there are any wobbles in building
materials shares, the construction sector could gain. Contracting companies
benefit later in the cycle. But at least they are trading on comparatively
meagre multiples.

FT  18 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bandwagon in the UK equity market seems unstoppable. Despite a profits
warning from Fisons and Pounds 400m of write-downs and provisions from
Trafalgar House, the FT-SE 100 still ended the week 76 points higher. Some
of the gain reflects a squeeze on those institutions which held back ahead
of the budget and are still trying to climb back on board. But the main
impetus remains interest rates. With inflation subdued, the view is growing
that rates may be cut not just in the new year, but again in the spring when
tax increases start to bite.
Whether the Bank of England will oblige is another matter. The recovery does
not look weak enough to make a fresh cut urgent, and the latest German money
supply data suggests continental cuts could be deferred. But as long as it
can convince itself that rates are heading lower, the equity market could
retain some steam. Cash is an unattractive alternative - as retail investors
were reminded this week by fresh reductions in building society and National
Savings rates. Only when the interest rate frenzy stops will the market have
to worry about boring matters such as earnings and dividends. Then it will
be time to remember that if low inflation holds back reported earnings, it
will take even longer for cover to be restored to the point where dividends
can grow in tandem.

FT  18 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Norman's conquest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Archie Norman may get quiet satisfaction from knowing that his gloomy
predictions about the UK grocery sector have proved much more accurate than
the sunny forecasts coming from his older rivals. But that will prove cold
comfort unless Asda rings up higher sales as a result of his analysis. On
that score, there is room for only modest encouragement about Asda's
long-term future, despite its strong half-year numbers.
A 9 per cent rise in same store sales, with almost no benefit from price
inflation, is an impressive achievement; the 14 per cent rise in operating
profits even more so. The new Asda team continues to make textbook progress,
lifting staff productivity, improving product mix, strengthening the
distribution chain and renovating the older stores. How satisfying it must
be to exploit under-utilised assets, especially when coming from such a low
profits base.
This renewal programme has a fair bit further to run. But at some point, the
recovery momentum will stall. Asda will then have to prove it has a trading
format capable of growing in the 1990s. The launch of the Dales discount
chain is hopeful. The infusion of Pounds 700m of equity also provides the
financial muscle for Asda to fund its ambitions. But Asda can no longer rely
on its competitors running their businesses as though they lingered in the
1980s. J. Sainsbury's latest price offensive shows how determined the market
leader is to claw back Asda's recent advantage. The market will grow far
tougher from here on in.

FT  18 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs on triple-witching
day
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US stocks posted solid gains yesterday in a rally fuelled by a more
optimistic outlook on interest rates and heavy trading related to the
'triple-witching' expiration of options and futures contracts, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 25.43 higher at 3,751.57,
and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 3.04 at 466.38. In
the secondary markets, the American FE composite was 2.76 ahead at 464.20,
while the Nasdaq composite was 3.70 higher at 759.23.
The triple-witching activity - triggered by the quarterly unwinding of
options and future contracts on stock indices and options on individual
stocks - lifted NYSE volume to 358m shares. Advances led declines by 1,467
to 649.
The market's direction, which is often erratic under such circumstances, was
set by a reassuring article on Federal Reserve policy in The Washington
Post. It quoted unnamed senior Fed officials as dismissing the fears of Wall
Street analysts that the central bank would boost short-term interest rates
before unambiguous signs of inflation surfaced.
Their comments appeared to have had a calming effect on the bond market,
which reacted with equanimity to more bullish news on the economy. In late
trading, the inflation-sensitive 30-year government bond was  7/16 firmer at
99 19/32 , aided by a further decline in crude oil prices.
The latest evidence suggesting strong fourth-quarter growth came from the
Commerce Department, which said November housing starts had risen by 3.9 per
cent in November to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.43m, the highest level
since February 1990.
The strong report, coupled with diminished concerns over the Fed's
intentions, led to a broad trend of moderate gains in equities.
Allied Signel gained Dollars 2 at Dollars 77 1/4 , International Paper
Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 67 7/8 , Eastman Kodak Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 55
1/4 and Roadway Services Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 63. But Coca-Cola shed
Dollars 1 to Dollars 42 5/8 . Banking issues were given a particular boost
from expiration-related trading. Citicorp was up Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36
1/2 , Banc One Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 39, Wachovia Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
34 and SunTrust Banks Dollars 1 to Dollars 45 7/8 .
Among individual stocks, IBM was marked up Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 59 3/4
after Merrill Lynch lifted its estimate of the company's 1993 performance.
General Electric climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 105 1/8 after announcing a
dividend increase.
Canada
TORONTO stocks recorded a small gain in moderate trading.
The 300 composite index was up 7.41, or 0.18 per cent, to 4223.58, for a
loss on the week of about 57 points. Advances led declines 449 to 367,
volume of 59,436,000 shares was little changed from yesterday's 58.8m
shares, and trading value was CDollars 628.8m compared with CDollars 673m.

FT  18 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): News and comment spice senior
bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News and comment continued to spice the technical preoccupations of the
Paris and Frankfurt bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was led higher by futures buying, particularly by domestic investors,
the cash market responding with a gain of 36.18, or 1.7 per cent in the
CAC-40 index to 2,196.44. This left it just 0.1 per cent lower on the week,
in turnover of FFr5bn.
Michelin was one of the best performers of the day, rising FFr6, or more
than 3 per cent to FFr199. Mr Christopher Will, of Lehman Brothers in
London, said that the shares of Michelin and other European tyremakers were
responding to Thursday night's US news of a Goodyear increase of 3 per cent
in downmarket replacement tyres - long awaited, and following price weakness
in a very soft US replacement market in the second and third quarters of
1993.
On the downgrade, Euro Disney fell 85 centimes to FFr34.55 after a report
said that its banks had rejected a solution to its financing problems from
its parent, Walt Disney, until an audit was carried out.
FRANKFURT fielded the expiry of DTB monthly and quarterly futures and
options contracts with little pain for share prices, the DAX index closing
13.54 higher on the session at 2,151.02, 0.5 per cent lower on the week, and
recovering a little more in the post bourse where it finished at 2,154.76.
Turnover, inflated by the options expiry, rose from DM9.2bn to DM17.5bn. In
a news-led gain, Metallgesellschaft climbed on the departure of its chairman
and its chief financial officer, rising DM16.30 to DM309.30 in floor
trading; but it fell back to trade at DM298 late in the post-bourse as
analysts worried that the company might need a rights issue.
Metallgesellschaft's new chairman is to be Mr Kajo Neukirchen, currently
supervisory board chairman at the ball bearing manufacturer, Kugelfischer,
which itself rose DM8.50, or more than 5 per cent to DM173.50 on a brokers'
recommendation citing its loss elimination potential.
Schering recovered DM28 to DM1,056.50 as a number of brokers said that its
multiple sclerosis drug, Betaseron, had timing on its side. In the
automotive sector, the tyremaker, Continental, climbed DM5.50 to DM265.50 on
the American pricing news from Goodyear.
ZURICH returned to record levels, led by a good performance by some of the
chemicals issues, and the SMI index added 21.8 to 2,889.5, for a weekly rise
of 1.0 per cent.
Mr Daniel Brupbacher at Bank Vontobel in Zurich sees room for further
advances next week, with the domestic interest rate trend continuing down
and in the absence of developments abroad to disrupt the market.
Ciba-Geigy, a recent laggard, rose strongly with its registered shares SFr12
higher at SFr844 and the bearers SFr28 up at SFr878. Sandoz bearers rose
SFr40 to SFr4,140.
Nestle continued to be heavily traded, adding SFr14 to SFr1,254.
Banks mostly edged lower, failing to derive benefit from Thursday's 25 basis
point cut in the discount rate. A SFr35 rise to SFr3,570 in CS Holding was
attributed to the expiry of a warrant issue in connection with a capital
increase, which was taking pressure off the share.
Bearers in SMH, the watchmaker, picked up SFr20 to SFr970 as the market
assessed the change in shareholder structure announced late on Thursday.
AMSTERDAM was driven higher by short-covering and options-related buying,
with the publishing sector at the centre of attention. The CBS Tendency
index added 1.7 to 143.1 for a 2.2 per cent rise over the week.
Elsevier rose Fl 2.50 to Fl 168.30, VNU added Fl 3.50 to Fl 157.50 and
Wolters Kluwer advanced Fl 2.80 to Fl 117.00.
A 30 cent dip to Fl 180.50 in Akzo was attributed to news that the
industry's European federation saw no sign of recovery. In the same sector,
DSM closed 0.80 cents higher at Fl 107.50, but off a Fl 108.00 high.
Hoogovens, the steel and aluminium producer, was lifted Fl 1.40 to Fl47.30
on foreign demand and rising aluminium prices. Hunter Douglas climbed
climbed Fl 5.00 to 83.50.
MILAN was steady as the lower house of parliament approved measures to cut
next year's deficit and the Comit index eased 0.15 to 602.40, for a 4 per
cent rise on the week.
Olivetti added L106 to L2,117 on expectations that it would be awarded
Italy's second mobile telephone operator license next year.
Credito Italiano shed L22 to L2,228 amid renewed heavy foreign selling.
Ferruzzi rose L400 to L27,400 and Montedison L50 to L585 ahead of their
capital raising operations next week.
MADRID featured a further Pta21 gain in Iberdrola to Pta969 on the potential
Standard &amp; Poors upgrade of its debt rating. The general index rose 1.10 to
308.61, fractionally up on the week, in turnover of Pta28bn.

FT  18 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei adds 1.5% in

<TEXT>
Hopes for an imminent announcement of economic measures by the government
boosted sentiment, and the Nikkei average closed above the 18,000 level for
the first time since November 18, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index rose 262.63, or 1.5 per cent, to 18,051.91, gaining ground
for the third consecutive day and up 3.9 per cent on the week. The Topix
index of all first section stocks gained 16.26, or 1.1 per cent, to
1,490.47.
Trading remained subdued for much of the day, but surged towards the end of
the session. The index fell to a low of 17,724.07 during the first hour of
trading but surged to 18,052.21 just before the close.
Volume totalled 287m shares against 339m as advances led losses by 682 to
326, with 167 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed at
1,228.05, down 0.4.
Share prices overcame profit taking in the morning thanks to buying by
financial institutions.
The afternoon buying was triggered by investment trusts, which have set up
new funds linked to the new 300 issue Nikkei index.
Speculation that the government would cancel its planned flotation of Japan
Tobacco shares this fiscal year boosted Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Y28,000 to Y789,000 and East Japan Railway by Y17,000 to Y455,000. After the
market closed, the ministry of finance announced its decision to postpone
the JT listing.
Toshiba, the most active issue of the day, fell Y14 to Y699. Reports that
the company would be punished by the government, for its illegal exports to
the former East Germany during 1986 and 1987, prompted heavy selling.
However, other high-technology issues continued to gain ground. Sony rose
Y10 to Y5,510 and Matsushita Electric Industrial added Y10 to Y1,530.
Investors took profits on steel companies. Nippon Steel fell Y6 to Y305.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 95.40 to 19,761.60 in volume of 57.1m shares.
Roundup
Four new highs were recorded in the Pacific Basin. Bombay remained closed
for fourth consecutive day as brokers protested against a ban on forward
deals.
HONG KONG's bull run showed no sign of running out of steam as the Hang Seng
index climbed 229.20 or 2.2 per cent to another record close of 10,568.86,
for a 3.3 per cent rise on the week.
Recent laggards, including banks and property investment issues, spearheaded
the rally although demand remained broadly based.
SEOUL saw a rally in blue chips, and strength in low price-to-book ratio
counters took the market to another year high, in spite of some selling
pressure, particularly in securities issues. The composite index added 3.38
to 874.10, 1.5 per cent higher on the week.
MANILA closed at a record high as investors swamped the exchanges to
position themselves for next year, brokers said. The composite index rose
47.46 to 2,662.43, up 5.9 per cent over the week.
JAKARTA closed higher across the board in an upbeat mood, backed by wide
local support. The official index added 2.59 to a record 556.95, a 5.4 per
cent rise on the week.
SINGAPORE closed easier in busy trading as afternoon profit-taking more than
wiped out early gains to put a brake on a week-long record-breaking run.
The Straits Times Industrials index closed down 5.73 at 2,280.26 after
Thursday's record closing high. The index was 2.7 per cent higher over the
week. Volume was a record 742.79m shares.
TAIWAN came in for heavy profit-taking after five straight days of strong
gains and the weighted index ended 57.11 down at 5,274.76 in hectic turnover
of TDollars 108.75bn - still up 13.6 per cent on the week.
AUSTRALIA closed slightly stronger but off its highs after early buying
orders evaporated and with BHP's strong half year results already
discounted. The All Ordinaries closed up 5.4 at 2,080.2, off a high of
2,088.5, little changed on the week.
BHP rose to ADollars 16.90 shortly after its profit announcement but later
fell back to close just 2 cents higher at ADollars 16.68.
NEW ZEALAND ended lower after the government's sale of its 6.7 per cent
Fletcher Challenge stake depressed prices. The NZSE-40 capital index ended
18.72 lower at 2,080.50, 1.1 per cent lower on the week, and Fletcher shed
10 cents to Dollars 3.33.

FT  18 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Profits in perplexity for German shares
in 1993 - David Waller on Frankfurt's bourse performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German stock market has been been profitable but perplexing during the
course of 1993.
Profitable, for as the year draws to its close, the DAX index of 30 leading
shares looks set to close nearly 40 per cent higher than at the beginning of
the year.
Perplexing, because the share price rises - which range from 20 per cent in
the building and cement sector to 50 per cent for insurance companies - have
often been decoupled from fundamentals.
'The companies in the worst state have been the best performers,' comments
Mr Tom Holmes, head of equity research at Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst in
Frankfurt. 'I have been absolutely baffled by the differentiation between
the performance of companies in the same sector.'
He points out that in the topsy-turvy world of German equities, Volkswagen
has outperformed the more resilient BMW, Viag has proved a better investment
than the more robust RWE. . . and so on throughout the market.
The performance of the market as a whole has been underpinned by at least
three broad positive factors.
The first is that German interest rates, already down dramatically from
their peak in the summer of 1992, will continue to fall in 1994. Kleinwort
Benson, for example, expects the discount rate to fall from 5.75 per cent
now to 4 per cent or below by the end of next year.
Disappointing data on money supply growth this week has done nothing to
change this picture. M3, the Bundesbank's trusted measure of broad money,
climbed at an annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of 7.2 per cent in
November, up from 6.9 in October. But according to the Hypo-Bank, for one,
inflation is set to drop towards the magic 2 per cent level by 1995,
allowing the Bundesbank to carry on cutting rates.
The second support for the market comes from companies' moves to rationalise
their costs. The recognition that costs must be cut - however damaging to
the social aspect of Germany's social market economy - is widespread in
German industry. Companies such as Volkswagen, Lufthansa and Daimler-Benz,
which are perceived to be the most aggressive in tackling costs, have been
honoured with substantial price rises despite the dire earnings situation at
each of the companies.
The third positive factor is the weight of money seeking to find a home in
German equities. Much of the market's rise this year was because of
purchases by cash-rich foreign institutions, especially US institutions,
eager to correct their underweight position in the German market. Now, as
the Bund market enters a consolidation phase, it may be that domestic
investors will provide further impetus.
Taken together, these three factors have driven the market to a level where
a great deal is being taken for granted. According to Kleinwort Benson, the
DAX at its current level of 2,151.02 stands at a multiple of 26 times 1994
earnings. This is in spite of a 73 per cent increase in earnings in prospect
next year, following a 47 per cent drop in 1993.
The cautious investor, undoubtedly, would reach the conclusion that the
market is overvalued at these levels - but undue caution at any stage in the
past year would have been a recipe for missing out on large share price
rises. Has anything changed now?
Mr Andrew Thomson at Kleinwort Benson identifies a number of significant
risks which - at some stage towards the end of the first quarter of next
year - may bring the market's euphoria to an end.
Politics cannot be ruled out as a destabilising factor. There are at least
20 regional, national and European elections scheduled for next year in
Germany. As Kleinwort notes, there are a number of smaller, regional
elections in March and April which - as in Brandenburg earlier this month -
may trigger protest votes from disillusioned voters.
Financial markets are likely to be upset by a surge in support for far-right
parties or a deepening of the uncertainty surrounding the future of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government.
Another potential problem is that the impact of corporate rationalisation
turns out to be less far-reaching than expected, exposing current valuations
as excessively optimistic. A first indication of whether this is the case
will emerge two or three months into next year when Germany's big industrial
groups report their final figures for 1993.
This danger will be exacerbated if the economy recovers more quickly than
expected: rationalisation is difficult to implement where the interests of
the workforce come ahead of those of shareholders. It is only the severity
of the current downturn that has forced management to attack costs and, if
pressure relents, it is likely that relations between management and labour
will revert to the comfortable pre-recession status quo that worked to the
disadvantage of shareholders.
In the words of Mr Tom Holmes at SMH, the message to shareholders in
Deutschland AG must be: 'Hang on tight, keep your eyes closed - and your
ears open.'

FT  18 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: British Gas hurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Utilities took a back seat as yield considerations were pushed aside by a
drive for undervalued stocks. One utility, British Gas, was further affected
by news that the group was to restructure itself and become five independent
units.
The changes are likely to lead to 20,000 people, or a third of the UK gas
workforce, losing their jobs and thus lead to heavy redundancy costs. The
shares fell 3 to 357p.
Pharmaceutical group Wellcome was well bought following a meeting late on
Thursday to discuss prospects for some of its products, particularly its
anti-herpes treatment, Zovirax.
There had been concern that the company might fail to get early approval for
over the counter sales of the drug in the US and the meeting removed some
jitters. The group also announced an alliance with Vertex Pharmaceuticals,
of Massachusetts to develop inhibitors against Aids and HIV, the virus
causing Aids. The shares, which have suffered badly in recent weeks, soared
ahead to close 24 up at 655p on respectable turnover of 6.3m.
SmithKline Beecham continued firmer to close 10 higher at 405p with Smith
New Court, Nomura and Keinwort benson all recommending the stock.
Airports group BAA fell 10 to 1020p as investors took profits after a recent
good run. British Airways dipped 1 1/2 to 443 1/2 p as it said it would
invest Pounds 150m in expanding cargo facilities at London Heathrow airport
in a joint venture with BAA.
The postponed figures from French electrical retail subsidiary Darty were in
line with analysts' expectations and the relief sent Kingfisher shares
forward 7 to 717p, although dealers said this was due to marketmakers
running tight positions.
Elsewhere among stores stocks, specialists continued to fret over the
trickle of reports from retailers suggesting dull pre-Christmas trading.
Next is said to be one exception, its shares showing continuing resilience
to the soggy sector, finishing the day 4 up at 212p. Marks and Spencer
retreated 7 to 430 1/2 p, although GUS, up 8 at 605p, and Boots, ahead 10 at
550p, provided brighter spots.
Strauss Turnbull was recommending top slicing in Cadbury-Schweppes, the
shares closing a half-penny off at 498p.
Manweb reported interim profits up 48 per cent to Pounds 54.9m, although it
cautioned against a similar level for the full-year. The shares gained 4 to
751p.
Profit-taking hit water stocks, among which, North West slid 12 to 588p,
Southern 13 to 659p and Welsh 15 to 715p.
Shares in Trafalgar House came under further pressure, easing 3 1/2 to 76
1/2 p.

News that efforts to restructure Europe's petrochemicals industry had been
scrapped came too late to affect the stock market. But the failure to
restrict production of ethylene, a big factor in plastics production, is
expected to hit the share price of ICI. The company is a big producer of the
product and, according to some chemicals analysts, the shares had risen by
around 60p on the back of optimism over a positive conference. The shares
closed up 7 1/2 at 767 1/2 p.

FT  18 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Asda busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interim results at the top end of market forecasts enabled Asda to continue
its recent recovery, although profit-taking and other concerns restricted
the final climb to just a penny at 56p. Turnover was a hefty 56m - the
second biggest this year. However, the results did nothing to quell the
debate over whether or not the food retail sector's recovery is likely to be
sustained.
Asda produced underlying sales growth ahead of the industry, with half-year
sales up 9 per cent even without the benefit of any new store openings. But
some analysts still professed concern over comments made by the Asda
management that the group would continue to match the price cuts of its
competitors.
'Asda has done all the right things but in doing so has stirred its
competitors into price competition,' said Mr Jeremy Alun-Jones at Lehman
Brothers. He remains negative on all the leading supermarket stocks.
Others were less cautious, one leading sector analyst saying: 'The food
retailing business has changed and people both within and outside the sector
are beginning to live with it.'
The recovery in shares yesterday reflected the more positive mood. J.
Sainsbury gained 5 to 450p, Kwik Save 9 to 586p and Argyll 7 to 284p. Tesco,
however, slipped 3 to 220p.

FT  18 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: US sellers unsettle Reuters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News and financial information group Reuters experienced a dramatic
turnaround in its share price yesterday after a number of investors,
particularly in the US, decided that the stock had become overpriced.
In early trading, the stock moved steadily upwards with the market to hit a
high of 1788p. The share price was driven forward by a bear squeeze -
marketmakers short of stock struggling to square their trading books. It was
also influenced by news that Reuters is to invest Dollars 125m in the
purchase of Teknekron Software Systems of California.
Then in the afternoon, Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, turned
seller arguing that the stock had risen too far. Lehman analyst Mr Alastair
Smellie said: 'The software deal is definitely a good acquisition, which
alleviates Reuters cash pile problem. But given that the shares have risen
by 30 per cent since July, consolidation must be a very real possibility.'
There was also some concern that the company's big grip on dealing room
technology might lay it open to criticism from the UK Monopolies and Merger
Commission. The share price turned the corner in the afternoon and slid back
to close a net 2 lower on the day at 1758p with 1.3m traded.

FT  18 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Powerful close to a successful week
for shares - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A highly successful week on the London stock market closed last night with
market indices powering through to new peaks in heavy trading as investors
looked for a base rate cut in the very near future. Stock index futures
continued to lead equities, attention switching to the March contract as
December expired.
Share prices opened higher and, with the exception of a few turbulent
moments around 10.15 am when the stock index future expired, moved ahead
steadily to the day's peak of 3,350.8, a new intra-day high. Strength in
other European bourses strengthened conviction that the Bundesbank will lead
interest rates lower across Europe in the New Year.
The final reading put the FT-SE at a new closing peak of 3,337.1 for a net
gain of 25.9 on the day. This week, the first leg of the three-week
Christmas account in equities, has seen a gain of around 2.3 per cent in the
Footsie, with new peaks reached almost daily.
Investors have become increasingly convinced that, with domestic inflation
still subdued and economic recovery apparently under way, interest rates
will be soon be reduced from the present 5.5 per cent to 5 per cent and
perhaps lower. Confidence has been buttressed this week by the latest
statistics on domestic inflation and unemployment.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, the indicator of broader-ranging investment
interest, also extended this week's gains, closing yesterday at a new peak
of 3,691.7, up 17.6.
Seaq volume jumped to 1,015.6m shares, just under the total for session
following the November Budget. On Thursday, Seaq volume of 923.3m shares was
worth Pounds 1.86bn in retail business in equities. Retail, or genuine
customer business, regarded as the most genuine guide to stock market health
and profitability, has already exceeded Pounds 6.6bn this week, with
Friday's total yet to come; this ensures it a place among the most
successful trading weeks of the year.
Although turnover was swollen yesterday by the final burst of activity
between blue chip shares and stock index futures, there was no gainsaying
the optimistic mood of the stock market.
The squeeze on marketmakers' positions continued, although pressures are
expected to ease now that the stock index futures expiry is out of the way.
Once again, the strongest rises came yesterday from shares in the merchant
banks, which are active participants in securities markets. Lending banks
were also in demand again as dividend growth prospects reflected the rapidly
improving health of their loan books. Gains in bank stocks have been resumed
after a pause for profit-taking.
A firm opening to the new Wall Street session, bringing a gain of 14 Dow
points in UK trading hours, confirmed a good performance by the blue chip
internationals. Pharmaceutical stocks were in favour while hopes for a rate
cut in Germany soon brought buyers in for some construction stocks.
Store shares, however, continued to underperform, with the exception of
Kingfisher, which responded well to the trading statement from Darty, the
French electrical retailing subsidiary acquired last February.
In government bonds, short dates again eased but the longer dates extended
early gains to close around  5/16 higher. Index-linked bonds were a shade
firmer.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expiry of the December contract on the FT-SE 100 futures drove the
underlying cash market forward as dealers fought to close out their
positions by the 10.30am deadline, writes Peter John.
Position-taking saw the cash index soar nearly 40 points by the time the
contract started to expire at 10.10 am.
The contract itself was very volatile, see-sawing between a discount of
three points to the cash and a premium of six points. There was an attempt
to force cash and the futures up to a meeting point of 3,350 but during the
20 minutes in which an average expiry price is calculated the underlying
market was forced back down by 10 points and final expiry was set at 3,345.
Many dealers had to use the cash market to square their books because of the
very high premium of the March contract. By the close of official dealing
March was at 3,355 with some 18,700 lots traded.
Traded options turnover was high at 53,187 lots.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Markets Report: D-Mark up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the Bundesbank council meeting out of the way and only a handful of
economic releases in the next two weeks, most currencies drifted sideways as
traders wound down their positions ahead of the year-end, writes Conner
Middelmann.
Following the Bundesbank's decision to leave its interest rates unchanged,
the US dollar continued slipping against the D-Mark, breaking technical
support at DM1.7050 and dropping as low as DM1.7025. The dollar was also
depressed by talk that central banks were selling dollars as part of their
reserve management operations. It ended in London at DM1.7045, down from
DM1.7085 on Thursday.
The dollar continued to firm against the Japanese yen, however, hitting a
high of Y110.20. It finished at Y110.10, up from Y109.75 at Thursday's
close.
'Having breached technical resistance at Y110, the dollar could push towards
Y112 towards year-end,' said Mr Michael Burke, an economist with Citibank.
Unlike many economists who expect the dollar to rally against the D-Mark in
1994, Mr Burke said he expected it to end the year around DM1.55. That
compares with a market average 12-month forecast of around DM1.80, although
some economists are calling for a rate as high as DM1.90 by the end of 1994.
'It's astonishing - if everyone is so bullish on the dollar, why isn't it
going up?' Mr Burke mused.
He expects the dollar to slip when the first quarter of 1994 shows that the
US economy is not as buoyant as many believe. 'US incomes don't support an
increase in the pace of private-sector consumption, and that will be further
slowed by next year's tax hikes,' he said. Meanwhile, 'it would be perverse
for the Fed to tighten while growth remains slow and inflation is falling',
he added.
Next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve open market committee will be
closely watched after an article in yesterday's Washington Post argued that
Fed officials do not favour a near-term increase in interest rates as a
pre-emptive strike against the possibility of stronger inflation.
The rate for D-Mark call money firmed as monthly tax outflows and seasonal
pressures sucked liquidity out of the banking system. This prompted a
liquidity injection by the Bundesbank via its Paragraph 17 facility, under
which it lends out government funds on deposit with the Bundesbank at market
rates. An estimated DM4-6bn were lent out at 6.15 per cent. The call rate
traded at 6.15 per cent, up from around 6.05 per cent the previous day.
The D-Mark strengthened slightly against some of its ERM counterparts. It
firmed against the French franc to FFr3.419, from FFr3.415 on Thursday. The
Danish krone slipped to DKr3.918, from DKr3.912 the previous day.
The sterling money market had a quiet day, leaving the March short sterling
futures contract unchanged at 94.80. The pound barely changed, finishing at
DM2.5425, after DM2.5450 on Thursday.
The Bank of England forecast a Pounds 1.75bn shortage but revised that later
to Pounds 1.4bn. In early operations it purchased bills totalling Pounds
1bn, of which Pounds 741m were for resale to the market on January 10 at 5
13/32 per cent. In the afternoon it bought Pounds 8m of bills and provided
late assistance of Pounds 420m.
The Bank kept the market tight early in the week to counteract market
pressure for a rate cut, but 'having successfully made its point, the Bank
will now begin to be more accommodating', predicted Mr Philip Shaw, group
economist at Union Discount.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Cocoa slips but bulls
undismayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cocoa prices wilted under the heat of heavy speculative selling towards the
end of the week, although analysts remained bullish about the market's
longer term prospects.
After sustaining a Pounds 32 fall to Pounds 989 a tonne on Thursday the
London Commodity Exchange's March futures position yesterday broke through a
technical support area around the Pounds 980 mark as selling by a US
commission house and a UK broker snow-balled into a full-scale bear run. The
next support area, at Pounds 965 a tonne , was tested, but after a brief dip
to Pounds 963 a tonne the price bounced to Pounds 967 a tonne at the close,
down Pounds 69 on the week.
The peaceful transition of power this week in the Ivory Coast, the biggest
cocoa producer, following the death of veteran President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny, had removed one factor that had been helping the market to
hold on to recent gains. And sellers received further encouragement from
indications that the Ivorians might market next year's mid-crop - harvested
between April and June and amounting to about 15 per cent of the total -
immediately, rather than with the main crop, as they did this year.
Traders said there was also some profit-taking this week ahead of the
publication at the end of the year of European Union report that could
recommend the use of more cocoa butter substitutes in the manufacture of
chocolate.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodity analyst at London broker GNI, said he was
still 'a long-term bull towards cocoa' but thought the market had 'got a bit
ahead of itself and attracted a lot of speculative interest'. It could fall
to about Pounds 900 a tonne, he said, but there remained strong buying
interest.
The LCE coffee futures market had a tranquil week, with prices locked in a
narrow trading range. By yesterday's close the March position had
surrendered an earlier Dollars 13 rise to end the week Dollars 3 down on
balance at Dollars 1,264 a tonne.
London Metal Exchange contracts built on last week's strong gains on Monday
but then succumbed to a heavy bout of profit-taking that left most with net
losses on the week.
Zinc traders appeared to put a mildly bullish construction on reports that
weekend talks on plans for co-operatively financed European production cuts,
though inconclusive, were 'encouraging'.
But, ironically, Tuesday brought news that the Netherlands' Budel smelter,
which had seemed doomed to closure because of environmental problems, had
been saved by an eleventh hour deal with national and provincial governments
allowing the storage of hazardous, cadmium-containing waste. Budel supplies
about 5 per cent of the western world's zinc.
That day saw a sudden reversal in the fortunes of the zinc market, the three
months price ending a six-day, Dollars 80-a-tonne advance with a Dollars 37
fall to Dollars 996.50 a tonne. But that fall could be mainly attributed to
the sudden evaporation of the general bullish sentiment that had been
pervading the LME, and in particular to a sudden sell-off in the aluminium
market after a big rise in LME warehouse stocks was reported on Tuesday.
The three months price of zinc edged up Dollars 1 over the past two days to
end Dollars 30.75 down on balance at Pounds 987.50 a tonne; while the
aluminium price bounced from a mid-week low of Dollars 1,087.50 to close
yesterday at Dollars 1,114.50 a tonne, down Dollars 22.25 on the week.

the existing stock is tightly controlled. So further price rises for whites
are likely. Imports into the US are running behind both 1992 and 1991.
Muntok whites traded at Dollars 2,700 a tonne for January delivery, while in
New York the ex-warehouse price was Dollars 3,100 a tonne. Brazilian
supplies were offered at about Dollars 2,600 a tonne, fob The black pepper
market reflected the steadiness of the whites. Brazilian prices were
stronger, with the limited quantities offered all absorbed. Renewed Russian
interest in India pepper has brightened the prospects for the new crop. The
harvest in Kerala is said to be delayed.

FT  18 DEC 93 / International Company News: KPMG to conduct audit probe on
Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Euro Disney banks have appointed KPMG, the accountancy and consulting
group, to conduct an investigative audit of the troubled leisure company in
preparation for the negotiations over its emergency financial restructuring.
KPMG in Paris yesterday confirmed that it had been appointed by the steering
committee which represents the 60 international banks that hold Euro
Disney's FFr20.3bn (Dollars 3.5bn) net debt.
A team of auditors and consultants from KPMG's French subsidiary has already
started work on the audit, which is provisionally scheduled for completion
in January.
The audit has been commissioned by the steering committee, which includes 11
of Euro Disney's banks and is headed by Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and
Banque Indosuez. It is intended to produce a thorough analysis of Euro
Disney's present financial situation and its future capital requirements.
The banks last month decided to commission the audit after a meeting in
Paris at which representatives of Walt Disney, the US entertainment company
that owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney, presented their analysis of the Euro
Disney's finances.
A senior French banker on the steering committee said the banks were keen to
commission their own audit because of the 'dramatic nature' of Euro Disney's
difficulties. The group, which recently disclosed a FFr5.3bn net loss for
the year ended September, has such severe cash-flow problems that it is
expected to run out of money by the end of this year and turn to Walt Disney
for support.
Once the audit is completed the steering committee will begin full scale
negotiations with Euro Disney and its US parent. The Disney camp has already
said that it hopes the banks will agree to halve Euro Disney's debt to
roughly FFr10bn through the combination of a debt-for-equity swap and a
rights issue.
However, the final composition of the rescue package will be influenced by
the impact of Euro Disney's share price on the value of the rights issue.
The shares yesterday fell by FFr0.85 to FFr34.55 on concern about an
interview with Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chief executive, in Time magazine in
which he said that Euro Disney's future viability would be determined by the
outcome of the rescue negotiations.

ADollars 640m

<TEXT>
Sharply higher results from steel and lower interest charges offset a
decline in earnings from minerals at Broken Hill Proprietary, and allowed
Australia's largest industrial company to post a 27.5 per cent improvement
to ADollars 640m (Dollars 432m) in profits after tax for the six months
ending in November.
But the group warned that it would be difficult to sustain this progress in
the current six months.
'Profit outlook is sensitive to international commodity prices and these are
currently at depressed levels (which). . . will make it difficult to
maintain the improved profit performance in the second half of the year,'
said the company.
Moreover, at the operating level, BHP's profits increased by a far more
modest 5.9 per cent to ADollars 2.01bn in the first six months. Revenues
were up 4.2 per cent.
Commenting on divisional results, BHP said the upturn in the steel division
 -already marked in the first quarter of the year - was due to lower unit
costs, in turn resulting from increased production and the benefit of cost
reduction programmes.
Australian domestic steel despatches totalled 2.003m tonnes, a 17 per cent
advance over the previous year, and exports reached 1.267m tonnes, a 23 per
cent increase. Net profits, before interest, for the division were ADollars
288.2m.

FT  18 DEC 93 / International Company News: Curtain lifts on MGM's new era -
Martin Dickson on the studio's attempt to restore its reputation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pyrotechnically impressive series of explosions booms through the quiet
Santa Monica office suite of Mr Frank Mancuso as the new chairman of
troubled Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer shows a trailer for one of the film studio's
biggest 1994 box office hopes.
The film, called Blown Away, is an action adventure, featuring rugged stars
Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones, which pits the leader of a US big city
bomb squad against an ingenious bomber.
It is one of a group of new releases which both Mr Mancuso and MGM's French
owner, the Credit Lyonnais banking group, are relying on to restore the
tarnished reputation of the loss-making studio.
'We now have a release schedule I'm getting real happy with, starting in May
of 1994,' says Mr Mancuso, who was appointed chairman by Credit Lyonnais
last July as part of a broad plan to restore MGM to profit and then sell the
studio.
The bank found itself the embarrassed owner of MGM in 1992 after foreclosing
on loans it had made to Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier.
Credit Lyonnais has to sell MGM by 1997, because under US law a foreign bank
which takes control of a US company must divest it within five years. It
could, however, retain a minority stake.
Advised by Mr Michael Ovitz, head of the talent brokerage Creative Artists
Agency (CAA) and one of the most influential figures in Hollywood, the bank
decided against a quick asset fire-sale. Instead, it is re-building MGM in
the belief that a healthy studio will allow it to recoup much more of its
investment in the company, which tops Dollars 2bn.
That judgment is already looking shrewd: the estimated value of Hollywood
studios has risen sharply over the past three months.
As cable television and telecommunications companies jostle for position in
preparation for an age of inter-active, multi-media television, they are
trying to snatch up film companies to ensure themselves a reliable supply of
entertainment 'software' to fill their many TV channels.
MGM is a shadow of its former self. However, as one of Hollywood's
traditional big seven studios it retains a powerful brand name and an
important, though neglected, US film distribution network. It also owns a
one third share in United International Pictures, the London-based
international distributor, and its film library still contains over 1,500
titles, ranging from the 16 James Bond movies to the hit comedy Thelma and
Louise.
In short, MGM could make an attractive meal for a software-hungry
communications group, provided Mr Mancuso can start turning out a steady
stream of shows which perform well at the box office - and make money.
Mr Mancuso, 60, is a well-connected member of the Hollywood establishment,
having spent 30 years with one of the industry leaders, Paramount Pictures,
where he was chairman for seven years. He quit in 1991 after a row with the
studio's parent, Paramount Communications.
He says the company's problems stem from the unsettling environment of a
succession of owners and 'tremendous neglect for many years' before the bank
took control. This finally 'led to a perception in the community (Hollywood)
that it wasn't safe to make a movie at MGM'.
Credit Lyonnais has acted to restore financial faith in the business by
increasing its credit line to Dollars 400m to support expanded production;
and by removing some Dollars 820m of bank debt from its balance sheet,
giving it a healthy debt to equity ratio of 1 to 2.
Mr Mancuso, for his part, has shaken up senior production management,
appointing Mr Michael Marcus, a ex-CAA executive, as president of MGM
Pictures and Mr John Calley, a former Warner Brothers executive, as head of
United Artists, a famous but defunct studio owned by MGM which the company
is reviving as a second source of films.
Mr Marcus is likely to produce films with a mass-market entertainment
appeal, while Mr Calley will tend towards more cutting edge material.
The group aims to increase its output of films to between 15 and 20 a year,
and that, together with deals with producers Polygram and Carolco Pictures,
will give it some 25-28 films a year to push through its distribution
network, compared to 9 or 10 in recent years.
It is too soon to say whether the burst of activity will produce a run of
hits, but on paper the studio has several promising titles for 1994.
Still, in an important display of confidence in MGM's creative abilities,
cable television's Showtime Networks, a film channel, recently signed a
seven-year deal for exclusive premium television rights to 150 new MGM
movies.
MGM reckons the deal could be worth Dollars 1bn. 'Its a huge additional
element of distribution,' says Mr Mancuso. 'Its as good a deal as anyone has
in the business.' True or not, its a long time since MGM has had the
confidence to compare itself with the best in Hollywood.

FT  18 DEC 93 / International Company News: Senior staff at Matav agree
Dollars 15m pay-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior managers at Matav, the Hungarian state telecoms group, have taken a
leaf out of the western corporate practices book by awarding themselves
capacious golden parachutes.
Western telecoms consortia, which are bidding for 30 per cent of Matav, said
yesterday that 127 executives at the Hungarian group had teed-up severance
packages worth around Ft1.5bn (Dollars 15m).
The disclosure comes embarrassingly close to the announcement expected
tomorrow that a consortium of Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Ameritech of
the US has won the stake in Matav on sale in what is eastern Europe's
largest privatisation.
The Hungarian state holding company AV RT informed the competing consortia
about the liability on Monday, the day before final offers were due.
Officials told bidders they had only recently discovered the severance
arrangements themselves and it is believed that Matav management instituted
the generous terms in the last few weeks.
AV RT promised to indemnify the successful consortium against the liability
and discussed possible legal action against Matav executives.
The western group which wins Matav takes the right to nominate half of the
company's operating committee. Matav's current executives have been nervous
about personnel changes.
Under the terms of the contract, the western investor would not, however,
have the power to remove Mr Pal Horvath, managing director of Matav.
The Dollars 15m contingent liability is a relatively moderate sum by western
standards and in comparison with the value of the 30 per cent stake in Matav
which bids put at about Dollars 900m.
But in Hungary a year's basic state pension is a hundredth of the redundancy
payment now due to an average Matav executive.

International Business Machines is understood to be looking for a top
marketing executive from outside the group to run two of its units making
consumer products. The executive will spearhead a much stronger drive into
the consumer arena by IBM, which in the past has displayed some clumsiness
in the field.
The move follows the recent promotion of Mr James Cannavino to become IBM's
top corporate strategist. He was previously in charge of four business units
 -IBM PC, which makes personal computers; Power Personal Systems, which
handles the company's new Power PC chip; the RS/6000 division, which makes
sophisticated workstations; and the Personal Software Products Division,
which sells the company's OS/2 operating software.

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo's share price hit a record high yesterday as optimistic investors
maintained a buying spree that has pushed the group's stock up smartly since
it abruptly pulled out of a plan to merge with France's Renault two weeks
ago.
The most-traded B share closed yesterday at SKr524 (Dollars 62), up SKr15
from Thursday's close of SKr509 and 14 per cent ahead of its level of SKr458
just before the merger collapse was announced on December 2.
The advance was even greater when taken against the price of SKr407 on
November 25 when it appeared the merger would be approved by shareholders.
Although stock market sentiment had for weeks favoured a breakdown of the
merger, Volvo shares fell significantly in the days following the collapse,
touching SKr435 on December 6.
Many had already discounted the deal's failure and others were alarmed by
the resignation statement of former chairman Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar. He
predicted the end of an existing alliance with Renault and voiced doubts
about Volvo's long-term ability to survive.
In the last 10 days, however, the earlier judgment that Volvo will produce
better earnings on its own than in league with Renault, where profits are
sagging, has reasserted itself.

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Unilever identifies new joint chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Niall FitzGerald, the Irish-born head of Unilever's detergents
operations, emerged yesterday as the heir-apparent to Mr Michael Perry as
joint chairman of the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group.
Mr FitzGerald, 48, will become a vice chairman of Unilever in May. A year
later he will join the 'special committee', Unilever's most senior
management body, whose other members are the group's joint chairmen.
Appointment to the special committee has long been viewed as preparation for
the top job. Mr Perry is due to retire after four years as chairman in May
1996, when he will be 62.
If Mr FitzGerald succeeds him, he will be one of youngest chairmen in
Unilever's 63-year history and will also be the first not to be born British
or Dutch.
The group also confirmed yesterday that Mr Morris Tabaksblat, currently
third member of the special committee, will succeed Mr Floris Maljers, who
retires in May after 10 years as the group's Dutch chairman.
Mr Tabaksblat, aged 56, has played a leading role in reorganising Unilever's
food businesses in the past few years and was closely involved in the late
1980s in acquiring US cosmetics companies, including Chesebrough-Ponds,
Elizabeth Arden and Faberge.
Mr FitzGerald, who joined Unilever in 1967, is an accountant by training who
has spent much of his career in financial posts. In 1990, he was made
responsible for all Unilever's food activities in northern Europe, and the
following year was put in charge of the worldwide detergents side, which has
annual sales of about Pounds 6bn.

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Banks agree refinancing for William Hill
chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Brent Walker, the troubled leisure group, appeared more secure
yesterday as its lead bankers agreed to take up the slack on a Pounds 370m
refinancing of its betting shop chain, William Hill.
The protracted negotiations over a refinancing ended in the early evening as
Standard Chartered and Lloyds Bank agreed to take on the Pounds 120m
shortfall. This is believed to have left the two banks with total exposure
to William Hill of more than Pounds 200m. After including loans to Brent
Walker, the banks are thought to be owed more than Pounds 400m.
The debt, which was due to be repaid on March 1, will now be extended until
1999. The company said yesterday it had ceased to consider alternatives such
as a flotation or sale of William Hill. It had been estimated that either of
these two options would raise between Pounds 470m and Pounds 550m.
William Hill's management had been thought to prefer either the flotation or
sale option which would have given it the freedom increase its capital
expenditure.
The refinancing will demolish the ring fence which has protected William
Hill from Brent Walker's bankers. The leisure group will take on William
Hill's debts and have complete control in return. This will leave Brent
Walker with borrowings of substantially more than Pounds 1.4bn.
Lloyds said the two lead banks would now seek to syndicate the William Hill
debt. Although this had proved difficult in recent weeks, the bank said
potential investors had been distracted by the possibility of an imminent
flotation.
It is thought that the banks and Brent Walker are aiming to float William
Hill after two years. 'We believe that the value of William Hill will
increase significantly during the next few years,' Lloyds said.
The proposal to float William Hill before March had proved unpopular with
Brent Walker's banks and could have ended the company's chances of survival,
according to one insider. The leisure group's refinancing in 1992 had been
based on the retention of two cash generative businesses - William Hill and
Pubmaster. Without William Hill, the prospect of Brent Walker's banks being
repaid appeared uncertain.
Brent Walker said it had submitted to its bankers proposals to amend certain
terms and conditions of borrowings as agreed in the 1992 refinancing. A
circular to shareholders and subordinated loan note holders was expected to
be sent out next month.

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Manweb increases to Pounds 55m and raises
dividend 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manweb rounded off the electricity distributors' interim results season by
announcing a 14.75 per cent dividend rise from pre-tax profits ahead from
Pounds 37.1m to Pounds 54.9m for the six months ended September 30.
Unlike some other regional companies, which have reported dividend rises of
up to 32 per cent, the distributor for North Wales and Merseyside is not
rebalancing payments between the two halves of the year.
Analysts believe that a 15 per cent rise is likely for the full year and
that that will be about average for regional companies.
Unlike other recs, the company has not restated its 1992 figures to take
account of changes in coal contracts.
The company said the underlying profits increase was 25 per cent but added
it did not expect to see such a high percentage growth for the year as a
whole.
Turnover was Pounds 437.4m (Pounds 408.9m) and earnings 34.1p (23.5p) per
share.
The interim dividend is lifted from 6.1p to 7p.
Mr John Roberts, chief executive, said the company added about 90 staff to
reach 4,600 in the first half, but added that after cutting 20 per cent of
staff since privatisation it was concentrating on improving quality through
investment in people and services.
Complaints fell 58 per cent and disconnections dropped by 98 per cent to the
lowest rate in the country.
Units distributed grew by 2.14 per cent, or 1.7 per cent weather corrected.
Manweb's supply business was helped by the gain of 15 large customers
outside the area.
The retail side incurred losses of Pounds 500,000, against profits of Pounds
200,000.
COMMENT
Now here is an electricity company with a difference. While other regional
companies are falling over themselves to answer the city's demands for job
cuts, Manweb calmly announces that its headcount went up marginally in the
first half of the year, and sees its shares rise later in the day. If the
company pays 24.1p this year, the shares are on a prospective yield of 4 per
cent, confirming Manweb as one of the highest rated companies. Investors
like the highly personable Mr Roberts and the messages he and his team
convey. Other recs have told similar stories on improving customer services
but somehow he makes it sound more plausible than most; but what the City
really admires is the company's stick-to-basics approach. Manweb may have
net cash of Pounds 21m but it is not about to follow water companies into
dangerous acquisitions and it is the only rec to have eschewed
diversification into gas-fired electricity generation. The test of the
generation policy will be in the back half of the decade when other
companies reap the benefits or suffer the consequences of their
diversification. In the meanwhile Manweb is likely to remain a sector
favourite.

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Europa poised to close merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a five-month delay, terms for the proposed three-way merger of Europa
Minerals, a small UK mining finance house, with Burmine and Austmin Gold,
two Australian companies with which it is already closely involved, will
soon be announced.
Europa said the Australian Securities Commission has now given approval in
principle for its merger with Burmine. When the ASC formally documents its
approval, probably next week, 'implementation of the merger can go ahead,'
the UK company said.
First news of the proposed merger was given in July, and in October Europa
said terms would be announced that month. In the meantime, another
Australian gold producer, Mt Edon, has also bid for Burmine in which it has
built a 22.6 per cent stake.
Mt Edon also owns 19.9 per cent of Europa and made an informal approach to
the UK group, but was rebuffed. The contest is made even more complex by the
fact that Europa already owns 38.5 per cent of Burmine and Austmin holds
19.8 per cent of Europa.
Henry Ansbacher, the UK merchant bank, owns 12.8 per cent of Europa
following a poorly-received rights issue of shares that it underwrote last
year.

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: J Bibby names executive flotation team
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
J Bibby yesterday named the executive team which will lead the Pounds 75m
flotation of its paper, scientific and agricultural businesses next year.
Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive of Compass Group, the catering and
healthcare company, has been appointed non-executive chairman, while Mr Alan
Gresty, Bibby's finance director, will become chief executive.
Mr Mackay, who once said the role of a non-executive was to create maximum
embarrassment with minimum effort, led Compass through its 1987 management
buy-out from Grand Metropolitan and eventual flotation. Mr Gresty, who has
been with Bibby since 1969, will resign as finance director on flotation. He
was appointed finance director in 1985, and has been a director of the
company's agricultural division since 1979.
Bibby announced plans to float the three divisions in October, in an effort
to reduce its Pounds 123m debt. Profits were hit and borrowings spiralled
after the Pounds 82m hostile takeover of Finanzauto, the Spanish Caterpillar
distributor, last year.
Barlow Rand, South Africa's largest industrial group, currently owns 79 per
cent of Bibby.

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Chrysalis turns in Pounds 14.6m loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysalis, the music and entertainment group, yesterday announced a full
year pre-tax loss of Pounds 14.6m, but said it would pay its first dividend
since April 1991.
The result for the year to August 31 included Pounds 15.5m in trading losses
and closure costs at MAM Leisure, the amusement machine arm, and other
discontinued businesses.
This compares with a profit of Pounds 5.6m last year. The 1992 outcome
included Pounds 11.6m in gains from the sale of Chrysalis Records to Thorn
EMI.
The group has started a new recording division under the Echo label.
Turnover was Pounds 73.6m, against Pounds 65.9m. A tax credit of Pounds 5.6m
reduced losses after tax to Pounds 9m.
The dividend is 3.25p. Losses per share were 34.44p (earnings 26.02p).

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Trio Pounds 5.08m in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trio Holdings, the revamped investment trust, yesterday returned to the
black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.08m for the 12 months to September
30, against losses of Pounds 68,000 in the previous 15 months.
The company, which last month warned that full year results would not meet
market expectations, described the figures as 'satisfactory'.
'In the event, our results were better than the current market
expectations,' said Mr David Hagan, chairman.
Turnover was Pounds 72.7m, against a nil figure for the previous period. The
balance sheet shows net tangible assets at the year end of Pounds 17.4m
(Pounds 1.46m).
Fully diluted earnings per share were 2.93p, compared with losses of 0.85p.
The final dividend is 1.5p making 2.5p (nil) for the year.
The results mark the first meaningful full year since the restructuring and
the takeover in January of Martin Bierbaum, the moneybroker, which
contributed for eight months.
The restructuring was directed by Mr Hagan who in May 1992 was given the job
of trying to revitalise a trust which had been brought to the stock market
16 months earlier at 50p per share by Raphael Zorn.
It had been set up as a specialist trust for investors with personal equity
plans. But the trust lost its original sense of purpose after rules were
changed and was trading at a substantial discount to its then Pounds 1.6m of
net assets.
Mr Hagan said: 'I regard the results as satisfactory but the core of the
group's traditional strength is in foreign exchange markets which have been
periodically subdued. Nonetheless, we are continuing to implement our
programme to revitalise the business.'

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Reuters expands with Dollars 125m cash
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters Holdings, the international news and information group, yesterday
announced the acquisition of Teknekron Software Systems for Dollars 125.1m
(Pounds 83.9m) cash.
Teknekron, a software supplier and systems integrator based in Palo Alto,
California with a workforce of 200, had turnover last year of Dollars 38.7m
and pre-tax profits of Dollars 8.2m. Net assets at the end of 1992 were
Dollars 3.6m.
Reuters said the fact that most of the consideration represented goodwill
and intangible assets would allow the group to benefit from US tax benefits
over 15 years, cutting the net cost of the acquisition considerably. It is
acquiring the shares from management, employees and venture capitalists.
Mr Vivek Ranadive, president and chief executive of Teknekron, said the
company's business was aimed at enabling workers 'to access all the
information assets of their corporate environment.'
Mr David Ure, Reuters' executive director for marketing and development,
said Teknekron's products were similar to those of Reuters' Triarch, but
that Teknekron was supplying markets outside the financial sector, such as
the oil and semiconductor manufacturing industries.
Reuters would benefit from Teknekron's technology and wider markets, he
said.
The group would in particular be looking at building operating links between
the Triarch and Teknekron systems.
Reuters has 212,000 information outlets worldwide, including 350 of the
latest digital Triarch systems.
Both Teknekron and Triarch systems are designed to allow the user to access
digital information from any source.
Under the deal, which has to clear both the US and UK regulatory
authorities, Teknekron will retain operational control of the company.
Two non-executive directors from Reuters will join the Teknekron board.
Teknekron's management will also benefit from a stock appreciation plan,
similar to a share option scheme.
Mr Ure said Reuters considered it was best to leave Teknekron to operate
independently, but the company would benefit from the backing of a large
group.
Barriers to entry in the software market were extremely low, he added.

FT  18 DEC 93 / International Company News: Irish bank sells DCC stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Ireland, the principal shareholder in DCC, the private Dublin-based
industrial holding company, has sold its 20 per cent stake of 2.7m shares in
the company at IPounds 10 (950p) per share to leading fund managers in the
UK and Ireland, prior to next year's planned flotation of the company.
DCC began as a venture capital company in 1984, with funding from the Bank
of Ireland and other leading Irish institutions.
Mr Pat Molloy, Bank of Ireland's group chief executive, said: 'Following
DCC's evolution into an industrial holding company, it is no longer
appropriate for Bank of Ireland, as a commercial banking group, to retain a
shareholding in DCC.'
The sale of Bank of Ireland's stake values the total 13.6m DCC shares in
issue at IPounds 136m. Last month DCC reported a 59 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to IPounds 8.31m for the six months to September 30 and
announced its first interim dividend of 5.52p.
The company said it planned a public flotation next year in May-June or
September-October 'depending on market conditions'.
DCC is 95 per cent owned by institutional investors. Mr Jim Flavin, chief
executive, thanked Bank of Ireland for being 'a strong, supportive
shareholder since 1984' and said 'we are pleased to welcome the significant
new investors in DCC'. These include PDFM, Gartmore Investment and Mercury
Asset Management in the UK and IBI nominees and AIB Capital Markets in
Ireland.

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Conrad losses reach Pounds 1.48m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Conrad, the Manchester-based sports, leisure and consultancy group, has
agreed to pay Pounds 1m in cash and shares for Inter Research, a specialist
human resource consultancy.
The group also reported a widening of losses from Pounds 297,000 to Pounds
1.48m pre-tax for the half year to end-June after taking account of an
exceptional provision of Pounds 527,000.
Turnover totalled Pounds 770,000 (Pounds 2.82m) and losses per share emerged
at 3.26p compared with 1.01p.
At the December 31 year-end, the pre-tax deficit stood at a restated Pounds
638,000.
The company has changed its year-end to June 30 to 'more sensibly fit' its
trading pattern.
Initial consideration for the acquisition of Pounds 400,000 will be
satisfied via the issue of 7m new shares and Pounds 50,000 cash. The Pounds
600,000 balance is dependent on performance.
Conrad is also proposing to raise about Pounds 410,000 net by the placing of
12.5m new shares at 4p, of which the directors have undertaken to subscribe
to 1.8m.
Mr Rodney Walker, chairman, said that for the first time since 1988 'the
group as a whole is trading profitably and ahead of budget.'
He was confident that Conrad would return to profit in the current year.

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Asda advances 14% to Pounds 105m - Chairman
warns of serious threat from 'stampede of discounters'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's food retailers face a serious threat from a 'stampede of
discounters', said Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, yesterday as
he unveiled a 14 per cent jump in first-half operating profits.
Mr Norman warned that the rapidly growing number of discounters, such as
Aldi, Netto and Kwik Save, would double their market share in the next two
to three years.
Contrary to comments made by other retail chains, Mr Norman said discounters
and warehouse clubs inevitably took sales from the superstores. 'A good Kwik
Save will take Pounds 30,000 a week off our sales,' he said.
However, he stressed that Asda had found 'a survival route, and a profitable
one,' in fending off competition. 'Our space in the market will be Dales -
Asda's own discounting chain which offers a higher proportion of fresh foods
 -the superstores and the hypermarkets', he said.
Discounters would pose the most significant threat in the south-east of
England, where Asda had a lower exposure than the bigger chains. The group
would also be offering a wider range of fresh food, clothing and leisure
products as well as focusing on its value for money brand.
Asda's strategy appeared to be paying off with like for like sales up 9 per
cent to Pounds 2.4bn, with little impact from inflation. Operating profits
rose from Pounds 91.9m to Pounds 105m for the 28 weeks to November 13.
Pre-tax profits were depressed by the absence of last year's Pounds 98.1m
exceptional gains on disposals and fell by 34 per cent from Pounds 126.7m to
Pounds 83.9m.
Profits were also hit by an increased loss of Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 11.9m)
from the Allied Maples business. Both the carpet and furniture businesses
have since been sold to management.
The store renewal programme was gathering pace, with 32 completed by
Christmas at a cost of roughly Pounds 2m to Pounds 3m each.
Total capital spending in the first half was Pounds 126m, with a further
Pounds 100m budgeted for the second six months.
Debt was down from Pounds 471.6m to Pounds 55.3m, following January's Pounds
347m rights issue. Interest charges fell from Pounds 51.9m to Pounds 7.9m.
The interim dividend is increased by 10 per cent to 0.55p. Earnings, hit by
the absence of exceptional gains, fell from 4.87p to 2.03p.

Pre-tax profits of Reliance Security, the USM-quoted security provider, rose
10 per cent from Pounds 905,000 to Pounds 991,000 in the 27 weeks to
November 5.
The improvement was struck on turnover marginally ahead from Pounds 34.1m to
Pounds 35.3m and was helped by a reduced loss of Pounds 430,000 (Pounds
502,000) in the electronic surveillance business.
Mr Brian Kingham, chairman, said that although there were some positive
signs, recovery from recession seemed likely to be slow.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.1p, payable from earnings per share
up from 2.7p to 3p.

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional leaves Compco in red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Difficulties at one of its joint venture properties, resulting in an
exceptional debit of Pounds 550,003, left Compco Holdings, the property
investment and development concern, with pre-tax losses of Pounds 198,149
for the six months to September 25, against Pounds 318,860 profits.
Mr David Pickford, chairman, said that as a result of the difficulties, the
value of the group's interest in the joint venture was uncertain and
therefore full provision was made.
He added that in the past three months there had been a noticeable increase
in activity in the property sector and this improvement in market conditions
had been reflected in the recent letting of the majority of vacancies in the
group's properties.
Losses were struck after interest payable of Pounds 283,756 (Pounds

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Reduced deficit at United Inds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The reorganisation implemented since the arrival in March of Mr Tom Brown as
chief executive is beginning to bear fruit at United Industries, the
precision spring, materials handling and process machinery group.
Helped by a reduced interest burden, pre-tax losses for the six months to
October 2 were reduced to Pounds 553,000, against Pounds 1.93m. Turnover
from continuing operations amounted to Pounds 13m (Pounds 14.1m).
The outcome was struck after a further exceptional charge of Pounds 133,000
for redundancy and reorganisation costs; there was a debit totalling Pounds
1.41m last time, largely reflecting losses on the disposal of the cutting
tool operation.
Losses per share were cut from 5.23p to 1.48p.

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Eliza Tinsley down to Pounds 0.33m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eliza Tinsley Group, the USM-quoted maker of hardware products, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 408,000 to Pounds 329,000 for the
six months ended September 30 1993.
The result contrasted with a 40 per cent increase in profit to Pounds
713,000 for the 1992-93 year. Turnover in the half year improved from Pounds
7.47m to Pounds 7.86m but pressure on margins affected the result.
The interim dividend is increased from 1.8p to 1.96p on earnings per share
of 2.84p (3.57p).
Mr Andrew Hall is to be co-opted to the board as chief executive in January.
Following this, Mr David Fletcher will resign as chairman but stay on the
board. Mr Jeremy Sharp, presently chief executive, will become chairman.

Pre-tax losses at Unit Group widened from Pounds 83,000 to Pounds 595,000 in
the six months to end-September. Turnover fell from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds
8.51m. Comparisons were restated to conform with FRS 3.
Directors of the USM-quoted maker of timber pallets blamed the fall on a
further decline in volumes, coupled with an increase in timber prices which
could not be passed on to customers.
In spite of the trading losses, the group continued to reduce borrowings,
reflected in a fall in interest charges to Pounds 157,000 (Pounds 224,000).
Losses per share came out at 11p (1.6p).

FT  18 DEC 93 / Go-getters wait for starting gun: Norma Cohen on the outlook
for a possible successor to the USM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's Unlisted Securities Market is dying. Is there going to be a son of
USM?
If European venture capitalists have their say, the London Stock Exchange
would accelerate plans for a new offspring. At a recent seminar, together
with the chairmen of many small companies, they were asked whether they
would prefer to list shares on the London Stock Exchange or a new exchange
tailored to their requirements. The answer was overwhelming. The
entrepreneurial companies' exchange won hands down.
The seminar indicated the widespread dissatisfaction among small companies
at the way they are crowded out by large companies who dominate the London
Stock Exchange's official list.
Last April, the City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco), a group of UK
venture capitalists, small company chairman and stockbrokers, published a
paper calling for a new Enterprise Market for the trading of smaller
companies' shares.
The model, Cisco says, would be the US-based Nasdaq, which was set up in the
1970s as an exchange for small companies but is now the second-largest stock
market in the world by trading volume, and includes many large companies. It
expanded rapidly in the 1980s as fast-growing companies such as Apple,
Microsoft and Intel chose it for the initial public offerings of their
shares.
Mr Richard Balarkas, chief executive of Cisco, says the group would prefer
to see a new UK enterprise exchange, which it estimates would cost Pounds
20m to develop independently, operating under the aegis of the existing
London Stock Exchange. But it has investigated whether there might be
alternative commercial providers, including Nasdaq, because it fears that it
will be some time, if at all, before the stock exchange acts.
This week such worries have come to a head. The stock exchange's board
shelved a report from its own smaller companies' working party which
recommended a new Nasdaq-type Enterprise Exchange - similar to that proposed
by Cisco - to replace the USM which is due to close by 1996.' The existing
official list clearly meets the financing needs of many smaller companies,'
the board says. Some 90 companies have floated their shares on the stock
exchange official list so far this year, it adds.
According to the exchange, the USM's closure later this decade was announced
earlier this year partly because it was becoming increasingly difficult to
distinguish between companies trading there and those on the official list.
Moreover recent amendments to the qualifications required for a listing on
the main exchange will make it easier still for small, high-technology
companies - including those which have not yet sold any products - to raise
equity capital on the official list.
However, the exchange acknowledges 'a widespread perception that the needs
of smaller companies are not always adequately catered for' and promises
further market research. Mr Giles Vardy, market development director at the
exchange and a member of the working party, says that the idea of a new
market for small companies has not been totally rejected.
Privately, however, some members of Cisco believe the stock exchange is not
prepared to cede ground to a potential rival. Already the exchange has seen
some of its core functions - such as its monopoly over the distribution of
share price information and its role in settling share transactions - taken
over by others. Its control over the listing of shares remains one of the
few areas where its dominance has not been questioned; an enterprise
exchange, with its own board of directors and chief executive, would do just
that, even if under the wing of the main exchange.
Mr Vardy, however, denies that the exchange is trying to block a potential
competitor. 'We have no divine right to run the only stock exchange in this
country,' he says.
The exchange's reticence may be justified. While many venture capitalists
are convinced that an enterprise exchange will draw investors, their
confidence is not universal. During the past few years of recession, small
companies have watched helplessly as trading in shares listed on the USM
fizzled out and investors withdrew their capital.
'In a bull market, there is nothing that avarice will not overcome,' says Mr
Brian Winterflood, chairman of Winterflood Securities which specialises in
small company shares. 'What we want is a market which will stand up in a
recession.'
Mr Neil Austen, partner in the corporate finance practice at KPMG Peat
Marwick, says: 'The USM achieved some of the aims of smaller companies. But
it was overtaken by changes in fashion and culture. It was seen by
entrepreneurs as an end in itself and many of the companies traded there
didn't have a clear strategy. They couldn't cope with the downturn.'
Now, as the economy emerges from recession, it remains unclear whether there
would be sufficient interest from either institutional or private investors.
Mr Geoffrey Madrell, chief executive of Pro-Share, an organisation which
promotes individual share ownership in the UK, argues that the US experience
shows that it is small investors who are likely to drive the new market.
Large institutions, he says, regard substantial investment in many small
companies as too risky and not worth the research effort.
But Mr Austen, believes the behaviour of small private investors in the past
few years show they are unlikely, either, to show much interest in an
enterprise exchange. 'If privatisations and the discounts they carry have
not attracted private individuals, then nothing will,' he says.
A possible means of stimulating private investor involvement would be for
institutions to package shares in enterprise market companies into
easily-tradable unit and investment trusts.
If Nasdaq is a guide, such a stimulus may prove essential in the early
stages of a new market. Initially, private investors accounted for more than
half the trading volume on Nasdaq although subsequently the figure has
fallen.
But Nasdaq officials do not believe their experience can necessarily be
repeated in the UK. Firstly, the US system of regulation has promoted
competition between many different exchanges. In the UK, the London Stock
Exchange still faces little competition.
Nasdaq's success reflects its ability to attract well-managed companies with
good products. 'When a small company lists on Nasdaq, retail investors are
interested because they all want to buy the next Intel or Apple,' says one
exchange official. The US system has spawned a multitude of stockbrokers who
track the shares of some of the smallest companies, helping private
investors to find bargains among the multitude of choices.
The creation of a US-style exchange for entrepreneurial companies looks a
long way off in Britain. The stock exchange must decide whether it wants to
be the creator of this new market, or whether it will allow a competitor to
take the initiative. But the debate about structure may prove secondary to
the central question of whether British investors are prepared to commit
their cash.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Populism at war with political correctness: Simon Holberton
says Chris Patten's confrontation with Beijing is about to heat up but
investors seem unconcerned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stage is now set in Hong Kong for a battle between populist politics and
the might of the Chinese Communist party. When Governor Chris Patten tabled
the first part of his democracy legislation this week he almost certainly
brought to an end Anglo-Chinese co-operation on the colony's political
development.
The contest, which promises to exacerbate already deep divisions, will
accelerate the decline of British power in Hong Kong in favour of the
mainland Chinese. It is in China's gift to make this contest as benign or
bloody as it chooses.
But it is clear that international and domestic investors regard the row
over democracy as little more than a sideshow. Continuing the gains it has
made in recent weeks, Hong Kong stock market's Hang Seng index ended
yesterday at a record of 10,568.86, up more than 2 per cent on Thursday's
close.
With mainland Chinese politics in a relatively stable period, Beijing's push
for economic liberalisation, together with the colony's pre-eminent position
as the gateway to China, has made Mr Patten's agenda for democratic reform a
secondary issue. Since 1984, when Britain and China signed the joint
declaration ceding sovereignty of the colony to Beijing in 1997, the Hong
Kong and Chinese economies have become increasingly dependent on each other:
as close as 'lips and teeth', say mainland officials.
As the chart shows, China's dependence on the port of Hong Kong for its
international trade has grown considerably. Hong Kong (and Macao) account
for the largest share of 'foreign' investment in China. In addition,
mainland interests have shareholdings on Hong Kong's stock market worth a
minimum of HKDollars 120bn; many observers believe the figure is much
higher.
For the colony, economic conditions across the border on the mainland are
crucial: about a quarter of its Gross Domestic Product is dependent on
activities derived from links with China.
All this serves to underline what has become apparent as the talks between
the UK and China have soured: increasing economic interdependence means that
much influence has already transferred to Beijing and that, whatever
political measures China plans to take against Britain, Hong Kong's economy
will be spared retribution.
Yet because the UK will not give China what it wants - a compliant
legislature - and because China still likes to vest all political control in
the Communist party, Hong Kong has to pass through one last rite of passage
before its formal return to Chinese sovereignty.
Beijing signaled the beginning of conflict on Wednesday evening when the
Xinhua News Agency called on the people of Hong Kong to work with the
mainland's representatives in the colony for a 'smooth transition' to
Chinese sovereignty.
This was a reference to the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), set up in
Beijing in the summer. It consists of mainland officials and several
prominent Hong Kong citizens, including Mr Li Ka-shing, the businessman, Mrs
Rita Fan, a former member of Mr Patten's executive council (colonial
cabinet), and Mr Tsang Yok Sing, a spokesman for the left wing in the
colony's politics.
The job of the PWC is to prepare the ground for a 'preparatory committee',
which will be created under Beijing's auspices in 1996 to prepare for the
takeover. As Anglo-Chinese relations have deteriorated, the PWC's remit has
changed. It will now engage in 'practical work', including devising, by July
next year, a method of electing the Legislative Council after 1997. The
timing is significant: July is when the Hong Kong government wants LegCo to
finish discussing Mr Patten's democracy legis-lation.
Already the pro-Beijing press has begun to question the 'Chineseness' of
some leading pro-democracy advocates in the colony. One recently said Ms
Christine Loh and Ms Anna Wu - two liberal-minded Patten appointees to LegCo
 -were 'women with striking western values and little feel for China and its
ancient ways'.
As Beijing has begun to prepare its tactics for the months ahead, so to has
Mr Patten. Earlier this month he told LegCo that he would 'employ all the
rhetorical talents at our command' to put into place arrangements that the
UK and Hong Kong governments think are in the best interests of the colony.
This week the campaign got off to a low-key start, with Mr Patten soliciting
individual legislators' support for the bill introduced on Wednesday. The
measure will lower Hong Kong's voting age to 18 from 21 and abolish
appointments to local government councils. It will also create single seat
constituencies for local government and 20 of LegCo's 60 seats.
The government is confident that about 50 LegCo members will support this
so-called 'first-stage' bill. There are signs, however, that support could
be weakening. The Liberal (conservative) party, which has 14 votes, is
split. The majority feel the party's credibility will be fatally damaged if
it fails to support the bill but a vociferous minority feel the party should
side with China.
The outcome of this internal conflict is unclear, but in the unlikely event
that the Liberal party votes against the government, Mr Patten would still
command a majority. 'I think we are home and dry' on the first-stage bill,
one senior government official noted.
The second phase of Mr Patten's campaign will coincide with the tabling  -
around the beginning of March - of his second bill. This will seek to
broaden democratic participation in the election of LegCo's remaining 40
seats. His campaign is expected to include public meetings, walkabouts
across the colony, and more intensive lobbying of LegCo members.
China has yet to respond to Mr Patten's plans. It may treat the legislative
process with the contempt it thinks it deserves. It may respond in kind by
organising 'patriotic' demonstrations against British rule.
Whatever the outcome of the Legco debates, China has promised fresh
elections after the 1997 takeover along lines to be determined partly by the
PWC's deliberations, but mainly by Beijing's requirement that LegCo be
quiescent.
As Mr Patten has discovered, China's concept of 'one country, two systems'
always meant a capitalist Hong Kong operating within the overarching
sovereignty and political control of Beijing.
The omens are reasonable that Hong Kong's capitalist system will survive the
political rows of the coming six months. But as economic influence drifts
into Beijing's hands, Mr Patten will find that his strength in the battle
will also diminish. By 1997, the best he may be able to say is that, however
belatedly, he at least tried to introduce the kind of democratic structures
the UK believed were right.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Irony behind unfairness of capital
gains plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof D R MYDDELTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You are right to criticise the government's budget proposal to abolish
indexation in calculating losses for capital gains tax (Leading article:
'Trickery with capital gains', December 13). The revenue yield will be very
small, but that is not the point. Both the proposal to tax 'unreal' net
capital gains and its retrospective aspect are unfair to taxpayers.
This is the sort of thing that brings government into disrepute. It is
ironic that the main supposed justification for taxing capital gains in the
first place was to 'add fairness' to the tax system.
You say it 'may be difficult to retreat from the principle of partial
de-indexation'. On the contrary, it should be easy - as well as highly
desirable - to retreat from a swindle.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Controversy about St Petersburg
development achieved only by a manipulation of the facts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SAM D PATERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Colin Amery's article, 'A monster that may ruin St Petersburg'
(December 13) is a regrettable example of journalistic licence which only
presents selected facts to fit a distorted image.
The illustration of the tower which he used was a product of Lennilprojekt -
one of St Petersburg's design institutes. Moreover, the illustration which
you published is not of the latest model. The concept has been around for at
least 20 years, and is purely home-grown. Wilson Mason's involvement is as
project-managers and as designers of certain aspects of the building which
will affect its letability, eg, the core. We have had a team in St
Petersburg for several months now, in close co-operation with Lennilprojekt,
the city architect and authorities, in order to ensure that neither local
sensibilities nor an architectural heritage second to none are trampled on;
how dare this one-day wonder assert otherwise?
Far from hanging our heads in shame, we are extremely proud to be associated
with a project which can only benefit St Petersburg by keeping rampant
commercial development out of the city centre and which will attract
incoming investment. We note that even the FT itself is aware of the need to
locate its buildings, in one instance at least, away from the City. What
would Mr Amery have made of a photograph of the FT's printing plant
juxtaposed, however innocently, beside one of St Pauls?
Architects also recognise the beauty of the historic parts of St Petersburg.
However, the fact that the proposed tower is to be built on the extreme edge
of the city and cannot be seen from the centre is an inconvenient fact far
from his viewpoint. I wonder what our Russian friends would make of Mr
Amery's cerebral observation that 'St Petersburg should advance slowly'?
Would he prefer them to live some kind of limbo existence in a giant theme
park?
If Mr Amery has set out to be controversial, then he has only succeeded by a
manipulation of the facts in this instance. His pious posturing is pure
humbug.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Vision that will build information
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NEIL A MCEVOY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Nick Moore (Letters, December 16) argues against himself in his
support for Mr Delors' proposals on 'info-highways'. Yes, the UK already has
the strongest European telecommunications and information services sectors,
precisely because of its relatively laissez faire approach to the industry.
Certainly Britain's 19th century investments in railways were handsomely
repaid in growth across the economy. However, this did not occur because
'Britain had the vision to invest', but because individual entrepreneurs had
that vision.
Any regular reader of your paper could easily determine that the information
services already available (and widely taken up) in the US far outstrip
those available in Europe. Further, provision of the software which makes it
all happen is an industry dominated by US companies, most of which didn't
exist 15 years ago. None of this happened because of an all-encompassing
government plan, but because of the vision and boldness of thousands of
ordinary engineers and businessmen. If a largely dirigiste (and still
protectionist) Europe competes with a largely free enterprise US in
information services, then all Europeans will be the losers.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Home game, away fans: Staging the World Cup in the US is a
gamble for its organisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When they held the draw for the 1990 World Cup finals in Rome, Luciano
Pavarotti was the star of the show. When the draw for the 1994 World Cup
finals is held in Las Vegas tomorrow, Barry Manilow will be the main
attraction.
Pavarotti was a natural host in Rome because he loves football and is an
international star. Manilow, however, like most Americans, does not - at
least not enough to convey its excitement on radio and television to his
home-grown fans.
The organisers of the World Cup have had trouble finding an American grown
superstar to extol the virtues of 'soccer' to a country with no footballing
tradition. So it is important that the stars who perform in person or by
satellite tomorrow - Rod Stewart, Elton John, Robin Williams and James Brown
 -do so with the kind of pizzazz normally reserved for a Super Bowl
half-time show. Otherwise, Mr and Mrs Middle America might ignore the event
altogether.
'All we're looking for is some exposure,' says Jim Trecker, senior
vice-president of World Cup '94, the organising committee in the US.
Outside the US, the going should be easier. Fans around the world usually
follow the draw closely to discover which country their national team will
be playing in the opening round of the tournament. A global audience of
about half a billion people is expected to watch the ceremony live tomorrow.
But only a fraction of that number will be in the US. While the draw will be
shown on ESPN cable sports channel, none of the country's three main
networks is broadcasting the event, which is not surprising since most
Americans know little about football or the World Cup. Although millions of
children play the game - it is regarded as safe and inexpensive - their
interest rarely survives beyond their teens.
The reasons are plain: since the North American Soccer League folded in 1985
there has been no fully-fledged professional league which they could support
or which they might join as players. In addition, football is rarely shown
on television, apparently with good reason. A poll last year by a Dallas
sports marketing group found it ranked 95th among 124 sports Americans liked
to watch. Dog-sledding and log rolling ranked higher.
So if Americans are uninterested in the game, why is the World Cup being
held in the US?
Two words hold the answer: ambition and money. In 1988, the Federation of
International Football Associations, the world governing body, selected the
US to host the 1994 finals because it wanted to conquer the last big
developed country which had not embraced 'the world game'. It also wanted to
make a lot of money in the process.
Fifa is almost certain to achieve the latter. A roster of blue-chip US
companies - including Coca-Cola, General Motors, Mastercard and McDonald's -
have lined up to pay as much as Dollars 20m each to Fifa to earn the status
of sponsor of the World Cup - not because they want to reach their domestic
market, but because they want to tap into the global marketplace. Sponsors
can attach their logos to World Cup merchandise and publicity material and
can buy prime television advertising slots. It is estimated that by the time
the 52nd and final game is over, a cumulative audience of 25bn to 30bn will
have watched the World Cup.
Aside from corporate sponsorship, Fifa has received Dollars 300m for the
international broadcasting rights, and Dollars 210m should come from the
sale of 3.6m game tickets, which are expected to be sold out in advance of
the opening ceremony on June 17. The nine cities hosting the games - New
York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Dallas, Washington DC, Detroit, San
Francisco and Orlando - anticipate a flood of foreign visitors, who will
contribute to the estimated Dollars 4bn which could be spent on the World
Cup in the US - on everything from hotels, to ticket and T-shirts.
While the tournament is virtually guaranteed to be a commercial success,
doubts remain about Fifa's primary ambition: to colonise the US for
football. Its hopes rest on the theory that the interest created by the
World Cup will sustain a US professional football league.
George Vescey, a New York Times sports columnist who has covered the last
three World Cups, is sceptical whether the tournament's legacy will be
strong enough to support such a league. 'I don't think the US will embarrass
world football. We have the stadiums, the phone lines, the hotels, and the
multinational (sponsors) - that's why we were selected. Whether it will feel
like a real World Cup is another question.'
By a 'real World Cup', Vescey means a tournament which not only stokes the
passions of fans in the 24 competing countries, but also captures the
imagination of the host nation.
A lot will depend upon how the US team, one of the weakest in the
tournament, fares. It is crucial that the home team advances past the first
stage of round-robin league games and into the more exciting knockout stage.
Quality will also be critical. Too many unexciting, low-scoring games will
make it harder to sell the sport to sceptical Americans.
At the moment, however, the World Cup organisers are more concerned about
making sure the stars booked for tomorrow's draw turn up to perform. Only
when the Las Vegas ceremonies are over, will the task of selling an American
World Cup to Americans crank into top gear. A survey released two weeks ago
by Fifa showed that only 35 per cent of Americans knew that the World Cup
was being held in their country next summer. In Brazil, the figure was 99
per cent. The final score in the US is far from certain.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: 'Imaginisation' runs riot a bit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A H COLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lucy Kellaway's article, 'Are you a vine, an egg or a train?' (November
17), led her to 'imaginise' calling her boss a hedgehog, rather than saying
straight out: 'You're prickly.' If her boss is a hedgehog carer, being
likened to one of her charges could lead her to think she is being called a
disgustingly noisy eater, or that she puffs and snorts vigorously when
making love. Possibly not the intended message.
If hedgehogs could send their own message at this time of year it would be
for people to take care when tending the garden. Hedgehogs hibernate among
piles of leaves and twigs, so please check these carefully before consigning
them to the bonfire.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Re-build more in keeping with the
environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL J WADE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Cassell ('Nightmare on Marsham St', December 17) is right to
criticise the current Department of the Environment buildings.
However, one point which I feel he misses is that the other dimension to
these dreadful buildings is the height to which they were constructed. Prior
to 1970 local residents, office workers and visitors were able to enjoy
views of the Palace of Westminster and Westminster Abbey from quite a long
distance away, which added to the agreeable ambience of the general area.
I very much hope that, once these awful buildings have been demolished, the
planners will not allow any reconstruction which exceeds the current
eight-floor limit imposed on other developers in this region over the past
few years.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Smile masks a scream of rage: Vladimir Zhirinovsky is part
clown, part victim, say John Lloyd and Leyla Boulton, but his contradictions
cause concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Russian couple debated which candidates they liked before last Sunday's
elections. The wife favoured Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the neo-fascist
Liberal Democratic Party. The husband objected: Zhirinovsky is a Jew, he
said. The wife believed him, and they voted communist. This really happened.
Post-communist Russia is perhaps the only place where voters who wish to
vote for fascists choose instead to vote communist because the fascist
leader is Jewish. It is the basis for a farce, but that is not what it is.
Mr Zhirinovsky's Jewishness (through his father, Wolf Zhirinovsky) is not
incontrovertible, but it is probable. Yesterday Mr Mikhail Chlenov, head of
Russia's Jewish Federation, says that he met Mr Zhirinovsky in November 1988
during the founding conference of an organisation called Shalom.
'He got up and said he was a lawyer, and after his speech he was elected to
the board. Shalom lasted three months and then he disappeared. There was no
hint of a future Fuhrer. It was self-evident that anyone who came to such a
meeting was Jewish or considered himself to be. There is no doubt that, with
a name like Wolf, his father was Jewish.'
Being, or not being, Jewish matters in Russia. Jews are not the most
oppressed of the former Soviet peoples - it is the Azeris, Armenians and
Georgians who are being thrown out of Moscow and St Petersburg now - but
they cannot expect to play a leading role in the governance of the state. It
matters for Mr Zhirinovsky, because he has used - inconsistently -
anti-semitic (or 'anti-Zionist', which can amount to the same thing)
rhetoric in his campaigns and would presumably suffer more defections from
his cause once people knew for sure he was Jewish.
Yet all this merely adds another veil to the dance Mr Zhirinovsky is
performing in front of the Russian people, and of the world. It adds another
layer of obfuscation on a figure whose contradictions are beyond easy
explanation. As the world asks - should we take this man seriously? Does he
herald a nation in arms against reform? - he continues to weave this way and
that, now protesting moderation, now threatening to use nuclear weapons on
Germany and Japan, now claiming he is is a maligned liberal, now welcoming
starvation in Central Asia if it assists Russia's economy. If Stalin was a
dogma wrapped in an enigma, Zhirinovsky is a scream of rage masked with a
grin, veiled with a lie and topped with a joke.
A judgment on him might start with his assessment of himself in his
autobiographical pamphlet The Last Dash for the South. The analysis is as
dark and pathetic, as ridden with complexes and hatreds as that of any
important public man of our times. His book is the testament of the victim:
of a boy who hardly knew his father; who grew up with five siblings (by
another father) in one room in a communal flat; whose mother took a young
husband while he was still a child; who 'never liked common games - I always
preferred to play by myself'; who says at one point that 'my whole life was
a degradation' and again that 'I had no friends' and that 'I loved my mother
. . . I loved her very much . . . I watched her cry again and again'.
The mawkishness, the obsessive insistence on his specialness and uniqueness,
his insistence on suffering are touching, because they show not a brute, but
a man whose sensitivity and intelligence never could attract the attention
of the mother he adored. There are also passages of compelling writing, as
on his first awakenings of sexuality, watching naked little girls go to the
lavatory in the night in the orphanage in which he spent some time. Later,
his wife and son are introduced as an afterthought - the centrepiece must be
the unfairness of the world to Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and the explicit and
constant equation of the ills of the former Soviet Union with the ills which
beset him.
On the first page, his birth is described down to the minute and the
weather, and intercut with the degraded condition of the Russians in
Kazakhstan (he was born in the Kazakh capital of Alma Ata) - a state they
considered they had brought into the civilised world. Later, he rails
against his life in the communal flat as a product of the preference given
to Kazakhs over Russians in the allocation of individual housing. After
another howl that his life has been 'nothing but suffering', he shifts to
Mikhail Gorbachev and says 'he had a sweet life. That's why he . . . could
do nothing right. He was weak.'
How could this bundle of resentments and hatreds and losses have risen so
fast to become the latest threat to the west's peace of mind? Throughout his
life's account, there are hints that he may have been associated with the
KGB: his education in a prestigious oriental language institute, his army
service as (apparently) an instructor, a trip to Turkey - all of these would
have at least attracted the attention of the all-enveloping security
service, if they were not sponsored by it. Mr Chlenov, also a graduate of
the oriental institute, says graduates were routinely asked by the KGB to
work for them after qualification. He avoided it by moving into academia.
Further, Mr Zhirinovsky's dip into Jewish movements in the late 1980s (an
area saturated with KGB attention) and most of all his founding of the
Liberal Democratic Party in 1990 (registered in 1991), shows either a man of
extraordinary freedom of movement or one with at least a thread leading back
to KGB headquarters in the Lubyanka.
From the start, the LDP was a strange formation. It eagerly espoused
individual rights and the need to 'de-ideologise Soviet society', (then
passing through the last,terminal crisis of communism) - and at the same
time insisting that the Soviet Union remain an integral state. An early
interview with Mr Zhirinovsky in the conservative newspaper Glasnost during
his bid for the Russian presidency in 1991 (where he zoomed from nowhere to
third place after Mr Boris Yeltsin and Mr Nikolai Ryzhkov), quotes him as
saying: 'Everywhere I went I spoke about anti-Russian attitudes. Now we've
seen the last straw - the killing of Russians in Russia because they're
Russians (referring to some apparently ethnic-based murders). I don't say
Russians are any better than anyone else but they are certainly no worse and
they don't deserve their present fate (as the victims of their former
colonial empire).'
It is the voice of the victim-nation, forced out of former colonies, feeling
the boot on the end of another foot. Every imperial country - Britain,
France, Portugal - has had a similar imperial movement, and Mr Zhirinovsky
began to articulate it as soon as he came into public view. It is not far
fetched to say that this is a voice of the KGB, and that the LDP - whose
launch made the first page of Pravda, a sign of approval - is yet another
'police party' of the kind familiar during the Tsarist period.
But are not the worries of Russians today less about the integrity of the
former Soviet Union than the price of bread? Is not the LDP's economic
programme - more arms sales, no more aid to the former Soviet republics, a
boost for the public sector, a crackdown on crime - ridiculous in its
simplicity? Yes: but Mr Zhirinovsky's skill has been to recognise that
people do not want one more foolproof plan from a self-satisfied economist:
they want action, even if it is only the action of a demagogue.
What Alan Bullock in his Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives says of the
German fascist leader is true of Mr Zhirinovsky. 'He never made the mistake
of supposing that the best way to exploit (the depression) was by making
economic policy and promises the centrepiece of the party's opposition. He
grasped, as no other German politician did, that the effect of such economic
factors on peoples' lives was one of psychological shock and that it was to
the emotions this created - fear, resentment, despair, the longing for
reassurance and the renewal of hope - that a political leader should address
himself.' Economics, indeed rationality, have nothing to do with it.
Comparisons with Hitler overestimate Mr Zhirinovsky, however. He will not
cut the same swathe through civilisation - not because he has no ambition to
do so, but because he has neither the will nor the space.
He is a fragile man, for all his scorn for those who have had the 'sweet
life'. He attracts no one of any quality (as Hitler soon did) and cannot
bear anyone who seeks equality with him. His background, or his KGB links,
or both, are in the end debilitating in this society. His need for the
victim status, much more obsessive than Hitler's as revealed in Mein Kampf
or Table Talk, will be difficult to transform into an effective use of the
power he appears to want.
The special circumstances of Russia, and the incompetence of the reformists,
especially in running an election campaign, have given a talented populist
room for growth. But he is a freak - a hot character in an increasingly cool
environment, where TV sets flicker behind threadbare curtains from Brest to
Vladivostok. Mr Zhirinovsky is at once the master and the victim of
television. The master, because he is able to be simple, direct and convey
his own obsessions and hatred of 'them', to chime with a nation made to feel
like outcasts. The victim, because the medium demands fresh fodder
constantly, and (as many Russians now say) he is a one-time phenomenon, not
a permanent fixture.
His insouciant ability to deny pledges made in print or in public and to
assert the opposite is seen as clever but will also bewilder or dishearten.
The great European tyrants of the century - Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini,
Franco - all did much of what they promised and often raised their peoples'
living standards, at least for a while. Mr Zhirinovsky, instead, threatens
nuclear holocaust.
Finally, the European dictators' rise to power was against a threatening
background in which it seemed wholly sensible to be tyrannical. Mr
Zhirinovsky grasps for the seat of the Russian president when almost every
important country in the world is trying to become democratic, or
market-oriented, or both. He himself, in his extraordinary dodging this way
and that, pays both the tribute of rhetorical support.
He is more than a clown, though he is funny: but less than a tyrant in the
making, though insofar as there is a programme it is fascistic. He is like
one of Shakespeare's most bitter and diseased jesters with a skinhead
retinue. And he reflects, sometimes with shocking accuracy, the cries of a
society in which many have suffered similar tribulations to his own, and now
feel even more dispossessed than he can give witness to.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Leading Article: So here it is, a merry Xmas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This will probably turn out to have been the most economically depressed
year for the world economy since the second world war, but that is not how
it will be recorded in the economic history books. Just as 1973 has become
the year of the oil shock, the beginning of a number of years of
stagflationary misery, so 1993 may be remembered as the year in which the
world economic community finally completed the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation, thus beginning a new era of free trade and rising
prosperity.
Of course, 1973 is not only remembered for the quadrupling of oil prices. It
was also the year in which Poland eliminated England from the World Cup and
Slade, a British rock group, cemented a tradition of seasonal hits by taking
a Christmas pop song to the top of the charts.
The power of Opec to influence oil prices has waned since then, but Slade's
Christmas song remains as popular in 1993 as it was 20 years ago. Indeed,
casual research suggests that it has been particularly popular at this
year's City of London Christmas parties. No one can blame equity market
dealers, as they celebrate the fruits of London's continuing bull market,
from crossing their fingers and singing along:
So here it is, merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
Yet can the stock market really do as well in 1994 as in 1993, a year in
which the FT-SE 100 Index has risen by 16 per cent, closing last night at
3,337.1? Or does the combination of relatively sluggish recoveries, rising
taxes and high price-earnings ratios on both sides of the Atlantic spell
danger?
Mixed signals
City opinion is split. Traders, and clients of Goldman Sachs, may take
comfort from analysis provided by Sushil Wadhwani, the investment bank's
equity analyst, who continues to point out that, using historical
bond-equity yield ratios, UK equities appear 20 per cent under-valued.
Others are much more pessimistic. 'It's all very uncomfortable,' says Robin
Aspinall of brokers Panmure Gordon, 'but at least I can guarantee that 1994
will see a return to 2900.'
Yet the bull market continues to roar. The FT-SE 100 gained 2.3 per cent
this week alone, despite mixed signals about the pace of UK recovery from
output and retail sales. Perverse as it may seem, the fact that 1993 has
turned out to be such a disappointing year for economic growth across the
industrialised world helps to explain why equity markets have performed so
well. Slow growth and low inflation have pushed short-term interest rates
down on both sides of the Atlantic, encouraging investors to move out of
cash in search of real returns. Bonds have benefited most from this pool of
income-seeking liquidity, but equity yields have also surged ahead in every
major market except Japan.
Big unknown
Can it last? For the UK stock market, the big unknown is whether economic
growth will eventually resume at historic rates without a surge in
inflation. If so, the scope for higher dividends combined perhaps with a
rise in bond yields as growth accelerates should be enough to return the
yield ratio to its historic level. But an upturn in inflation alone would
also lift the yield ratio by raising long-term rates and, if short rates
also rise, could send shares falling.
Then again, perhaps historic relationships between bonds and equities are no
longer a good guide to the future. A prolonged period of low growth could
rule out the kind of earnings growth which would be needed to justify
current price-earnings ratios.
In Britain, the immediate threat of a sudden rise in bond yields seems
non-existent. Underlying inflation is falling and the labour market remains
depressed. Short-term UK interest rates are more likely to go down than up.
If there is an inflationary risk to UK equities, it comes from the US where
growth is stronger and the Federal Reserve may soon raise short-term
interest rates. A sharp US increase could dry up the flow of US money into
Europe, while falls on Wall Street would also be felt across the Atlantic.
But with US inflation still subdued, any rise in short rates is likely to be
a statement of intent rather than a sign of imminent danger. US bonds could
even rally as a result. Nor does slow growth on the European continent spell
too much danger for UK equities so long as the Bundesbank continues to push
interest rates lower.
Not surprisingly, the pace of domestic recovery remains the greatest risk
for UK equities. Britain's long-term economic weaknesses - low investment,
decaying infrastructure and inadequate skills - have not gone away, despite
the statistical fog which currently surrounds the trade figures. But the
immediate threat is that growth will be too slow, not too fast, over the
first half of this decade. Investors may well be persuaded that lower UK
interest rates will offset the effects of tax increases, and that slow
growth of disposable incomes will postpone recovery rather than abort it.
But how far into the future are they being asked to peer?

FT  18 DEC 93 / Man in the News: Bulldozer brawn with a brain - Leon Brittan
/ Lionel Barber on Europe's chief Gatt negotiator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just before the climactic announcement of a deal in the Gatt world trade
talks, Sir Leon Brittan stepped out of a Brussels conference room and paid a
visit to the in-house canteen.
Here was the prospect of a mouthwatering quote for the assembled media
horde, along the lines of 'I'll take the ham sandwich and, by the way,
where's the claret?'. Alas, the queues were interminable, the Gatt clock was
ticking, and so the European Union's chief trade negotiator was forced to
stop fraternising with the hoi polloi.
The metamorphosis of Sir Leon from grand gourmet into homme ordinaire offers
an insight into his wider ambitions. For even as a conclusion to the Uruguay
Round drew close last Wednesday lunchtime, he was looking ahead to the next
move: his bid to succeed Mr Jacques Delors next year as president of the
European Commission.
Until this week, it was easy to write off Sir Leon's chances of attaining
the top job in the Commission. But the Gatt deal is a personal triumph which
has seen his reputation as a high-powered, if aloof, intellectual
transformed into that of a deal-maker on a grand scale. 'He has become a
viable candidate,' says one senior Commission official.
Seven years ago, Sir Leon's political career appeared finished. Memories of
his involvement in a clumsy campaign during the Westland helicopter affair
to discredit Mr Michael Heseltine, then UK defence secretary, might have
faded. What has not faded is the the verdict of a fellow Conservative MP at
the time: 'Too many brains, not enough common sense.'
Yet Sir Leon has flourished since arriving in Brussels in 1989 to become
senior UK commissioner responsible for competition policy. Although he keeps
contact with friends in London and often spends weekends walking in his
former constituency in Yorkshire, he seems happier jetting off to Moscow to
see President Boris Yeltsin than suffering the sling-shots of the annual
Conservative party conference.
His success is a tribute to hard work, a willingess to pick first-rate staff
and an unshakeable self-confidence. 'He has the style of a bulldozer,' says
a senior EU official.
An ability to plough through mind-numbing detail proved crucial as the EU's
lead negotiator in the tortuous Gatt negotiations. 'The contrast with his
predecessor (Frans Andriessen) could not be more marked,' says a Commission
official. 'He listens to what his civil servants tell him, he uses their
briefs, and he understands them. This is all highly motivating.'
His eagerness occasionally borders on the impulsive. In early January, Sir
Leon tried to strike a deal with the outgoing Bush administration on Gatt
before he had been formally confirmed in his new post as Commissioner for
External Economic Relations. He still insists he had a chance of converting
his 'short twirl' with Mrs Carla Hills, then US trade representative, into
an agreement. 'I just needed a month rather than two weeks.'
Others disagree. 'In the beginning, Brittan wanted a deal at any cost,' says
a veteran EU trade negotiator, 'but he ended up understanding that the
Americans only respect hard bargaining.'
This became evident during his relationship with Mr Mickey Kantor, the US
trade representative. At times, the two men looked like the Odd Couple on
the international trade circuit: Sir Leon as the silken-tongued barrister
from Cambridge and Yale Law School, and Mr Kantor, the country lawyer with
the light Tennessee drawl.
Sir Leon makes little pretence to personal chemistry with Mr Kantor and no
reference to their common heritage as the descendants of Lithuanian Jews.
'Mickey Kantor is a deal-maker,' he says, 'he is a man you can do business
with.'
The moment that Sir Leon believed there was a deal to be done came when
President Clinton renewed his 'fast-track' negotiating authority. This meant
the US Congress could not attach treaty-wrecking amendments to a final Gatt
text, provided a deal was struck before December 15.
Sir Leon was determined to make December 15 stick. He knew that failure
risked splitting the EU between a free-trading bloc led the UK and Germany,
and a protectionist-leaning rump led by France.
His strengths and weaknesses were less apparent in his dealings with the
Americans than in his efforts to resolve internal differences among the
Europeans.
The job of chief EU trade negotiator requires the skills of juggler and
tight-rope walker. As a member of the Commission, Sir Leon is the servant of
the 12 member states. He must balance their (often conflicting) interests
while following a mandate set out by the Council of Ministers.
Simultaneously, he must show his interlocutors that he has the flexibility
to negotiate and ultimately deliver a deal.
This is a shade more complicated than the hand played by Mr Kantor. Late in
the negotiations, the talk in Geneva was that the US trade representative
was taking his instructions from two men only: President Clinton and Mr Jack
Valenti, head of the powerful Motion Picture Association which was pressing
for greater access to film and broadcasting markets in Europe.
The charge against Sir Leon is that he lacks political touch in dealing with
his European partners. An observer in the Council of Ministers says it was
only late in the day that Sir Leon grasped the importance of keeping all
member states on board during the negotiations - particularly the
recalcitrant French.
This lacuna resulted in an explosive encounter with Mr Alain Juppe, the
French foreign minister. The clash exposed the love-hate relationship which
France has enjoyed with Sir Leon since he came to Europe. Although the
French like to demonise him as a Anglo-Saxon free-marketeer, they are drawn
to his intelligence, charm and vanity; in their eyes, he will always be the
knighted member of the British upper class who can handle a French
subjunctive clause.
On September 20, Mr Juppe pressed a list of French demands for revisions of
the EU-US Blair House accord limiting farm export subsidies. Sir Leon
refused to have his hands tied, and still maintains that his stubbornness
saved a Gatt deal: 'The French demands were extremely risky and could have
led to disaster by provoking an outright American rejection.'
A colleague agrees that Sir Leon was objectively right, but adds that facing
down the French government risked weakening Paris's confidence in the
Commission as an impartial negotiator. Similar doubts were shared by the
Danes, Greeks, Spanish and Portuguese, all of whom felt they had been kept
in the dark as the talks neared a conclusion.
Sir Leon, ever agile, counters that he was never once pressed for
information beyond what he was ready to reveal. 'They knew perfectly well
what I was not saying. It was accepted, and it was acceptable.' But a
Council official describes Sir Leon's self-righteous attitude as 'very
British'.
Sir Leon knows very well that he cannot afford to be labelled British at
this stage in his career. Right now, being British in Brussels rates as a
negative. Resentment lingers over Mr Major's article setting out a
minimalist vision of European integration in The Economist; but the problem
goes deeper. Sir Leon's tactics over the past 12 months have been to put
discreet distance between himself and Mr John Major's government.
Earlier this year, he warned Britain to take seriously the prospect of a
'hard-core' of member states moving towards European monetary union. He
supports the concept of a common European foreign and security policy, and
he has taken to chastising the US in public for not living up to its
free-trade rhetoric.
It may not be enough to win the top job in the Commission. He faces tough
though undeclared competition from Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister
and front runner, and the two seasoned Belgians, Mr Leo Tindemans and Mr
Wilfred Martens, and possibly from Mr Peter Sutherland, the director-general
of Gatt.
Sir Leon inspires great loyalty among staff inside the Commission, who
praise him for opening up information flows and streamlining the
bureaucracy. 'He would be a godsend to the Community,' said one official,
'because somebody has to manage the Commission.'
Sir Leon himself denies he is running for higher office. But he is willing
to describe the qualities of a Commission president. 'You have to be capable
of vision, and have the determination and energy to pursue that vision, as
well as the capacity to persuade people that it is the right vision.'
He adds, in matter of fact fashion, that his own vision of Europe will
appear in a book 'published by Hamish Hamilton on March 31'. This happens to
be just three months before the European summit in Corfu will choose a
successor to Mr Delors.
There is always an element of calculation about Sir Leon, a hint of a wider
game-plan. No doubt the Gatt trade deal has forced everyone to take a second
look at his pending candidacy; but he must still overcome residual
suspicions about anything British in Europe. It is a hard sell.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Media ownership rules to be reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is pushing ahead with a review of the cross-media ownership
rules that prevent newspaper publishers owning more than 20 per cent of
conventional commercial television companies, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Members of a review group which may start work next month will include
officials from the Department of National Heritage, the Department of Trade
and Industry, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury.
The review, which will take at least three months, could pave the way for a
relaxation of the rules in the wake of the recent liberalisation of ITV
ownership regulations.
The government has been lobbied extensively by newspaper groups wanting to
increase their television interests, particularly Associated Newspapers,
publisher of the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday, and Pearson, owner of
the Financial Times.
Both Associated and Pearson were interested in bidding for a significant
stake in a new fifth national television channel but were prevented by the
rules from holding more than 5 per cent.
The argument of the liberalisers is that in an age of growing media
competition and choice and the growing convergence between computers,
telecommunications and entertainment, the old cross-media rules are too
narrowly drawn.
When Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, announced last month
his intention to allow one company to own two ITV licences, he promised to
keep ownership restrictions under review and to re-examine the wider
questions of cross-media ownership.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Rift opens over 'going concern'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A damaging rift has opened in the accountancy profession over how far ahead
accounts should provide any assurance that a company will survive.
Two bodies responsible for drafting guidelines cannot agree on the period
covered by the 'going concern' assumption. This is a central issue in
audited accounts, providing confidence that a company is not about to
collapse.
A working group was established this year by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales, on behalf of the Cadbury committee, to
consider guidance for directors. It wants no change.
The institute says that accounts should only provide reassurance that the
company will survive as far as the end of the financial year. It says that
projections beyond that are not reliable.
A group from the Auditing Practices Board, which is drafting guidelines for
auditors, this week recommended that the period should be extended to
provide greater assurance.
The board says that many of the companies in most difficulty would delay
issuing accounts until well into the next year, so the institute's assurance
would last a very short time. The board wants to extend the period for 12
months from the signing of the accounts.
The institute's working party is believed to have pressed the board to
withhold its proposals until the issue had been further debated.
Now that the board has taken an independent line the institute may produce
its own draft early next year.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Prosecution witness admits misleading Old Bailey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior civil servant who was a prosecution witness in last year's
collapsed trial of executives of engineering company Matrix Churchill
yesterday admitted that he misled the Old Bailey on three occasions, Rachel
Johnson writes.
Mr Eric Beston, former head of export controls at the Department of Trade
and Industry, told the Scott inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq affair he had
been 'mistaken' and had 'misled' himself.
The trial collapsed after ministers failed to suppress documents showing
that the government had known all along that the company was selling
equipment to Iraqi munitions factories. This led to Lord Justice Scott's
investigation. The inquiry was adjourned until the new year.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Revenue wins case on BES tax relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling that investors in two
business expansion schemes issued by National Westminster Bank, Hambros Bank
and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of Barclays Bank, are
entitled to tax relief.
The appeal was brought by the Inland Revenue in a case hinging on what is
meant by the issue of a share. Lord Justices Dillon and Mann found for the
Revenue with Lord Justice Hirst dissenting.
NatWest said it was disappointed and was considering with Barclays an appeal
to the House of Lords. A decision on this will be taken next week.
The Revenue argued that shares in the Homeshare scheme, issued in February
by NatWest in conjunction with Hambros Bank, and BZW's Gracechurch business
expansion scheme, had not been issued in a way which would allow investors
to qualify for tax relief.
Loan-back BES schemes, which allowed investors to withdraw after six months
while retaining full tax relief, were abolished in the March Budget.
The banks had allotted shares but had not listed the shareholdings in the
companies' register of members by the Budget deadline. As a result, the
Revenue did not accept that the shares qualified for tax relief.
In July, the High Court found in favour of the banks and against the Revenue
by ruling that the word 'issue' had no fixed meaning.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Growth in rented housing to slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of homes built by housing associations for rent will fall sharply
after cuts in the budget of the Housing Corporation, the quango which
distributes government grant to associations.
Approvals to start building homes for rent are due to fall from 38,900 this
year to 26,800 in 1996-97. Last year associations provided more than 60,000
homes for rent.
The corporation has told the government that the cut will mean the loss of
15,000 to 18,000 construction jobs.
Sir George Young, the housing minister, yesterday told the Commons that he
expected at least 154,000 housing association homes to be completed between
1993-94 and 1995-96.
Mr Jim Coulter, director of the National Federation of Housing Associations,
said the government was focusing on completions rather than starts in order
to disguise the cut.
He said: 'Sir George is attempting to conceal the 30 per cent drop in new
approvals by emphasising the lettings which will come on stream from homes
started in previous years.'
New housing plans also include a shift away from building for rent towards
increased sales. This was a backdoor change in policy, Mr Coulter said. 'In
two years new rented housing will make up only 55 per cent of the housing
association programme.'
The government is recommending that local authorities raise rents on council
homes by 7.5 per cent in the coming year, four times the rate of inflation.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Opt-out schools gain Pounds 150m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department for Education yesterday announced grants of Pounds 150m to
grant-maintained schools that have opted out of local education authority
control.
Only 70 per cent of the schools which have opted out in the past year will
receive capital grants, however, and about a third of these must wait until
the educational year 1995-96 before the funds will be available. Last year
virtually all newly opted-out schools were offered capital grants.
Labour said this showed that the Treasury had applied pressure on the
education department to make the funding for opted-out schools less
generous. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said: 'The bribes to
education department grant-maintained schools are clearly running out.'
She accused Mr John Patten, the education secretary, of massaging the
figures to make the allocation look generous, adding: 'The truth is, this
year there are more losers.'
However, teachers' unions continued to object that more funds were being
made available to opted-out schools than to those which had remained with
local authorities.
While the total of Pounds 150m, which is for specific new capital building
programmes, would be split between about 700 grant-maintained schools,
Labour complained that the 24,000 which have not opted out would receive
only Pounds 516m in total.
Mr Robin Squire, the schools minister, said that the self-governing sector
continued 'to grow and flourish in response to parental demand'.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Sir Robert Reid: tough insider at British Rail who rose to
the top - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Robert Reid, former chairman of British Rail and a lifelong railwayman,
has died aged 72.
Although he was not the government's first choice to become BR chairman in
1983, he is credited with the modernisation of its management. He put in
place many of the building blocks for the planned privatisation and break-up
of BR, in spite of his distaste for the process. His death comes within a
few weeks of parliament approving the privatisation bill.
Robert Reid was born in February 1921. His education at Brasenose College,
Oxford, was interrupted by the second world war. He was commissioned in the
Royal Tank Regiment and spent more than three years in a German
prisoner-of-war camp. He returned to Oxford and in 1947 opted for a graduate
traineeship with the London and North Eastern Railway at Pounds 399 a year.
He started as a traffic apprentice and became BR chief executive in 1980 and
chairman in 1983. The government had sought strenuously to find a tough
outsider to shake up the railway but ended up with an equally tough insider.
In spite of his long career with the railways he did not hold a romantic
view of its traditions or its role. He broke up the established hierarchy
and split BR into five sectors - freight, InterCity, provincial services,
London and the south-east, and parcels. He closed the network of regional
offices with the loss of 6,000 jobs and presided over a halving of the
government subsidy.
Unlike his flamboyant predecessor, Sir Peter Parker, Sir Robert was soft
spoken and adopted a low profile. Few among the travelling public would have
recognised his hawk-nosed profile.
In office he took care not to become embroiled in the political discussions
of BR's future, but when pressed would question the value to customers and
employees of privatising BR. When privatisation appeared inevitable he
declared himself in favour of retaining BR as a single operation rather than
allowing it to become 'a broken-up railway with lots of little companies'.
A few months before his retirement as chairman in March 1990 he made a
public plea for more government investment in rail to maintain London's role
as an important European transport centre.
Towards the end of his period in office his efficiency improvements were
somewhat overshadowed by three fatal train crashes and a damaging dispute
with the rail unions.
A member of Business in the Community, he was also on the council of the
Prince's Youth Business Trust and a member of the Confederation of British
Industry president's committee. He was also a companion of the British
Institute of Management.
Sir Robert, knighted in June 1985, listed golf, sailing, shooting, fishing
and mountaineering as his hobbies. He was a widower since 1976 and leaves a
son and daughter.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Exchange withholds study on USM substitute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange has declined to release a report prepared by one
of its own working parties which recommends the creation of a separate
market for the trading of small company shares intended to replace the
Unlisted Securities Market.
After a long board meeting on Thursday, the exchange said it had decided
there was insufficient evidence of public support for the creation of a
so-called Enterprise Market, with its own management. That proposal has had
strong support from venture capitalists and stockbrokers specialising in the
shares of smaller companies.
Mr Andrew Beeson, chairman of stockbrokers Beeson Gregory and chairman of
the City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco) - which had urged the creation
of the new market - said yesterday he was 'disappointed' at the Stock
Exchange move. While Cisco still preferred to see an Enterprise Market
operating as part of the London Stock Exchange, 'there will be venture
capitalists who will be prepared to spawn a new market,' he said.
The exchange, in announcing it was shelving the report - if only temporarily
 -acknowledged that it has not been seen as a promoter of small company
interests.
'There is a widespread perception that the needs of smaller enterprise
companies are not always adequately catered for,' the exchange said in a
statement. It added that it 'will consider whether changes in the exchange's
organisation or in regulatory arrangements are required to deliver the
necessary service'.
Earlier this year the Stock Exchange said it would close the USM, partly
because it was concerned that the distinctions between it and the main
official list of traded companies were too blurred. The exchange's Smaller
Companies Working Party, established last April, had recommended that the
new market be established and operate under the aegis of the Stock Exchange.
The working party had suggested that the Enterprise Market could
alternatively try to distinguish itself from the Stock Exchange's official
list of traded companies by lowering regulatory and reporting requirements
for companies whose shares trade there.
It had been intended that the working party's report would be released by
the Stock Exchange as a consultation document and that no planning would
occur until the comment period had expired. However, the board voted instead
to commission additional market research aimed at investigating the degree
of public support for a new exchange.
Privately, some Cisco members said the board's move may have been prompted
by fears of embarrassment if the new market failed to attract sufficient
support. 'They are saying that if we revamp the secondary market for a
second time and it doesn't work we will look really stupid,' one member
said.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Lib Dems face split on racism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrat party was facing an ugly split over racism last night
after an internal inquiry recommended the expulsion of three members in the
London borough of Tower Hamlets.
Mr Jeremy Shaw, one of three members accused of circulating racist leaflets,
said local members were 'very likely' to set up a splinter group. A
substantial breakaway could deprive the Liberal Democrats of its eight-seat
majority on Tower Hamlets council, which the party won from Labour in 1986.
The inquiry, chaired by Lord Lester, a Liberal Democrat peer, was set up
after controversial leaflets were published during a council by-election won
by the British National Party.
The report is a damning indictment of campaigning tactics in the Tower
Hamlets party during the past three years, which continued after the inquiry
was established.
In addition to recommending three expulsions, it urges the national party to
appoint a campaigns officer to monitor Tower Hamlets until after next year's
local elections in May.
The three members, who deny racism, have the right to appeal to an
independent panel to be set up by the party. The report says the members
involved did not intend to stir up racial prejudice. But their populist
approach pandered to resentment and anxiety among local white voters.
Lord Lester accuses the Tower Hamlets Labour party of adopting 'misguided
and dishonourable' policies during the by-election which contributed to the
BNP campaign.
The report's most damaging section asserts that the national Liberal
Democrat party knew what was happening in Tower Hamlets three years ago, but
took 'no effective concerted action'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, moved quickly last night to
limit electoral damage to the party by making clear that it would act firmly
to end racism.
Mr Graham Tope, president of the Liberal Democrat London region, said the
exposure of racism in Tower Hamlets was unlikely to affect the party's
prospects in the elections.
'Where people comment at all, they recognise that this party has not tried
to sweep it under the carpet. Far from hurting us next May, I think it is
going to help us,' he said.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said the report was a
'whitewash'.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Savings rates are reduced by Woolwich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third-largest, yesterday became the
latest society to reduce its savings rates. From tomorrow most of the 4m
people who save with the Woolwich will find that the interest rate they
receive is cut by 0.41 of a percentage point.
With few exceptions the largest lenders have now set out their stalls for
both mortgage and savings rates in the wake of the pre-Budget cut in base
interest rates of 0.5 of a percentage point.
It has given them the opportunity - taken by almost all - to widen their
margins by passing on to borrowers a lower rate cut than the reduction in
savings rates.
All will also gain a short-term benefit from the time lag - usually two to
four weeks - between the new, lower rates applying to investors and those
applying to existing borrowers.
Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest, cut its base mortgage rate by
0.35 of a percentage point for existing borrowers from the turn of the year,
and its saving rate by 0.5 of a percentage point for most savers from last
Wednesday.
That gap of about 0.15 of a percentage point is reflected in the changes
made by other societies, although Nationwide, the second largest, had a
wider spread, cutting its mortgage rate by 0.25 of a percentage point and
its rates for most savers by 0.5 of a percentage points.
This chance to widen margins is far smaller than the opportunity presented
by the sharper cuts in interest rates last autumn, after sterling's
departure from the European exchange rate mechanism.
But the building societies are still likely to face accusations that they
are not treating their members fairly.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS, said that building societies
needed to widen their margins to make up for the fact that the returns they
were achieving on their free reserves were also declining as interest rates
fell.
He said: 'They're running as hard as they can to stand still.'
The pressure to reduce margins over next year will come not from MPs or
ministers but from competition.
Societies have been squeezed both on lending and borrowing. They have lost
the market share of mortgages to banks, and face an intensifying struggle to
retain their personal savers.
Although sounding reasonably relaxed about the cuts in National Savings
rates announced on Thursday, the sector is keenly awaiting the details of
the new guaranteed income bond for pensioners, which was announced in the
Budget.
Some in the sector already foresee a more general threat to societies'
retail deposit base in the prospect that, if interest rates remain low,
large numbers of savers might decide that they are prepared to face some
risk for a higher reward than savings accounts can offer.

FT  18 DEC 93 / BAA says failure of fifth terminal will cost 14,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Failure to build a fifth terminal at London Heathrow would cost 14,000 jobs,
BAA, which operates the airport, said yesterday, Daniel Green writes.
A decision to proceed with the Pounds 900m terminal would create 6,000 jobs
and protect 8,000 others, the company said in a lobbying document it
submitted to the government.
A public inquiry is expected to begin in 1995. If planning permission were
granted in 1997, the first stage of the terminal would open in the year
2002.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Loyalists hold to threat of retaliation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Loyalist paramilitaries are prepared to match an IRA ceasefire with one of
their own, but are holding back from taking the first step.
Yesterday, in its first public response to the UK-Irish joint declaration,
the Combined Loyalist Military Command, which represents the Ulster Freedom
Fighters and Ulster Volunteer Force, said that 'in the absence of any
response from the Provisional murder gangs' it would pursue its 'stated
policy in retaliation to IRA violence'.
Loyalist paramilitaries have carried out indiscriminate murders of Catholics
in recent weeks, but security sources believe both the UFF and the UVF will
scale down their operations before Christmas. 'They are waiting to see what
the IRA does next,' one security source said yesterday. 'This is a holding
statement.'
While adopting an essentially reactive posture in military terms,
yesterday's statement made clear that the loyalist paramilitaries also want
to be seen as playing a part in setting the agenda.
They are calling for the creation of a forum in Northern Ireland to bring
together loyalist paramilitary leaders and unionist party officials, to
protect unionist interests and act as a potential channel for demilitarising
the province.
The idea mirrors the Irish government's proposed forum for nationalists.
Mr Jim Rodgers, a Belfast Ulster Unionist party councillor, said yesterday
that loyalist paramilitaries were angered by what they saw as the emphasis
on bringing the IRA into the political process. 'It is one-sided, as if the
violence of the IRA justified it,' Mr Rodgers said.
Republican sources yesterday again lowered expectations that the IRA would
move quickly to declare a permanent cessation of violence, as the joint
declaration demands.
The sources said the 35-person national executive of Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, may reach a 'considered position' on the joint declaration
by early next week, following consultations with regional and branch
offices. But both Mr Gerry Adams, the party's president, and his deputy Mr
Martin McGuinness want to ensure that Sinn Fein's response has the backing
of the IRA to avoid a damaging and potentially bloody split in the
republican movement.
A senior republican source said yesterday: 'We have got to get our response
right even if it takes much longer than people expect or else we are all
going to be in trouble.'
The IRA's executive army council - which includes Sinn Fein officials and
representatives of both sides of the border - is empowered by the
organisation's constitution to declare 'war or peace'.
But the consultation in the next few days will be extended to the IRA's army
convention, which comprises active service men and women from each of the
IRA's brigade areas.
It is widely accepted within the republican movement that any cessation of
violence must be endorsed by the convention if it is to be successfully
delivered.
The IRA disputes the portrayal of the loyalist paramilitaries as reactive,
and is reluctant to abandon its operations unless the loyalists first
declare a ceasefire.
Security sources believe this unwillingness by each side to make the first
move could undermine the peace process.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Lyell reinforces stance on Levitt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, yesterday again defended the
Serious Fraud Office's handling of the trial of Mr Roger Levitt.
He insisted prosecuting lawyers had not been told the businessman's
barristers intended to cite other cases where fraudsters received suspended
sentences before the SFO agreed to Mr Levitt's guilty plea.
The controversy of the plea bargain arose after Mr Levitt received a
180-hour community service order having admitted a single charge of
deceiving Fimbra, the Levitt Group's regulator - only one of a number of
charges the SFO had brought against him.
Controversy afterwards centred on whether the SFO was aware Mr Levitt might
receive a non-custodial sentence after making such a plea.
Yesterday Sir Nicholas said in a parliamentary answer that he had been told
by prosecution counsel that they had not been informed of any intention by
Mr Levitt's lawyers to use examples such as Mr Terry Ramsden, the former
Japanese-warrants dealer given a suspended sentence after admitting fraud,
during their plea-bargaining efforts.
However, earlier this week the trial judge, Mr Justice Laws, agreed that
transcripts of the plea-bargaining discussions could be made public.
In these it is disclosed that before the SFO accepted Mr Levitt's plea, his
barrister, Mr Jonathan Goldberg QC, sent a letter to Mr David Cocks, QC for
the SFO. It ended: 'If you are instructed to accept such a plea, I am
instructed to seek an indication from the judge on sentence and Mr Levitt
will then decide what to do.'
The attorney-general also enlarged on a previous statement to MPs when he
admitted that discussions over the possible plea might have taken place
before November 22 - the day Mr Levitt made his plea in front of the jury.
In an earlier parliamentary answer Sir Nicholas denied that the SFO
approached Mr Levitt about a possible plea before then. Yesterday he said
discussions may have taken place before, adding: 'I have been assured by
prosecuting counsel that although potential pleas may have been discussed on
a counsel-to-counsel basis no offers were made by the Crown to Mr Levitt.'

FT  18 DEC 93 / Lilley avoids banana skins: James Blitz on the political
skills of the social security secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For once Mr Peter Lilley can say that he has had a good week.
In recent months the social security secretary, one of the most Thatcherite
members of the cabinet, must have felt that he was the butt of more
criticism than any other minister.
His ambitions to target social security benefits on those who most need them
have drawn intense fire from Labour's front benches.
Even some cabinet ministers have hinted that his plans are far too
draconian.
Yet this week he introduced two bills central to his objective to contain
the growth of the Pounds 80bn social security budget. The two measures -
raising employees' National Insurance contributions by 1 per cent and
cutting the statutory sick-pay subsidy to employers - were countered by the
Labour whips, who ended their 'pairing' arrangements with Tory MPs in
protest at the speed with which the measures were being pushed through.
Nevertheless both went through without a hitch.
Sitting in his Whitehall office this week Mr Lilley looked like a man
preparing for another march forward in the new year. He said in his quiet,
slightly intense voice: 'Any one of the measures that we have recently
announced would have been a major item at any time.
'We seem to have done much better than we could have expected in getting
support for them.'
Tory backbenchers say the bills have had a smooth passage because Mr Lilley
understood an important lesson of politics. He leaked his plans on
withdrawing the statutory sick-pay subsidy before they were announced in the
Budget.
But the going will get tougher from now on. In the spring Mr Lilley will
introduce a bill to tighten up the rules for applicants for invalidity
benefit, introducing an objective test that would replace the informal
examination now made by GPs.
He says the measure will be controversial. Some Tory backbenchers go
further, fearing the legislation will do the unthinkable by taking benefits
away from people who already have them.
He must also tackle problems with the Child Support Agency, which has been
attacked for zealously forcing separated fathers to pay maintenance when
they cannot afford to.
Mr Lilley is under pressure to reduce the burden on the absent fathers. But
that, in turn, could force his already hard-pressed department to pay out
more in benefits to lone mothers.
So what of longer-term, neo-Thatcherite ambitions to curtail the welfare
state?
He is clear enough on the broad principles, especially on pensions. 'I would
expect to see welfare provision rising,' he said. 'But the share which comes
from individual pensions will have to increase more rapidly than the share
which comes from the state.'
But he is vague on specifics. He says that the legislation which emerges
from his social security review 'cannot be pre-ordained'.
Mr Lilley's discretion may have been learnt by example. As every Tory MP
knows, the shadow of Lord Moore hangs over Mr Lilley. The resignation of his
predecessor in 1988 was triggered partly by the embarrassing zeal with which
Mr Moore tried to reform the benefits system.
Cabinet colleagues urging caution will press Mr Lilley to temper his
enthusiasm.
As one Tory MP said: 'Caution must be his watchword.' A neo-Thatcherite
social security secretary moves step by step - or not at all.

FT  18 DEC 93 / BA plans Heathrow cargo expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways plans to invest Pounds 150m expanding its cargo facilities
at London's Heathrow airport in a joint development with BAA, the site
operator.
Yesterday BA said the project would be the airline's largest single
investment in an airport construction venture and would more than double its
cargo handling capacity at Heathrow by the year 2000.
The BA and BAA boards have approved the project in principle. Final approval
is expected by the end of next year. The scheme will involve three phases
which, when completed, will increase BA's Heathrow cargo handling capacity
from 451,000 tonnes a year to about 1m tonnes a year in the year 2000.
Details of the development and funding of the new cargo terminal are still
being worked out. BAA also regards the scheme as an important part of its
efforts to boost freight activities at Heathrow.
Developed around the existing World Cargocentre on the south side of the
airport, the new terminal will be a third of a mile long with a floor area
of 600,000 sq ft compared with the current floor space of about 425,000 sq
ft.
The new centre will replace the old facilities built for BA's forerunners,
BEA and BOAC. Construction of the first phase is expected to start by the
end of next year and should be completed by late 1996. The second and final
phases are expected to be ready in 1998 and 2000.
Mr Kevin Hatton, managing director of BA's world cargo division, said the
airline intended 'to take advantage of the latest, proven technology to
achieve maximum auto-mation of handling func-tions'.
BA said the old terminal operation was mainly manual and its facilities for
handling premium products needed improvement. Mr Hatton said there would now
be a unit to handle premium products.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Howard unveils tough measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough measures giving courts the power to lock up children as young as 10,
detain persistent juvenile criminals in secure training centres and end
suspects' so-called right to silence were unveiled yesterday.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, publishing the Criminal Justice and
Public Order bill and the Police and Magistrates' Courts bill, said the
measures amounted to a 'comprehensive attack on every aspect of crime'.
But Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, told an audience at Bramshill
police college, Hampshire, that the police reforms would undermine the fight
against crime.
He said: 'The cumulative effect will be dramatically to increase the
centralisation of policing and therefore substantially to undermine
community policing.'
The 117-clause Criminal Justice and Public Order bill proposes action
against juvenile offenders, bail 'bandits', terrorists, trespassers and
squatters.
The Police and Magistrates' Courts bill sets national objectives for police,
gives chief constables more flexibility over their budgets and introduces
Home Office-appointed chairmen and members of slimmed-down police
authorities.
Mr Howard said the new members of the police authorities 'will be local
people, and we are dismantling a whole series of central controls'.
The measures, announced in last month's Queen's Speech, were attacked by
politicians, civil liberties groups, lawyers and police. Mr Blair accused
the government of increasing centralisation of power - the heads of police
authorities and a third of their members are to be appointed by the
government. It would allow police authorities to be amalgamated, even
against local wishes.
Mr Rodger Pannone, Law Society president, accused the government of ignoring
recommendations of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice which did not
suit its immediate purpose - including the creation of an independent review
body to consider alleged miscarriages of justice.
Liberty, the civil liberties pressure group, condemned the criminal justice
bill as the 'most serious and broad-ranging assault on human rights' in the
UK in recent years.
Police leaders warned that the police authority reforms, fixed-term
contracts and performance-related pay threatened operational independence.
The Association of County Councils and Association of Metropolitan
Authorities called the police bill 'an expensive distraction from the real
business of fighting crime'.
The associations said the government had admitted that the reforms would
cost Pounds 21m.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Dublin aims at speeding Sinn Fein dialogue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish government's proposal to establish a 'peace forum' - referred to
in this week's joint UK-Irish declaration - is aimed at bringing Sinn Fein
rapidly into a formal negotiating process after the IRA has announced the
ending of violence.
Senior Irish cabinet ministers say Sinn Fein could be brought into the forum
'very quickly' after an announcement. This would be before the exploratory
talks the British government has offered the party, which would start after
a three-month 'quarantine'.
The ministers also echoed the British government's view that surrender of
IRA weapons would not be a precondition to Sinn Fein's involvement in talks.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, told the Dail yesterday: 'The joint
declaration was the first stage in the peace process. The Forum for Peace
and Reconciliation could be absolutely vital to reaching a second stage, and
to achieving a permanent cessation of violence.
'If we want to be realistic, we have to guarantee that there will be a
political process, once violence is permanently ended. The forum could
provide a useful input to wider negotiations.'
The creation of such a forum was one of the main sticking points in the
drafting of the joint declaration. Irish government officials say it was
therefore decided to make it an Irish initiative, rather than a joint
initiative with Britain.
Mr Reynolds said the forum would be open 'to democratically mandated parties
to provide a means to debate and devise appropriate alternative political
strategies to violence'. Apparently acknowledging that unionists will not
initially wish to be involved, he said the debate would take place 'among
all strands of nationalism and hopefully a wider range of opinion, (and) in
the aftermath of a permanent cessation of violence, could be a very healthy
exercise'.
Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael party, was cautious. 'A
forum that does not contain representatives of both traditions cannot
achieve the stated objective in the joint declaration to promote
reconciliation.'
The Irish parliament later backed the joint declaration without a vote at
the end of a day-long debate in the Dail.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government announced yesterday that it intends to legislate to allow
local authorities to set their own fees for planning applications. Fees will
increase by 15 per cent from January 13 and a further 15 per cent from
January 1995.
Mr David Curry, planning minister, said the increases 'represent another
important step towards applicants meeting the full costs incurred by local
planning authorities in determining planning applications'. He said council
tax payers should not have to pay for this service. The 15 per cent increase
comes after rises of 20 per cent and 10 per cent last year and this year.

Mr John Major has turned down a direct appeal from a Labour MP to intervene
in bringing about a settlement for creditors of Bank of Credit and Commerce

In a letter to Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, dated November 23

October decision by a Luxembourg court is likely to lead to 'a considerable

FT  18 DEC 93 / Bankers to visit south-east Asia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is to lead a party of top UK bankers to
south-east Asia later this month to try to help the financial services
industry expand its presence in the region.
The tour of about two weeks, with about eight bankers, will start the week
after Christmas and take in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Indonesia. A
Treasury official said the countries had been chosen because of the 'good
prospects' for doing business there.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Exporters attack DTI on new law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Institute of Export yesterday protested to the government about
'ineffective' consultation with industry and corporate lawyers about the new
laws on commercial agents, which come into force on January 1.
Complaints about poor consultation have been mounting throughout the autumn
as exporters realised the new laws were going to raise costs and that some
companies were unlikely to have enough time to adjust.
It appears a new section in the final form of the regulations was the final
straw. It changed the way agents should be compensated when sacked. In all
drafts, Britain appeared to be opting for damages rather than the
fixed-indemnity formulae favoured by most other European Union countries.
Since damages are negotiable, most lawyers acting for exporters believed
this would generally offer the cheapest option if companies and agents fell
out.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Swan Hunter set for subsidy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, looks set to become
eligible for Intervention Funding subsidy, improving its prospects of
finding a buyer, Chris Tighe writes.
A meeting in Brussels yesterday of European Union heads of cabinet - senior
civil servants - agreed to recommend to next Tuesday's meeting of the EU's
17 commissioners that the Tyneside yard should become eligible for the 9 per
cent merchant order subsidy, which would be paid by the UK government.
It is thought to be unlikely that the commissioners would overturn a
recommendation by their senior aides.
The news was welcomed by Mr Ed James of receivers Price Waterhouse. 'It's
not a guarantee of a buyer but it clearly enhances the prospect for the yard
to win new work,' he said.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Nissan is offered deal in sports stadium row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunderland Football Club has written to Nissan asking the Japanese car
manufacturer to drop its opposition to the club's plans for a Pounds 70m
sports, entertainment and conference centre on land near the company's
Pounds 900m car plant.
In its letter the club offers Nissan a seat on the board and the chance to
buy a 'substantial' shareholding in the club.
The letter to Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing
(UK) also offers the company the chance to become co-promoter of the leisure
complex. It offers to incorporate into its scheme, at no cost to Nissan, all
additional roads 'reasonably' required by the company.
The club says it is prepared to move the site for the leisure development
slightly to the west - on condition Nissan makes a public commitment to
expand on to the site previously earmarked by the club within a guaranteed
period, buys the 120-acre site freehold and makes up any funding shortfall
arising from the scheme's move.
The football club board has also offered to visit Japan to achieve a
satisfactory conclusion.
Nissan is opposing the plan because it fears that traffic congestion from
the 40,000-seat stadium, 12,000-seat indoor arena and 11,000-space car park
would jeopardise just-in-time deliveries to its plant, upsetting production
schedules.
It has also argued that the choice of site would block its expansion
prospects.
The club's letter claims to re-confirm its 'aim of accommodation and
compromise' and insists it never wanted confrontation. But it also warns:
'Unless Nissan feel they can single-handedly drive the regeneration of the
region by themselves, they must accommodate the ambitions and aspirations of
others within the north-east who wish to drive the region forward on both a
national and European basis.'
The club says it has received many letters from people who fail to
understand Nissan's objections. 'People consider that your actions have put
at risk the enormous number of permanent new jobs, linked to the vast
investment the regional centre would bring to the north-east,' the club
says. It also questions why, if Nissan might need the land, it has not
bought it.
Yesterday the company - which employs more than 4,000 people at Sunderland -
said that the letter failed to add anything to what it knew already. 'Nissan
has no interest in branching out into the leisure industry.'
It described the conditions attached to the proposed move of site as 'a
nonsense'.
The club, which has declined to name its backers for the complex, is heading
for a Pounds 1m loss this year. Its planning application will be considered
by Sunderland City Council in the new year.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Heathrow's fifth terminal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Failure to build a fifth terminal at London Heathrow would cost 14,000 jobs,
BAA, which operates the airport, said yesterday, Daniel Green writes.
A decision to proceed with the Pounds 900m terminal would create 6,000 jobs
and protect 8,000 others, the company said in a lobbying document it
submitted to the government.
A public inquiry is expected to begin in 1995. If planning permission were
granted in 1997, the first stage of the terminal would open in the year 2002
and work would be finished by 2013, BAA said. The new terminal would handle
30m passengers a year.
'Terminal 5 will ensure that Heathrow retains its position in the face of
increasingly fierce competition from Europe,' said Sir John Egan, BAA's
chief executive.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Dublin 'forum' to speed Sinn Fein involvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish government's proposal to establish a 'peace forum' - referred to
in this week's joint UK-Irish declaration - is aimed at bringing Sinn Fein
rapidly into a formal negotiating process after the IRA has announced the
ending of violence.
Senior cabinet ministers say Sinn Fein could be brought into the Irish forum
'very quickly' after an announcement. This would be before the exploratory
talks the British government has offered the party, which would start after
a three-month 'quarantine' period.
The ministers also echoed the British government's view that a surrender of
IRA weapons would not be a precondition to the involvement of Sinn Fein in
talks.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the taoiseach, told the Dail yesterday: 'The joint
declaration was the first stage in the peace process. The Forum for Peace
and Reconciliation could be absolutely vital to reaching a second stage, and
to achieving a permanent cessation of violence.
'If we want to be realistic, we have to guarantee that there will be a
political process, once violence is permanently ended. The forum could
provide a useful input to wider negotiations.'
The creation of such a forum was one of the main sticking points in the
drafting of the joint declaration. Irish government officials say it was
therefore decided to make it an Irish initiative, rather than a joint
initiative with Britain.
Mr Reynolds said the forum would be modelled on the New Ireland Forum, set
up in 1983 on the initiative of Mr John Hume, the leader of the nationalist
Social Democratic and Labour party in Northern Ireland, in which all the
main parties in the Republic and the SDLP participated, but which the
unionist parties in the north boycotted.
Mr Reynolds said the new forum would be open 'to democratically mandated
parties to provide a means to debate and devise appropriate alternative
political strategies to violence'.
Apparently acknowledging that unionist parties will not initially wish to be
involved, he said the debate would take place 'among all strands of
nationalism and hopefully a wider range of opinion, (and) in the aftermath
of a permanent cessation of violence, could be a very healthy exercise in
advance of resumed talks between all political parties, unionist and
nationalist'.
Dublin sees the forum as providing a 'bridge' to exploratory Sinn Fein talks
with London and to subsequent wider talks involving all parties in Northern
Ireland and the Republic. Dublin believes the move is necessary if Sinn Fein
and the IRA are to accept the peace initiative.
Issues of concern to Sinn Fein and the IRA, such as the future of IRA
prisoners and the 'dumping' of arms, would be dealt with in these initial
talks.
Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael party, expressed
reservations. 'A forum that does not contain representatives of both
traditions cannot achieve the stated objective in the joint declaration to
promote reconciliation. There is a risk that some form of
institutionalisation of division may be established.'
The Irish parliament later backed the joint declaration without a vote at
the end of a day-long debate in the Dail.
Winding up the Dail debate, Mr Dick Spring, the deputy premier and foreign
minister, said he would brief fellow members of the EC's General Affairs
Council in Brussels on Monday.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Palestinian peace negotiations falter again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The planned meeting in Cairo next week between Israel's prime minister, Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, and the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, Mr Yassir
Arafat, intended to resuscitate the deadlocked Israeli-PLO negotiations, is
almost certain to be postponed to January 6 or later, Israeli officials said
yesterday.
The Cairo meeting, tentatively scheduled for December 22 or 23, was agreed
on by the two leaders after talks last Sunday failed to resolve differences
holding up the start of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the
Jericho area of the West Bank.
Israeli troops were to begin pulling out of the Gaza and Jericho areas last
Monday. And although both Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin said after their abortive
meeting that a delay of 10 days in finalising the precise details of an
Israeli-PLO autonomy agreement would not be too damaging, another delay
could only weaken the diminishing support on both sides for the peace
process.
However, Norway's deputy foreign minister, Mr Jan Egeland, said last night
that 'high-level representatives' of Israel and the PLO would meet in Norway
on Monday for talks, Reuter reports.
The meeting at an Oslo hotel, also including delegates from the US, Russia,
Egypt, the EU and Norway, would be preceded by informal talks tomorrow, he
said.
Mr Egeland, who helped broker the historic peace deal in at least 14 rounds
of secret talks in Norway this year, said it was unclear if Israel's foreign
minister, Mr Shimon Peres, would head the Israeli delegation, as reported
earlier by a PLO official.
Mr Omar Kitmitto, PLO representative in Norway, had also said the PLO
delegation would be headed by Mahmoud Abbas, known as Abu Mazen. Israeli TV
said the discussions might prepare the ground for another meeting between Mr
Rabin and Mr Arafat.
In the past 24 hours, several Israeli officials involved in the negotiations
have given off-the-record briefings indicating that central issues still
remain to be resolved, and that the start of the troop withdrawal may have
to be put off for several weeks.
Israeli and PLO officials are continuing to hold private contacts in an
effort to agree the size of the Jericho autonomous area, and to resolve the
issue of border controls. Mr Arafat wants crossing points from Gaza into
Egypt and from the Jericho region into Jordan managed by Palestinians.
An opinion poll published yesterday by the Centre for Palestinian Research
showed a decline in support for the autonomy programme among Palestinians,
with 41.5 per cent backing the accords, compared with 64.9 per cent three
months ago. A survey among Israelis, published by the Ma'ariv daily, showed
54 per cent believe an autonomy deal will eventually be reached.
Foreign governments have pledged Dollars 570m (Pounds 383m) in aid to the
Palestinians next year, but insisted that any use of this to meet start-up
costs of the fledgling Palestinian administration must be properly
monitored, the World Bank said yesterday.
At the first meeting in Paris of the Bank's consultative group for the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, Mr Abu Ala'a (Ahmed Qurie) pressed donors to allow some
of their aid to be used to fund current costs of the Palestine Economic
Council for Reconstruction and Development, which he chairs, and other new
Palestinian institutions, as well as capital investment in aid projects.
The Bank backed his argument, with its vice president for the Middle East,
Mr Caio Hoch-Weser, asking donors to be 'flexible' in the difficult start-up
phase of Palestinian self-government.
He said: 'We are assuming all tax receipts, direct and indirect, in the
territories will be transferred to the Palestinians.' But initially the
latter might have difficulty without foreign aid in covering salary costs.
The European Union, which together with national donations from its 12
states is the biggest contributor to the Dollars 2bn fund for the
Palestinians, had promised to meet some administrative running costs, Mr
Hoch-Weser said.
He was confident that other donors would do the same. International auditors
would be brought in to monitor the aid.
Mr Abu Ala'a, who earlier held talks with Mr Peres, in Paris, acknowledged
that the delay in reaching full agreement on implementing the September
peace accord would have 'a real impact' on economic development plans.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Toshiba penalised for breach of Cocom rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company, has been barred by the Japanese
government from exporting semiconductors to 27 present and former communist
nations for one month after admitting that it violated the regulations of
the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls.
The case arose after documents from the former East Germany were uncovered
by the Japanese media, forcing the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry to investigate Toshiba's alleged exports of leading-edge
semiconductor equipment from December 1986 to February 1987.
Miti officials said Toshiba exported masks and 150 silicon wafers to East
Germany, as well as providing documents detailing the production of advanced
memory chips. The case is embarrassing for the Japanese government, which
claimed that it maintained tight controls over exports of strategic
technologies.
However, Miti's punishment is relatively lenient, as the 27 countries
include Mongolia, Vietnam and North Korea, none of which is a leading
importer of Japanese semiconductor products. China is the only significant
market temporarily closed to Toshiba.
Miti officials also reprimanded Mitsui, the trading house, which was
involved in collecting payments for the deal. As is customary in such cases,
Mitsui said its employees had acted without authorisation, and that two
officials had been reprimanded.
The Japanese government has imposed penalties in 10 cases of Cocom
violations, and Miti said the export ban imposed on Toshiba was thought
appropriate because the statute of limitations had expired for a criminal
action against the company. Toshiba estimates that its semiconductor exports
to the 27 countries in an average month total Y1.6bn (Pounds 10m). Total
exports of chips this year will be around Y280bn.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Palestinian peace negotiations falter again

The planned meeting in Cairo next week between Israel's prime minister, Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, and the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, Mr Yassir
Arafat, intended to resuscitate the deadlocked Israeli-PLO negotiations, is
almost certain to be postponed to January 6 or later, Israeli officials said
yesterday.
The Cairo meeting, tentatively scheduled for December 22 or 23, was agreed
on by the two leaders as a last resort after talks last Sunday failed to
resolve differences holding up the start of Palestinian self-rule in the
Gaza Strip and the Jericho area of the West Bank.
Originally, Israeli troops were to begin pulling out of the Gaza and Jericho
areas last Monday. And although both Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin said after their
abortive meeting that a delay of 10 days in finalising the precise details
of an Israeli-PLO autonomy agreement would not be too damaging, another
delay could only weaken the diminishing support on both sides for the peace
process.
In the past 24 hours, several Israeli officials involved in the negotiations
have given off-the-record briefings indicating that central issues still
remain to be resolved, and that the start of the troop withdrawal may have
to be put off for several weeks.
One senior military figure, quoted in the Ha'aretz newspaper yesterday, said
there was no chance of wrapping up the final autonomy deal within 10 days or
even 20. And the longer the signing was put off, he added, the harder it
would be for Israel to honour the next scheduled autonomy deadline -
completing the military pull-out by April 13.
Israeli and PLO officials are continuing to hold private contacts in an
effort to agree the size of the Jericho autonomous area, and to resolve the
issue of border controls. Mr Arafat has been insisting that the crossing
points from Gaza into Egypt and from the Jericho region into Jordan be
managed exclusively by Palestinians. Mr Rabin rejects this as prejudicial to
Israeli security.
Meanwhile, an opinion poll published yesterday by the Centre for Palestinian
Research showed a marked decline in support for the autonomy programme among
Palestinians, with 41.5 per cent backing the accords, compared to 64.9 per
cent three months ago. A survey among Israelis, published by the Ma'ariv
daily, showed 54 per cent believe a final autonomy deal will eventually be
reached.
Foreign governments have pledged Dollars 570m in aid to the Palestinians
next year, but insisted that any use of this to meet start-up costs of the
fledgling Palestinian administration must be properly monitored, the World
Bank said yesterday.
At the first meeting in Paris of the World Bank's consultative group for the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, Mr Abu Ala'a (Ahmed Qurie) pressed donors to allow
some of their aid to be used to fund current costs of the Palestine Economic
Council for Reconstruction and Development, which he chairs, and other new
Palestinian institutions, as well as capital investment in aid projects.
The World Bank backed his argument, with its vice president for the Middle
East, Mr Caio Hoch-Weser, asking donors to be 'flexible' in the difficult
start-up phase of Palestinian self-government. He said: 'We are assuming
that all tax receipts, direct and indirect, in the territories will be
transferred to the Palestinians.' But initially the latter might have
difficulty without foreign aid in covering salary costs.
Mr Abu Ala'a said it was as much in the Palestinian self-interest as in the
interest of foreign donors that there should be 'transparency' in the
spending of international aid. However, he seemed to define recurrent costs
more broadly than the Bank and donors to include 'social costs, such as the
rehabilitation of prisoners'.
The European Union, which together with national donations from its 12
states is the biggest contributor to the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) fund for
the Palestinians, had promised to meet some administrative running costs, Mr
Hoch-Weser said. He was confident that other donors would do the same.
International auditors would be brought in to monitor the aid.
Mr Abu Ala'a, who earlier held talks with Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli
foreign minister, in Paris, acknowledged that the delay in reaching full
agreement on implementing the September peace accord would have 'a real
impact' on economic development plans.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Australia's treasurer quits unexpectedly: Dawkins'
announcement greeted with surprise in political and financial circles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<TEXT>
Mr John Dawkins, the Australian treasurer, yesterday astonished both the
political world and financial markets by saying he was resigning.
Mr Dawkins' announcement in the House of Representatives at the close of the
year's parliamentary sittings had not been foreshadowed by any immediate
controversy. Only hours beforehand, he had been detailing next year's budget
process to parliament.
The treasurer's position had appeared shaky during the late summer, when the
Keating government's budget was stalled for two months in the senate by
minor parties who hold the balance of power there. But Mr Dawkins - once one
of the closest political associates of Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister -
weathered this storm, and recently won support from both the cabinet and the
minor parties for a revised budget process.
By bringing the budget date forward to May, and seeking to have bills passed
by end-June, the government hoped to avoid similar debacles in the future.
The 46-year-old treasurer said yesterday he was resigning at a time of his
own choosing. 'It's a time which I think. . . is the right time for me. . .
to pursue other interests - what, I don't know.'
Mr Dawkins added that he had informed Mr Keating of his desire to move to
the back benches 'as a step to leaving parliament at some time between now
and the next election'. He holds the Fremantle seat in Western Australia.
The prime minster's office said the successor would not be announced until
next year, and Mr Dawkins would continue as treasurer until then. Mr
Keating, addressing parliament shortly after Mr Dawkins' announcement,
added: 'I will miss him and I will miss him very much from cabinet.'
Mr Dawkins has been in parliament for 20 years and was one of Mr Keating's
staunchest supporters during the Labor party leadership battle in 1991.
However, the relationship between the two men is thought to have been
affected by Mr Dawkins' poor handling of the summer's budget crisis.
At the height of those troubles, Mr Dawkins incautiously remarked: 'Whenever
it becomes necessary for me to leave Fremantle (where his family lives), get
on a plane and come to Canberra, the prospect of political retirement does
well in my mind.' This led to a frenzy of resignation gossip, although the
possibility was denied at the time.
Nevertheless, suspicions that Mr Dawkins lacked the inclination and
political adroitness to deal with the difficult senate lingered. It was
noted then, for example, that he had bought land in South Australia,
possibly with a view to establishing a winery, and that he and his wife were
expecting their first child, who was subsequently born in late October.
Mr Dawkins, who holds an economics degree from the University of West
Australia and was trade minister during the mid-1980s, has been a fervent
believer in Australia's need to develop a more export-oriented economy. He
has come under fire recently from unions and the Labor party caucus for
putting more emphasis on the budget deficit than on social issues such as
unemployment.
Yesterday, news of his resignation sent the Australian dollar down from
about USDollars 0.6745 ahead of the announcement to about USDollars 0.67,
although some dealers suggested that this was a knee-jerk reaction, and that
the currency could stabilise if investors concluded that the reasons for Mr
Dawkins' departure were largely personal.
Speculation over Mr Dawkins' replacement began immediately. Front-runners
include Mr Ralph Willis, the finance minister who held the treasurer's job
briefly under Mr Bob Hawke's administration; Mr George Gear, the assistant
treasurer; Mr Bob McMullan, the arts and administrative services minister;
and Mr Laurie Brereton, who is industrial relations minister and a close
colleague of Mr Keating.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Senegal in 'debt for children' swap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dutch aid organisation has bought Dollars 24m of Senegalese foreign debt
and converted it into projects for women and children in the west African
nation.
The Netherlands Unicef Committee cancelled Senegal's entire bilateral debt
with Argentina in a buy-back operation managed by Internationale Nederlanden
Bank NV (ING Bank).
In return, the government of Senegal has agreed to invest Dollars 11m
(Pounds 7.3m) in Unicef projects ranging from child immunisation programmes
to the education of street children in Dakar.
The debt-for-children swap was first proposed by President Abdou Diouf of
Senegal in 1990.
Since then, debt conversions have benefited children in Madagascar, Jamaica
and the Philippines.
'The debt conversion has reduced Senegal's overall debt burden while
releasing extra resources for the country's women and children,' said Mr
Samir Sobhi at Unicef's office in Dakar.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, yesterday said there was no
need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates because inflationary
pressures were under control.
He spoke as figures from the Commerce Department confirmed a strong recovery
in US house building.
Housing starts rose 3.9 per cent in November to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.43m, the highest level in nearly four years.
Building permits - a guide to future construction trends - also rose sharply
last month, suggesting the housing market will remain buoyant.
The figures for starts are the latest in a series of robust economic
statistics pointing to an acceleration of economic growth to an annual rate
of about 4.5 per cent this quarter. The faster growth has prompted calls for
tighter monetary policy to prevent inflation creeping higher next year.
Mr Bentsen said slack labour markets and excess industrial capacity had
created a favourable inflation outlook. Earlier this week President Bill
Clinton told the Fed it would be a 'mistake' to raise rates.
Many economists believe the pace of economic growth will decline to about 3
per cent early next year because consumer spending has run ahead of personal
incomes.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<TEXT>
The Japanese government plans to increase substantially its wage subsidies
for middle-aged employees, who are the target of most companies' attempts to
reduce costs by cutting jobs.
Labour Ministry officials hope to safeguard as many as 1m jobs under the
scheme, under which the government will provide subsidies for the wages of
employees transferred to lower-paid positions and provide incentives for
companies willing to take on workers 45 years or older.
Japanese companies traditionally transfer older employees to affiliates or
subsidiaries during an economic downturn, but cases are on the rise of group
companies refusing to accept these employees, claiming that they, too, need
to reduce labour costs.
The trend is a challenge to the traditional system of lifetime employment
among leading companies, and the government fears that an increase in the
unemployment rate, now 2.7 per cent, would further undermine consumer
confidence, which is already shaky.
To support the labour market, the ministry is expecting to spend Y326bn
(Pounds 2.05bn) or three times the amount spent during the downturn in the
mid-1980s.
The final figure will however be decided by the Finance Ministry during
negotiations for the budget for the year beginning in April.
The government will subsidise a quarter of the wages of older workers at
larger companies and a third of the wages at smaller companies, and lower
the age limit for the subsidies from 55 years to 45 years.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Islamic party sets terms for Algeria talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The banned Algerian Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) yesterday set out its
conditions for opening talks with the government in an attempt to end the
civil conflict which has cost more than 3,000 lives in two years.
The offer, which could open the way to direct negotiations, came a week
after General Mohamed Touati, one of the country's most respected military
leaders, said on state television that the government would consider
'talking to leaders of the FIS who show respect for the law of the land'.
The FIS was banned after appearing to be on the verge of winning
parliamentary elections in January 1992.
Mr Rabah Khebir, the FIS spokesman who took refuge in Germany last year,
said at a press conference in Bonn that his party insisted on five
conditions being met before it would agree to talk to the government.
These were: the freeing of all political prisoners; the repeal of laws
passed under emergency rule; the establishment of a 'free and independent'
committee to include the main political, religious and judicial forces in
Algeria; the bringing to trial of those 'responsible for recent bloody and
murderous acts'; and any talks would have to take place in a neutral country
to be chosen by both sides, he said.
Mr Khebir condemned the murder of 12 Croats on Tuesday near Algiers and said
that the FIS 'was not behind such calls for murder'. He added: 'The Algerian
people and the FIS have nothing against foreigners, who are welcome in
Algeria if they want to co-operate with the people.' He also warned that a
lot of what was happening in Algeria was outside the control of FIS and
could lead to revolution.
Responsibility for the 23 murders of foreigners over the past three months
has been claimed by two other radical Islamic factions, the Groupe Islamique
Arme and the Takfir wal Hijra.
General Touati, whose televised statement may have provoked the FIS offer,
is a member of the eight-man National Committee for Dialogue, an
organisation set up in the autumn with the aim of bringing all parties to
the negotiating table.
Secret contacts have recently taken place between members of the committee
and FIS representatives. But General Touati's offer was the first
acknowledgement by a senior military commander that the outlawed FIS
represents a political constituency which cannot be ignored.
Other parties, such as the moderate Islamic Hamas, the lay Front des Forces
Socialistes and the former ruling Front de Liberation National party, have
been urging the military to extend a hand to FIS. They argue that it is the
only way for Algeria to avoid a slide into civil war.
Armed police yesterday rounded up dozens of men after mass Moslem prayers at
two Algiers mosques frequented by fundamentalists, witnesses said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday displayed signs of compromise with
conservatives following the electoral setback for reformists at the hands of
ultra-nationalists and communists.
In a gesture to the state-owned-industry and agriculture lobby, he signed a
decree re-introducing subsidised loans for producers of agricultural
machinery, which, along with lending at rates well below inflation, were
supposed to have been phased out.
In an attempt to pre-empt the crackdown on law and order which will almost
certainly be demanded by the new parliament, he issued a decree promising
tough new border controls, including the checking of identification papers
and of asylum requests.
Yeltsin aides have already advised him to try to beat Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist who wants to be Russia's next president, at his
own game, for instance by taking the lead on law and order.
On foreign policy, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, has said Baltic
republics should help Moscow improve the lot of Russians on their territory
to counter support for extremist politicians such as Mr Zhirinovsky, who has
promised to defend Russians everywhere.
In an attempt to appear to be dealing with hidden unemployment which has not
yet translated into open job losses, Mr Yeltsin also cut Russian companies'
ability to hire labour from former Soviet republics and further afield.
Insisting that Russians should have priority on job vacancies, the decree
said companies must pay the equivalent of the minimum monthly wage for work
permits.
Mr Yeltsin also issued another decree to the effect that the central bank
had to obtain consent of the Finance Ministry to license banks to conduct
operations involving gold. The ministry is headed by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the
radical who wants to unseat the central bank chief.

FT  18 DEC 93 / French education finance row flares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first open row between Socialist President Francois Mitterrand and the
conservative Balladur government erupted yesterday over the latter's move to
scrap a 143-year-old restriction on public financing of private schools.
On a visit to south-west France, Mr Mitterrand told a delegation of teachers
and parents from the state school system that he was 'surprised and shocked'
at the 'precipitation' of the government in getting the Senate, at 5am on
Wednesday, to change an 1850 law on school finance.
The new bill would scrap the limitation on private, mainly Catholic, schools
which up to now have only been able to draw 10 per cent of their funding
from local public authorities. The government claimed it had to act quickly
on recent reports that half the country's private schools were unsafe and
needed money for urgent repairs.
Left-wing parties and teachers' unions have said the move will drain money
from the state system.
The Socialist and Communist parties have said they will appeal to the
country's constitutional court, and the president indicated yesterday he
would await that judgment before considering whether to throw the school
finance law back to parliament for further debate.
Many French schools were empty yesterday, as half the country's teachers
walked out and several thousand demonstrated in Paris.
Another day of protest has been set for January 16. Mr Michel Rocard, the
Socialist party leader, called for supporters of state education to turn out
then in the same huge numbers as private school backers had done in 1984 in
protest at Socialist education policy.
The 77-year-old president said that in his 35 years of parliamentary
experience he had never seen a similarly 'rushed' piece of legislation.
'If one were to push this to extremes, all difficult laws could be torn up
in the same way,' he said.
The row may mark an end to the 'gentle cohabitation' between the Socialist
president and conservative prime minister, with the latter now clearly
emboldened by his success on the Gatt agreements.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boris Fyodorov, Russia's finance minister, yesterday told the Group of
Seven countries which have spearheaded aid to his country that, in spite of
the controversial results of the recent election, there would still be a
majority in favour of continuing reform.
At a meeting in Paris with senior G7 officials, the minister said he was
confident that when the final election results were in, there would be 'a
parliamentary majority in favour of economic reform', according to a French
official.
'The meeting did not take any decisions, and was not supposed to do so,'
said the official.
Mr Fyodorov and the International Monetary Fund officials were both quoted
as expressing satisfaction with their current negotiations on future western
aid.
Russia has already received half of a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) special
'facility for systemic transformation' and is now seeking to persuade the G7
and the IMF that it is sufficiently committed to economic reform to merit
the rest, and eventually a regular IMF standby credit.
Earlier this week, Mr Al Gore, the US vice president, criticised the IMF and
the governments on its board for being insufficiently sensitive to the
effect of harsh budget cuts on individual Russians.
But, according to the French official, this was not echoed in yesterday's
meeting in Paris where the US was represented by Mr Larry Summers, the US
Treasury under-secretary.
The International Monetary Fund said yesterday it approved about Dollars
103m in credits for Moldova to help the country stabilise and reform its
economy, Reuter reports from Washington.
Despite declining economic activity and rising inflation, the former Soviet
republic made significant progress reforming its economy this year,
launching a privatisation programme, introducing a new currency and moving
to rein in the government budget deficit, the IMF said.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Government contracts to be opened up
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Government contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars are to be opened
to international competition for the first time following agreement on
government procurement concluded this week in Geneva in parallel with the
Uruguay Round talks on global trade liberalisation.
The agreement, which will cover both national and state-level government
contracts, as well as utilities such as water and electricity, will expand
tenfold the coverage of contracts open to international bidding, according
to staff at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The agreement, finalised this week, will apply to the 12 European Union
member states, and 11 other countries ranging from Japan, Hong Kong and
Korea to the European Free Trade Association countries, Canada and the US.
It will come into force at the beginning of 1996.
Under the agreement, foreign suppliers must be given no less favourable
treatment in government procurement than national suppliers.
This will involve clear rules on how to tender; no use of technical
specifications simply to block outside bidders; clear information on how
bidders qualify; proper notice of invitations to tender; providing tender
documents to potential suppliers; and full information afterwards on who won
a contract and on what terms.
The US and the European Union have been at loggerheads over procurement
contracts since early this year. A breakthrough occurred in May, when
negotiators agreed to hive off the telecommunications sector from the
procurement package. Talks on a separate telecommunications agreement aim to
reach a deal by early 1996.
The US has consistently claimed that it is more generous in the government
contracts it opens to international bidding. In 1990, it says bidding
opportunities worth Dollars 16.8bn (Pounds 11.3bn) were offered to EU
contractors - more than twice the Dollars 7.8bn offered by EU governments in
the same year.
The EU has replied that new EU procurement rules linked with creation of the
European single market have massively increased the contracts open to
foreign bidders since 1990. They have complained about US reluctance to
include state-level procurement business, much of which is protected by 'Buy
America' acts, within the scope of the agreement.
They have also fought to include contracts from private-sector companies,
such as water and power companies, which operate as effective oligopolies.
In many European countries, these are state-owned, and fall under the
government procurement accord.
After a long dispute over thresholds above which tenders must be open to
international bidding, the agreement sets a floor of SDR 130,000 (Pounds
121,000) for central government purchases of goods and services; SDR 200,000
for state or sub-federal bodies; SDR 400,000 for utilities; and SDR 5m for
construction contracts.
In response to fears that aggrieved bidders would not be able to challenge
an award they regarded as suspect, governments have agreed to put domestic
procedures in place to mount challenges, and obtain redress.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Italian Socialist party splits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's 100-year-old Socialist party has split, with the majority opting to
form a new movement with a different name and symbol.
The majority 58 per cent has backed the leadership of former trades unionist
Mr Ottaviano Del Turco, who took over the running of the party in May.
He has now been given full powers to call a special meeting on January 15 to
establish the new movement.
The minority is made up of faithful supporters of Mr Bettino Craxi, the
former party leader who was obliged to step down in February as a result of
his involvement in the corruption scandals.
The split followed a stormy meeting held throughout Thursday in a Rome
hotel, during which Mr Craxi and Mr Del Turco traded insults.
It marks the end of more than three decades in which the Socialists have
played a central role in Italian politics; and it is the first time since
1976 that Mr Craxi, once the party's all-powerful boss, has found himself in
a minority.
The break-up of the party has been expected for sometime in the wake of the
discredit caused by the corruption scandals and the divisions arising from
the arrogant behaviour of Mr Craxi. Although the party won almost 14 per
cent of the vote in the 1992 general elections, at the latest local
elections it mustered less than 2 per cent.
The Del Turco-led majority is now likely to seek an alliance on the left.
To underline the impact of the corruption scandals on the party's demise, Mr
Craxi yesterday appeared in court to give evidence in the trial of Mr Sergio
Cusani, who acted as an intermediary for the Socialists in the business
world.
He admitted that the entire system had been riddled with corruption and that
his and other parties had taken illicit contributions.
However, he refused to give any details of his personal involvement or to
admit he had taken any money for his own use, as he has been accused of
doing.
Mr Craxi went on to accuse all his political colleagues of hyprocrisy,
pretending to ignore the existence of illicit financing of political
parties.
He also made specific accusations against Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the leader
of the Senate and former head of the Republican party, and Mr Georgio
Napolitano, the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and a former communist,
alleging they were fully aware of illicit funding of their parties.
He also accused companies such as Fiat and Olivetti of being deeply involved
in the system of corruption.

FT  18 DEC 93 / European plan to cut ethylene capacity fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Efforts to restructure Europe's petrochemicals industry were in disarray
last night after plans to close as much as 2m tonnes of ethylene capacity
collapsed.
The sector is plagued by massive overcapacity of ethylene, the basic
building block of plastics, and is losing hundreds of millions of dollars a
month.
The plan had involved creating a DM550m (Pounds 216m) fund based on a levy
of DM30 per tonne of installed ethylene capacity.
Groups wanting to close plants would then have to bid for part of the fund
in return for shutting down capacity.
The Association of the Petrochemical Producers in Europe said the plan had
collapsed because not enough capacity had been put forward for closure and
some of its 31 members were not prepared to put money into the fund.
It said a substantial majority were in favour, but unanimity could not be
reached.
Mr Jean-Marie Devos, secretary general of Cefic, the European chemical
industry's trade association, said: 'We would have gone ahead despite some
companies refusing if there had been bids to shut substantial amounts of
capacity.'
An APPE survey asked ethylene producers how much they wanted to close
permanently through the fund.
'The survey indicated we couldn't reach even the mimimum threshold,' said Mr
Devos. This is thought to have been 1.5m tonnes.
Operations that may have been available for closure include BP Chemicals'
plant at Baglan Bay, BASF's 160,000-tonne-a-year plant at Ludwigshafen, a
complex at Luena in eastern Germany, and two Enichem plants at Gela and
Porto Torres.
The APPE said that it would be continuing to develop other proposals to
restructure the industry, which employs 600,000 people directly.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Kohl's health plan rejected by Bundesrat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's efforts to push through reforms aimed at financing
care for the aged failed yesterday, when the reforms were rejected by the
Bundesrat or upper house.
The reforms, aimed at shifting the burden of old age health care away from
local councils on to enterprises, were defeated by the opposition Social
Democrats, who form the majority in the Bundesrat. Another joint commission
 -the third so far - is expected to be set up in January to work out a new
proposal.
Mr Friedrich Bohl, head of the Chancellery, said the government was 'very
disappointed' with the result, and accused the SPD of blocking necessary
help for the 2m people dependent on nursing. Full time nursing, which costs
about DM5,000 (Pounds 1,950) a month, is financed by the municipalities,
many of which are running large budget deficits.
Mr Kohl, and Mr Norbert Blum, the labour minister, had pledged to introduce
reforms before next year's state and federal elections to win the votes of
the elderly.
The reform measures came unstuck after SPD officials representing the
Lander, or states, challenged the way in which employees would have to
finance the reforms.
The government had intended to seek contributions of 1 per cent a month
starting from 1994, and 1.7 per cent after 1996, which would be shared
equally by employees and employers.
But employers were sharply critical of the measures, saying they would
further reduce Germany's competitiveness by raising wage bills for industry.
At the insistence of the Free Democrats, the junior partners in the
coalition, a plan was tabled for compensating employers through a cut in
official holiday pay by 10 per cent from next year, and 20 per cent in 1996,
or through the scrapping of first one day of holiday, and then two, by 1996.
However, SPD deputies - and the trade unions - rejected both the
compensation arrangements, and the level of employee contributions.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Anger at steel subsidy scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German Steel Federation, yesterday
sharply denounced the steel subsidy package agreed by European Union
industry ministers, as 'pure window dressing for the gullibles', and
predicted dire consequences for Germany's private steel makers.
The deal, which will allow a series of state aids for public-sector steel
producers in east Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal, worth nearly Ecu7bn
(Pounds 5.3bn), also sets capacity cuts of over 5m tonnes.
Referring to yesterday as 'a black Friday for the private steel industry in
Europe', he accused the EU of 'once again handing out subsidies to ailing
state-owned steel makers at the expense of the taxpayers'.
'Capacity cuts will be made on paper only. In return, the Italian and
Spanish steel producers will receive billions in subsidies,' Mr Vondran
said.
Private steelmakers in Germany argue that capacity cuts offered by Spain and
Italy do not correspond to current output levels. Moreover, they add,
subsidies will give a competitive edge to state-owned steel companies at the
expense of the private sector. They warn this will force private steel
companies to further cut capacity and lay off tens of thousands of steel
workers.
'The politicians, including the German government, must decide if they are
willing to have an efficient German industry destroyed by the industrial
policies conducted in other European capitals,' he said. Mr Vondran also
accused Bonn of betraying German private steelmakers by winning approval for
subsidies for Ekostahl, the steel plant in eastern Germany.
The Treuhand privatisation agency, which runs Ekostahl, welcomed the
decision and said, 'It paves the way for restructuring the steel mill.'
The Treuhand, backed by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, had
for the past nine months lobbied European Union countries to support
subsidies totalling DM1bn (Pounds 393m) to modernise the plant in the
eastern state of Brandenburg.
Officials at the agency last night insisted that the subsidies would make
Ekostahl more competitive, and would not be 'indefinite'. They added that
the agreement was expected to restrict production to 900,000 tonnes of raw
steel a year until 1999, when output can then be raised to a maximum of 1.7m
tonnes a year.
Officials added that the Brussels decision was likely to speed privatisation
of the mill.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Serbs to vote as economy crumbles: Laura Silber on the
hardships after three years of war and 19 months of UN sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Journalists from Television Serbia are already toasting the victory of
Serbia's ruling Socialist party ahead of tomorrow's parliamentary elections,
so confident are they of another victory for their sponsors.
Their confidence may be misplaced. All the indications are that the
opposition are more popular and have run a better campaign.
Recent opinion polls indicate that opposition parties, notably DEPOS, the
opposition coalition led by Mr Vuk Draskovic, the ultranationalist Radicals
of Mr Vojislav Seselj, and the centrist Democratic party could pose a
challenge to Socialist majority rule.
But, after three years of war and 19 months of sanctions, Serbia has turned
into something of a never-never land and the results of opinion polls are
rarely borne out by the votes recorded.
'Under normal circumstances, the opposition would be a sure winner, but here
nothing is as it seems,' said a western diplomat, reflecting on whether the
Socialists would, for the third time since the first multiparty elections in
1990, succeed in capturing most of the 250 seats in the Serbian parliament.
As if oblivious to the rapidly deteriorating economy, a monthly inflation
rate of 450,000 per cent and an average wage of Pounds 1.50, the Socialists'
message ahead of the polls has been that President Slobodan Milosevic has
achieved Serbia's national goals and that only he can now secure a Greater
Serbia.
But, picking through rubbish bins, dispensing with colourful dinar notes too
worthless even to bother collecting, the inhabitants of Belgrade appear more
concerned with economic than with national salvation.
In the conviction that Serbs have won the war in Croatia and Bosnia, they
are preoccupied with how to survive.
The opposition has focused on this preoccupation and pitched its campaign at
countering the economic chaos, accusing the government of plunging Serbia's
7.1m voters into drastic impoverishment.
While the Socialists blame the economic situation on the UN sanctions,
imposed for Serbia's violent carve-up of Bosnia, the opposition is charging
that Serbian leaders have used the sanctions to fatten their own foreign
bank accounts.
Pitching for the moral high ground with slogans such as 'posteno',
Serbo-Croat for honesty, the opposition has run a seasoned campaign.
They have criticised Mr Milosevic for giving criminals free rein over
Serbia, by way of reference to Mafia boss, Mr Zeljko Raznatovic, alias
Arkan, the paramilitary leader who has formed a satellite party of the
Socialists in a bid for the extremist vote.
In the hope of deflecting the Socialists' usual charges of treachery, they
have also played the nationalist card.
'Sarajevo, Mostar, Benkovac, Pakrac, that is Serbia,' pledged a charismatic
Mr Draskovic, referring to cities in Bosnia and Croatia.
But they have been able to do little to counter the Socialists' iron grip of
the media.
Nor may they be in a position to counter the Socialists' penchant for
electoral manipulation and fraud: the virtually unknown party of the
Associated Left, led by the wife of Mr Milosevic, has been accused of being
a possible funnel for stolen votes.
And, even if the opinion polls are borne out and the Socialists lose their
majority, Mr Milosevic seems unlikely to bow to the results.
He may allow the opposition a few months in which to cope with the economic
deluge, before calling new elections, or, if really pressed, he could
declare a state of emergency and cement his grip on all institutions in
Serbia.
Whatever the result, the election is unlikely to have furthered the cause of
democracy in Serbia.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Metals group chief ousted: Six directors of Frankfurt-based
conglomerate lose jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The dazzling career of Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch as chief executive of
Metallgesellschaft came to an ignominious end yesterday when he was sacked
as head of the Frankfurt-based conglomerate.
Mr Schimmelbusch, a charismatic Austrian businessman, built the company into
one of Germany's largest industrial groups. Together with Mr Meinhard
Forster, the group's finance director, he was ousted following a meeting of
Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board. The meeting was convened to examine
the mounting problems of MG Corp, the group's US-based trading subsidiary,
which have triggered a liquidity crisis in the company as a whole.
Mr Schimmelbusch and Mr Forster were sacked on the grounds that they had
failed to keep the supervisory board informed of developments at MG Corp and
may have acted in breach of German corporate law. Four other directors left
the management board after reaching agreement with the supervisory board.
Mr Kajo Neukirchen, a former chief executive of the Hoesch steel group, who
has a reputation in Germany as a tough restructuring specialist, was
appointed as Mr Schimmelbusch's successor with immediate effect. Four
further new directors were appointed, three from outside the
Metallgesellschaft group.
The forced personnel changes are highly unusual for so large a German
company, bearing witness to the gravity of the problems at MG Corp.
Last week Metallgesellschaft was forced to turn to its bankers to negotiate
new credit lines after MG Corp was obliged to make large 'margin payments' -
cash calls - on oil futures contracts taken out in New York. Last week
Deutsche Bank, a big shareholder in Metallgesellschaft as well as creditor,
backed the company's line that the liquidity problems were temporary, caused
by technical developments in the oils futures markets.
It was clear from yesterday's announcement that investigations undertaken by
the banks in the meantime have uncovered far more serious problems.
The statement from the company cast little light on the scale of
Metallgesellschaft's problems, saying that investigations to date had
uncovered deficiencies in controls and management at MG Corp.
The investigations into MG Corp and other US subsidiaries would continue,
Metallgesellschaft said, and it was likely that the provisional loss of
DM347m (Pounds 137.6m) reported for the year to the end of September would
have to be restated. Turnover for last year was DM25.5bn.
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, Germany's two biggest banks which own more
than 10 per cent each of Metallgesellschaft, said they would continue to
provide financial support for the company.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Loyalists may end killings if IRA agrees ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Loyalist gunmen in Northern Ireland yesterday ruled out a unilateral
ceasefire but held out the prospect of an end to killings if the IRA laid
down its arms.
The Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC), in its first response to this
week's declaration by the British and Irish prime ministers, made clear the
IRA must make the first move. In the absence of any response from the
'Provisional murder gangs', it would pursue its 'stated policy in
retaliation to IRA violence'.
The loyalist statement came as Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister,
fleshed out Dublin's proposal for a peace forum to pave the way for an early
entry by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into dialogue.
Mr Reynolds told the Dail (the Irish parliament) that the forum would
initially draw together strands of nationalist opinion in both parts of the
island.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, yesterday held out the prospect
of lifting Ireland's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, if it accepted the peace
initiative.
The ban comes up for its annual review next month. Mr Spring said: 'I would
like to feel we can arrive at a decision which will further promote and
enhance the prospects of an open dialogue, in which everyone who accepts a
democratic mandate can take part.'
Mr Peter Brooke, UK national heritage secretary, is expected to report to Mr
John Major on a review of British restrictions on broadcasting direct speech
by members of terrorist groups in the province early next year.
Downing Street officials sought to underline the degree of cross-party
backing in Britain for the peace initiative by praising Thursday night's
broadcast by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader.
Their comments follow unease on the Tory backbenches over the extent to
which they perceive the Downing Street Declaration as diluting the
government's commitment to the Union and embracing the nationalist agenda.
A further boost for the peace initiative came when Cardinal Cahal Daly, the
all-Ireland primate for the Roman Catholic Church, said the declaration gave
paramilitaries on both sides an honourable opportunity to halt their violent
campaigns.
As a poll suggested the people of Ulster were divided over whether the
initiative was a first step towards peace, the CLMC said it was seeking
clarification on certain aspects of the joint declaration. It would make a
'considered response' later.
The CLMC - an umbrella group comprising principally the Ulster Freedom
Fighters and the Ulster Volunteer Force - also called for a unionist forum
'to encompass all the loyalist and unionist political parties'.
Mr Reynolds said the peace forum would pave the way for wider talks between
nationalist and unionist parties together.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Annenberg gives Dollars 500m to help troubled US schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Teachers labouring in US schools beset by violence and declining results
yesterday received an early Christmas present.
Mr Walter Annenberg, the publishing magnate and philanthropist who was
President Richard Nixon's ambassador to London, announced he would give
Dollars 500m (Pounds 335m) to help improve the US public education system.
The 85-year-old Mr Annenberg, who has already donated hundreds of millions
of dollars to universities and private schools, said he had been deeply
troubled by the violence in some schools. 'If this continues it will not
only erode the educational system but will destroy our way of life in the
United States.'
The gift is the largest ever made to the US public education system. It will
initially include a Dollars 60m grant to the New American Schools
Development Corporation, a government-sponsored initiative to promote
innovation in education, and Dollars 15m for the Education Commission of the
States to help local governments reform their school systems.
Mr Annenberg will also give Dollars 15m to set up an Institute for School
Reform at Brown University. The rest of the gift will be channelled through
other educational organisations.
Educators have expressed growing concern about the difficulties of teaching
in schools whose students routinely carry guns and knives. Many inner city
schools have set up metal detectors to screen students.
One recent study showed that 100,000 students bring guns to school every
day.
Mr Annenberg, who sold his Triangle magazine publishing empire to Mr Rupert
Murdoch for Dollars 3bn five years ago, earlier this year gave Dollars 120m
each to the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern
California, and Dollars 100m to the Peddie School, a preparatory school
which he attended.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Poor advice on pensions feared for 1m women: Survey
indicates mis-selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 1m women who contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension
Scheme to invest in personal pensions may have been better off staying in
the state scheme because they earn too little to benefit from tax incentives
which make contracting out worthwhile.
Government statistics released by the Department of Social Security
yesterday show that, in addition to unsuitable pension sales to these women,
there may also have been widespread mis-selling to other personal pension
holders.
The first demographic analysis of personal pension holders in Britain shows
significant numbers of sales to those who cannot benefit from tax
incentives. These people may in fact be worse off if they contract out of
Serps because they have given up their rights to state benefits.
The data show that the tax rebates which have been a chief selling point
contribute very little to the average personal pension. The median annual
contribution from tax rebates for women was Pounds 205 per year, and for men
Pounds 395.
Government statistics released yesterday also show that the greatest
increase in personal pension sales in the 1991-92 fiscal year was to those
who were 45 years or over at the time, and who would have been better off
remaining in Serps.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog,
has announced a sweeping review of all personal pensions sold to individuals
who have transferred out of their occupational schemes.
The SIB commissioned a study by accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick which,
after a sample review of files, found that there was clear evidence that
nine out of 10 files contained too little information, suspect advice or
both. The SIB has said it also intends to review the sale of rebate-only
pensions.
The government data represent the first comprehensive review of the
categories of people who make up the UK's 5m personal pensions holders. It
examines which types of individuals have received more than Pounds 9bn in
tax benefits since personal pensions were introduced in mid-1988.
The data show that a significant number of personal pensions - 18 per cent
of the total - have been sold to those with no income, and another 7 per
cent were sold to people earning under the Pounds 2,704 a year lower limit
who did not have to pay national insurance.
The statistics show that the median income of women personal pension holders
is Pounds 6,250. While estimates vary of just how much income an individual
needed in 1991/92 to benefit from contracting out, insurance companies agree
that at least Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 8,000 of earnings would be required.
The study found that the median income of male personal pension holders was
Pounds 9,550, suggesting that significant numbers of men had also contracted
out against their own interests.

FT  18 DEC 93 / UK shares hit new high as economic outlook brightens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in London closed last night at another record high, boosted by hopes
of steady economic growth next year with inflation staying weak.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading stocks climbed 25.9 to finish at 3,337.1, for
a 76-point rise on the week. Since the day before the Budget on November 30,
share prices have gained 7 per cent.
UK government bonds also continued their good run, with prices driven up by
low inflationary pressures and expectations of a cut in interest rates early
in the new year.

FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Ascom bullish on Bosch venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ascom, the Swiss tele-communications group, yesterday said a planned venture
with Robert Bosch, the German electronics and auto parts manufacturer, in
private mobile radio would lead to improved results in 1995, Reuter reports
from Berne.
The company said that negotiations about the venture would be completed
during next year and until then Ascom would be responsible for all losses
and restructuring costs at Ascom Radiocom, the fully owned private mobile
radio subsidiary.
However, Robert Bosch said it planned to take a majority stake in
Switzerland's Ascom Radiocom. It said an agreement had been signed with
Ascom on Wednesday.
'With this co-operation Bosch's radio communications technology business
should be further strengthened in the European private mobile radio market,'
Robert Bosch said. Bosch has an annual turnover of DM280m (Dollars 163m) in
its private mobile radio division which employs 1,100. Ascom will set aside
provisions for 1994 losses and restructuring this year.
'The results will be significantly relieved in 1995,' a spokesman said.
Ascom lost SFr79m in the first half of 1993 and has predicted a marked loss
for the full year, mainly due to losses at the Radiocom unit.

FT  17 DEC 93 / EU faces dispute over industrial aid: Commission presses UK
and France to reduce bids for regional funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A row is brewing in the European Union over the share-out between the 12
member states of structural aid for industrially depressed, high
unemployment regions. The chief reason is that the UK and France are bidding
for very large slices of an assistance fund worth Ecu30bn (Dollars 34bn).
The funding is for so-called Objective 2 areas which are judged to be in
industrial decline, and is part of the overall Ecu156bn regional aid budget
for the 1994-99 period. Most of this goes to the four poorest member states,
whereas Objective 2 funding is channelled to the black spots in larger
economies.
The current dispute arises because the regulations approved in July oblige
the Objective 2 portion to be concentrated on a maximum of 15 per cent of
the EU population.
However, total bids put in by the 12 members would cover 23 per cent of the
Union's inhabitants. European Commission officials say that after tough
negotiations, 10 of the member states are satisfied.
But the UK has bid for Objective 2 funding to cover 40 per cent of the
British population, while the bid from France wants coverage for one-third
of its inhabitants.
Both countries have been asked to submit more reasonable bids. If they do
not, the Commission will be obliged to make aid decisions for them, which
would probably lead to serious political friction.
Eligibility for Objective 2 aid has until now required an unemployment rate
higher than the EU average, a higher percentage of industrial employment
than the EU average and a decline specifically in industrial employment.
These criteria, which are relatively easy to measure, were ratified in July.
But new, more judgmental criteria were added, for instance on matters such
as aid to rebuild inner cities. This prompted overbidding and complicated
the share-out.
Commission officials are also particularly dismissive of some of the areas
on the UK's shopping list, such as the Isle of Wight and parts of south-east
England, which they do not regard as meeting the criteria.
After some delay, the Commission is expected to deal with the issue on
Tuesday. The probable clash between Brussels and London and Paris could
spread to other EU members if the Commission makes any significant
concessions to the UK and France, since any extra funding they gain would
have to be taken from their EU partners. This would prove difficult since Mr
Jacques Delors, the Commission president, has in some cases, such as the
Netherlands and Italy, already made firm funding commitments.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Deadlock over EU pension fund rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands yesterday rejected a compromise aimed
at opening up cross-border investment by European pension funds, on the
grounds that it did not go far enough.
Internal market ministers were again unable to agree on the pension funds
directive, which is supposed to improve pension funds' ability to invest
their assets in other countries of the European Union.
Nine ministers yesterday supported a compromise deal which would allow
member states to oblige pension funds to invest as much as 80 per cent of
their assets in the currency in which its pensioners are paid.
But Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands, which impose no restrictions on
their pension funds' investments, believe such an obligation would run
counter to the single market's commitment to the free movement of capital
around the EU.
'There is still a pension fund directive that we would like - but this isn't
it,' said one UK official.
Normally, the dissenting trio could be outvoted by the other nine member
states, but the European Commission is also opposed to the 80 per cent
limit, and this means approval of the compromise has to be unanimous. The
Commission said it could accept a currency matching requirement of 60 per
cent, but no higher.
The internal market ministers also agreed a separate and controversial
proposal offering patent protection to biotechnological inventions.
For months the European Parliament has held up progress on the measure
because of ethical objections, particularly to the possibility that the
directive might lead to patents on genetically modified human cells or parts
of the body.
Ministers had to resolve a number of complex outstanding technical issues.
Environmental groups and political parties have argued that approval of the
directive could lead to higher prices for food, medicine and other products
of biotechnology, with farmers obliged to pay royalties on new strains of
plants and livestock.

A special report in today's FT tells the story of the attempt by Mr Chris
Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to win China's agreement to faster democracy
in the colony, based on interviews with Mr Patten and with Chinese and
British officials. It reveals that before arriving in Hong Kong last year Mr
Patten was rebuffed in an attempt to open a secret channel of communication
to Beijing. Failure of the talks has left in doubt Hong Kong's smooth
transition to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Sino-British impasse, Page 6;

FT  17 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Paper group shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paper group Arjo Wiggins Appleton surprised the market by announcing the
resignation of Mr Gordon Bond, chief executive of its printing and writings
division, and the shares fell sharply in nervous reaction. They closed 23
down at 226p on heavy volume of 10m.
Mr Bond joined the company in January and analysts said there had been no
indication of any difference of opinion. When the statement came out,
specialists were surprised by the lack of information it contained. Many
read between the lines to see a conflict between Mr Bond and the French
group St Louis, which holds a 40 per cent stake. There was also talk of a
clash with Mr Alain Soulas, the French chief executive.
The report from the Securities and Investments Board on the life and
pensions industry impacted sharply on the life stocks, where Lloyds Abbey
Life was the worst affected, finishing 19 cheaper at 412p, closely followed
by groups such as Britannic, 9 weaker at 434p, Legal &amp; General, 18 down at
505p, and Prudential, which lost 9 to 345p.
Criticisms of the life companies' selling methods, however, were said to be
already reflected in share prices, according to leading insurance analysts.
'There will be a bounce in the life stocks from these levels,' said a
specialist.
The SIB report was said to have prompted a flurry of selling pressure in
banks such as Lloyds, 9 off at 630p, and TSB, 5 cheaper at 240p, with both
said to be affected by worries about life and pensions concerns. National
Westminster dropped 16 to 581p on turnover of 4.1m after BZW was said to
have adopted a more bearish stance on the shares, following similar recent
moves by securities houses such as Hoare Govett and Kleinwort Benson.
British Petroleum's investment seminar in New York, delivering essentially
the same highly positive story as it did to European analysts in London on
Wednesday, drew a good response from the US institutions.
The latter, big buyers of BP shares over the past 15 months, moved in again
to push the stock up to 348p, before it closed a net 9 1/2 ahead at 342 1/2
p. Turnover reached a hefty 25m shares, the highest single day's volume
since the beginning of November.
Analysts in London said the US institutions were worried about missing what
could be a period of strong outper-formance by BP. News of cut-backs in
crude oil output by Oman was said to have had little impact in the market
yesterday.
British Gas moved up 5 further to 360p on relatively small turnover of 8m
shares as the market braced itself for imminent news from the president of
the board of trade on the possible break-up of the company and a possible
reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
SmithKline Beecham rose 14 to 395p in the 'A' stock and 6 to 358p in the
units after Wednesday's late announcement that the company had received
preliminary approval in the US for Kytril, its treatment for sickness in
cancer patients. The units, which tend to reflect US interest, were heavily
traded, with one block of 8m shares dealt at 343p making up most of the
day's turnover of more than 13m. The 'A's saw more than 12m traded.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome was volatile on a mixed reception to its agm.
The shares were up 11 and down 7 before ending 4 off at 631p.
The building materials sector of the market was one of the areas said to
have been squeezed higher, with marketmakers acutely short of stock chasing
share prices ahead to try to level their short positions. Big winners
included Wolseley, 31 up at 864p, BPB, 9 dearer at 333p, BCI, 9 firmer at
345p, and Hepworth, which added 11 at 435p. RMC climbed 15 to 945p. Redland
continued to shrug off the weakness prompted by the loss of the finance
director earlier this week, closing 13 better at 585p.
Housebuilders also gained substantial ground. Berkeley Group, which
delivered above average results earlier this week, was 9 1/2 stronger at
507p.
Vodafone moved against the overall trend, ending 5 lighter at 556p after
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank and one of Vodafone's bigger
supporters over recent years, was said to have adopted a more cautious line.
Spirits groups were lifted by the Gatt agreement, Guinness advancing 5 to
482p, Highland Distilleries 19 to 356p and Allied-Lyons 10 to 635p. Grand
Metropolitan, which announ-ced slightly contentious executive changes this
week, was again volatile, losing 8 to 443p.
Among holiday operators, Owners Abroad reported a restructuring involving
the loss of 260 jobs. The shares eased a penny to 79p. Analysts said the
changes being wrought by the new management would have little effect until
the 1995 season. Airtours unveiled a major rebranding of its booking
operations. The shares appreciated 8 to 478p.
Electrical retailer Dixons again lost ground, with Smith New Court said to
have downgraded its profits forecasts. The shares slid 9 to 267p.
Fashion company Jacques Vert announced that interim profits, at around
Pounds 1.2m, would be better than expected when they are revealed in
January. The stock jumped 27 to 179p.

FT  17 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Darty nerves hit Kingfisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A range of discouraging tales surrounding Kingfisher combined to push the
shares sharply lower. Most prominent of the cautionary tales was nervousness
ahead of results today from Darty, the French electrical retailing
subsidiary bought by Kingfisher for Pounds 560m in February this year. These
figures were due a month ago but were postponed by Kingfisher for technical
reasons, a move which still left some investors nervous. Analysts expect
Darty to produce profits in the region of Pounds 100m.
There was also talk emanating from Wall Street that one broker was
speculating on the likelihood of a leading US home products group entering
the UK DIY market. Statistics were said to have been produced showing the
higher margins of the UK business. This, together with the fairly parlous
state of the UK DIY market, encouraged suggestions that Texas Homecare,
owned by Ladbroke and rumoured to be up for sale, was the most likely
target. Kingfisher owns the DIY market leader B&amp;Q. Finally, there was
continuing talk of flat pre-Christmas sales among stores stocks in general.
Kingfisher shares ended the session 15 down at 710p. Ladbroke gained 5 at
158p.

FT  17 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: New peak as futures continue to lead
shares - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another volatile trading session in the London stock market yesterday left
market indices at new peaks, with interest rate optimism undimmed by the
Bundesbank's decision to leave key German rates unchanged. The FT-SE 100
Index closed decisively above the 3,300 mark and volume was high as basket
trading between equities and stock index futures increased ahead of the
expiry this morning of the December contract on the Footsie.
The market closed just below the day's best, with the FT-SE 100-Share Index
32.4 ahead at 3,311.2, having established a new intraday peak of 3.313.6
earlier. Spreading confidence across the range of the stock market pushed
the FT-SE Mid 250 Index up by 42.6 to 3,674.1. Activity among the Footsie
Mid 250 stocks indicates the presence of the private investor; these stocks
are less affected by futures-related business than the Footsie 100.
Further evidence of economic recovery in the UK came in the form of a larger
fall than expected in UK unemployment in November. Expectations of cuts in
UK base rates early in the New Year remained solid, with analysts
unperturbed by the Bundesbank's unchanged stance at yesterday's meeting.
Reductions in interest rates throughout Europe are still confidently
expected.
The most significant factor, however, was the pressure from the stock index
futures market. At least five programme trades crossed the trading screens
as the big futures players covered positions in futures, where both the
December and March contracts on the Footsie are now in full cry. Traders are
rolling positions over into the March contract.
Those marketmakers lacking positions to arbitrage between the two markets
found themselves victims of the programme trades which intensified the
squeeze in the blue chip stocks to near unbearable proportions. Seaq volume
jumped to 923m shares from Wednesday's 753m and heavy trading losses were
suffered by some marketmaking houses.
The market's mood was shown at the opening, with the first official reading
on the Footsie showing a gain of 15 points on overnight, as London
concentrated on its own futures sector and ignored the overnight setback on
Wall Street. From that time on, traders kept their eyes on the futures
premium and the net gain on the Footsie hovered around 30 points for most of
the session. At the close, London again ignored Wall Street which edged
ahead by 7 Dow points in UK hours.
Utility stocks again responded strongly to the higher dividend payments from
the sector. Among the interest related issues, consumer stocks did well but
stores remained heavily overshadowed by conflicting reports on the progress
of the all-important Christmas selling season.
Firmness in sterling in the wake of the UK unemployment figures gave no help
to the overseas earning stocks but this was counterbalanced by the presence
of most of these blue chip stocks in the Footsie 100 Index list which placed
them among the futures-related basket trades.
Some traders began to ask yesterday whether the London market was becoming
overbought. The futures settlement is likely to dominate the stock market
this morning but once this is out of the way, share prices will have little
else to lead them until after the Christmas-New Year break.

FT  17 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volatile and active dealing in derivatives yesterday pointed to choppy
trading at this morning's futures and options expiry, writes Peter John.
Dealers said that the affect of so-called 'triple witching hour' in the US
could also spill over to London.
Open interest, the number of futures contracts awaiting expiry, was still
high by the the close of dealing yesterday - around 15,000 December futures
will have to be closed out in the contracts remaining two and a half hours
according to some estimates.
Under normal circumstances many of the positions would be rolled forward
into the March contract. However, the spread between March and December was
30 points at the official close compared to a fair value estimate of around
14.
Consequently, many dealers will prefer to roll out by selling their
positions and buying the Footsie or vice versa depending on whether they are
long or short. The battle between the longs and shorts will tug at the cash
market.
The December future was volatile yesterday, trading four points below cash
and 10 above before closing at a premium of 3 points.
It opened at 3,305, reached 3,318 and then closed officially at 3,313 on
turnover of 17,530. A further 4,000 contracts were traded in late dealing.
March opened at 3,334 and closed at 3,342 on turnover of 13,968.
FT-SE options are also due to expire and their imminent end boosted total
options turnover to 51,787 against 31,079 on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, the US sees expiry of index options and futures as well as equity
options and there is futures expiry in the Netherlands, Germany and
Switzerland.

FT  17 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies on bargain
hunting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks yesterday staged a half-hearted rally as bargain hunters moved in
after two losing sessions, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 9.22 firmer at 3,726.14,
while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.50 at 463.34. The American SE
composite put on 1.50 at 461.44 and the Nasdaq composite added 2.56 at
755.53. New York SE volume was 284.6m shares.
Stocks opened on a firmer note, but a further batch of favourable economic
news appeared to have less influence on sentiment than did the opportunity
for bargain hunting presented by the 48-point decline in the Dow over the
previous two sessions.
The day's stream of data merely filled in details of a now familiar portrait
of the economy. In the most prominent report, the US merchandise trade
deficit showed a slight easing in October, but solid gains in both imports
and exports suggested heightened business activity.
The market has already factored a strong fourth quarter into share prices,
and now seems more preoccupied with the prospect of rising short-term
interest rates early next year, which could drain funds out of stocks.
Among the Dow components, 3M advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to 113, Boeing Dollars 1
1/4 to Dollars 44 and JP Morgan also Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 71 5/8 .
But UAL, parent of United Airlines, dropped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 144
after announcing an agreement under which employees would acquire a majority
stake in the carrier. Investors were concerned that the company was giving
away too much value to the unions and not adequately compensating existing
shareholders for the dilution of their equity.
Merry-Go-Round, the most active issue of the day, plunged Dollars 3 5/8 to
Dollars 2 5/8 on 9.7m shares traded amid reports that the clothing chain was
unable to make payments to some creditors. In other retailing stocks, The
Limited shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 17 1/2 after the stock was downgraded
by Alex Brown &amp; Sons.
Eastman Kodak, a big loser on Wednesday, shed a further Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 54 1/8 .
Fruit of the Loom's plunge also continued, the stock dropping Dollars 3 3/8
to Dollars 24 1/2 after announcing that its earnings would fall short of
analysts' forecasts.
Canada
Toronto ended slightly lower after relatively light trading. The TSE 300
index slipped 9.4 to 4,216.2 and declines outnumbered advances by 410 to
387. Volume came to 59.3m shares.
Eight of the 14 sub-indices lost ground, led by transportation, off 1.2 per
cent. Airline issue PWA fell 12 cents to CDollars 1.11 on the day's heaviest
volume of 1.6m shares.

FT  17 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Spain and Italy lead turnover gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
November was a remarkably firm month for European bourse volume, says Mr
James Cornish of NatWest Securities, which produces the figures.
After a fall of 10.1 per cent in September from the August level, and a
compensating gain of 10.1 per cent, again, in October, Europe's eight
biggest markets turned over 2.9 per cent more in November than in the month
before.
This happened in spite of a 1.5 per cent fall in the FT-Actuaries Europe
index for the month, says Mr Cornish, as markets consolidated following
October's steep increase, with only Brussels and Zurich out of the eight
showing a rise on the month in share price terms.
The UK, with an economy further on its way out of recession, had a good
month with a turnover gain of 6.7 per cent, up 5.2 per cent on a 'very
respectable' three month average, animated by budget hopes. The London
market weighs heavily in the overall figures but, even excluding it, the
continental seven still show a turnover gain of 0.9 per cent for the period.
In fact, the biggest increases in volume last month came from the two
markets which fell furthest: Spain, down by just under 5 per cent, and
Milan, down 6 per cent. To Mr Cornish, this suggests an active European
equity market with institutions keen to buy as well as sell.
Institutional funds have big profits on their continental equity portfolios
this year, so they can be uninhibited about selling. In 1993, when equity
markets were far less comfortable, falls in share prices frequently
reflected market makers marking them down, while the institutions sat on
their hands.
Spain chalked up a 33 per cent rise in November turnover, up 47 per cent on
the average of the previous three months, as share prices went on the slide.
The Madrid bourse was disappointed in its hopes of an early cut in interest
rates, where the cut did not come until December 3, and there was also a
peak in volume ahead of a futures expiry. Mr Cornish notes that volumes on
Seaq International, the London screen-based trading system, almost doubled
for Spain on the month, also to a record high.
In Italy, turnover showed a gain of nearly 12 per cent on the month, but the
figure was still down by over 14 per cent from the average of the previous
quarter, reflecting a further fall in share prices in November as political
nervousness fed on the collapse of the centre in the first round of the
local elections.
The Netherlands saw turnover rise 8.4 per cent to a new high as share prices
showed some resistance to profit-taking, but the markets where share prices
actually rose on the month did less well, the Swiss with a turnover gain of
4.6 per cent (albeit to a new record) and the Belgians with one of just 0.7
per cent.
Germany and France both did lower business on the month, but they were up by
3.1 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively on very high averages for
August/October.
There seemed to be a pattern within November, says Mr Cornish. At the
beginning of the month, there was a sell-off in the US bond market following
strong US employment figures for October. The thought that American money
would race back into the domestic fixed interest market after its recent
adventures abroad led to equity sales in Europe and elsewhere.
Later in the month those fears subsided, and were replaced by a run of
strength which ran on until late last week, giving volumes a good start to
December.

FT  17 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich higher after cut in
Swiss discount rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses were relatively subdued, rate cuts or the absence of them doing
little to influence share prices, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH gave an initially muted response to the 25 basis point cut in the
discount rate but it picked up later in the day, led by the chemicals
sector. The SMI index added 17.1 to 2,867.7.
Buying of Roche certificates, up SFr50 to SFr6,250, by one small bank
triggered demand elsewhere in the sector. Ciba registered rose SFr17 to
SFr832.
Ascom added SFr90 to SFr1,290 on news that it planned a joint venture,
controlled by Germany's Robert Bosch, into which the Swiss group would bring
its loss making Radiocom subsidiary.
SMH bearers shed SFr31 to SFr950 ahead of news, after the market closed, of
a change in shareholder structure.
Swissair, which forecast a group profit for the year rose SFr15 to SFr780:
in September the group said only that it expected to break even.
FRANKFURT was quiet as the market waited for the Bundesbank's decision on
key interest rates, turnover easing from DM9.9bn to DM9.2bn as the DAX index
closed 26.75 higher at 2,137.45.
After hours, with rates unchanged, the Ibis indicated DAX rose another 6.58
to 2,144.03.
At corporate level, the engineer and truckmaker, MAN, rose DM8 to DM385.50
although it said that a further deterioration in its results could not be
ruled out next year. Volkswagen rose DM8.50 to DM418.50 after an Frankfurt
court turned down an appeal by Adam Opel, GM's German unit, for an
injunction to prevent seven former employees from working for VW.
Metallgesellschaft fell DM12.20, or 4 per cent moreto DM293.00. There were
stories of executive resignations in the US, where the drop in the oil price
has caused the group embarassment, and confirmation of a supervisory board
meeting at the parent company today.
MILAN turned easier in the absence of a German rate cut, the real-time
Mibtel index finishing 87, or 0.8 per cent lower at 10,464. The market was
also depressed post-privatisation profit-taking in Credito Italiano, which
fell L85 to L2,237 in the day's highest volume of 26.2m shares.
Ferruzzi, which launches its L2,480bn capital increase on Tuesday fell
L3,254 or 10.7 per cent, to L27,192 as investors switched to the savings
shares, which rose L46.10 or 11 per cent to L465.5. Holders of the savings
issues will have the same buying rights for the second and third tranches of
the capital increase as holders of the ordinary stock.
Alitalia marked its debut on the screen based trading system with a L36 or
5.1 per cent rise to L746 amid reports of a planned restructuring.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index closed virtually unchanged, easing
just 0.9 to 1,361.0; but the SX 16 index, which tracks the 16 most active
issues, dropped 0.46 per cent to 1426.35, due mainly to continued losses for
Ericsson, hit by large waves of selling over the session.
Ericsson B, a US favourite earlier this year when it hit a high of SKr477,
dropped another SKr14, or 4.2 per cent to SKr316 with international
investors heavy net sellers and little or no domestic buying interest to
cushion the fall; dealers said that the fall accelerated in the last hour of
trading, after the opening of US markets. Volume remained heavy, rising from
SKr1.58bn to SKr1.77bn. Ericsson was the most active stock, accounting for
SKr350m of that.
PARIS fell slightly, dealers saying that investors were closing their
positions before the year-end. The CAC-40 index fell 2.37 to 2,160.26,
turnover dropping from FFr5.67bn to some FFr4.2bn.
Thomson-CSF, up FFr2 on Wednesday, rose another FFr1.80 to FFr162.80. Its
chairman said that the company should be able to maintain profits in spite
of an expected fall in defence electronics activity.
Rhone-Poulenc fell another FFr2.30 to FFr141.40. Goldman Sachs rated its
Rorer healthcare subsidiary as a poetntial underperformer in the US market,
and there was further weakness yesterday in Institut Merieux, its partner in
a delayed merger, which fell another FFr42 to FFr2,055.
MADRID's cash market followed higher futures prices, the general index
rising 2.44 to 307.51.
Iberdrola rose Pta21 to Pta948 after Standard &amp; Poors said that it was
considering a lift in the utility's long term debt rating.
AMSTERDAM climbed 1.5 per cent amid short covering and a lack of sellers.
Elsevier rose Fl 2.80 to Fl 165 after news that it had taken a stake in an
Italian publisher.
WARSAW hit its third consecutive high this week, the WIG index rising 263,
or 2.5 per cent to 10,677 in turnover of 1,100bn zloty.

FT  17 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei advances 1.7% as
region sets further records

The Japanese government's decision to extend the current parliamentary
session by 45 days encouraged investors, and the Nikkei average advanced 1.7
per cent on buying by arbitrageurs and foreign investors, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index rose 300.13 to 17,789.28, while the Topix index of all
first section stocks put on 21.86, or 1.5 per cent, at 1,474.21.
The Nikkei opened at the day's low of 17,514.35 and rose to a high of
17,911.99 during the morning session. Overnight strength on the Chicago
futures market spurred buying on the Osaka exchange, which in turn prompted
arbitrage buying. Overseas investors were also seen purchasing
export-related stocks. However, profit-taking by institutional investors
prevented the index from rising past 18,000.
Volume totalled 338.4m shares, against 237m. Advances overwhelmed declines
by 963 to 100, with 105 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
added 3.67 at 1,216.16.
Late on Wednesday night, the seven-party coalition, which has a slim
majority in the lower house, forced a vote to extend the parliamentary
session. The supplementary bill, which incorporates a large amount of the
fiscal package announced last September, was subsequently passed.
Investors who had been inactive due to worries over political turmoil came
back as buyers. Foreign investors were seen in pursuit of automobile stocks,
Nissan Motor climbing by Y13 to Y730 and Honda Motor by Y40 to Y1,550.
Electronics issues continued to rise. Sony moved ahead Y70 to a year's high
of Y5,500, while Matsushita Electric Industrial advanced Y50 to Y1,520 and
Aiwa Y50 to Y1,880.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone added Y13,000 at Y761,000, posting its sixth
consecutive gain, and East Japan Railway ended Y19,000 higher at Y438,000.
Bank shares, which have been weak recently on index-linked selling, gained
ground. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y50 to Y2,900 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
Y10 to Y1,810.
However, profit-taking depressed regional banks, with Musashino Bank falling
Y400 to Y6,000 and Aichi Bank Y100 to Y10,300.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 441.03 to 19,666.20 in volume of 59.9m
shares. Konami, a electronic game maker, moved forward Y320 to Y3,700.
Roundup
Record-setting performances featured again in many of the markets around the
Pacific Basin.
Bombay remained closed for the third day because of the brokers' boycott in
protest at the ban on carry forward deals.
HONG KONG resumed its advance after the two-day consolidation and the Hang
Seng index rose by 394.40, or 4 per cent, to a record 10,339.66.
The index also hit an all-time intraday high of 10,353 in late trading as
foreign institutions concentrated on domestic factors such as the better
than expected results from Wednesday's land auction, and overseas prospects,
as reasons to resume buying blue chips.
Dao Heng Bank Group's surge contributed much to the buoyant sentiment. The
bank, on its Hong Kong debut, was up to HKDollars 36.75 from its HKDollars
21.70 offer price, after touching HKDollars 38.
SINGAPORE finished at a high, although profit-taking amid talk of brokers
reimposing tighter trading conditions dampened speculative trade in the
afternoon.
The Straits Times Industrial index was finally 14.75 stronger at 2,285.99,
after setting an intraday peak of 2,294.50.
TAIWAN overcame bouts of profit-taking to remain at a 22-month high in
hectic trade, extending a rally that has taken the market up 28 per cent
since the ruling Nationalist Party's election victory on November 27.
The index gained 170.07, or 3.3 per cent, at 5,331.87 in turnover of
TDollars 100.43bn, against Wednesday's TDollars 129.65bn.
KARACHI closed at another new high, the KSE 100-share index climbing 31.81
to 1,987.72 as Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, pledged to improve
credit facilities for textile exporters.
SEOUL disregarded South Korea's change of prime minister and closed at a
year's high on demand for blue chips.
The composite index moved up 4.86 to 870.72, surpassing the previous closing
high of 866.88 on December 11.
JAKARTA posted a record close, the market index adding 9.52 at 553.36 in
active trading as local investors bought selected stocks heavily.
NEW ZEALAND finished firmly, with some end-of-year book-squaring seen, and
the NZSE-40 capital index put on 9.92 at 2,099.22.
Fletcher appreciated 10 cents to NZDollars 3.43 as speculation that there
would be a pre-Christmas placement by the government of its 6.7 per cent
holding looked less likely.
MANILA looked ahead to the prospects for 1994, decided the omens were good,
and the composite index rose 47.14 to a high of 2,614.97.
KUALA LUMPUR was easier on profit-taking, sentiment soured by talk of
restrictions on contra trading. The composite index lost 3.50 at 1,112.59.
BANGKOK saw a round of profit-taking during the late afternoon when the SET
index failed to break through the key 1,550-point level. The index finished
6.40 down at 1,512.66, having turned back from a day's high of 1,547.96.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Markets Report: D-Mark broadly firmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's decision yesterday to leave official interest rates
unchanged bolstered the D-Mark against the US dollar and most European
currencies, writes Conner Middelmann.
At its last meeting of the year, the Bundesbank's central bank council held
its 5.75 per cent discount rate and 6.75 per cent Lombard rate steady. This
disappointed many dealers, who had hoped for another rate cut before the
year-end, in spite of the Bundesbank's recent reminder that it had set
fixed-rate securities repurchase agreements until January 5 to quell
speculation about a cut in interest rates.
But even before the Bundesbank said it was leaving rates unchanged, the
dollar slid on the announcement that German M3 money supply had grown by an
annualised 7.2 per cent in the year to November, up from 6.9 per cent in
October and well above forecasts for a 6.7 per cent rate. This not only
dampened hopes that M3 would return to its 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target this
year, but also dashed any lingering speculation of a rate reduction at
yesterday's council meeting.
The Bundesbank's council lowered the central bank's M3 target range for 1994
to 4 to 6 per cent. This had been widely expected and had little market
impact.
Disappointment that the Bundesbank did not cut rates sent the March
three-month Euromark interest rate contract tumbling by 0.09 point to 94.45.
The French March Pibor contract slid in sympathy, ending at 94.16, down 0.09
point from Wednesday's close. The French franc finished at FFr3.415 to the
D-Mark, compared with FFr3.418 on Wednesday.
The Bank of France left interest rates unchanged at its latest open-market
operation, where it drained FFr9.2bn of liquidity. Its five to 10-day rate
currently stands at 7 per cent, while the intervention rate is 6.2 per cent.
The D-Mark also firmed against the Belgian franc, which fell to BFr20.88,
down from BFr20.86. The Italian lira closed at L987.4 to the D-Mark, down
from L987.0 the previous day. The Danish krone ended at DKr3.912 to the
D-Mark, up from DKr3.923 on Wednesday.
The dollar fell to around DM1.7080, recovered during midday but slipped
towards the close on late profit-taking. It ended at DM1.7085, down from
Wednesday's DM1.7160.
It also slipped against the yen on November trade data showing that the US
trade gap with Japan reached a seven-year high at Dollars 6.1bn. It ended at
Y109.75, up from Y109.65 but off an earlier high of Y110.05.
In New York the dollar closed at DM1.7093 and Y109.55.
Although German interest rates remained on hold, Austria and Switzerland
lowered theirs.
Early in the day, the Swiss National Bank reduced its discount rate by 1/4
percentage point to 4.25 per cent, explaining that the cut took account of
interest rate developments in the markets. However, it stressed there was
only limited room for further interest rate declines.
Immediately after the announcement, the Swiss franc declined to SFr0.859 to
the D-Mark, but it recouped its loss to close at SFr0.853, up from SFr0.855
at Wednesday's close.
'The market is taking the view that the relative interest-rate differential
will move in favour of the Swiss franc,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior
currency analyst at UBS. He feels that the Swiss central bank may shave
another 75 basis points off rates as Swiss inflation continues to ease,
while he expects the German discount rate to fall by around 175 basis points
next year.
The Austrian National Bank announced a 10 basis-point cut in its Gomex
open-market intervention rate to 5.70 per cent, effective today. Earlier
this week a central bank official indicated it would continue cutting
interest rates autonomously if it had room for manoeuvre.
Austria has cut its rates several times in recent months, helped by the
recent strength of the schilling, which on Tuesday was fixed at its highest
level this year against the D-Mark at Ats703.05 per 100 D-Marks, but
yesterday finished at Ats703.15.
The sterling money market was slightly more relaxed, helped by the smaller
liquidity shortage and waning rate-cut expectations.
The Bank of England initially announced a shortage of Pounds 1.5bn, but
later revised that to Pounds 1.1bn. That compares with a Pounds 2.65bn
shortage on Wednesday. In early operations the Bank purchased bills
totalling Pounds 488m for resale to the market on January 7 at 5 13/32 per
cent. In further operations it bought Pounds 58m of bills, followed by late
assistance of around Pounds 510m.
'We have had a terribly tight week, but things should start easing off a
little into the Christmas period,' said a senior money dealer. He added that
the Bank of England had kept the market tight to indicate that there would
be no near-term cut in interest rates. 'Now, all the speculation for rate
cuts this year has gone, which is a reason for the Bank to be a bit less
tight.'
The March short sterling contract slipped by 0.04 point to 94.80 after
sliding by 0.09 point on Wednesday.
Early in the day, the pound firmed briefly to a high of DM2.5478 on the back
of a stronger than expected decline in UK unemployment, but it slipped back
to finish at DM2.5450, unchanged from the previous day. Against the dollar
sterling ended at Dollars 1.4890, compared with Dollars 1.4835 on Wednesday.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil market ignores output cut
plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil markets yesterday shrugged off statements by some producers outside the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries that they might cut oil
production to bolster sagging prices.
The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for February was Dollars 13.75 in
late London trading yesterday, having closed on Wednesday at Dollars 13.79.
Agency reports yesterday said Oman had informed customers that their
shipments would be cut by 5 per cent from January.
A cut of that size would amount to only 40,000 barrels a day, which would
have a negligible impact on the worldwide surplus of crude oil, traders
said.
Egypt later said it was considering a similar cut in its exports of around
300,000 b/d.
Opec has blamed a surge in output by independent producers for adding to the
crude oil surplus that emerged earlier this year because of chronic
over-production by some Opec members. The organisation has appealed to the
independent producers to restrain output, but most have rejected the calls.
If the Omani cut materialised it would be the first independent exporter of
any consequence to go along with Opec.
Market reaction to such cuts is likely to be muted, however, as long as big
producers such as the UK and Norway continue to increase output. Figures
issued by Arthur Andersen yesterday showed that Norway's October production
had jumped by 22 per cent over September to 2.4m b/d. UK production in
October surged above the 2m b/d figure to 2.072m b/d. North Sea production
is expected to climb steadily into next year.
Qatargas has agreed the principle terms for a Dollars 2bn loan to finance
the construction of a liquefaction plant, an integral part of its Dollars
6bn liquefied natural gas project, Antonia Sharpe writes. The terms of the
loan were not disclosed.

The first half of the wool selling season in major international markets is
coming to an end with prices just holding steady. South Africa closed last
week with prices tending dearer. The Australian market indicator edged
slightly lower at this week's sales, and yesterday at 471 cents a kg. was 6
cents down compared with a week before. The Christmas recess lasts nearly
untill mid January and an uncertain market at closing sales will not help to
bring out business at satisfactory prices further down the manufacturing
line.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian disruption bumps up
hardwood pulp market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A disruption in Russian birch log supplies has contributed to an unexpected
jump in world hardwood pulp prices in recent weeks. The rise has raised
hopes among producers that the pulp market, battered by weak demand and
over-capacity for the past four years, may be on the brink of revival.
Mr Chip Dillon, analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York, said that besides
bottlenecks in pulp supplies, 'there's clearly been an improvement in paper
and pulp ordering in the past month or two'.
The price of North American hardwood kraft pulp has climbed to about Dollars
400 a tonne, from USDollars 360 a tonne at the end of November. This product
was selling at about Dollars 500 a tonne a year ago. Hardwoods account for
about a third of world pulp output of 30m tonnes a year.
Mr Richard Kellertas, analyst at McLean McCarthy in Montreal, said that
softwood pulp producers, whose output totals about 14m tonnes a year, will
probably have more difficulty raising prices, Softwood pulp mills still have
substantial over-capacity, and the outlook depends heavily on overall
business activity early next year in the US and Europe.
The interruption of Russian birch exports has forced several Finnish and
Swedish mills to cut production. One industry official estimated that
Scandinavian hardwood pulp producers are operating at only 50 to 60 per cent
of capacity.
Eucalyptus producers in Spain, Portugal and Brazil have taken advantage of
the tighter market to raise their prices. European eucalyptus prices have
jumped to about Ecu350 (Pounds 275) a tonne, from Ecu290 in mid-November.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rapeseed futures to be launched
in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Matif, the French futures exchange, said it plans to launch rapeseed futures
in October, 1994. The contract will allow pricing in Europe's dominant
oilseed and will be denominated in D-Marks, with provisions for currency
conversions into US dollars or French francs.
The futures contract will apply to rapeseed of any origin with 40 per cent
oil content and will have barge delivery points on the Rhine, Moselle, and
Main rivers in France and Germany. One contract will represent 50 tonnes of
rapeseed.
The exchange developed the contract in conjuction the French oilseeds trade
group Onidol, which will conduct a major training programme for market users
during 1994.
'The launching of the rapeseed futures contract reflects Matif's
determination to diversify its product range in the commodities sector,'
said Gerard Pfauwadel, Matif's Chairman.
Matif, best known for its financial futures contracts, currently has sugar,
coffee, and potato futures in its agricultural repertoire.
'The rapeseed futures market will offer both French and European producers a
system of reference prices on the one hand and arbitrage opportunities on
the other. It is an up-to-date response to the uncertainties resulting from
the new common agricultural policy,' said Mr Jean-Claude Sabin, Onidol's
chairman.
Matif was still considering a European wheat futures contract but its
creation was not yet justified as there was no volatility in grain prices,
said Mr Pfauwadel, reports Reuter from Paris.
The project was linked to the results of the common agricultural policy
reform and the effects of the Gatt deal.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa price fall gains momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cocoa prices slipped further yesterday as more pessimistic market trends
dampened sentiment. The second position futures contract at the London
Commodity Exchange fell Pounds 32 a tonne to Pounds 988 a tonne and New York
prices lost Dollars 40 in early trading to Dollars 1,193 a tonne for March
futures - the lowest point for over a month.
Much of the sell-off in the market was based on technical chart analysis,
but it also reflected the peaceful transition of power in the Ivory Coast -
the world's biggest producer. The death of president Felix Houphouet-Boigny
a couple of weeks ago led traders to fear a power struggle that could affect
cocoa deliveries.
In addition, the Ivory Coast has also indicated that it may sell its mid
crop of cocoa, which will be harvested in April to June next year,
immediately rather than with the main crop, as happened this year. The mid
crop is usually between 100,000 and 150,000 tonnes compared with a main crop
of 650,000 tonnes. Some of this has been damaged in transit this year and
has not been exported.
Traders were also taking profits this week ahead of the publication of the
European Union's report - due at the end of the year - on cocoa butter
substitutes in chocolate. That report could recommend increased use of
substitutes.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodity analyst at GNI, the London brokers, said: 'I'm
a long-term bull towards cocoa, but I think the market has got a bit ahead
of itself and attracted a lot of speculative interest'. Mr Eagles said cocoa
prices could slip further, to about Pounds 900 a tonne, but there remained
strong buying interest in the market.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbeans in protest over Gatt
banana deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British banana market, already in a parlous state, could be further
damaged as a result of offers made by European Union in the Uruguay Round of
the General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade. That was the message delivered
to UK junior agriculture minister Mr Michael Jack yesterday by
representatives of Caribbean banana exporting countries and three importing
companies, Fyffes, Geest and Jamaica producers.
The offers would entail rises of 100,000 tonnes in 1994 and 1995 in the
2m-tonnes-a-year tariff quota for so-called 'dollar' bananas - produced in
Central and South America - set in July this year, they told the minister.
They added that the existing quota had already resulted in oversupply and
falling prices in the UK market.
The delegation also claimed that the new banana regime meant the EU was
failing to meet its legal commitment under the Lome trade and aid convention
that no Caribbean producer should be 'in a less favourable situation than in
the past' in regard to access to its traditional markets.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Verbundnetzgas signs agreement
with Norwegian consortium
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Verbundnetzgas, eastern Germany's regional gas company, yesterday signed a
long term natural gas contract with a Norwegian consortium aimed at reducing
its dependence on Russian gas, as well as shifting domestic consumption away
from brown coal to natural gas. Starting in 1996, the consortium will
deliver 4bn cubic metres a year to VNG which supplies about 90 per cent of
the gas market in eastern Germany. Officials said that natural gas
consumption in eastern Germany, now about 9bn cubic metres a year, was
expected to rise to 20bn after 2000 as more towns and cities in the region
switched their domestic heating from gas generated from brown coal to
natural gas.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Competition comes to eastern
German energy - The sale of brown coal fields to an Anglo-American
consortium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treuhand privatisation agency could not have hoped for a better
Christmas present than it secured last week by formally completing the sale
of the Mibrag brown coal fields to an Anglo-American energy consortium led
by PowerGen of the UK, NRG of Minneapolis, and Morrison Knudsen of Idaho.
By signing the deal the Treuhand, backed by the federal finance ministry,
achieved three things: It saved jobs in the Mibrag fields, which straddle
the eastern German states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony; It set about
introducing competition into eastern Germany's highly regulated energy
sector; And, as Mr Klaus Schucht, the Treuhand's board member who is
determined to prise open the region's energy industry, said, 'the sale of
Mibrag is a signal for the future of the Laubag mines'.
Laubag, three times the size of Mibrag, is being privatised by the Treuhand,
which is negotiating the sale to a western German consortium led by
Rheinbraun, the brown coal subsidiary of RWE, the country's largest utility.
It also includes the PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk utility companies. The
consortium had originally intended to merge Laubag with Mibrag, with the aim
of running down the latter.
At the same time, the consortium and west Germany's five other main utility
companies are the majority shareholders in Veag, eastern Germany's largest
electricity company, as well as in the east's 15 regional utilities. This
ownership structure stems from the electricity contract, or stromvertrag,
signed in August 1990 between the then East German government and West
Germany's utilities.
On one level, the contract represents the federal government's commitment to
brown coal in eastern Germany. On another, it has given the western German
utilities a monopoly over eastern Germany's electricity network on the
understanding that they will modernise the sector. In return - and in spite
of the subsequent misgivings of the European Union concerning this monopoly
structure - eastern Germany's regional utilities are obliged to buy 70 per
cent of their energy from Veag over the next 20 years in order to underwrite
investments totalling DM46bn (Pounds 18bn).
'If the Rheinbraun consortium buys Laubag, the west German utilities will
enjoy a dual monopoly role in eastern Germany: as a monopoly supplier of
brown coal to Veag, which is totally dependent on Laubag's coal, and as a
monopoly customer for Veag,' explained an energy expert from the consortium.
He added: 'Is the Treuhand really in a position to weaken such a dual
monopoly given that it is selling both companies to the same buyers?'
In selling the Veag electricity company, the Treuhand has to agree with
Rheinbraun on the price Veag will pay for the consortium's brown coal. 'The
definitive value of Veag is dependent on the definitive coal price of
Laubag. Both are dependent on each other,' said a consortium official.
He added that the consortium wanted to set a low price for Laubag's coal so
as to boost Veag's earnings, as it would be paying a low price for Laubag's
coal deliveries. As a result, however, Laubag would be left with a
considerable cost disadvantage in paying its miners.
'This is one of the main issues in the negotiations,' said a consortium
official. 'The government - and the Treuhand - wants the income earned from
Laubag's brown coal sales to finance the workers. If the consortium thinks
the government will finance/subsidise the difference in order to save those
jobs, they are mistaken. Veag and Laubag will have to find an acceptable
price to pay for coal which will finance the employment of the miners.'
Rheinbraun officials admit that the price of coal is the most contentious
issues. 'The consortium is being asked by the Treuhand to pay a price for
Laubag on the basis of expected income generated from brown coal sales,'
said a PreussenElektra official. 'This is difficult because we don't know by
how much energy consumption in eastern Germany will increase or decline over
the next decade.'
Consumption, already down by over 40 per cent since 1990 because of the
collapse of the region's industry, may grow by 1 per cent a year after 1994.
But energy experts point out that demand for brown coal may decline further
as Laubag and Veag face increasing competition from gas.
Whatever the outlook, the Treuhand is determined not to privatise eastern
Germany's electricity sector until it has found a solution for coal. 'Just
because we are dealing with the same two monopolies does not mean we cannot
get a good price for coal and electricity,' said a Treuhand energy adviser.
'If the negotiations do not make progress, the Treuhand - as the
Anglo-American deal showed - would be free to go seek alternative solutions,
and go outside Germany,' he added.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Money supply figures hit German bunds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB, FRANK MCGURTY and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German government bonds tumbled yesterday following the release of
disappointing money supply figures, and the market proved unable to make up
for lost ground later in the day, ending a quarter point lower. Most
activity took place in the futures markets, while cash bond prices ended
little changed, dealers said.
Bund market participants had started the day awaiting the outcome of the
Bundesbank's final council meeting for 1993, with some dealers hoping to see
an easing. However, with the release in the morning of higher than expected
M3 money supply figures, any hopes of a rate cut evaporated and the futures
prices fell sharply.
German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 7.2 per cent in
November, compared with a 6.9 per cent rise in October and well outside the
central bank's 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range. Bund market participants
were taken by surprise as money supply had appeared to be gradually edging
down in recent months.
In the three months to November, growth in M3 money supply was an annualised
7.5 per cent, compared with a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 5.5 per
cent in the August to October period.
At its council meeting yesterday, the Bundesbank left its key interest rates
unchanged, and economists now expect the next reduction in the 5.75 per cent
discount rate and 6.75 per cent Lombard rate possibly to take place early
next year.
The Bundesbank announced a 1994 M3 target of 4 to 6 per cent, which dealers
said did not come as a surprise, adding that the targets have not been
achieved in the last two years.
UK government bonds continued their energetic rally following the latest
batch of economic news showing that inflationary pressures remain subdued
while the economy comes out of recession.
Although the gilt market's upward momentum was interrupted briefly by the
release of worse-than-expected German money supply figures, long-dated gilts
gained half a point on the day, helped by the low inflation background,
while short-dated issues underperformed, with a rise of about  1/16 point,
as the chance of a near-term base rate cut appeared more remote.
Underlying average earnings rose by 3 per cent year-on-year (seasonally
adjusted) in October, after 3 per cent in September. Meanwhile, the number
of unemployed fell much more sharply than the market had expected, with a
provisional, seasonally adjusted 36,100 drop in November to 2.82m or 10 per
cent of the workforce. The figures follow a steep drop in October, which was
revised to a 52,100 fall from 49,000.
Coupled with Wednesday's stronger than expected retail sales data, the sharp
drop in unemployment means there is less reason to hope for an imminent base
rate cut.
On the funding front, the Treasury announced that the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) for November was Pounds 3.1bn. While this was
slightly higher than market expectations, dealers said the news had little
impact on the gilt market because funding pressures have eased in the wake
of the Budget announcement.
The 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 gained  1/16 to trade at 106 1/8 by late
afternoon while the 8 3/4 per cent stock due 2017 gained half a point to
trade at 126 3/4 .
The US Treasury market softened yesterday, but a further barrage of bearish
news for fixed-rate investments barely dented bond prices in thin
pre-holiday trading.
In the first volley, the Commerce Department said the merchandise trade
deficit had narrowed a touch in October but both exports and imports showed
solid gains, suggesting increased activity despite sluggish overseas
markets.
That impression was reinforced by the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia, which
said its index of regional business activity surged to 42.4 this month from
22.4 in November.
Although a reading of 32 had been expected, prices stayed within the narrow
ranges established over the past fortnight, suggesting the market had
already adjusted to the accelerated level of economic growth in the fourth
quarter.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  9/32 at 99
11/32 , with the yield rising to 6.294 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.182 per cent.
South Korea plans to scrap its 10 per cent ceiling on individual stock
holdings in listed companies from January 1997, Reuter reports.
The finance ministry said the change would not apply to foreigners, who are
restricted to holding 10 per cent of any listed stock. The ministry had
earlier proposed removing the ceiling from next July.

FT  17 DEC 93 / International Bonds: World Bank offers interest rate play
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurobond market was enlivened yesterday by investor-driven transactions
from the World Bank and Eksportfinans, the Norwegian export-financing
agency.
The World Bank raised DM100m through an issue of five-year notes offering
investors a play on German interest rates. The proceeds were believed to
have been swapped into floating-rate D-Marks.
Lead manager Morgan Stanley, which has arranged three similar offerings
totalling DM425m in the last week, said the notes appealed to investors who
believed that German interest rates were set to fall further in the new
year.
During the first year, the coupon on the so-called 're-set' notes is fixed
at 6 1/8 per cent. At the end of the first year the coupon will be
re-calculated with reference to five-year D-Mark swap rates.
Morgan Stanley said the notes were similar in structure to reverse
floating-rate notes, except the coupon was only re-set once during their
life. The notes, which had a fixed re-offer price of 99.45, were not freed
to trade yesterday.
Elsewhere, Eksportfinans raised CDollars 200m through an issue of six-year
Eurobonds. The proceeds were thought to have been swapped into sub-Libor
floating-rate dollars.
Lead manager ScotiaMcLeod said the bonds were designed to satisfy demand for
short-dated Canadian dollar paper. They were priced to yield 30 basis points
over the 5 3/4 per cent Canadian Treasury due 1999. When the bonds were
freed to trade, the spread remained unchanged.

FT  17 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Algeria faces dilemma over
Dollars 26bn foreign borrowings - The difficulties of economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Algeria's economic reforms, pledged by Mr Redha Malek when he became prime
minister four months ago, began to take shape this week. After preliminary
talks with the IMF, Mr Malek said his government would seek a multilateral
refinancing of Algeria's foreign borrowings, which total Dollars 26bn and
will this year absorb more than four-fifths of Algeria's foreign currency
receipts.
Part of Algeria's debt was refinanced between 1989 and 1991. Its commercial
bank debt of Dollars 1.5bn (70 per cent of which is held by Japanese banks)
and its Dollars 2.7bn of bilateral debt with Italy was refinanced.
The latter operation, however, met with strong opposition from the French
Treasury, whose views carry considerable weight among Algeria's state,
private and multilateral creditors.
The relative success of the policy provided Algeria with precious breathing
space, as did budget deficit cuts, but the gains were quickly frittered
away.
Various governments have re-established the state monopoly on foreign trade
and pumped AD308bn (Dollars 12.8bn) into unreformed state corporations. The
1 per cent budget surplus notched up for 1991 looks like being turned this
year into a deficit equal to 17 per cent of GDP.
The respective advantages of rescheduling or refinancing debt have not
changed but Algeria has a weaker hand today. Moreover, the weakness of the
oil price - 97 per cent of export receipts are from hydrocarbons - and
continued political turmoil have led leading western creditors to doubt
Algeria's ability to push through economic reforms.
If agreement is reached with the IMF, several factors argue in favour of
refinancing. The first is the strong opposition to a rescheduling from
Japan, which holds about Dollars 4.5bn of medium and long-term Algerian
paper, 75 per cent of which is not state-guaranteed.
A senior official of Japan's export credit agency, Jexim, put it bluntly:
'The request for debt rescheduling will not only make it impossible for
Japan to accept new commitments for a considerable time, but will also make
it more difficult for Japanese parties to proceed with the implementation of
commercial contracts and disbursement of existing loan contracts.'
Japan is involved in a major co-financing with the World Bank while Japanese
companies are key players in the building of liquid gas and condensate
plants for Sonatrach, the state oil company, factories which hold a
significant key to Algeria's future export earnings.
Rescheduling would also lead to western export credit organisations
suspending, at least for a few months, cover on Algerian loans. Just over
half Algerian foreign borrowings are guaranteed by western credit
organisations.
France, which favours rescheduling, holds FFr33bn worth of Algerian paper,
FFr27bn of which in long and medium-term debt. Its leading banks hold little
debt that is not guaranteed by Coface, France's export credit agency.
Were Algeria to reach agreement with the IMF, it could draw on about Dollars
1bn made up of an IMF loan and the second tranche of a number of World Bank
and EU loans which have been frozen for the past two years. However, this
figure is well short of Algeria's external financing needs.

FT  17 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Indian fund to raise a
further Dollars 150m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian Opportunities Fund, a Dollars 100m open-ended investment fund
which was launched in the summer, plans to raise a further Dollars 150m of
new money to place in Indian securities and investments.
The decision to more than double the size of the fund reflects the keen
interest among international investors in the Indian market, which is seen
as one of the more promising emerging markets.
The fund, which is managed by Martin Currie Investment Management (MCIM),
was set up in July 1993 and has already invested about 90 per cent of the
Dollars 100m originally raised in about 80 different holdings.
Mr Joe Scott Plummer, chairman of MCIM, said the new money would be raised
using special 'C' class shares: once 90 per cent of the new money has been
invested, these shares will be converted to ordinary shares (which are the
kind that investors currently hold).
Mr Scott Plummer said this would ensure that existing shareholders did not
suffer from an dilution effect.

FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: State sells stake in Fletcher
Challenge
</HEADLINE>

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The New Zealand Government last night announced it had sold all its shares
overnight in Fletcher Challenge and Fletcher Forests for NZDollars 418m.
The government said it had broken even on the deal. The minister of finance
Bill Birch said in an interview that it had never been the government's
intention to profit from holding the shares. 'Our instructions to Treasury
were that we were not in the business of trading shares in a public company,
and that they were to be sold at a price which covered holding costs, and
brokerage less dividends,' he said. Mr Birch said that the shares had been
sold under a mandate by CS First Boston to international investors in the US
and Australia. The parcels comprised 104m ordinary shares and 26m Forestry
shares.
Mr Birch said that the money would be used to repay foreign debt. The
government had consistently said it was not a long term holder of the
shares. He said that the reduction in debt would be positive for interest
rates, which had already fallen sharply yesterday, when the New Zealand
exchange rate hit a two-year high following the signing of the GATT
agreement.
The government acquired the shares at NZDollars 3.83 each last year, or a
total cost of NZDollars 400m (USDollars 223.5m) under a put option arranged
with Fletcher Challenge in 1988 when it acquired the Petrocorp group of
companies.
Fletcher Challenge shares rise 10 cents on Wednesday to NZDollars 3.43 on
rumours that the sale was imminent. Last month Fletcher Challenge floated
off Fletcher Forests as a separate company from the parent.

Malaysian company Westmont Holdings, one of three foreign groups which
submitted bids for 40 per cent of Philippine oil refiner and distributor
Petron Corp, has protested its exclusion from the auction, Reuter reports
from Manila.
The group's local representative, Mr Manuel Estrella, said Westmont would
contest the decision by the Philippine National Oil Co rejecting their bid
without explanation.
The Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Aramco) won a 40 per cent stake in Petron after
bidding Dollars 502m or Dollars 62m above the minimum price of Dollars 440m.
The Malaysian national oil company Petronas bid Dollars 421m.
Monico Jacob, president of PNOC, Petron's parent company, said on Wednesday
the auction committee returned Westmont's bid unopened after it failed to
meet pre-qualification or technical requirements.

Australia's national shipping line, ANL, has recorded its second consecutive
net loss due to sluggish world trading conditions, Reuter reports from
Canberra. However, the soon-to-be privatised line said it expected to break
even in the year to June 1994.
ANL reported a net loss of ADollars 8.3m (USDollars 5.4m) against a loss of
ADollars 8.9m the previous year although it posted a pre-tax profit of
ADollars 8.7m compared with a loss of ADollars 19m a year earlier.
The group's finance manager, Mr Daryl Corney, said a number of strategic
postions taken by ANL in earlier years, particularly in the coastal
business, began to pay dividends in the latest year.
He said the group hoped to at least break even in 1993-94 even though
international trading conditions were not expected to pick up until 1995-96
according to World Bank forecasts.
The government said in August it would seek to privatise the company this
financial year, although little progress on a sale has been made. Analysts
expect the company to fetch up to ADollars 150m.

Investment profits on assets at Japan's 25 non-life insurers fell 9.7 per
cent in the six months to September to Y563.9bn (Dollars 5.27bn) from the
same period a year earlier, Mr Takashi Onoda, chairman of the Marine and
Fire Insurance Association of Japan, said, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Mr Onoda told a news conference that the lower yields were mainly due to
falling interest rates.
Net premiums of the 25 firms rose 3.1 per cent to Y4,790bn, while net
insurance claims increased 2.9 per cent to Y1,670bn over the same period, he
said.
The association expects insurance claims to rise sharply in the second half
of 1993-94 as heavy rains and typhoons this summer caused serious damage
throughout Japan, Mr Onoda said.
Japan's non-life insurance firms and the finance ministry are studying
measures to cope with foreign insurers' demands to open the insurance market
wider to newcomers, he added.

FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Pinault-Printemps in FFr540m
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pinault-Printemps, the heavily indebted French retail group, is continuing
its capital raising programme by raising FFr540m (Dollars 91.8m) through the
sale of its property interests to Unibail, one of France's largest property
and leasing concerns.
The two companies have agreed terms for a complicated deal whereby Unibail
will pay FFr540m to take a 60 per cent stake in Societe Immobiliere
Provence, a subsidiary of Pinault-Printemps that owns a number of the
group's properties.
The properties controlled by Societe Immobiliere Provence include one of the
buildings at the flagship Printemps department store on rue Caumartin in the
9th arrondissement of Paris and the neighbouring Prisunic store.
Pinault-Printemps has for two years been trying to reduce the debt incurred
when Pinault, the industrial group led by Mr Francois Pinault, mounted a
controversial FFr5.3bn partial bid for Au Printemps, the prestigious retail
group that includes the La Redoute mail order business as well as its
eponymous department stores.
The debt reduction programme has included aggressive asset sales and complex
deals to restructure Pinault-Printemps's loans negotiated with Credit
Lyonnais, the group's main banker.
The Unibail transaction brings the total raised from asset sales by
Pinault-Printemps in 1993 to over FFr5bn, thereby reducing its net debt to
around FFr13bn by the year end.
However, the group's operations have been affected by the French recession.
It recently confirmed that it expected a fall in operating profits to FFr2bn
in 1993 from FFr2.8bn in 1992.
Despite the pressures on Pinault-Printemps, Mr Pinault has continued to
pursue personal deals, including this summer's FFr690m acquisition of
Chateau Latour, one of the finest Bordeaux wines.
He has also expressed interest in Fnac, France's leading books and music
retailer.

<TEXT>
Dickson Concepts, the Hong Kong-based luxury wholesaler and retailer,
yesterday reported a 10 per cent rise in profits to HKDollars 143.56m
(USDollars 18.6m), after tax and minority interests, for the six months to
September 30. This compares with HKDollars 130.46m for the comparable period
last year.
Mr Edwin Ing, executive director and company secretary, said the interim
period marked a phase of consolidation for the group in its position as a
premier international retailer and wholesaler of luxury goods.
It was also broadly a time of expansion, as Dickson forged stronger links
with the China market and creamed off bigger profits from London store
Harvey Nichols, which it bought for Pounds 53.7m (Dollars 80m) from the
Burton Group in October 1991.
Overall, turnover rose 2.8 per cent to HKDollars 1.32bn from HKDollars
1.29bn, and earnings per share improved 1.9 cents to 20.9 cents. The interim
dividend is to be maintained at 10 cents.
Dickson Concepts next year plans to follow up its successful launch of
upmarket designer labels on the mainland with the opening of two new
boutiques: exclusive Polo/Ralph Lauren and Harvey Nichols stores in Shanghai
and Shenzhen.
Also in Shanghai, the J. J. Dickson Arcade - 100,000 sq ft of luxurious
shopping, into which the group invested an initial USDollars 24m - is due to
come on line next month.
Mr Ing said: 'The group's retail network across the world has now been
expanded to well over 200 outlets.
'With development programmes being implemented throughout the group's
operations worldwide, the group is confident that given its healthy
debt-free financial position and its strong recurring income base, it will
be able to substantially increase its turnover and profits capabilities once
these projects reach fruition.'

FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: HKSE to introduce regulated
short-selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is to introduce regulated short-selling on
January 3, further underlining its commitment to become an
international-league player.
However, arbitrage and hedging will initially be heavily limited by a 14-day
curb on stock lending, a pre-requisite for short selling.
Legislation to extend the 14-day period and to remove stamp duty obligations
are expected to be passed by the Legislative Council in the first quarter of
the new year.
Mr Paul Chow, chief executive of the HKSE, said a pilot scheme would be
launched with an initial 16 highly liquid securities, with market
capitalisations above HKDollars 10bn (USDollars 1.3bn).
Stocks designated in the first raft to come on stream include Cheung Kong
(Holdings), Wharf (Holdings), Hongkong Telecommunications and HSBC Holdings.
A further five companies will be eligible once they start trading on the
automated trading and order-matching system, which came on-line last month.
In line with US regulations on short-selling, short sales can only be made
at or above the best current ask price quoted in the Automatic Order
Matching and Execution System (AMS). This is to prevent the market being
driven lower by short-selling activity alone.
On top of reporting requirements, members will be banned from 'naked'
short-selling, where positions are not covered by borrowed stock.
Mr Chow said the introduction of regulated short-selling marks another
significant step forward in the exchange's bid to develop a full range of
investment products and strategies to increase Hong Kong's attraction as an
international finance centre. 'It is also an important indicator of the
growing maturity of the Hong Kong market,' he said.
Currently, Japan is the only Asian market offering short-selling, but
exchanges in both Malaysia and Singapore are exploring the possibility.

Motorola, the US electronics group, announced top management changes in the
wake of the departure of George Fisher, former chairman and chief executive,
who left in October to become chairman and chief executive of Eastman Kodak.
William Weisz, formerly vice chairman, was appointed non-executive chairman.
Mr Weisz, 66, was chief executive from 1972 until his retirement in 1989.
Previously, Motorola's chief executive was board chairman. The company said
that under its new structure the chairman will become the primary link
between the board and the chief executive office.
Gary Tooker, 54, formerly president and chief operating officer, was elected
chief executive and vice chairman. Christopher Galvin, 43, grandson of the
founder of Motorola, was elected president and chief operating officer. Mr
Galvin had been senior executive vice president and assistant chief
operating officer. Messrs Tooker and Galvin will form a two-person chief
executive office, with total responsibility to manage the company's affairs,
Motorola said.

International Business Machines of the US will not subscribe to next year's
FFr8.5bn (Dollars 1.44bn) recapitalisation programme for Groupe Bull, the
loss-making, state-owned, French computer group.
The US computer group, which acquired 5.6 per cent of Bull's shares in early
1992, cited 'other financial priorities' for its decision. IBM itself is
struggling to cut costs to improve its weak financial performance.
But IBM said it remained committed to its alliance with Groupe Bull and that
the two would continue to work on joint projects. IBM said it would continue
to collaborate with Groupe Bull on Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)
microprocessor technology.
Bull said other existing industrial agreements, such as the manufacture of
circuit boards by Bull for its US partner would also continue.
Bull's other main shareholders, the French state, France Telecom, and NEC,
the Japanese electronics group, have agreed to provide their share of the
refinancing package.

FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Keeping up with the Dow Jones'
screen - A new video service mixes live and recorded information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street was glued to the television set last week, watching live
coverage of a Delaware supreme court hearing that may prove crucial to the
Dollars 10bn bid battle for control of Paramount Communications.
A few investment bankers, traders and fund managers, however, were able to
follow courtroom developments and monitor Paramount's stock simultaneously,
thanks to live pictures from Delaware displayed on their desktop computer
screens.
These few are subscribers to the Dow Jones Investor Network (DJIN), a new
video business news service that allows users of desktop personal computers
to watch live and recorded press conferences, interviews, shareholders'
meetings, earnings announcements, and court cases.
DJIN was launched just two months ago by Dow Jones, the media and
information group. The service is still in its infancy, with only a handful
of subscribers paying the Dollars 750 a month rental. But, says DJIN, there
is a lot of potential.
The company describes a future where moving and static video, audio,
financial news, real-time price data, and sophisticated market analytics are
shown on a single computer screen, and in an interactive environment
allowing the user to shape the service to his own needs.
DJIN is not a new concept. A similar service was tried three years ago by
Reuters. TV 2000 provided subscribers with moving pictures of interviews,
press conferences and analysts' briefings, but was scrapped after only a few
months.
If Reuters failed with TV 2000, why does Dow Jones think it can succeed? One
answer is the rapid development of interactive and multi-media technology.
Mr Mark Wood, editor-in-chief at Reuters, said that one of the main problems
with TV 2000 was its delivery. The video pictures were sent to a separate
monitor which sat next to the subscribers' Reuters screen, a system he
describes as 'awkward and intrusive'.
DJIN is able to deliver moving video pictures straight to the subscriber's
computer over the telephone line.
Another reason TV 2000 failed was the editorial content. Mr Wood says the
company was never sure what kind of news was wanted in video form - an
uncertainty that confused subscribers and undermined the product.
In contrast, Dow Jones has a clear idea what subscribers want, says Mr
Martin Schenker, head of DJIN. The unit compiles a list of the day's
programming each morning and faxes it to subscribers, who can call up any
item at the press of a button.
It offers about four video news events a day, representing some 2 1/2 hours
of content, but plans to add new programming every week. If an unplanned
news story develops during the day, subscribers can be alerted to its
availability by an on-screen newsflash.
Mr Schenker believes the success of DJIN will depend on the quality and
exclusivity of its news. He says one of its strengths will be subscribers'
ability to watch exclusive interviews with businessmen. The video interviews
will give users much more than a text version or audio recording ever could,
he says.
'It's not so much what the person says,' he argues, 'as how they say it.'
DJIN is initially aiming the service at the professional investment
community, judging that money managers will have time to watch the service,
and will be most interested in extensive interviews with business leaders
and detailed coverage of press conferences and shareholders' meetings.
One Wall Street portfolio manager who has been using DJIN for more than a
month is aware of the dangers of information overload, but willing to devote
the time to DJIN if the news or analysis it provides cannot be obtained
elsewhere.
'In our business, as long as I find something value-added, I will figure out
a way to make it part of my day.'
There is still plenty of scepticism around about video business news, and
whether it has a sufficiently attractive ingredient that cannot be found in
newspapers, on newswires and radio and television financial news networks.
Dow Jones, however, sees DJIN as a launchpad for a more comprehensive
product that will eventually give users access to live and stored news, data
and analytics in an interactive form that will allow subscribers to tailor
the information to their own needs.
Under this system, subscribers would pose their own questions to businessmen
during live interviews.
They would be able to watch a company press conference, read the most recent
press articles about that company, and look at graphics of the company's
share price or earnings performance, all at the same time and on the same
screen.
The trail is already starting to warm. Other information providers are
considering on-terminal full-motion video news, notably Bloomberg Financial
Services and Reuters, which is mulling a relaunch of a TV 2000-style
product.

<TEXT>
Air Canada and Canadian Airlines have failed to settle their quarrel over
airline industry restructuring after nearly three weeks of face to face
negotiations.
'The parties have very serious business differences that remain unresolved,'
said Mr Stanley Hartt, the lawyer called in by both sides to act as a
facilitator.
The deadlock means several key issues will go before the courts, while
Canadian Airlines and PWA, its parent company, arrange CDollars 213m
(USDollars 159m) of interim financing to stay in business until they receive
a CDollars 246m equity infusion from American Airlines.
The talks focused mainly on the jointly-owned Gemini reservation system.
Canadian Airlines must switch to American's Sabre system to qualify for the
equity infusion.
Air Canada maintains Canadian Airlines is contracted as a Gemini shareholder
until 1997.
Canadian Airlines is making a new offer to settle the Gemini issue, but
refused to disclose details until Air Canada has studied it.
It said the deadline for American's equity infusion has been extended to
June 30 1994. American would get 25 per cent control of Canadian Airlines in
return.
Canadian Airlines plans to find ways of exiting from Gemini without causing
its collapse.
If Air Canada refuses the latest undisclosed offer, Gemini would be
dissolved and recreated in another form since it owns Canada's largest
private telecommunications system.
Air Canada has offered in excess of CDollars 1.1bn, including CDollars 250m
cash, for Canadian Airlines' foreign routes. It includes CDollars 250m in
cash and up to CDollars 800m in relief of debt or lease obligations for
three Boeing 747 and five Boeing 767 aircraft.

FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Cragnotti given trading ban in
Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Sergio Cragnotti, the Italian financier, has agreed to settle allegations
of Canadian securities law violations with a CDollars 2.7m (USDollars 2m)
payment and a lifetime trading ban.
Under the terms of a settlement approved yesterday by the Ontario Securities
Commission, Mr Cragnotti and his business associate Mr Robert Marziale have
also been banned for life from serving as directors or officers of any
public company in Ontario.
The allegations against Mr Cragnotti and Mr Marziale involve Lawson Mardon,
the packaging group in which Cragnotti and Partners, the Milan-based
investment group controlled by Mr Cragnotti, has a 52 per cent voting stake.
According to a statement of facts, nominee accounts controlled by Mr
Cragnotti accounted for 48 per cent of all trades in Lawson shares in the
six weeks prior to an equity offering by the company in October 1992.
The statement said that these purchases increased market liquidity and
buoyed Lawson's share price.
Mr Cragnotti and Mr Marziale initially claimed they were not involved. But
according to the statement, they 'subsequently corrected their evidence and
co-operated with (the commission's) staff'.
A spokesman for Mr Cragnotti said he had agreed to the settlement to
expedite a proposed takeover of Lawson Mardon by Alusuisse-Lonza, the Swiss
industrial group. Alusuisse, in the middle of a due diligence assessment of
Lawson, has indicated that the case against Mr Cragnotti will not affect its
decision whether to proceed with its CDollars 555m offer.
An OSC lawyer said yesterday that the penalties confirm 'the commission's
resolve to ensure compliance with rules designed to protect investors in the
capital markets'.
Mr Cragnotti was questioned by Italian police last month about his
involvement in the Enimont bribes scandal. He has subsequently been
released.

Deutsche Telekom, the German state-owned telecoms company, and Stet
International, its Italian counterpart, were last night battling it out for
the 30 per cent of Hungarian operator Matav on sale in eastern Europe's
biggest privatisation.
Stet, with it's consortium partner, Bell Atlantic, the US regional operator,
is understood to have made the highest offer of more than Dollars 910m.
Deutsche Telekom, the German state telecoms provider, and partner Ameritech,
a regional Bell operating company (RBOC), are understood to have taken
second place with a bid that rivals believe amounts to Dollars 860m.
But Telekom and Ameritech will make up much ground in the evaluation by
charging a much lower 'management fee' than the Stet alliance.
Trailing is the duo of France Telecom, the state monopoly, and US West,
another RBOC, which has put forward the figure of Dollars 830m.
In the previous round of the tender, Stet put in by far the highest
preliminary 'indicative' bid and competitors believe that backing by Simest,
the Italian state investment agency, has sweetened the Italian financial
calculations.
Telekom and Ameritech have raised their price the most since the last stage
and the increase contributed to the withdrawal earlier this week of the UK's
Cable &amp; Wireless from their consortium.
Observers believe, though officials deny, that nationality is a factor as
well as price. Germany, home to Telekom, is Hungary's closest western
friend. Alitalia, the Italian national airline, last year took a stake in
Hungarian carrier Malev and Budapest is reluctant to see Italian involvement
in another strategic company.
Budapest will also give weight to the technical quality of the submissions
and US West had banked on a vision of bringing broadband, multi-media
networks to Hungary.
Rival contenders nevertheless claim equal if not greater technological
expertise and most observers doubt whether the prospect of services like
video-on-demand has much appeal in a country where 700,000-800,000 of a
population of 10m are waiting for a telephone line.

FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Swedish health group's loss less
than forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ARJO, the Swedish healthcare group floated in Stockholm and London in
October, has turned in a slightly smaller than forecast pre-tax loss for the
year ended September 30.
It lost SKr139.1m (Dollars 16.5m) against an estimated SKr140.9m and a
pre-tax profit of SKr15.2m a year earlier. Turnover was SKr1.1bn against
SKr809.1m. If the company had been floated for the full year, thus saving on
interest and foreign exchange costs, it would have reported a pre-tax profit
of SKr178.7m.

Thyssen Stahl and Krupp-Hoesch Stahl, Germany's two largest steel makers,
yesterday announced they will merge their production of tin plates,
non-corrosive steels and sheets for the electrical industry in a last-ditch
attempt to cut costs and reduce losses.
Thyssen said two new companies will be created through the merger. One will
oversee the production of tin plates and will be majority-owned by Thyssen
which is the market leader in Germany for the product. Thyssen Stahl's
Rasselstein subsidiary in Neuwied, near Koblenz, produces 700,000 tonnes of
tin plates a year, about twice the output of the Hoesch Stahl's
Westfallenhutte plant in Dortmund.
A second new company will regroup non-corrosive steels and metal sheets and
will be largely owned by Krupp-Hoesch which produces more in these divisions
than Thyssen.
All three divisions at the moment account for about a tenth of the two
companies' turnover and represent combined sales of roughly DM2bn (Dollars
1.2bn). The merger marks the first time that the two steel giants strike a
partnership in areas where they have previously been fierce competitors.

FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Seat chief delivers rescue
package - Kevin Done examines the challenge facing Juan Llorens when he
presents his plans at VW's HQ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Juan Llorens, chief executive of Seat, has had barely six weeks to get to
grips with the beleaguered Spanish subsidiary of the Volkswagen group.
The mounting losses at the Spanish carmaker and the failure to produce a
convincing restructuring plan led to the summary departure of his
predecessor, Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, at the end of September.
Tomorrow Mr Llorens will discover how well he passes muster at the
Volkswagen headquarters, when he presents Seat's latest response to its
mounting financial crisis to the VW supervisory board.
Mr Llorens, previously the head of the Spanish motor industry confederation,
faces the task of wringing out of the supervisory board the further
financial backing that Seat desperately needs to ride out the present storm.
'The boat is sailing in a very rough sea,' said Mr Llorens yesterday.
Important parts of his rescue package, including the negotiation of a 10 per
cent pay cut for the entire Seat workforce, are still to be completed, but
at least Mr Llorens has won the reluctant backing this week of the Spanish
authorities and trade unions for a drastic cut in the Seat workforce that
will be unprecedented in its severity.
In the face of losses at Seat that may now mount to around DM2bn (Dollars
1.2bn), including a DM600m restructuring provision, and dramatic
overcapacity, Volkswagen was no longer willing to accept any plans from the
company that were prepared on optimistic forecasts for an early recovery in
the European new car market.
The restructuring plan that Mr Llorens will present tomorrow is now based on
the closure of Seat's oldest assembly plant at Zona Franca in Barcelona.
Seat is being forced to consolidate all its car assembly at its new
Martorell plant on the outskirts of Barcelona. The plant already makes the
Ibiza hatchback and related Cordoba saloon cars launched during the last 12
months.
Now Seat plans to move production of its larger Toledo family car from Zona
Franca to Martorell during the first half of next year. The dramatic
concentration of Seat production will mean that the company will be forced
to abandon the A-class segment of the European car market.
By late next year it will have been forced to give up production altogether
of the Marbella small car, a range which was derived from the Fiat Panda.
Now the product development cupboard is bare for Seat in this segment of the
market. It must sink or swim with its present product range, although it
will add a new small car-derived van in 1995 at the Martorell plant. This
will be derived from the Ibiza and will replace the Marbella-based Terra van
range, which will be abandoned next year.
Under the terms of the restructuring plan agreed with the Catalonia
government on Wednesday, Seat is planning to cut 9,000 jobs from a group
workforce that totalled 23,756 at the end of October.
At the Zona Franca plant, where car assembly will cease during the second
half of next year, it is eliminating 2,978 jobs through the early retirement
of workers aged 55 and more. It has also won the support of the authorities
to lay off a further 4,616 workers at the plant for a maximum of two years
for each worker during the three years from 1994 to 1996. In addition it is
eliminating up to 1,400 more temporary contract jobs.
The earlier plans for the expansion of Seat have turned out to be hopelessly
over-optimistic in the face of the widespread recession in west European new
car markets. Seat now has an installed capacity to produce 780,000 cars a
year at its two plants, Zona Franca and Martorell, Mr Llorens said
yesterday.
In fact output of cars under the Seat brand - excluding production of the VW
Polo at the Pamplona plant in northern Spain - is expected to total only
296,000 this year. Seat is currently forecasting a production level of at
least 320,000 for 1994, but Mr Llorens said yesterday that with some
additional investment, capacity at Martorell alone could be increased to
500,000 vehicles a year.
After the transfer of all car assembly to Martorell, Seat will still have a
workforce of around 2,900 left at the Zona Franca plant that will be engaged
largely in the remaining press-shop, foundry and sub-assembly operations.
The big challenge facing the company will be the creation of a 'supplier
park' at the Zona Franca plant, where Seat hopes to attract automotive
components suppliers that can establish operations to take on some of Seat's
remaining surplus labour.
Under the agreement reached this week the 4,616 Zona Franca workers that are
to be laid off for up to two years, could return to Seat at the end of the
period.
'We are going to create a taskforce on Monday, which will have three years
to re-locate all these people,' said Mr Llorens yesterday. 'It is not going
to be easy. Our objective is that the number of people coming back at the
end of 1996 will be zero.'
To help reach that target and also cut its purchasing costs, Seat aims to
increase the share of components it buys in Spain from 54 per cent at
present to 67 per cent by 1996, which calls for the re-location of parts
purchases totalling Pta32bn (Dollars 228m).

deal

<TEXT>
SCA, a leading Swedish forestry group, said yesterday it had finalised an
agreement with the South African-linked Minorco and Mondi Paper groups to
build a Pounds 250m (Dollars 370m) paper machine at Aylesford in Kent in the
UK.
The machine will be able to produce 280,000 tons of newsprint a year,
lifting the plant's total capacity to 390,000 tons a year after an existing
machine has been upgraded. The raw material will be recycled paper.
SCA Graphic Paper and Mondi European Holdings will each hold 50 per cent in
a new company, Aylesford Newsprint, which will have a share capital of
Pounds 130m and total capitalisation of around Pounds 300m. Part of the
funding will come from a Pounds 20m UK government grant.
Both Minorco and Mondi Paper are shareholders in Mondi European Holdings,
which was formed in 1990 to invest in the European pulp, paper and packaging
sector. Mondi Paper is a subsidiary of Anglo American.
SCA said it expected continued growth in the European newsprint market and
increased demand for paper made from recycled fibre. It says its raw
material and distribution costs will be much lower near to a big population
centre such as London, which is only 30 miles away from Aylesford, than if
it built the same machine in Scandinavia.
The Swedish group recently raised SKr1.4bn (Dollars 166m) in a rights issue
to help fund the cost of its UK investment. It has been anxious to proceed
with the project since it acquired Reedpack in 1990, but wanted a partner to
reduce its risk.

Credito Italiano
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Credito Italiano, Italy's seventh biggest bank, which has just
been privatised, fell yesterday on the first day's trading after investors
received details of their allocations.
The bank's stock reached a low of L2,200 (Dollars 1.29), against a closing
price of L2,320 on Wednesday, before ending the day at L2,237. The shares,
which had been expected to drop as speculators sold unwanted stock, were
also hit by news of a tax investigation into large write-offs claimed by the
bank in conjunction with the purchase of a loss-making company in 1987.
Allocations of shares to thousands of retail investors had to be scaled back
because of heavy demand in Italy's first mass privatisation. About 100,000
of more than 292,000 applications received from domestic retail investors
will not be filled, while successful applicants will be limited to a maximum
of 2,500 shares.
About 70 per cent of the 840m ordinary shares being sold by the IRI state
holding company will go to Italian investors. Around 60 per cent of IRI's
stake has been bought by retail buyers, while 10 per cent will go to Italian
institutional investors. The remaining stock has been sold outside Italy,
with strong demand from the US and Europe.
IRI is holding back a further 45m ordinary shares, to be used as a 'loyalty'
bonus to retail investors who keep their holding for at least three years.
Eventually, IRI will dispose of its entire 67 per cent stake in the bank's
ordinary capital.
The Credito Italiano flotation has already provided lessons for the Italian
authorities, notably the Consob stockmarket watchdog.
It was at Consob's behest that retail allocations were not scaled back below
the 2,500 share minimum level, despite the fact that it became clear early
in the issue that many applicants would not receive stock owing to high
demand.

FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Citroen predicts bleak outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of PSA Peugeot-Citroen, the French car
manufacturer, yesterday forecast a slow recovery in the European car market
next year and said that demand would be constrained by economic conditions.
At Citroen's annual press conference Mr Calvet predicted that European car
sales would grow by just over 3 per cent next year to 11.78m cars, while the
French market would grow by 5.7 per cent to 1.85m cars.
The estimate for the French market is lower than the 9 per cent growth
forecast that the company made last month. 'The last few months seemed worse
than expected. We do not feel that there has been an upward move in orders,'
said Mr Calvet. He said a sharp increase in car purchases at the end of last
year, as consumers anticipated higher prices resulting from new safety and
environmental regulations, had a distorting effect with this year's
comparisons.
According to Mr Calvet, the European market will see an uneven pattern of
growth next year. In the UK, he expected car sales to rise by just under 4
per cent. In Italy sales are expected to remain stable, Spain's forecast is
for strong growth of 12 per cent. In Germany a contraction of 3.1 per cent
is forecast.
But Mr Calvet said Citroen should continue to strengthen its market position
in 1994. This year, the company said it represented between 4.9 per cent and
5 per cent of the European market, up slightly from 4.8 per cent in 1992.
Mr Calvet described the economic climate this year as the worst since the
second world war.
He criticised 'the religion of monetarists' and said the current environment
required a looser monetary policy.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Unigate quits poultry with Turners Turkeys
divestiture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES UNWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unigate is completing its exit from the poultry business with the sale of
Turners Turkeys to Bernard Matthews, the largest UK turkey producer, for an
estimated Pounds 18m.
Unigate's largest divestiture in the sector came nearly two years ago when
it sold its lossmaking JP Wood chicken business to sharpen its focus on
value added foods.
Bernard Matthews is buying Turners to keep pace with a UK demand for fresh
turkey products which was up by 30 per cent in the last year, and to acquire
farms with confirmed planning permissions.
'Increases in our agricultural production have been restricted over the last
years through the difficulties in obtaining planning permission for new
farms both in Norfolk and Suffolk',said Mr Bernard Matthews, chairman.
The cash consideration includes Pounds 11m for fixed assets and about Pounds
7m for the stock, subject to final valuation.
Matthews is financing the deal with bank borrowings. It has conditionally
agreed a Pounds 5.6m sale of 19 Turners Turkey breeding and turkey growing
farms in the West Midlands to Sun Valley Poultry, a subsidiary of Cargill of
the US.
Matthews will be left with 20 Turners' farms and two processing plants in
Norfolk and Lincolnshire, Matthews' home base. It will maintain the Turners
brand.
Turners, employing 800 people, reported operating profit of Pounds 2.8m on
turnover of Pounds 59.6m for the year ended March 31.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: PSB's counter bid intensifies the battle
for control of ICD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE battle for control of International Communications &amp; Data intensified
yesterday with a counter, though unquantified, bid for the marketing
services company
PSB Group, a direct marketing concern which claims to control 23.6 per cent
of ICD's voting rights, said it would set a price once it was given access
to ICD's books.
The first bid, from IMC Industries and its supporters, was forced into a 9
1/2 p a share offer for the company on December 8, although the USM-quoted
soft drinks and leisure company said it did not wish to gain ICD.
Mr David Cicurel, full time executive chairman of IMC and a big shareholder
in the company, obtained for IMC an option to subscribe for 6.95m shares at
7p as payment for his services as ICD's chairman.
IMC exercised its option, triggering a mandatory takeover bid under the
takeover code. IMC was a reluctant bidder and pitched its offer at the
lowest price permitted under the takeover code.
IMC exercised the option to support the ICD board in its battle with PSB,
which has been seeking control of ICD for about three months.
The option gave IMC a 10.6 per cent stake in ICD. The company and its
supporters now claim to hold about 40 per cent.
At a special meeting held on December 9 ICD shareholders defeated all
resolutions put forward by PSB, which requisitioned the meeting for the
removal of a majority of the existing directors and their replacement by PSB
nominees.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: RJB Mining takes over Young's UK businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining, which wants to reopen several mines closed recently by British
Coal, is to buy the main UK businesses of the Young Group, including
opencast and drift pits.
The consideration is Pounds 1.45m plus the assumption of Pounds 3.65m debt.
The total value of Young's contracted work in hand is about Pounds 60m,
similar in size to RJB's existing contracts. The majority of the contracts
involve the sale of coal for power generation.
RJB will increase its gearing to about 50 per cent to fund the acquisition.
Mr Richard Budge, chairman, said he was comfortable with that level and
there were no plans for a rights issue.
It is thought that gearing will not be increased further if RJB is
successful in licensing and leasing British Coal pits, because it will not
have to pay any money up front.
In the year ending November 30 1992 Young Group businesses had an aggregate
turnover of Pounds 34.6m and operating profits of Pounds 201,000, but
reported a loss before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 384,000.
The net asset value of the company at that date was Pounds 1.82m.
Although the figures also include Venezuelan businesses which RJB is not
buying, Mr Budge said these were a relatively small part of the total.
Young operates one opencast site on behalf of British Coal, two licensed
opencast sites and four underground drift mines. RJB is acquiring
approximately 5m tonnes of coal reserve, of which 1.2m have planning
permission and 600,000 have coaling licences.
RJB already operates sites with a total of 6.5m tonnes of coal reserves. Mr
Budge said the acquisition would help secure RJB's plant fleet over the next
four years.
The acquisition would also reduce transport costs and optimise coal blending
opportunities for the whole group.
The Young businesses employ about 300 people in the UK, although it is
likely that rationalisation will reduce the total.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Albion cautious despite 51% rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Albion, the Belfast-based tailored men's wear group, lifted pre-tax profits
by 51 per cent over the 12 months to September 30.
The upturn, from Pounds 773,937 to Pounds 1.09m, was achieved on turnover 38
per cent up at Pounds 21.6m.
However, the directors said trading remained difficult. 'Although a further
more modest increase in turnover is anticipated, we must recognise the
competitive nature of international sourcing at a time when new low cost
sources of supply are becoming increasingly accessible.'
Earnings per share worked through at 20.2p (15.5p). A proposed final
dividend of 2.4p brings the total to 4p (3p).

MS International, the specialist engineering products manufacturer,
continued along its recovery path with profits of Pounds 462,000 before tax
for the six months to October 30, against Pounds 250,000.
Turnover was ahead slightly from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 13.9m, including

is unchanged at 1p.
Mr Michael Bell, chairman, said there was a considerable level of
improvement in the performance of a number of the individual businesses.
Some other operations, however, still had some way to go to achieve what
could be deemed as 'acceptable levels of trading consistency.'

Victoria Carpet Holdings, the Worcestershire-based carpet and carpet yarn

September 30 on sales of Pounds 17.1m.
The outcome compared with profits last time of Pounds 227,000 on turnover of

In a cautiously optimistic statement, Mr John Bettinson, chairman, said that
although margins remained under pressure, the industry had shown signs of
recovery in recent weeks.
'There are also signs that export sales are increasing as confidence returns
to the international contract market,' he said.
Earnings per share emerged at 4.17p (2.03p): 'We see no reason at this stage
why the year-end dividend should be returned to its previous level,' Mr
Bettinson said.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: PhoneLink loss widens to Pounds 0.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PhoneLink, the USM-quoted computing services company, said yesterday that
its development of an 'information supermarket' was on course for a launch
in 1994.
Announcing a pre-tax loss of Pounds 301,000 in the six months to September
30 against a Pounds 2,000 deficit last time, the Birkenhead-based company
said its performance was in line with market expectations.
It warned that development costs of its unique Tel-Me system, which extracts
information from commercial computer databases faster and more economically
than existing technology, was about to enter its most expensive stage.
In spite of the large-scale investment necessary to launch the system,
PhoneLink said its losses had been contained by increased oper-ating
efficiency at its Prenton plant near Liverpool.
Mr Trevor Burke, chief executive and founder of the company, said savings of
almost Pounds 2m at Prenton resulted in lower than expected operating losses
of Pounds 484,000, compared with a Pounds 7,000 profit last time.
Development costs for Tel-Me were offset by improved turnover in the
DataCare business, a bulk database service for large corporations.
DataCare was wholly responsible for a 79 per cent increase in turnover to
Pounds 586,000. It also generated gross profits of Pounds 359,000 (Pounds
212,000) before operating expenses associated with Tel-Me.
Losses per share emerged at 0.8p.
PhoneLink's shares, which rose sharply earlier this year after IBM decided
to market Tel-Me, closed 5p higher at 325p. They were placed in May at 155p.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Nu-Swift to go private via 398p share offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nu-Swift, the fire protection and property group, is to be acquired by a
private company indirectly owned by Mr Jacques Murray, its chairman.
Euro Fire Security will offer 398p in cash for each Nu-Swift share, valuing
the issued share capital at Pounds 147.2m.
The price represents a 15 per cent premium over the 345p of the last trade
on the USM at the end of June, when news emerged of the plans to take the
company private.
Mr Murray is the sole beneficial shareholder in European Fire Protection
Holding, owner of Euro Fire Security. Through EFP and other companies he
owns 24.4m shares (66.1 per cent) of Nu-Swift, which he has chaired since
1984.
The other main shareholding is held by subsidiaries of ADT, the
Bermuda-based security and vehicle auction group headed by Mr Michael
Ashcroft. They have 8.4m shares, or 22.8 per cent. Mr Ashcroft is the
independent director on Nu-Swift's board.
ADT's subsidiaries are backing the proposed privatisation.
Mr Murray has confirmed that connected shareholders will not use their vote
at the extraordinary meeting, still to be convened, on the adoption of the
scheme.
Nu-Swift lost its full listing on the Stock Exchange in 1991 because such a
small stake was in public hands. Since December 1988 the group has bought
about 7m of its own shares, leaving only 11.1 per cent outside the two
principal investors.
The board said yesterday that it considered the trading of the shares on the
USM was 'not currently serving any useful purpose,' and imposed a costly
administrative and regulatory burden.
The group has changed the nature of its business, disposing of service
industries and moving into property.
At the end of June the unaudited balance sheet showed consolidated net
assets of Pounds 135.7m, equivalent to approximately 367p a share. The bank
balances and cash were Pounds 91m before finance debt.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Cluff Zimbabwe raises Dollars 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cluff Resources Zimbabwe, 82.4 per cent owned by the UK-quoted mining
company, is raising a 52,000 troy ounce gold loan which should raise about
Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m).
The cash will be used to fund an underground project at the Freda Rebecca
mine in Zimbabwe and repay debt.
Interest has been fixed at 5.6 per cent, substantially below the 30 per cent
paid by CRZ last year. Repayment, in gold, will be in eight equal
instalments over four years beginning in January 1995.
The company said the Freda Rebecca underground development was projected to
boost annual gold output, which was a little more than 72,000 ounces last
year, to about 100,000 ounces during 1995 and should extend the mine's life
to 2000.
It added this was the first gold loan to be approved by the Zimbabwe
government and had been granted by the Eastern and Southern African
Development Bank.
The UK parent also announced that Cluff Oil (Hong Kong), its 34 per cent
owned associate, had accepted an offer from the Chinese government to
participate through a joint venture company in a new round of oil
exploration licences being offered in the East China Sea.
Cluff will have a 17 per cent interest but funding for the initial two-year
exploration programme will be provided by Primeline Properties of Hong Kong.
Cluff has appointed Samuel Montagu as its merchant bank and James Capel as
its broker.

<TEXT>
Increased profits from the Farringford Hotel, its only active subsidiary,
and lower head office overheads were behind the improvement at Farringford,
the former soft drinks manufacturer, in the six months ended August 31 1993.
The company reduced its trading loss from Pounds 151,000 to Pounds 51,000 on
sales of Pounds 403,000 (Pounds 387,000).
Operating profit of the hotel increased from Pounds 65,000 to Pounds 103,000
and interest payable fell from Pounds 56,000 to Pounds 39,000. Head office
costs were shaved to Pounds 126,000, compared with Pounds 208,000.
Losses per share came through lower at 0.21p (0.66p).
Directors said that as the hotel's profitable period fell during the six
months under review, they did not expect it to make a profit in the six
months to February 28 1994.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: New chairman at Intercare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intercare Group, the ac-quisitive manufacturer and supplier of healthcare
products, has responded to its flagging share price by raising its dividend
and splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive.
The shares yesterday rose 14p to 150p after the Stockport-based group
reported a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.31m for the
year to October 2.
Mr Peter Cowan, chairman and chief executive, said the group's shares had
suffered along with the rest of the healthcare sector, and there was also
market concern about small, acquisitive companies that did not conform to
the Cadbury recommendations on corporate governance.
Mr Cowan, who has a 10 per cent stake in Intercare, said the board had
decided to separate his roles, with his full agreement. He will remain as
chief executive, while Mr Robert Shepherd, 62, will become non-executive
chairman. Mr Shepherd founded Priestly Footwear in 1956, which was acquired
by Pentland Industries in 1972, where he became deputy chairman. He retired
from Pentland at the end of 1992.
Mr John Padget, 57, who has been a non-executive director of Kwik-Fit
Holdings since 1981, will join the board as the fourth non-executive
director.
Intercare's sales increased by 34 per cent to Pounds 39m and earnings per
share rose to 10.5p (9.5p).
Mr Cowan said the strength and diversity of the businesses enabled the board
to increase the final dividend to 2.8p, raising the total for the year by 35
per cent to 3.5p (2.6p).
The results included a Pounds 320,000 profits contribution from RTH, the
Dutch supplier of specialised wheelchairs which the group acquired in May
for an initial Pounds 1.8m.
Mr Cowan said Intercare would continue its strategy of concentrating on
medical devices used by the disabled, the elderly, and the optical markets.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Low activity puts AH Ball in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low activity levels in the early part of the current year meant AH Ball
Group, the civil engineer, turned in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 40,000 for the
six months to September 30, against a Pounds 407,000 profit last time.
An inflow of orders in June helped the AH Ball subsidiary to raise turnover
by 48 per cent to Pounds 2.98m in a group total of Pounds 4.15m (Pounds
2.89m). The subsidiary's margins, however, were reduced from 33.3 per cent
to 22.7 per cent and pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 360,000 to Pounds
233,000, which Mr Tom Austin, chairman, said reflected a lack of volume in
the early months.
Setting up costs associated with beginning five new contracts and tighter
margins due to increased competition also contributed to the decline. Mr
Austin expected an improvement in second-half turnover, but margins would
continue to be depressed by poor work mix and competitive factors.
KD Process International incurred a Pounds 157,000 loss (Pounds 142,000
profit for two months), on sales of Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 874,000). Mr Austin
said that early in the current year a review of this operation was taken,
which resulted in lower direct and administrative costs.
However, in view of continuing low sales volumes, a second review in the
current quarter has further reduced KD's costs and Mr Austin said he
believed that 'we have the correct size of organisation to successfully
compete within the company's market.'
Overall, he expected the group to perform better in the second six months.
With losses per share at 0.2p (3.48p earnings), the company is paying an

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sutcliffe Speakman returns to profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sutcliffe Speakman, the activated carbon technology and environmental
protection systems group, returned to profit in the six months to September
30 with Pounds 361,000 pre-tax.
This compared with a deficit of Pounds 560,000 in the comparable six months
and with a total loss of Pounds 6.56m for the whole of 1992-93 - the first
year under the new board - which was arrived at after Pounds 5.83m
restructuring costs.
The shares rose 5p to 54p.
Mr Frank Buckley, chairman, said the result represented a milestone in the
group's recovery.
With the balance sheet ungeared following the July rights issue which
eliminated borrowings of Pounds 6.09m and the restructuring he said that the
group was seeing a strong recovery at the operating level.
Turnover from continuing businesses was Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 8.91m). The
profit was struck after provision of Pounds 576,000 for losses on operations
to be discontinued. Earnings per share were 0.38p (2.06p losses).
Mr Buckley said that the preference dividend due on December 31 cannot
legally be paid because the company will not have sufficient distributable
profits. Publication of the report and accounts for 1993-94 will be the
earliest opportunity for any resumption of preference dividends.
Mr Buckley said that following progress made on the relocation of the
group's operations and the improvement in profits in the current year,
particularly in the second half to date, the resumption of ordinary
dividends will also be reviewed when the accounts are published.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Westport Pounds 220,000 in red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A low level of activity coupled with price competition continued to affect
Westport Group, which reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 220,000 for the half
year to October 30.
Last time there were profits of Pounds 111,000.
The deficit was struck after an exceptional Pounds 162,000 for redundancy
costs and a loss on property disposal.
Turnover for the USM-quoted exhibition, photographic services and markets
specialist fell slightly to Pounds 7.84m (Pounds 7.98m). That was despite a
substantial growth in both turnover and profits from the T&amp;S Lightbox film
processing subsidiary and to a lesser extent from Stanco, which supplies
stand construction to exhibition organisers.
As part of its plan to expand further in digital electronic photographic
imagining services, Westport also announced the acquisition by T&amp;S Lightbox
of Printed Picture Company, a subsidiary of Carlton Communications. The
consideration, in cash, represents less than 3.5 per cent of Westport's net
assets.
Losses per share amounted to 0.18p (0.09p earnings).

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Fairline powers back to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fairline Boats powered back into the black in 1992-93 with overseas sales
bolstered by sterling's devaluation in 1992.
Recovery at the Peterborough-based luxury powerboat maker gathered pace
through the second half with pre-tax profits for the full year to
end-September working through at Pounds 558,000. That compared with previous
losses of Pounds 507,000.
The shares responded with a 16p rise to 298p.
Conditions in all of Fairline's export markets were helped by the
devaluation while new boats introduced in the year - Targa 38, Phantom 37
and Squadron 47 - were all 'exceptionally' well received.
Turnover improved from Pounds 27.7m to Pounds 33.7m with about 90 per cent
of output going to European countries.
Mr Sam Newington, chairman, was expecting some impact from the deepening
recession in Fairline's main markets, pointing out that this had already
been experienced in Spain, France and Italy as well as the Scandinavian
countries. In Germany, however, sales were holding up quite well, UK sales
were showing some improvement while east Asian sales were significantly
better.
At the end of November the company held 11 per cent more value of order
deposits than 12 months earlier and its total outstanding order book value
was ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 15m.
Overall, Mr Newington was looking for a better year in 1993-94 with improved
margins working through when the new boats were 'in full and efficient
production.'
City analysts were anticipating pre-tax profits in the region of Pounds 1m
for 1993-94. However, that depended on the outcome of the London and
Dusseldorf boat shows in January which would be a key factor of the outcome.
Fairline has a strong balance sheet with more cash in hand than at this time
last year after paying off a large part of its development loans for its
factories at Weldon and Oundle, Northamptonshire.
A final dividend of 6.925p maintains the total at 10.5p. Earnings of 10.6p
compared with previous losses of 7p.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: NPT side helps Barcom to Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barcom, the plant hire group which supplies the civil engineering and coal
mining industries, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 562,000 to Pounds
2.06m during the 12 months to September 30.
The company was aided by new acquisitions with NPT, in for its first full
year, contributing Pounds 1.3m and Hawkins, in for four months, generating
Pounds 500,000. These two businesses have now been rationalised under the
Hawkins Plant Services banner.
Group turnover rose from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 31.8m, which included Pounds
6.27m from the acquisitions.
Earnings per share rose from 7.4p to 10.9p. A proposed final dividend of
1.75p brings the year's total to 3p (1.25p).
The company remains highly geared with net debt of Pounds 19.8m, compared
with shareholders funds of Pounds 12m. Two thirds of borrowings, however,
represent finance leases on plant and equipment. Barcom said that it intends
to reduce net debt substantially in the current year.

<TEXT>
Chiltern Radio, the independent local radio operator, returned to profits in
the second half of the year to September 30.
However, the figure of Pounds 79,000, against losses of Pounds 136,000, was
not sufficient to overcome first half losses leaving a full year deficit of
Pounds 246,000 pre-tax, against Pounds 392,000.
The shares lost 9p yesterday to 109p.
The outcome had been affected by costs incurred in the relicensing process.
The company retained eight out of 10 licences and gained a licence for one
of the new regional areas which covered one of the other two.
The company said the present year had started well with strong national
airtime revenues.
Turnover was Pounds 5.76m (Pounds 5.27m). After a tax credit of Pounds
27,000 (Pounds 95,000) losses per share were reduced from 4.6p to 3.4p.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring contributes to first loss at
AJ Archer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AJ Archer, the listed agency on the Lloyd's of London insurance market,
yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 816,000 in the year to September
30.
The deficit, which the company said was the first in its history, compared
with a restated profit of Pounds 1.16m in the previous 12 months.
Mr Ralph Sharp, group managing director, said he was confident about the
future and attributed the losses partly to the restructuring of the company
during the year.
Turnover was Pounds 8.17m (Pounds 7.94m) and losses per share emerged at
1.9p (earnings 1.8p). The final dividend is 0.5p, giving a total of 1p
(4.4p).
AJ Archer acquired Kellett (Holdings) in November 1992 and Castle
Underwriting Holdings in July this year. The purchases have led to
substantial restructuring.
Mr Sharp said there had already been a number of redundancies and staff
taking early retirement, and he expected further falls in the payroll.
He also expressed confidence in the level of capacity for the 1994
underwriting year, which he projected would be up 40 per cent on this year
to Pounds 550m.
He said the agency had already received commitments of more than Pounds 100m
from the new corporate capital vehicles and was still waiting for final
confirmation from Names.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Electra confident as asset value rises 23%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net assets per share at Electra, the UK's largest venture capital investment
trust, rose by 23 per cent to 341.3p over the year to September 30, on a
fully diluted basis.
More than two thirds of Electra's portfolio is held in unquoted companies in
the US and UK, which suffered badly during the recession.
The trust's net asset value per share has yet to regain the 1989 value of
345.7p.
However, Mr Michael Stoddart, chairman, said: 'I believe that Electra
Investment Trust is positioned to resume the growth that it enjoyed during
the 1980s. I look forward to the future with some optimism.'
Mr Hugh Mumford, managing director, said the trust had benefited from a
number of factors, including the improvement in smaller company share
prices, gains on realisations of holdings and from listings, and from the
strength of the dollar.
Electra said it would, for the first time, describe in the annual report and
accounts the principles it follows for valuing unquoted holdings.
Doubts over the valuation of its unquoted holdings, caused Electra shares to
trade at a discount to net asset values of more than 30 per cent in early
1993, although this has since narrowed.
Based on yesterday's closing price of 302p, up 7p, the shares are trading on
a discount of 11.5 per cent.
The trust said its objective was 'to produce a valuation of the unlisted
portfolio which is both consistent and conservative.'
The application of its valuation principles, said Electra, 'normally allows
for a resonable margin of increase in value at the time of realisation or
listing.'
Parker Pen, the trusts's largest unlisted investment, was sold at a
substantial premium to last year's valuation.
Meanwhile, Sphere Drake became the trust's second largest investment
following a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, which more than doubled
the previous valuation.
Electra's pre-tax profits were Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 16.7m). Earnings per
share were 7.544p (7.526p).
The proposed final dividend is increased to 3.55p, making a total of 7p
(6.7p).
The trust's board is about to undergo a number of changes.
Mr Clive Clague and Sir Christopher Wates will retire on December 31; in
addition Mr Colin Black and Mr Brian Peppiatt will retire at the next annual
meeting. Three additional non-executive directors will be appointed.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hoskins transforms with two purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiny USM-traded Hoskins Brewery is set to emerge as Halkin Holdings, a
tobacco accessories and airport shops supplier with a real ale brewery and
three pubs, Mr Howard Hodgson, its new chief executive, said yesterday when
announcing interim results.
The company reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 830,000 for the six months to
September 30, against profits of Pounds 50,000 in the comparative period.
Sales fell to Pounds 330,000 (Pounds 812,000) and there were exceptional
charges of Pounds 529,000 (Pounds 35,000) relating to costs of management
changes and reflecting the dimunition in value of some properties.
The company also showed a Pounds 283,000 provision to cover the loss on the
sale of a loss-making pub.
Losses per share were 14.2p, compared with earnings of 0.87p last time.
Mr Hodgson, a stock market darling in the 1980s, announced the
transformation through two linked acquisitions for Pounds 19.5m funded by
three separate share issues to raise Pounds 15m.
Hoskins' new board announced a Pounds 9.5m partial cash alternative offer
for LGW, which imports and distributes branded goods such as watches and
jewellery through shops based at Gatwick Airport.
Two of LGW's directors and another principal shareholder, accounting for
80.6 per cent of the issued capital, have irrevocably undertaken to accept
the offer.
The offer is conditional on the brewery's Pounds 10m cash acquisition of
Ronson, a manufacturer of cigarette lighters and other smokers' requisites,
as well as household aerosol products and writing instruments.
The new board plans to fund these acquisitions with a placing, subscription
and rights issue which together will raise Pounds 15m through the issue of
25m new shares at 68p apiece.
Of the proceeds, Pounds 10m will be payable to Ronson and Pounds 5.1m will
be available to satisfy acceptances in full by LGW shareholders of the
partial cash alternative.
The issue price compares with the middle market quotation of 78p per share
on December 8 when Hoskins shares were suspended.
On completion of the Ronson deal, Ronson will subscribe for 2.94m new
Hoskins shares at 68p which the company has agreed to retain for 12 months.
Peel Hunt have conditionally placed Pounds 16.2m shares with institutions at
68p and shareholders will be offered new Hoskins shares at the same price on
the basis of a 1-for-1 rights issue.
The placing and rights issue have both been fully underwritten by Guiness
Mahon, save for 755,000 shares to be taken up in accordance with
undertakings received by the company.
The board also proposed a capital reconstruction for which the company needs
court approval and, in common with most of yesterday's proposals, will have
to be agreed by shareholders at a special meeting on January 12.
Shares in Hoskins were suspended on December 8 and the Stock Exchange has
indicated that dealings will recommence on the USM but will be suspended for
a second time on January 11.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reed Elsevier, the international publisher, has taken its first move into
the legal publishing market in Italy with the purchase of a 40 per cent
stake in the Giuffre group which has offices in Milan and Rome.
Reed is buying the stake in Giuffre Editore, a family-owned company, and its
sister company Mori which in the year to December 1992 had sales of L102bn
(Pounds 43.4m).
No price was announced but it is believed the stake cost Reed, which has
been expanding its international legal publishing operations, just under
Pounds 30m.
Giuffre specialises in law, economics and political science. It claims
Italian market leadership in legal publishing for the university and
professional market. The company has a backlist of about 5,000 titles and 60
journals.
Reed Elsevier's main legal publishers are Butterworths in the UK and the
Commonwealth and Editions Techniques, the French legal publisher bought
earlier this year in a deal worth Pounds 77m.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 27m purchase by Manders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manders, the Wolverhampton-based paints, inks and property group, has
acquired the printing inks and graphics supplies business of Croda
International for about Pounds 26.7m cash.
Manders' shares climbed 14p to 350p.
Mr John Farmer, Manders finance director, said that the acquisition would
push borrowings up to Pounds 50m. Manders is paying about Pounds 16m for the
net assets plus goodwill of Pounds 10.7m.
Manders said the acquisition would complement its existing coatings and inks
business. Mr Farmer said that the purchase would increase turnover in the
coatings side from Pounds 50m a year to between Pounds 80m and Pounds 85m.
Most of the increase would derive from continental Europe, especially the
Netherlands. The operations bought are also located in the UK, Ireland,
Italy, New Zealand and Zimbabwe.
Manders said it would benefit from the spread of the businesses bought
because many European customers now wanted to standardise supply
relationships across borders.
In 1992, the bought businesses made operating profits of Pounds 2m (Pounds
1.7m) on sales of Pounds 30m (Pounds 29.6m). Net operating assets were
valued at Pounds 12.4m at December 31 1992.
In September Mr Roger Akers, Manders chief executive, said that the Mander
Centre, the group's shopping centre valued in December 1991 at Pounds 57.5m,
was being marketed in response to 'unsolicited approaches'.
Mr Farmer said a short list of interested parties had been prepared. Sale
details would be put to shareholders 'within eight to 10 weeks'. He
suggested that the group would want to reduce borrowings with part of the
proceeds.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Jacques Vert shares jump 27p
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Jacques Vert, the women's fashion wear supplier, advanced 27p to
179p after an interim profit forecast above expectations.
It is expected that when the company reports figures for the six months to
October 30 on January 11 pre-tax profits will be Pounds 800,000, after
taking a property devaluation charge of about Pounds 400,000.
There would also be an additional charge of Pounds 962,000 taken directly
against reserves.
The company, which underwent a restructuring in the previous financial year
after falling into losses, reported a return to profits of Pounds 1.03m
(Pounds 4.65m losses) for the year to April 24.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: LMS supported by Pounds 2m exceptional
gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at London Merchant Securities, the property and investment company,
slipped from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 10.1m pre-tax in the six months to
September 30. The shares eased 2p to 109p.
Under FRS 3 the corresponding figures have been restated to bring
extraordinaries above the line: last time profits of Pounds 11.3m were
declared.
While gross rental income edged ahead to Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 16.9m), net
rental income from investment properties declined to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds
15m). Lord Rayne, chairman, said that reflected the 'full effect of the
carrying costs of new developments as yet unlet'. Property trading profits
grew to Pounds 624,000 (Pounds 75,000) and operating profits to Pounds 13.3m
(Pounds 12.8m).
Under FRS 3, First Leisure, in which LMS has a 14.6 per cent stake, is now
treated as an investment. Therefore the dividend receivable is shown, rather
than a share of the leisure group's profits. Within other income down at
Pounds 4.43m (Pounds 6.33m) because of the effect of lower interest rates on
cash deposits, income from First Leisure was flat at Pounds 596,000.
This time there were exceptional credits of Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 812,000)
from a rise in other investments and the release of a Pounds 574,000
provision against investments. Interest payable expanded to Pounds 9.5m
(Pounds 8.8m).
During the period the core businesses were expanded by the acquisition of
seven bingo clubs in the Midlands. Lord Rayne said organic growth was
continuing.
Earnings per share worked through at 2.31p (2.53p) and the interim dividend
is held at 0.8p.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Expanding Bowthorpe seeks Pounds 64m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bowthorpe, the international electronic and electrical components group,
yesterday announced a Pounds 64.4m rights issue to fund the expansion of its
instruments and sensors business.
The company hoped the 1-for-8 placement, involving the issue of 20.6m new
shares at 320p, would enable it to pursue acquisitions and strengthen a
balance sheet depleted recently by the Dollars 21m (Pounds 14m) purchase of
Lear Siegler, the US measurement controls company.
The issue would also offset the Dollars 17.2m cash purchase of Kaye
Instruments, another US instrument manufacturer.
Although borrowings had increased sharply, the company was expecting pre-tax
profits to grow 18 per cent to Pounds 50.5m (Pounds 42.7m) in the 12 months
to December 31.
Of that increase, Pounds 4.8m would be due to beneficial currency
translations compared with Pounds 900,000 last time.
A final dividend of 5.03p (4.57p) would raise the total to 6.91p (6.36p).
Mr Colin McCarthy, financial director, said increased demand in the UK and
US had persuaded the company to expand in those markets.
'We'd like to find suitable acquisitions in the UK, but there are more
opportunities overseas. The rights issue will help us exploit those,' he
said.
COMMENT
Bowthorpe, which last made a cash call shortly before the 1987 stock market
crash, has a reputation for shrewdly exploiting its buoyant share price to
raise capital. So although the issue price of 320p looks attractive against
yesterday's close of 373p, analysts suspect the market price might be
overvalued. Indeed, a 9p fall on the day suggests some investors felt it was
time to take profits. Bowthorpe, however, has not let down investors in the
past by making poor acquisitions. Forecast pre-tax profits for next year
have been increased to Pounds 59.5m, putting the shares on a forward
multiple of 20.7 and reflecting market confidence about the group's
strategy.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Plysu suffers sharp decrease to Pounds
3.41m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plysu, the plastic milk and juice bottle manufacturer, yesterday announced a
sharp drop in interim pre-tax profits, from Pounds 5.81m to Pounds 3.41m, on
sales 4 per cent higher at Pounds 44m against Pounds 42.5m.
The results had been widely expected following the group's profits warning
in October and the shares closed 2p higher at 197p.
The interim dividend is maintained at 2p, while earnings fell from 8.4p to
4.8p.
Mr Stephen Nobbs, finance director, said the decline in profits had been due
to three main factors: firstly, a significant reduction in milk carton
prices as a result of the renegotiation of contracts with customers;
secondly, exceptional costs of Pounds 1m to increase capacity in the dairy
business to secure the contracts; and finally, deepening recession in
continental Europe.
The profits picture was also slightly distorted by the comparison of 26
weeks in 1993, against 28 weeks last time. However, it was estimated that
the pre-tax figure was still 32 per cent down on a comparable basis.
Mr Nobbs said that trading in continental Europe had proved to be
particularly difficult. Sales had been boosted by the inclusion for the full
six months of SEP, the Belgian and Dutch business acquired last year, which
contributed Pounds 15.9m. Turnover, however, was down by 9 per cent when
currency and acquisitions gains were excluded.
Mr Nobbs said Plysu was committed to expanding in Europe, and had some
acquisitions in sight.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Yorks Electricity rises to Pounds 74m -
Dividend increased by 15% 'about average for the sector'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Electricity provided shareholders with an interim dividend
increase of 15 per cent after increasing pre-tax profits from Pounds 42.5m
to Pounds 74m.
The dividend rise was less than that of several regional power companies but
Yorkshire said that, unlike them, it was not rebalancing the pay-outs
between the two halves.
Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive, said the increase was about average for
the sector and consistent with previously stated policies.
The published pre-tax profits showed a 74 per cent rise on turnover of
Pounds 587.2m (Pounds 590.7m). However, unlike other regional companies
Yorkshire has not restated its accounts to reflect changes in coal
contracts. Taking this into account the underlying growth in profits was
said to be 22 per cent.
Earnings per share were 27.8p (14.8p), with underlying growth of 32 per
cent. The dividend is 6.9p (6p).
In the half year staff was cut by 329. The company said it was on target to
deliver a 550 reduction by the end of year, a fall of 10 per cent.
In the core business operating costs fell by 2 per cent during the half.
Units distributed increased by 1.6 per cent, or 0.6 per cent when adjusted
for weather. The company said this 'provided evidence of an upturn in the
region's economy'.
Retail is continuing to benefit from efficiencies following the setting up
of a joint venture with East Midlands Electricity. But Mr Chatwin said it
made a small loss in the half year and was facing difficult trading
conditions.
COMMENT
Once a star of the sector, Yorkshire's sparkle has faded somewhat in the
last year. Assuming an annual dividend of 23.2p, the shares are on a
prospective yield of about 4.3 per cent, signifying concerns about
relatively low dividend cover and the company's progress in cutting costs.
That may seem strange for a company that cut more than 300 jobs in the half
year, above the average. But some analysts believe its cost base remains
higher than most regional electricity companies and that it may be penalised
by the regulator in the forthcoming distribution review as a result. The
contrary view is that Yorkshire will start to benefit soon from innovative
restructuring of its core business into more competitive units. In these
results the management showed its value by building the Brigg generating
plant to programme and at a saving of about Pounds 5m to budget. In the end
Yorkshire's steady, 'managed growth' approach may pay off but investors may
wait until after the review before re-assessing their opinions. The shares
are meanwhile worth holding on to.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: H&amp;C shares fall on statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the plantations, chemicals and commodities
company, yesterday fell 4 per cent in a buoyant market as the group sought
to rein in expectations for 1993 profits.
Mr Bill Turcan, finance director, said a substantial fall in pig and palm
oil prices since the interim results meant that many forecasts may have been
too high. He stressed that H&amp;C was still on track for a 'useful improvement'
in the full year.
The shares closed 9p down at 195p after a trading statement which the
company insisted was not a profits warning. It was, said Mr Turcan, an
attempt to inform the market as a whole, rather than analysts and
institutions individually. This was in line with the best practice
guidelines encouraged by the Stock Exchange, he said.
Analysts welcomed the statement and suggested the share price fall might
have been unwarranted. Forecasts for pre-tax profits were marked down from
about Pounds 105m to between Pounds 95m and Pounds 100m, against Pounds 85m
last year.
'One hopes other companies will not be put off from making this sort of
announcement after what happened to Harrisons &amp; Crosfield,' said Mr Andrew
Mitchell, investment analyst with Smith New Court.
H&amp;C's statement warned that the decline in pig prices would wipe Pounds 6m
off profits in the food and agriculture division. The group would seek to
allay some of the volatility in pig prices through longer term contracts
with retailers. However, that would be difficult to achieve while prices
were low.
The plantations division had suffered from lower than expected palm oil
prices. This meant that profits would be close to the Pounds 12.4m achieved
in the first half, instead of about Pounds 16m expected by the market.
On a brighter note, H&amp;C said its chemicals division was expected to return
profits 'significantly ahead' of 1992. Timber was also expected to improve
substantially.
Debt and gearing were expected to be unchanged from last year's Pounds 250m
and 51 per cent respectively.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Amber Day in Pounds 15.5m fundraising
exercise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amber Day Holdings, the discount retailer, last night announced a Pounds
15.5m fundraising exercise which will see Warburg Pincus, the US investment
institution, raise its stake in the group from 17 to 25 per cent.
The latest management team, supported by Warburg Pincus, will use the
proceeds to strengthen the group's highly geared balance sheet and
eventually double the size of its existing chain of 58 What Everyone Wants
stores.
The controversial group, which has suffered from continuing management
upheaval, also plans to change its name to WEW Group, which it said 'marks a
clear separation with the past.'
Mr Peter Carr, an experienced retailer who became executive chairman in
August, is the group's third chairman in the last 15 months. He will receive
an option on 3m shares, subject to achieving profit-related targets over a
five-year period. No part of the option can be exercised before 1998, under
normal circumstances.
Amber Day said it proposed to raise about Pounds 15.5m by issuing 29m new
shares by way of a placing and open offer and a subscription. Under the
subscription, Warburg Pincus will subscribe for 5.8m new shares (5 per cent)
at 58p per share.
Under a placing, the company has placed 23m new ordinary shares with Warburg
Pincus and certain sizeable shareholders, together representing an aggregate
holding of 52.7 per cent of the company's share capital, and other
institutions, at 56p per share, subject to an open offer to qualifying
shareholders.
Under the terms of the open offer, qualifying shareholders can subscribe for
the new ordinary shares at the same price on a 1-for-5 basis.
The fundraising exercise, change of company name and Mr Carr's options
scheme are all subject to shareholders' approval.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Hotel group restructures as prelude to flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inter-Continental Hotels, owned by the Japanese Saison group, is to split
its management oper-ations and property activities into two companies at the
start of next year.
The move, which follows a similar restructuring by Marriott, the US hotel
chain, is a prelude to the possible flotation of a minority of the shares in
the property business in about three years' time.
Mr Gavin Simonds, until recently a director of Kleinwort Benson, and Mr
Robert Collier, president of Inter-Continental group services, have been
named joint managing directors of the two companies.
Mr Simonds, who will be mainly responsible for the property business,
expected the two companies to have 'a very close relationship'. He added
that the new structure would focus management resources more effectively.
'It will make the operating company a clear vehicle for winning new business
and earning a profit by managing hotels,' he said. 'The future for
Inter-Continental lies in using the power of its brand, its reservations
system and other intangible assets.'
The chain operates 121 hotels in 50 countries, most of which it does not
own.
Mr Simonds said that unlike Marriott, which made large profits from property
development until the market collapsed in the late 1980s, Inter-Continental
had not traded actively in property.
Saison acquired Inter-Continental from Grand Metropolitan, the UK drinks and
food company, for Dollars 2.2bn in 1988.

FT  17 DEC 93 / M&amp;G surges as recovery plays pay off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in M&amp;G jumped 30p to 995p yesterday as the fund management group
announced a 36 per cent increase in its final dividend for the year to
September 30. Full-year pre-tax profits advanced 29 per cent from Pounds
39.4m to Pounds 50.9m.
Funds under management rose 45 per cent, helped by buoyant stock markets and
a strong improvement in the group's relative investment performance. M&amp;G
follows a 'value investing' style - looking for shares with artificially
depressed prices - which tends to suffer during recessions, but performs
very well in periods of recovery.
The group's sales of unit trusts (sales minus redemptions) were just Pounds
92m for the year to September 30, against an industry total of more than
Pounds 7bn. Mr Peter Emms, marketing director, said the trust traditionally
did not attract a large share of institutional unit trust sales, nor did it
offer a high income fund.
Some unit trust launches have offered yields as high as 10 per cent and have
been very successful. But Mr Paddy Linaker, group managing director, did not
feel that such products were appropriate for M&amp;G clients. He warned of the
problems unit trust groups faced in the 1970s, when 'withdrawal plans' led
to the erosion of investors' capital in the 1973-74 bear market.
M&amp;G's sales showed signs of improvement in the second half and all four of
its UK equity income funds are in the top 10 per cent of the sector over the
year to September 1. It has more Personal Equity Plan accounts than any
other UK company.
At September 30, unit trust funds under management were Pounds 6.32bn
(Pounds 4.15bn); investment trusts were Pounds 662m (Pounds 456m); life and
pension funds were Pounds 2.14bn (Pounds 1.55bn); and institutional investor
clients were Pounds 3.34bn (Pounds 2.45bn). Total funds under management
were Pounds 12.46bn (Pounds 8.59bn), or Pounds 10.56bn after allowing for
double counting.
Revenue from investment management was Pounds 63.7m (Pounds 59.4m).
Marketing and commissions expenditure was Pounds 13.17m, down from Pounds
18.53m in 1991-92 when the company launched two investment trusts.
Administration expenditure was Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 17.9m).
The group's insurance activities contributed Pounds 12.69m (Pounds 10.19m).
The accounting treatment of this business will change this year to reflect
the EC Insurance Accounts Directive.
The final dividend is increased from 11p to 15p, making a total of 25p,
against 20p. Earnings per share rose from 36.4p to 47.8p.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Pooling funds to ease the pain of change: Negotiations among
Europe's petrochemicals producers to cut loss-making capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's petrochemicals industry is in agony. Profitability has fallen for
five years and not a single producer is covering reinvestment costs. Today
the sector's most important manufacturers will tackle the cause of the
suffering.
Delegates from Europe's most important manufacturers of ethylene, the basic
building block of plastics, are gathering in Brussels under the auspices of
the Association of Petrochemicals Producers in Europe to discuss closing
capacity. The 10-strong subcommittee is expected to make a final decision
about whether to recommend a Europe-wide rationalisation programme.
The problem facing the sector is deceptively simple. There are 53 ethylene
crackers in western Europe with capacity of 18.4m tonnes a year. Next year
the figure will rise to 19.34m tonnes because of BASF's new
650,000-tonne-a-year plant in Antwerp.
In contrast, demand, hit by the European recession, is expected to be only
15.6m tonnes next year, according to Trichem consultants, the London-based
industry specialists.
Given the massive imbalance between supply and demand, prices of ethylene
derivatives remain grim and capacity utilisation rates during the fourth
quarter have drifted below 80 per cent. Polystyrene prices have tumbled from
more than DM2.60 (Pounds 1.03) a kilo in 1989 to less than DM1.50 while
polypropylene prices have plummeted from DM2.30 a kilo in 1990 to just over
DM1. Efforts by manufacturers to raise prices this autumn have been largely
unsuccessful. Increases were almost immediately undermined by discounting.
The only exception was PVC, which has gone up 20 per cent since September,
but from a devastatingly low base.
The solution appears obvious. The industry must cut capacity. The proposal
being discussed today is that between 1.5m tonnes and 2m tonnes a year of
ethylene capacity should be shut down. This would be achieved by setting up
a DM500m fund based on a levy of about DM30 per tonne of installed capacity.
Those manufacturers wanting to close capacity would then bid for part of the
fund in return for shutting down their plants. Some derivative production
would also need to be closed.
According to estimates by brokers James Capel, Enichem of Italy would pay
DM63m into the scheme for its capacity of 2.1m tonnes a year; Shell DM51m
for its 1.7m tonnes; Dow DM48m for its 1.6m tonnes; BASF and Elf Atochem
DM45m each for their 1.5m tonnes; the Fina-Neste joint-venture DM30m for its
1m tonnes; DSM DM30m for its 1m tonnes; and Imperial Chemical Industries
DM18m for its 600,000 tonnes.
Mr Jukka Viinanen, APPE president, is optimistic about the plan's prospects.
But the barriers to rationalisation remain considerable. These include
environmental clean-up and redundancy costs, as well as the political
obstacles to closing state-owned plants.
Last month members of the APPE general council members voted 20 to three in
favour of the plan, with two abstentions. But if the plan is to work,
unanimity is needed.
Ethylene producers have remained unwilling to discuss prospects for the
meeting. The sticking points appear to be:
Whether the capacity closures would be sufficient to justify the fund's
creation.
Whether producers, which closed capacity in the 1980s at their own expense
and are now cost-efficient, should pay for others to close plants. ICI, for
example, closed 650,000 tonnes of capacity during the 1980s.
Whether a moratorium on new capacity could be agreed. There would be little
point in closing capacity if other manufacturers added new production soon
afterwards.
The APPE is determined that a decision on whether or not to press ahead with
the plan should be made today. Delaying it further could be
counter-productive, preventing rationalisation that would take place anyway.
Mergers of individual businesses - such as between Shell and Himont, Enichem
and BP Chemicals, and Neste and Statoil - appear to be in limbo.
Even if the steering committee does give the green light to the plan, it has
to be approved by the members' boards and by the European Commission.
Earlier this month Mr Karel Van Miert, European competition commissioner,
said he needed to be convinced the situation facing the industry was not
merely a dip in the business cycle, but rather a true structural crisis with
no hope of a reasonable recovery without rationalisation. He also warned
that any restructuring should not be used to create an anti-competitive
cartel. If that was the case, the Commission would not hesitate to take
appropriate action, he said.
If the proposals go ahead, the question remains whether they will have any
real impact.
Over the past decade, Europe, with its high labour, energy, environmental
and logistical costs, has become a net importer of plastics. Attempts at
price rises may inevitably be undermined by greater imports from low-cost
manufacturers in the US and Middle East.
In other words, the present unprofitability may be the consequence of
structural change in the sector, rather than its traditional cyclicality. If
so, the petrochemicals manufacturers' efforts to close capacity and swap or
merge businesses may prove of little use.
As Ms Hilfra Tandy, editor of Chemical Matters, the industry newsletter, has
warned: the plastics producers' increasingly frantic efforts to save
themselves could prove little more effective than passengers swapping
deckchairs on the decks of the Titanic.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Job cuts herald shake-up at Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Francis Baron, new chief executive of holiday company Owners Abroad,
yesterday announced the redundancy of 260 management and support staff and
said he was conducting a review that could change the group's name.
Mr Baron, who took charge of Owners Abroad last month, said the group had
little idea under its previous management of how profitable it was. He added
that its branding and marketing strategy had been incoherent. The defence
documents it published to fight off a takeover by its rival Airtours earlier
this year had 'lacked conviction'.
Mr Baron, a former television executive, replaced Mr Howard Klein, the
former chairman and chief executive, who announced his resignation last
July.
Mr Klein left after the group announced that full-year profits this year
were likely to be half that of market expectations. Mr Baron said that while
the group had been producing large amounts of data, there was no system to
ensure this reached directors in a form that would enable them to assess the
company's performance.
Mr Baron said yesterday's redundancies, accompanied by a restructuring were
the first part of a three-phase plan to restore the group's fortunes.
The restructuring will eliminate four levels of management. General managers
and finance directors of subsidiary companies are leaving. The post of
managing director of tour operating is being abolished and Mr Dermot
Blastland, the current incumbent, is being reassigned to work on a special
project for Mr Baron. Mr Baron would not describe the project.
The second phase of the plan, which Mr Baron hoped to complete by the end of
February, would improve information systems.
The third phase will develop a marketing and branding strategy by the end of
March.
Mr Baron said: 'Everything is up for grabs, including the corporate name.'
Airtours is renaming its Pickfords Travel and Hogg Robinson retail chains.
All 550 shops will be called Going Places. Airtours intends to complete the
rebranding by Christmas.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Metallgesellschaft loses chief of US arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the German mining, metals and industrial group, faced
deepening problems yesterday when the head of its US trading subsidiary
resigned.
The resignation of Mr Siegfried Hodapp, the MG Corp chief, came before a
special meeting of Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board which will take
place in Frankfurt this morning. This is likely to focus on problems at MG
Corp and is widely expected to lead to the departure of Metallgesellschaft
board directors.
Last week Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, Metallgesellschaft's chief executive,
successfully negotiated new lines of credit from the group's bankers. This
was in response to what Metallgesellschaft said then were temporary
liquidity problems arising from the need to meet margin calls  - cash
payouts - on oil futures contracts taken out by MG Corp in New York,
triggered by the sharp fall in the oil price in recent months.
There is a growing concern that the liquidity problems are greater than have
been indicated. Shares in Metallgesellschaft yesterday dropped DM12.30 to
close at DM293, against the trend of the German stock market. The shares
have fallen more than 30 per cent since the start of last week.
Mr Hans Schreiber, Metallgesellschaft spokesman, said that the supervisory
board meeting would focus on 'the status of business developments at
Metallgesellschaft in general, with special reference to developments at MG
Corp'.
He did not know why Mr Hodapp left MG Corp, saying reports that a further
five senior MG Corp employees had resigned were 'rubbish'.
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, shareholders in Metallgesellschaft as well
as creditors, backed the company's version of events last week. Mr Hilmar
Kopper, Deutsche's chief executive, said last Tuesday that the group's
liquidity problems were not 'life-threatening'.
However since then it is understood that the banks have investigated MG
Corp's activities and have been revised their original assessment of the
situation.
It is likely that Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank main-board director
who is chairman of Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board, will today detail
MG Corp's problems and their impact on the parent company's liquidity.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Welsh electronics company buys Grundig TV factory in France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A Welsh company is to rescue a television plant in eastern France where the
German consumer electronics manufacturer Grundig had planned to stop
production at the end of the year.
Gooding Consumer Electronics, a privately owned and newly formed company, is
paying FFr160m (Pounds 18.28m), supported by a French government grant of
FFr50m, to buy the Grundig Electronique factory at Creutzwald in the Moselle
region.
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, announcing the deal
yesterday, said Gooding would keep 350 of the 550 jobs at the plant and the
workforce could increase to more than 450 by the end of 1995.
Gooding Consumer Electronics is jointly owned by Mr Alfred Gooding, a
leading entrepreneur in Wales, and Mr Koen van Driel, until recently
commercial director of Astra, the European radio and television satellite
station, and a former managing director of Grundig UK.
Mr Gooding is chairman of the new company and Mr van Driel chief executive.
Mr Gooding is also chairman of two manufacturing companies in south Wales,
Race Electronics and Gooding Sanken, a joint venture company with Sanken
Electric of Japan which makes power supply units.
The Creutzwald plant's existing capacity is 500,000 sets a year, but Mr
Gooding said yesterday he intended to go for a volume market, mainly in
14in, 20in and 21in sets, and to boost production to 1m sets a year in three
years.
Philips, the Dutch electronics group which owns 31.6 per cent of Grundig and
has management control, said in January that from the beginning of 1994
production would be switched from Creutzwald to factories in Germany and
Austria.
The new company is acquiring the Minerva brand name from Grundig, and is
setting up a company to sell the televisions made at Creutzwald. It is also
buying the brand name Continental Edison from Thomson of France, and will
initially market the televisions under this name in France.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Gore hits at IMF over plight of Russia's jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, criticised the International Monetary
Fund yesterday for insensitivity to the plight of the unemployed in Russia,
foreshadowing a possible shift in western policy on helping the country's
economy.
Mr Gore said the effect of huge defence budget cuts on communities dependent
on defence production had been 'devastating'.
He criticised western countries for not waking up to Russia's problems.
'Every country with representatives on the IMF board has been slow to
recognise the hardship caused by some of what has been done in the past.
That may cause a diplomatic incident, but I don't care.'
The IMF was supposed to grant at least Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) in the
current year to assist reform. Only Dollars 1.5bn has been given and there
are doubts if the second tranche will be released.
The IMF has complained that successive Russian governments have not
curtailed the budget deficit and brought inflation down to 5 per cent a
month. Meeting these criteria would mean choking off credits to already
shaky Russian enterprises, causing mass unemployment.
Mr Gore said that 'in circumstances where there is a great deal of economic
suffering and when the world does not pay too much attention to that, then
people become vulnerable to demagoguery'. This was endorsed by Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, who said it was in the defence
industries where 'the highest intellectual strength is concentrated, and we
cannot shut them down'.
The neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party swept the board in Sunday's
election in that part of parliament chosen according to party lists. Senior
international financial officials now believe western aid strategies for
Russia will change as a new government reins back the speed of reforms.
Reuter in Washington reports: Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state,
said last night the US would go on supporting Russian reformers. In a TV
interview he said the reformers had needed a 'wake-up call' and should now
build coalitions.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Bundesbank sets tougher target for money supply: Scope for
rate cut to be studied as inflation eases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank yesterday tight-ened its money supply growth targets for next
year, but stressed this was not a signal for a more restrictive interest
rates policy.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president, in a modestly upbeat review of economic and
monetary conditions, also suggested inflation was weakening and reinforced
economists' expectations that the recent series of small interest rate cuts
would be resumed early in the new year.
The bank's central council fixed the 1994 target range for annualised
expansion of the key M3 measure at 4-6 per cent, compared with 4.5-6.5 per
cent this year. As expected, it left the Bundesbank's key discount rate
unchanged at 5.75 per cent.
A surprise surge in monetary growth in November, announced yesterday,
demonstrated that the bank still has grounds for concern. M3, its most
trusted indicator of future inflation, grew at an annualised rate of 7.2 per
cent, up from 6.9 per cent in October.
Mr Tietmeyer said that although the economy was in a difficult transition
phase, and the correction of structural problems in the west needed time,
inflation was weakening and the east no longer relied solely on cash
transfers from the west.
He said the bank would assess any scope for rate reductions. The discount
rate has been cut six times this year, paring it from 8.25 per cent in
January to 5.75 per cent now.
Mr Otmar Issing, the bank's top economist, suggested west German inflation
could fall below 3 per cent in the course of the new year, compared with the
latest figure of 3.6 per cent.
The average rate of price increases for 1994 would still be above 3 per
cent, he warned, and there was always a danger to import prices from the
possible appreciation of the US dollar or higher costs of oil.
Yesterday's decisions, although criticised by trade unions and opposition
politicians as brakes on the economic recovery, were widely welcomed by
industry and the financial community.
The tighter M3 target range underscored the bank's determination to maintain
monetary stability, according to the Confederation of German industry. It
allowed room for further interest cuts and ensured enough liquidity for
tension-free economic growth, the confederation added.
Mr Tietmeyer said one main factor persuading the bank to lower its targets
was reduced potential for economic growth. The 1993 range allowed for growth
of up to 3 per cent, while the new figures assumed 2.5 per cent next year.
Falling capital investment and decisions by some manufacturers to base new
plant outside Germany had reduced potential.
The notional inflation rate allowed for was unchanged at 2 per cent.

FT  17 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Harrisons &amp; Crosfield
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The theory of conglomerates is that if one part of the group is suffering,
growth elsewhere will ease the pain. Yesterday's trading statement from
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield is a reminder that the argument cuts both ways. While
its interests in chemicals and building materials are starting to recover,
the commodity exposure to pigs is now acting as a drag. A surfeit of Polish
pigs is the immediate cause of a price swing which will knock Pounds 6m off
profits this year.
Unlike the US, Europe does not boast a liquid futures market in pig meat.
Profits cannot easily be protected from sudden price movements. Harrisons'
palm oil and rubber can be sold forward to lock into good prices, but that
only offers temporary respite should the market turn sour. Perhaps Harrisons
should therefore decide whether, despite its origins, it wants to be in
commodities at all.
Since Harrisons' pigs are reared in the UK, lower profits will aggravate the
problem of surplus advance corporation tax. An enhanced scrip dividend would
reduce ACT and help repair the damage to the balance sheet caused by the
recent run of uncovered dividends. With this year's earnings likely to be
below the level of 1989, though, Harrisons does not have a strong argument
for raising additional equity. While a yield well above the market average
offers some protection, yesterday's 5 per cent fall in the shares suggests
investors are looking for something more.

The flow of funds into unit trusts has been uneven. Despite its reputation
in the field, M&amp;G's net sales of unit trusts amounted to only Pounds 92m
last year, out of an industry total of more than Pounds 7bn. Its strategy of
investing in high yield and recovery stocks, which produced a mediocre
investment record in recession, is partly to blame. But that style of
investing has produced handsome return since Black Wednesday, so M&amp;G should
now return to favour among independent financial advisers. Sales in the
early part of this financial year are apparently running well ahead of last.
Even so, M&amp;G is not well placed to capture institutional inflows, which have
accounted for more than a third of net sales across the industry this year.
Fund managers with a long list of pension fund clients, such as Gartmore,
will continue to enjoy the best of this business. Neither has M&amp;G launched a
guaranteed income fund, the kind of product which attracted so much retail
money as interest rates declined. With such funds now attracting
controversy, though, that may be less of a handicap from now on.
While the global bull market continues, a dull sales performance is not
enough to upset the shares. Yesterday's 25 per cent dividend increase puts
most utilities to shame. If the flow of savings into equities turns out to
be more than a passing phenomenon, M&amp;G looks undervalued despite having
outperformed the market by 25 per cent this year.

FT  17 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Arjo Wiggins Appleton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The departure of another Anglo-Saxon director at Arjo Wiggins Appleton comes
as a further blow to a company which seems to specialise in nasty surprises.
Mr Gordon Bond had done a good job at Appleton in the US, exhibiting
energetic marketing skills which are not conspicuously abundant throughout
the rest of the group. Brought back to Europe to run the printing and
writing divisions, he had been in the post for less than a year before
yesterday's resignation. This latest boardroom rumpus may owe more to style
than substance. The company was certainly at pains yesterday to counter the
more alarmist rumours. Yet following the earlier resignations of Mr Henry
Wendt and Mr Stephen Walls, the market has grown intolerant of such mishaps.
The 9 per cent drop in AWA's shares illustrates the scale of disappointment.
Such worries will linger until the merged Franco-British enterprise exhibits
greater stability. Yet there is no reason to doubt the underlying economics
of the business. AWA has articulated a cogent strategy which should bear
fruit as the European paper cycle swings upwards. The market is undoubtedly
tightening. The capacity slack is being taken up and sales volumes are
recovering. There is widespread talk that pulp prices may rise next year and
even some expectation they may stick. This year's surge in AWA's shares
suggested that the market had anticipated every scrap of good news.
Yesterday's shock highlights how AWA can be relied upon to throw in
something bad.

FT  17 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: High hopes of low rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a case of another day, another record for the UK equity market.
Yesterday's 32 point rise seems to reflect a growing conviction that more
interest rate cuts are on the way. Since average earnings are still growing
by only 3 per cent, the government has little to fear from wage pressure,
while Wednesday's retail prices data show inflation is well under control.
On the surface, a 36,000 drop in seasonally-adjusted unemployment makes it
look as though there is some growth about as well.
Yet other indicators are not quite so auspicious. Manufacturing output
shrank by 0.2 per cent in the last three months; employment in manufacturing
actually fell by 10,000 in October. Nor do yesterday's figures for notes and
coins in circulation suggest a bumper Christmas in the shops. So the equity
market must be driven above all by interest rate expectations. That is also
reflected in the vulnerability of particular sectors to specific worries -
such as life insurers yesterday on pensions - which draws attention to how
stretched individual valuations often are.
The money markets do not expect another base rate cut immediately. But the
equity market can afford to wait until the new year, especially since the
perception is now growing that the next half-point cut may not be the last.
The worrying thought is what will happen when the interest trough is reached
and next year's tax increases start to bite. While low wage growth justifies
lower interest rates, it also means real disposable incomes could well fall.
Growth would then depend on consumers borrowing more. If not, equities could
be high and dry, especially if higher US bond yields have staunched the
international flow of funds.

horror when the three-star Berkshire hostelry not only denied knowledge of

Goldman Sachs.
Salomon then found that the landlord at another Waterside Inn, close by
London's red-light district, was completing meticulous preparations to
welcome Salomon's banker friends. Fortunately, Mosimann's, the swanky
Belgravia watering hole frequented by minor royals, swallowed its pride and

It's an ill wind . . . The Scott inquiry into the British government's murky

manufacturers of Post-it notes, those sticky-backed yellow bits of paper for

The bulk of the damning evidence at the Scott inquiry derives from remarks
scrawled by civil servants and ministers in the margins of official
documents.
Officials in sensitive posts say they have thus learnt an important lesson.
Any controversial recommendations will henceforth be confined to Post-it
notes, easily removable before documents are filed for posterity.

Well done Diane Abbott, MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, for saying

'Economics is a happy hunting ground for charlatans. This is partly because
it is dominated by men - famously the less practical sex,' she informed the
Treasury and Civil Service committee examining the role of the Bank of

concepts, and the unintelligibility of the jargon all combine to cow
otherwise healthily sceptical observers.' What a sensible person.

Who's going to replace National Health Service boss Sir Duncan Nichol?
The question is causing increasing alarm in some quarters of the health
service now that KPMG partner Sheila Masters, a non-executive member of the
NHS policy board, has reached the final interview stage yesterday. Insiders
are terrified that health secretary Virginia Bottomley will impose Masters
on them again. A former NHS finance director, she frightened civil servants
by her tough demands when crafting the 1991 NHS reforms.
Alan Langlands, the current deputy chief executive, would be much more
preferable to NHS types. He would continue Sir Duncan's capable management
style while allowing ministers to hog the limelight. Alternatively, Ken
Jarrold, chief executive of Wessex regional health authority, who is
credited with having restored its reputation, would be another safe bet.

So you thought Graham Taylor was to blame for failing to get the England
football team into next year's World Cup. Wrong. The reason is much more
simple - it's all the fault of the free market.
At least that's the verdict of the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy
Research. Perhaps in an effort to improve its credibility among its
supporters on the terraces, it has produced a report on the decline of the
national game.
Too-high ticket prices, fixture schedules dictated by TV companies, the
decline of the small clubs are all the inevitable product of a system that
leaves clubs, players and television fighting their own corner, says the
think-tank.
'Free market policies have ruined our national economy. Now they threaten
our national game,' argue Dan Corry and Paul Williamson. What the game needs
is a 'dose of national planning'. Sounds familiar.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Last orders at a movable feast: Robert Peston examines a
report that criticises a European development bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one talks or knows about this institution.' So said Mrs Paule Dufour to
explain why the Council of Europe's Social Development Fund strayed from its
original purpose - financing projects to help resettle or absorb refugees in
Europe - towards generating profits from money markets and giving generous
rewards to staff.
Sitting in her elegant 19th-century Parisian office, a few hundred yards
from L'Etoile, she said that even when she became president of the fund's
governing body in 1990 she had difficulty obtaining information on its work.
Partly as a result, she commissioned Castel Jacquet Ernst &amp; Young, the
accountancy firm, to carry out a wide-ranging audit of its activities. Its
report, which has not been published but has been obtained by the Financial
Times, is a lesson in how multinational development banks should not be
managed.
Set up in 1956, the social fund, with assets totalling Pounds 10.5bn at the
end of 1992, became a rich gravy train for staff and provided a pleasant
sinecure for the former politicians and officials who comprised its twin
supervisory boards, the governing body and the administrative council.
According to Ernst &amp; Young, the bulk of its loans - which totalled Ecu6.7bn
(Pounds 5.1bn) at the end of 1992 - were made without properly monitoring
where the money was going. There was often no way of telling how borrowers
used the relatively cheap loans. The problem was particularly acute in
Italy.
Because it did not know where money was going, there was also a risk that it
could face unforeseen losses on loans - though Mr Roger Vanden Branden, who
resigned as governor last month, pointed out that to date the repayment
record of borrowers had been good.
But it was in its staff remuneration practices that Ernst &amp; Young says
behaviour was encouraged that ran 'contrary to the ethics which should
govern the professional life of an international official'. Executives were
given big expense allowances without proper checking to ensure expenses were
actually incurred. They were also granted subsidised loans totalling
FFr16.9m (Pounds 1.94m) at a 3 per cent interest rate, but there were no
effective controls to ensure loans were being used as intended for mortgages
on principal residences. The report says some of these loans were used for
property speculation.
Probably the most unorthodox practice was the withdrawal of substantial sums
from the pension fund by executives who had completed 10 years of service
with the social fund, though they remained in office. The main beneficiary
was the governor, Mr Vanden Branden.
But if what the fund did was dubious, Mr Vanden Branden cannot take all the
blame. As he said in a statement to the FT, Ernst &amp; Young does not say that
he broke institutional or pension fund rules. However Ernst &amp; Young lists
examples of rules which were imprecisely drafted and liberally interpreted.
Mr Vanden Branden also said in his statement: 'Management accounts were . .
. approved . . . by the administrative council, which each year commended
the governor (Mr Vanden Branden) for his management.'
In the words of Mrs Catherine Lalumiere, the secretary general of the
Council of Europe (a parallel organisation to the European Union) under
whose umbrella the fund falls, it was a 'child abandoned by its parents'.
What she means is that it was given too much autonomy by its shareholders:
21 Council of Europe members, including France, Germany and Italy but not
the UK.
Perhaps out of embarrassment at their negligent stewardship, the
shareholders did not want public disclosure of the Ernst &amp; Young report
although they have been quietly trying to reform the institution via
representatives on the supervisory boards. But earlier this autumn, rumours
about the report's content circulated at the Council of Europe's
Parliamentary Assembly in Strasbourg and eventually details appeared in the
French newspaper Le Monde.
Soon after came the resignation of Mr Vanden Branden, a Belgian who has been
associated with the fund since 1962 and has been governor since 1979. Mrs
Dufour said she believed he should have left earlier: 'The first lesson to
learn from what happened at the fund is that, in an international
organisation where controls on management are never as strong as in a
national organisation, it is wrong to allow executives to keep their jobs
too long.'
Another lesson is that the responsibilities of the two supervisory boards,
consisting of government appointees, were imprecisely drafted when the fund
was set up. The two boards met no more than a few times a year and in
practice delegated considerable power to Mr Vanden Branden and executives.
Any desire among board members to subject the fund to stricter controls may
have been tempered by the fringe benefits they enjoyed, which were generous
for a public institution. As listed by Ernst &amp; Young, they included liberal
expense allowances for meetings, per diem payments for senior board members,
cash advances and automatic reimbursement of travel expenses at the highest
ticket price.
Until they received the Ernst &amp; Young report, European governments had taken
comfort from the fund's profitability, much of it derived from playing the
international money markets. The fund raises money from money markets which
it then lends to projects that meet its social objectives or invests in
securities and complicated financial derivative instruments, such as swaps
and options. The question raised by the Ernst &amp; Young report is whether the
balance of its activities is tilted too much towards making short-term
profits from financial markets.
Though the shareholders have guaranteed to provide capital resources of
Ecu1.14bn, they have injected only Ecu20m of cash. From this tiny
investment, the fund has generated profits of almost Ecu800m since its
creation, including Ecu109m in 1992 alone. This income is in effect
distributed to the shareholders in the form of special loans at the highly
subsidised interest rate of 1 per cent, well below the fund's normal lending
rate.
Yet despite its profitability, Ernst &amp; Young warns the fund was taking
'significant' risks in generating money market profits which could
'compromise the fund's financial stability in the medium term'.
The fund also departed from the established practice among multinational
development banks of organising an open competitive tendering process among
securities firms when raising money from bond markets. Two lesser-known
German and Swiss banks were regularly awarded the mandate for issuing bonds
on the fund's behalf. 'The principle of no competition is very bad,' said
Mrs Dufour, though she added the fund had been able to raise funds at
competitive rates.
The worst flaws were in the fund's management of staff and in its lending
practices. Though many executives benefited from lax controls over
subsidised loans and expenses claims, Mr Vanden Branden appears to have
profited most, according to Ernst &amp; Young, though he insisted that his
remuneration package and other benefits were worse than for the heads of
comparable development banks.
Ernst &amp; Young gives a catalogue of questionable practices:
In 1991, his undisclosed salary for the whole year was paid in advance at
the start of the year.
His travel expenses of FFr111,314 in 1991 and similar amounts in 1990 and
1989 were reimbursed on the basis of an annual travel expense account filled
out by himself. In 1991, they included seven weekend trips to Brussels, for
some of which no reason was given.
As overseer of the pension fund, he allowed executives to make withdrawals
totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds after completing 10 years of
service. He 'made his 10-year withdrawal in 1989 and since 1990 has indulged
himself with an annual withdrawal (which was FFr865,000 in 1991), made at
the beginning of the year'. The report criticises this policy as a
'compliance breach' which 'hurts the APF's (the pension fund's) portfolio
management, so hurting the interests of other officers'.
He set up representative offices of the social fund in Brussels and Rome
without getting the approval of the administrative council.
In response to these criticisms, Mr Vanden Branden said in his statement
that the 'equilibrium' of the pension fund had not been 'prejudiced' by the
withdrawals.
The bulk of the report concentrates on the fund's drift away from its
original aim of financing schemes providing work and accommodation for
refugees and other displaced persons, or assistance in relocating them. In a
'de facto and unplanned way', according to Ernst &amp; Young, it started to
commit money to many other socially motivated developments, such as general
housing construction projects in Italy, an irrigation scheme in Spain and an
electricity project in Turkey. According to Mrs Dufour, the fund even
financed the construction of a Sheraton Hotel in Milan.
Ernst &amp; Young says that, whatever the nature of the projects, the fund did
not take steps to ensure budgeted costs were reasonable and that the best
construction methods were used. More seriously, it did not employ sufficient
staff to verify the money was being used for the intended purpose - nor did
it receive sufficiently detailed information from applicants to allow
effective monitoring to take place. Ernst &amp; Young comments: 'We believe this
situation is worrying; the sample tested did not show the fund was able,
using the information received from the beneficiaries, to verify that the
loans granted were indeed used during the period from issuance of the funds
to completion of the project for the projects approved.'
A shortage of information on use of funds is most marked on loans to Italy
and Turkey, the two biggest borrowers, which between them have received more
than Ecu4bn from the fund since 1981.
Italian projects benefited from a special exemption such that there was no
monitoring of any loans under Ecu3m dating before January 1992. Ernst &amp;
Young says that 'according to the head of monitoring, the beneficiaries are
unidentifiable, the co-operatives involved are dissolved after completion of
the project and the managing banks are incapable of providing supporting
documents'.
Meanwhile large 'global loans' have been made to the Turkish government  -
Ecu597m in 1991 and 1992 alone - based on a list of approved projects but
without precise allocation of funds to individual schemes. So in effect
these have been additions to Turkey's foreign currency resources - though if
Turkey had tried to raise the funds directly on international markets, the
cost would have been far greater because its credit rating is worse than the
fund's.
Mrs Lalumiere of the Council of Europe said that, for all its apparent
shortcomings, 'more than ever, the fund is useful'. Because of the war in
the former Yugoslavia and the turmoil in the former Soviet Union, Europe is
facing its biggest refugee problem since the creation of the eastern bloc
after the second world war.
She hopes that changes in the fund's rules which come into effect in the new
year will rejuvenate it. Executives are to be subjected to stricter control
by the supervisory boards and an increased emphasis has been placed on the
fund's original purpose of helping refugees and displaced persons. Further
reform of the monitoring procedures for project loans are likely once a
successor to Mr Vanden Branden has been found.
As for Mrs Dufour, her fiercest criticism of the fund is not directed at
what it did in the late 1980s and early 1990s but rather at what it did not
do. Because of its penchant for making short-term profits, it avoided making
loans to parts of Europe where the needs and risks were biggest. Mrs Dufour
said: 'The greatest scandal is that we did not lend a penny to Yugoslavia.'

FT  17 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Hong Kong - the next stage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, will view the end of Sino-British
talks on his democratic reform proposals as double-edged. He has suffered a
decisive setback in his efforts to secure China's acquiescence to broader
democracy before Beijing assumes sovereignty in 1997. But he is now embarked
on the course which, as a report elsewhere in this newspaper suggests, he
might have preferred all along: to allow Hong Kong people to take a hand in
deciding how far they want to go in broadening the electoral franchise. The
problem is that neither he nor they know whether China will accept their
choice, even if it is for limited change.
Mr Patten's efforts to date have served to heighten uncertainty about the
transition to Chinese rule. It is not only the political talks that have
foundered. Sino-British discussions on many practical issues of the
handover, as well as on the financing for the new airport, are also just
about at a standstill. Instead of the closer co-operation which the 1984
Joint Declaration called for during the latter part of the transition
period, there appears to be a widening cultural divide.
Open discussion
This is not to suggest that Mr Patten was wrong to try to broaden the
democratic franchise within the limits imposed by the post-1997 Basic Law -
and to seek to do this with China's agreement. One effect has been to force
open discussion, both in Hong Kong and China, about the true implications of
a 'one country, two systems' approach. It is far better that the wrangling
takes place now than to have sudden, bruising revelations after 1997. If
Hong Kong really is to be allowed to maintain its way of life as the Joint
Declaration promised, its 'high degree of autonomy' must mean something. Mr
Patten has rightly explored its limits.
Now, however, the game has moved on, and Mr Patten is no longer at the
centre of events. The Legislative Council will almost certainly prove less
willing to confront China than he has been. Passage even of the
'non-controversial' package tabled this week may be in doubt, with the
conservative party which favours co-operation with China opting to poll its
membership. If this bill were to run into problems, Mr Patten would have
little chance of getting the meatier parts of his reforms into law. His
Westminster skills will be pitted against the exertion of mighty Chinese
influence. In itself, this may not be unduly damaging. Indeed, it is the
sort of political debate to which a nascent democracy must become
accustomed, even in such constrained circumstances.
Electoral uncertainty
Less desirable is the uncertainty about the eventual fate of the electoral
system which LegCo puts in place. Even if it substantially waters down Mr
Patten's reforms, its decision may still be rejected by China and a new
political system instituted. However, this will not necessarily be the end
for democracy, Hong Kong-style. China has this week reiterated its
commitment to enacting the Basic Law, which sets out specific steps towards
democracy and says: 'The ultimate aim is the election of all the members of
the Legislative Council by universal suffrage.' Unless events prove
otherwise, these Chinese commitments can be taken at face value.
Many Hong Kong people - investors in particular - are doing just that. The
stock and property markets have shown great resilience in the face of the
Sino-British confrontation. The economy behaves more and more as though it
were already part of China.
What cannot yet be guaranteed is that it will continue to enjoy such
uninterrupted growth through the handover. It will only do so if the nuts
and bolts - the legal and judicial framework, arrangements for the civil
service, and the other features that buttress Hong Kong's economic success -
are in place before 1997. With China and Britain now apparently destined for
permanent disagreement on political issues, it is ever more important for
both sides to focus on these practical arrangements. If only for this
reason, they will have to talk. And although the British approach has
suffered a reverse, the UK cannot wash its hands of Hong Kong. lf serious
uncertainties about the future are aroused, it will have to reconsider the
issue of passports.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Leading Article: The west and Zhirinovsky
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If any good comes out of the electoral triumph of the ultra-nationalist
Russian right in last weekend's elections, it will be because it finally
focuses the minds of Russia's reformers and their western backers. For,
while the reform parties squabbled, while President Boris Yeltsin remained
aloof and the western governments kept their distance, Vladimir Zhirinovsky
was hard at work. He cleverly played on the electorate's fears about the
threat of unemployment, rising lawlessness and loss of self-esteem.
What should the west and its institutions do next? It was bad enough for
International Monetary Fund officials to monitor progress and lend money
when a supposedly pro-reformist government was in place. But now, with the
complexion of the post-election government still unknown and the president's
commitment to future reform uncertain, the dangerous temptation is to wait
and see. What they should do is to act.
First, they can recognise that the rules of the reform game have changed.
The grave threat of a further boost to extremist politics if reform is
perceived to make things worse over the next year means that a substantial
rise in open unemployment is now politically intolerable. The standard IMF
strategy of stabilisation, withdrawal of subsidies to state industries and
the establishment of a social safety net to catch the casualties is now too
risky for anyone other than the most apolitical reformer to contemplate.
Indeed, anything which even smells of an IMF-run austerity programme is
almost certainly off Mr Yeltsin's agenda.
Pointed criticism
US vice-president Al Gore has already got this message. In Moscow,
yesterday, his pointed criticism of the failure of IMF officials to be
sensitive to the effects of harsh budget cuts on individual Russians
suggested a sharp change in western rhetoric. But, as US Treasury officials
will well understand, it is important that the west does not throw out the
baby with the bathwater. The IMF may be a convenient scapegoat for lack of
progress so far. But to suggest, as Mr Gore also did, that Russia should
abandon rapid reform is badly misguided.
Too little reform, not too much, is the reason for the persistently
miserable performance of the Russian economy over the past year. Rapid
inflation remains a significant obstacle to private sector expansion and
foreign investment as well as a tax on Russian citizens. Lack of progress on
land and financial sector reform are other impediments. The IMF can be
criticised for taking an over-bureaucratic approach to conditionality and
for failing to provide the Russians with sufficient technical support. But
it is the Russian government that must take most of the blame for the lack
of progress.
Fascist advance
Western leaders cannot afford, for their own security as well as Russia's,
to allow Mr Yeltsin to abandon the reformist road. Without action to slow
credit creation, hyperinflation is inevitable. Without structural reform,
the growth of new private employment will remain stunted. Without a legal
system, the power of illegal racketeers will grow. In short, without rapid
reform the conditions for a further fascist advance will emerge.
The west can help stabilisation to occur and reform to progress without the
kind of open unemployment seen in Poland since 1989. It can do so by
enabling the government to replace inflationary bank credits to loss-making
industries with non-inflationary western credits. These should be released
through a new G7 agency, rather than via the IMF.
These credits should be made conditional on market-oriented reform as well
as continued stabilisation and, as far as possible, they should be
time-limited and linked to restructuring of specific enterprises. If China's
success contains a lesson for Russia, it is not - as Mr Gore appears to
believe - that gradualism works but, instead, that radical reform to
encourage the growth of the non-state sector is consistent with apparently
wasteful but politically essential subsidies for inefficient state
industries.
The west has not yet had time to gauge fully the implications of Mr
Zhirinovsky's success. But the G7 has no alternative but to act while it
can.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Defective cure for unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DON PITMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Richard Layard's diagnosis (Personal View: 'An offer the
unemployed cannot refuse', December 7) is that unemployment is likely to be
high if benefits are available indefinitely, and his cure is to draft the
unemployed into the workforce at no cost to the employer.
His diagnosis depends on statistics that show long-term unemployment in the
US and Japan at 1 per cent or less compared with 5 per cent in the European
Union and his assertion that this is due to the cessation of benefits in the
US and Japan after six months.
His diagnosis is defective because:
1. In the US, men do not qualify for unemployment benefit after six months.
So, after that period, jobless men have little incentive to describe
themselves as actively looking for work and thus be counted as unemployed
(Economic Eye, by Edward Balls, December 6).
2. In Japan the social security fund is available indefinitely (and is
generous compared with Britain's system). The reasons for low unemployment
in Japan are that there is work for anyone who is willing and able to do it,
and the Japanese have a great reluctance to accept state help, and will
therefore hurry back to work as quickly as possible.
3) He takes no account of the level of benefit available (which in Britain
is so low as to drive most recipients to despair).
However, not only is his diagnosis wrong. His cure would dump the employed
on to the dole queue to make way for the slave labour introduced by the cure
itself, and at the same time subsidise the employer while promoting
inefficiency.
The real problem is competitiveness and the cure lies with those in work,
not with those denied it.

Sir, I was more than moved by Michael Grade's piece (Personal View, December
14) advocating more competition in commercial television when, as head of
Channel 4, he is confronted with the proposed mergers in Channel 3.
Mr Grade is, of course, a hereditary placeman of the British television
establishment, which has fought tooth and nail against enhanced competition
and choice for the last 25 years.
Does Michael Grade's belated and self-serving conversion now mean that he
will unequivocally support and press for the Independent Television
Commission to advertise Channel 5, which would be a competitor to Channel 4?

FT  17 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Crest not more costly for private
investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr I D SAVILLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr J D Whittle thinks (Letters, December 11/12) that it is generally
accepted that the Crest share settlement system will disadvantage the
private investor while increasing his costs of dealing. I do not think
either point of this view is well-founded.
Crest will improve conditions for the private investor, by helping to
facilitate a more efficient and liquid wholesale market, and by bringing
settlement conditions in the UK into line with the best international
practice.
Costs will be sharply reduced by getting rid of much of the very large
volumes of paper that have to be processed in the City and at registrars,
and there will be significant reductions in risk in the settlement process.
These benefits improve the attractiveness of London as a financial centre,
and the private investor will benefit from this because his shares will be
traded on a more liquid and efficiently priced market.
Moreover, I believe that when Crest is introduced the cost of dealings for
the private investor need be no more than today, even where the private
investor chooses to retain share certificates. (The cost will, of course, be
lower if he chooses to participate fully in Crest by giving up his
certificate.) This is because the 'wholesale' part of the transaction,
between the investor's broker and a market maker, should be cheaper than
today, while the paper-based part should remain very much like today's
arrangements.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Nightmare on Marsham St: A welcome change of address for the
UK environment department
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The customers in Sabrina's sandwich bar, just across the road, were
unanimous: 'It's the pits,' volunteered motorcyle messenger Mr Jason Webb.
'It's a dump,' claimed legal clerk Mr Stanley Singer.
Mr Webb and Mr Singer are in good company. According to Mr John Gummer,
environment secretary: 'It is staggeringly and revoltingly offensive. It is
ugly, unsympathetic, unhygienic and unsafe.'
Mr Ian Clegg, spokesman for the four trade unions that work in it, has no
argument with Mr Gummer: 'It's the most depressing place I've ever worked
in. Good riddance.'
The target of their scorn is 2 Marsham Street, Westminster, the crumbling,
concrete monolith which, since completion in 1971, has led an ironic
double-life as headquarters for the Department of the Environment and one of
London's best-known, least-loved eyesores.
Now, after the long-awaited announcement of plans to relocate the 3,000
people who walk its dark, identical corridors, the end is nigh for the
650,000 sq ft office complex known locally as 'faulty towers'.
Faced with estimated refurbishment costs of at least Pounds 50m, ministers
have decided that it will be reduced to rubble in 1998. Left behind will be
a five-acre site worth about Pounds 25m, and questions over why it was
allowed to be built in the first place.
The weather-stained building, which also houses the Department of Transport,
has lacked friends almost since the day it was designed in the 1960s by Mr
Eric Bedford, chief architect to the old Ministry of Public Building and
Works.
The ministry was to become part of the DoE, created at the start of Sir
Edward Heath's premiership in 1970.
Its three, 200ft tower blocks breach a historic skyline noted for
architectural landmarks such as Westminster Abbey and the Palace of
Westminster. The lifts that serve them are unreliable and slow, and stop
short of the top floor.
Last month, as he went to tell staff the details of the proposed relocation,
Mr Gummer was trapped in a lift for 20 minutes: 'Its number was 666 - the
mark of the devil,' he recollects with a wry smile.
Mr Gummer, like successive environment secretaries before him, has welcomed
visitors to his 16th-floor suite, explainingthat their viewpoint is the only
one in central London not rudely interrupted by 2 Marsham Street.
Independent Television News omitted the windswept tower blocks from the
classy, computer-generated views of central London that introduce its
bulletins.
The building's visual shortcomings are matched by its deteriorating physical
state. Outside, green netting hangs from scaffolding to catch the shards of
concrete that occasionally break free from pre-cast wall panels to expose
rotting reinforcing steel; windows remain partially open because they no
longer shut.
Civil servants on the south side of the complex can enjoy dramatic summer
sunsets over Battersea while they fry in office temperatures of 30'C; in the
winter, it can take the struggling boilers 48 hours to warm up the building.
The DoE's next home will be in nearby Victoria, after a combination of cost
considerations and threatened insurrection among staff ended the dream of
former environment secretary Mr Michael Heseltine to move it east to
Docklands.
The new headquarters, incorporating the ultimate in 'green' credentials,
will attempt to make amends for a building that has lasted barely 25 years
and which, with hindsight, should never have left the drawing board.
But Marsham Street was not out of place in its time, merely another
utilitarian statement of the modern movement in architecture, which has left
behind it equally unpopular and discredited buildings elsewhere in London
and other provincial cities.
Mr Bedford employed state-of-the-art industrialised methods to fulfil his
brief of housing, as quickly as possible and at minimum cost, the maximum
number of people under one ministerial roof.
He had problems from the start. Massive reinforced concrete structures
already filled much of the former gas works site and were too big to be
broken up; they partly dictated the final, user-unfriendly design of the new
building.
The Pounds 5.5m construction contract - carried out by Bernard Sunley, now
part of Lonrho, and M J Gleeson, still a family-run, quoted construction
company - employed a pioneering building system designed specifically for
the large-scale construction project. The simple, repetitious lay-out
permitted mass-production of many construction components on site. But
aesthetics, along with the need to create a practical, working environment
which fitted comfortably into its surroundings, were given short shrift.
'The building is so remarkably hard to use,' says one senior civil servant.
Westminster City Council, which regarded any building as an improvement on a
derelict gas works site, nodded through the plans, and building work began
in 1965. But completion was delayed by two years because of a wave of
prolonged strikes which hit the construction industry.
Mr Gummer, who says he would like to 'push the plunger' on demolition day,
believes Marsham Street is a symbol of 1960s arrogance. 'It was in many ways
an unpleasant period, which did not believe it had anything to learn from
previous generations. It was brash and insensitive and this building stuck
up two - or should I say three? - fingers to everyone.'
According to Mr Clegg, in Marsham Street's first-floor union office: 'People
have had to endure deteriorating working conditions which are simply not
accepted in the private sector. The building rubs in that staff have not
been the highest priority. It is dehumanising.'
This time, ministers and civil servants are hopeful of something better. The
new Eland House offices to be built in Bressenden Place, close to Victoria
station, will incorporate a catalogue of fashionable architectural and
environmental specifications, from the 'thermal buffers' of its double atria
to ozone-friendly refrigerants and plentiful cycle bays.
Already, however, the unions are hesitant about proposals for large,
open-plan floors, which mean reliance on artificial lighting and air
conditioning, which some believe can contribute to workplace illnesses. This
time round, they want - though do not expect - to be consulted about more
than curtains and carpets.
The DoE says it has negotiated a 25-year lease on Eland House from Land
Securities, Britain's biggest private commercial landlord. Whether or not
today's architectural fashions prove more enduring, there is at least an
expectation that the building will outlive the DoE's new lease.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Deflator paints wrong picture of
export volumes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr N H DIMSDALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his Economic Viewpoint (December 9), Samuel Brittan comments
favourably on a recently published article by Peter Sinclair in the Oxford
Review of Economic Policy, where export values have been deflated by a
general price index, the gross domestic product deflator, to calculate a
measure of export volume. There is little justification for the use of this
deflator when an index of export prices is available. Its use could give
rise to a significant distortion compared with the appropriate deflator. The
fact that the inappropriate deflator makes a big difference must make one
suspicious of the final result.
If a measure of the purchasing power of exports is required, as Sinclair
proposes in his article, it could readily be derived by adjusting the
correctly computed export volume index by a measure of the terms of trade
such as the ratio of export to import prices. The resulting indicator would
not involve any breach of the conventions of index numbers, unlike the crude
practice reported in the article.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW GLYN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan ('Two-way switch in the world economy', December 9)
reports with approval Peter Sinclair's figures purporting to show that there
was a radical slowdown in the growth of the volume of trade for the G7
countries in the 1980s.
The table (right) shows why deflating the value of G7 exports by the gross
domestic product deflator (in contrast to the normal procedure where the
price index of exports is used) suggests that most of the slow-down in the
growth of world trade happened after 1979, not after 1973 as we had hitherto
assumed.
Export prices rose faster than GDP prices over the period 1973-79 because
energy and commodities, whose prices rose especially rapidly, comprise a
much higher proportion of exports (as intermediate inputs and final sales)
than of G7 GDP (which excludes any imported energy and materials component).
This exceptional development obviously boosted the value of world trade. But
why should we regard this as boosting its volume.
Sinclair says his measure shows the 'real value of export receipts, defined
in terms of the general basket of goods that its firms, households and
public authorities buy' (Oxford Review of Economic Policy, Autumn 1993,
p116). This is inaccurate since the GDP deflator excludes the value of
imports which comprise a proportion of the purchases of all domestic
sectors. But in any case this is a measure of the real incomes of the export
sector. This may be interesting but it is not a measure of real output. If
Samuel Brittan's or Dr Sinclair's new computer is half the price (in
relation to the GDP deflator) of their old one, would they describe it as
only half a computer?

FT  17 DEC 93 / More like a prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heaven alone knows what the Downing Street declaration will do for Ireland,
north and south. Will it bring peace? A lasting settlement? We have to wait
for prolonged silence, or a bomb blast, to give us the beginnings of an
answer. Yesterday's statement by the president of Sinn Fein, Mr Gerry Adams,
was redolent of peaceful promise, but takes us no further. Meanwhile it is
open season for wishful thinkers. Optimists can let their fancy flow free,
down to the speeches by the British and Irish prime ministers when,
following Mandela/de Klerk, they collect their Nobels. Sceptics, or those
who harbour pet Ulster theories, can predict doom and disaster. Armchair
strategists can set up their imaginary battlefields and pit 'loyalist'
terrorists against their IRA opponents.
Patience, patience. There is no telling what will happen, and therefore no
way of estimating the eventual effect on the standing, before their present
electorates and in the eye of history, of Mr Albert Reynolds and Mr John
Major. All that can be said today is that the taoiseach and the prime
minister have shown courage and imagination. Against the odds, they have
co-authored a document that allows for a united Ireland while obliging those
who seek one to persuade a majority of the people of Ulster to vote for it.
This was accomplished by rewriting, in the language of the nationalists,
Britain's long-standing promise that it will protect the unionists.
Both leaders have done well. This should be acknowledged without quibble or
qualification. Mr Major in particular sounded more like a prime minister
when he spoke in the Commons on Wednesday than he has since Britain was
ejected from the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 and he lost his
authority. This time he had the best house since the Gulf war, with members
listening intently to his every word, breaking concentration only to
approve. His manner had become less hesitant, his voice less uncertain. This
was, for once, a politician at ease with himself.
Take, as a single example, his response to Rev Ian Paisley, who had spoken
of people being 'slaughtered, butchered and murdered' by the IRA. His
constituents, said Mr Paisley, looked on the Downing Street declaration as a
'sell-out act of treachery'. With rare passion, Mr Major turned on the
Democratic Unionist and replied that he wished to make sure that there was
no more bloodshed. Politicians had to have the courage to address the
problem. 'I am prepared to do that. If the honourable gentleman believes
that I should not, he does not understand the responsibilities of the prime
minister of the United Kingdom.'
We have, in short, seen the prime minister rise to an important occasion. In
handling Northern Ireland his most effective qualities have come to the
fore. Major the negotiator, he of Maastricht, saw to the detailed haggling.
Major the whip, he who has survived in spite of a dwindling parliamentary
majority, has ensured that most susceptibilities were catered for in the
drafting. Major the chancer, he of the hard Ecu and the safe havens, proved
willing to throw the dice in Ireland. Let us set aside cynicism, and grant
that these characteristics have been enhanced on this occasion by a proper
sense of the responsibilities of his office.
The prime minister will be strengthened if a wearily cynical electorate is
equally charitable. His weakness arises from the disrespect in which he is
held by natural Conservative voters. On Wednesday morning, before the
declaration on Ulster was published, Mr Major was the least popular prime
minister since polling began. Rebuilding a reputation in such circumstances
takes time. It cannot be achieved by a single outstanding performance on a
powerful Wed-nesday afternoon. More is required. Events in general have to
be in his favour. The prime minister may be given his due on Ulster, while
yet suffering the fate of his predecessor. To take a more exalted example,
remember what happened to Winston Churchill after he led Britain to victory
in the second world war.
That said, the favourable news is beginning to pile up. The Uruguay Round of
the Gatt negotiations has been completed, setting the markets further
towards the stratosphere. The prime minister intimated yesterday that Europe
in general and Britain in particular would gain more from trade
liberalisation than most of the other participants. Downing Street's role in
helping the process forward was subtly suggested. Mr Major knows that the
performance of the economy is paramount. On Wednesday the latest monthly
indicator showed the annual rate of inflation still at 1.4 per cent.
Yesterday we saw a further fall in unemployment.
The Conservatives in Parliament have continued to hold steady on other
matters, as they have done since the prime minister concluded his devil's
pact with the right at the party conference in October. A carefully crafted
Queen's speech, avoiding difficult legislation, and a strategy of limiting
the length of time Parliament sits, have helped reduce the number of 'Tories
split' headlines.
These developments could have been designed to create a feeling that perhaps
the government is not doing so badly after all. Mr Major's job was in some
immediate danger during the summer. That crisis has passed. The sense that
nobody is in charge of the administration has to some extent been countered
by the wizardry of Mr Kenneth Clarke. The chancellor's recent Budget may
have added to the March Budget's imposition of the greatest tax increase
anybody could remember, but it demonstrated control, 'grip', command. Mr
Clarke's opinion after Budget day was that its positive political effect
would not be reflected in public sentiment for a year or so. That may still
be true.
We have now had three years of Mr Major as prime minister. He has been flat
on his face much of the time, but he did win in April 1992, against many
predictions. The next opportunities to vote will come at local council
elections in May and elections to the European parliament in June. The
conventional wisdom in October was that he had about a year in which to
restore his and his party's popularity, or face a challenge to his
leadership. He has made a good start to that year of trial. A triumph in
Ireland would, if it came, take his rehabilitation further.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Arts: Lully's 'Roland' - Opera in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing in France's operatic life has given greater cause for cheer in
recent years than the rediscovery of its baroque heritage. The principal
beneficiary has been Lully: first came the ground-breaking Atys at the
Opera-Comique in 1987, then a project by the Theatre des Champs-Elysees to
stage his three tales of medieval chivalry - Amadis, Roland and Armide.
That trilogy has just been completed with the first performances for more
than two centuries of Roland, in a production which Paris is sharing with
Lisbon, Montpellier and Lyon. The title role is sung by Jose van Dam, an
acknowledged master of French style. The conductor is Rene Jacobs, one of
several rising stars in period instrument performance on the continent. And
the producer - a Belgian like the other two - is Gilbert Deflo, fresh from a
string of successes in Monteverdi. Why, then, was Roland such a flop?
It is hard to blame the work itself. Premiered at Versailles in 1685 in the
presence of Louis XIV, who had chosen the subject, Roland is based on
Ariosto's epic poem Orlando furioso, which was to inspire numerous other
composers after Lully (including Handel, whose opera comes to the Theatre
des Champs-Elysees in February). This was the tenth tragedie lyrique on
which Lully and his librettist Philippe Quinault collaborated, and their
experience shows.
The libretto is a masterpiece of compression. Roland woos Angelique, who
prefers Medor; his love unrequited, Roland vents his anger, is put to sleep
by a fairy and wakes up calmer, wiser and determined to seek glory in
defence of his country. The theme - tailored to suit the mood of the French
court - is the eternal conflict between love and reason, dressed in the
clothes of crusading knights and oriental queens. The only obvious weakness
is structural: Roland does not appear in the first act, is overshadowed by
Angelique and Medor in the next two and dominates acts four and five.
Whether the music matches the quality of Lully's other mature stage works
was hard to tell from this performance. It sounded less good, but judgment
was heavily influenced by the nondescript staging. William Orlandi confined
his decor to a series of anonymous pictorial drop-cloths, overhung by wave
upon wave of puffy cloud. No attempt was made to recreate the effects of
baroque machinery or provide a sense of spectacle. The principals gestured
vacuously. The chorus, dressed in wishy-washy apricot robes, adopted static,
doll-like poses. The dances were anodyne.
In the pit, Concerto Koln played with precision and textural refinement  -
but this was more than offset by Jacobs' strict tempos and unyielding
rhythms, robbing the recitatives of their supple expressiveness. Only in the
gentle airs and symphonies of the final act  - which must rank among Lully's
most noble music - did Jacobs begin to relax.
The other major problem was the undercasting of three major roles. Ann
Panagulias, who made her name as Lulu in San Francisco, lacked the
histrionic and vocal opulence for Angelique. Harry Nicoll, in the
haute-contre part of Medor, sounded puny and looked effeminate. Claire Brua
turned the benevolent fairy Logistille into a dull figurine.
Not all was gloom. The words were audible. Themire, Angelique's confidante,
was sung by the statuesque Veronique Gens, whose handsome low soprano
deserves wider hearing. Rufus Muller's Tersandre livened up the pastoral
divertissement of the act four wedding party. And despite an unflattering
red wig and costume, Jose van Dam sang with all the conviction he could
muster. Here at last was evidence of Lully's seamless fusion of verse and
music; here was evidence of psychological development, as Roland's hope gave
way to despair. But Van Dam could not carry the show alone. Perhaps the
merits of Roland will be more obvious when the promised recording is issued
next spring.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Arts: Artists drawn to the club - The continuing popularity
of the London Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The artists' exhibiting society has been a feature of the British art world
ever since the founding of the Royal Academy. The essential unclubbability
of the artist was always largely a myth - egocentric yes, but not
unclubbable - and how else was he to set his work against that of his peers
and before the public?
The Academy set the pattern and, by its very success, made the proliferation
of junior rivals inevitable. Up they sprang through the 19th century, the
Royal Society of This and the Royal Association of That, all soon to be
reacted against in their turn.
Some groups, especially the more experimental, proved all too disputatious
and ephemeral - Wyndham Lewis's Vorticists before the first world war, for
example, and the Seven &amp; Five Society after. But two have proved as
resilient as any: the New English Art Club, set up by Whistler, Wilson Steer
and their cronies at the turn of the century which openly cocked a snook at
the Academy; and the London Group, born on the break-up of the Camden Town
Group in the autumn of 1913.
Eighty years on, the list of sometime members and exhibitors with the London
Group is almost a roll-call of British modernism, from Sickert, Lewis and
Epstein, through Bomberg and the Nash brothers, Spencer, John, Gertler, Bell
and Fry, to Hepworth, Hitchens, Moore and Piper and so on to Heron, Pasmore,
Auerbach, Rego, Frink, Davie and Bellany in more recent times. Even so, it
is hard to say quite why the Group remains important. It has had its moments
of near-terminal crisis, and long fallow periods, and yet still its
disappearance would be a real loss. Happily, any such outcome now seems
remote.
The London Group is run by artists for their own benefit and interest, quite
independent of the judgment of important dealers and museum curators and
their view of what is saleable and what significant. Conceptual
installations may still command international exhibitions and awards, but
painting, on this evidence, is still a resilient and healthy plant which no
narrow critical correctness will stifle.
Such is the plethora of choice and opportunity facing the young artist these
days, with generous prize exhibitions and an enormously expanded acreage of
gallery wallspace available, that the kind of opportunity the London Group
represents is too easily undervalued and overlooked. Thirty years ago, when
I was a student myself, its annual open-submission exhibitions gave young
artists pretty well the only chance they had of getting work onto a public
wall in the company of their peers. And of them all, it was with the London
Group that we most wished to show because of the distinction of its members,
the rigour of its selection and the knowledge that one's work really was to
be submitted to the judgment of one's peers.
So it still is - and the approbation of one's fellow artists is still the
most gratifying. Lately, after wandering for a while, the London Group seems
to have found a home at the Barbican. The curving Concourse Gallery is not
the easiest of spaces but, used well, it is impressive and this 80th
celebratory show is as well-chosen and hung as any of its recent occupants.
No open show can ever be better than its submission, but the Group evidently
still attracts a strong professional entry. The selection is properly
catholic, setting abstraction against figuration of all kinds, and trusting
the strength and quality of the particular work to hold its own in the
company. It would be invidious to pick out names other than as typical of
the whole, but I do recommend Ray Atkins, Gus Cummings, Adrian Bartlett,
John Copnall, Trica Gillman, Albert Irvin, Anthony Whishaw, Stan Smith and
Ken Oliver among the members and, of the outsiders, Shanti Panchal, Georgina
Hunt, Susan Hawker and Mark Dunford.
Both Graham Sutherland and Edward Burra showed with the London Group in
their time, and it is by a nice coincidence that both are celebrated in
current exhibitions, if only for another week. The Sutherland, at Bernard
Jacobson, is a show of real distinction, a choice group of comparatively
small paintings of landscape and organic forms. They represent the artist on
his surest ground and in his strongest period, most especially the 1940s and
'50s, with a handful of his pre-war prints for good measure. The show has
been extended beyond its advertised run until Christmas Eve.
The Burra show at Lefevre is more of a curiosity but none the less engaging
for that. Given the incidental and picaresque preoccupations of his early
work, in particular the louche bar and cafe life of the Marseilles
waterfront of the early 1930s, it seems no more than obvious that he should
have worked for the theatre. The only surprise, on the strength of these
remarkably lively and witty sets of costume designs for various productions
of the 1930s and '40s, is that he was not working all the time. My own
favourites are the figures for Carmen, at Covent Garden in 1946, but from
Rio Grande of 1931 to Don Quixote of 1949, all have their considerable charm
and quality.
The London Group's 80th Open Exhibition: Concourse Gallery, Barbican Centre,
EC2, until January 7. Graham Sutherland: Bernard Jacobson Gallery, 14a
Clifford Street W1, until December 24. Costume Designs by Edward Burra:
Lefevre Gallery, 30 Bruton Street W1, until December 21.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Arts: The Arts Council tries to keep things sweet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
England's arts companies discovered yesterday how much subsidy they will
receive from the Arts Council in 1994-95 - and for most of them the news was
better than anticipated. Despite receiving a cut of Pounds 3.2m, or 1.7 per
cent, in its grant from the government, the council, with its usual sleight
of hand, has given most of its clients same again funding next year.
So Covent Garden (which still takes in Birmingham Royal Ballet) is frozen at
Pounds 19.5m; the ENO at Pounds 11.65m; the National Theatre at Pounds
11.16m; and the RSC at Pounds 8.47m. Since all these companies must have
been planning on a small reduction in grant they should be marginally
relieved. It is the same across the board. The South Bank Centre gets Pounds
13.4m; English National Ballet Pounds 3.6m; Manchester Royal Exchange Pounds
1.3m; Opera North, Pounds 3.8m, and on and on.
There are a few rogue payments. Following through its declared, and
unpopular, aim of boosting contemporary dance and the visual arts, the
council has given Dance Umbrella a 20 per cent uplift to Pounds 175,000;
Rambert gets 35 per cent more at Pounds 1.2m; and Shobana Jeyasingh, flush
with Pounds 100,000 as the Prudential Awards winner, enjoys 34 per cent more
from the council at Pounds 170,000. Michael Clark receives his first Pounds
100,000.
In the visual arts, the Whitechapel has a 6.8 per cent improvement to Pounds
471,000; the Photographers Gallery almost a 13 per cent uplift at Pounds
352,000; and the Serpentine, which is threatened with an outrageous increase
in its rent from the Royal Parks, is bolstered with almost 9 per cent more,
at Pounds 248,000.
There is the odd casualty: principally Glyndebourne Touring, and the
Regional Arts Boards, which fund thousands of small arts groups, are
suffering a reduction in grants of up to 4.5 per cent. But the council has
done its bit to keep the arts going through 1994 when falling box office
income, reduced sponsorship and squeezed local authority funding will make
survival difficult.
The council found the money by cutting Pounds 2m from its Pounds 14m budget
for new projects and schemes, especially in the theatre. This is bad news
for touring drama companies, many of which might now close. As secretary
general Anthony Everitt said yesterday, 'the aim is to protect the basic
infra-structure of arts organisations throughout the country'.
By this clever package the council has gone a little way towards recovering
some of the massive loss of face and confidence it suffered through its
mishandling of the funding of the London orchestras. On Wednesday it
confirmed that all four would receive virtually identical grants next year -
a complete climbdown from its aim to axe two and create two super
orchestras.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Arts: Me &amp; Mamie O'Rourke - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were already two first-class American plays showing in London: David
Mamet's Oleanna at the Duke of York's and Tony Kushner's duo, Millennium
Approaches and Perestroika at the Royal National Theatre. Out of the blue
comes another: Me &amp; Mamie O'Rourke at the Strand is the most intriguing and
straight-forwardly enjoyable of the lot.
Mary Agnes Donoghue's piece has Hollywood written all over it, which is not
surprising since all her previous work has been for the cinema - Paradise
and Beaches, for examples. On stage, it is not the glamour, multi-scene
changing and technological brilliance of Hollywood that stand out, but
rather the sheer hard work that goes into short, terse dialogue that can be
witty and touching at the same time. Me &amp; Mamie has only one set, designed
by Ultz, and the classical unities are observed throughout.
Ms Donoghue has achieved something else. She has written a provocative play
that will not offend anyone, except perhaps militant feminists. Never
underestimate that talent if you want an audience. Ms Donoghue raises
questions, mainly about the role of women, without telling you what to
think. She never rants, she keeps her sense of humour in adverse
circumstances, and there is not the slightest descent into American
sentimentality.
Two women dominate the stage, so much so that it is hard to think of another
play where a pair of females are in command for so long. Louise (Jennifer
Saunders) is the fairly fed-up wife of an unemployed architect who wants to
knock down their house in Los Angeles in protest, he says, against middle
class respectability. Gradually he does so, though without any greater
theatrical ostentation than the dropping of the odd brick and mortar. Louise
draws the line at the hacking out of her favourite, imitation Adams,
fireplace.
Back in the basement, where all the dialogue takes place, Louise talks to
her friend Bibi (Dawn French). Should they, they wonder, have a shot at
lesbianism? 'We'll have to get a bit drunker first.' They try, they fail,
but the experience does not end in tears. Where this scene scores
theatrically is that it is not over-explicit. Neither of them takes off many
clothes, hardly more than a pair of boots. It scores intellectually because
they realise they are getting nowhere, but it was still worth trying. Their
simple conclusion is: 'Why can't a man be more like a woman?'
The environment is highly intelligent. There are educated Californians who
believe that learning should go on long after school. No form of therapy is
unknown to them. Bibi is taking a doctorate in animal behaviour; she is also
 -as demonstrated by her actions on stage, shaving carrots and making soup
while she talks - an accomplished cook. Louise is working quietly in her
basement on designer bullet-proof vests and, being set in LA, there is
always the possibility of an earthquake underneath. The suitably fast
direction of the one-liners is by Robert Allan Ackerman.

Hugh Thompson and Phil Loftus, two London paparazzi, are the subject of
today's Short Stories (8.00 C4). They are the ones who got the photograph of
Joan Collins looking dowdy in a head scarf, a picture which earned them
Pounds 8,000. But since they have to turn up just after first light to get a
front row spot for an evening premiere, perhaps the job is not quite the
doddle it may appear.
There was something uniquely charming about the series A Victorian Kitchen
Garden. BBC2's attempt to keep the bandwagon rolling with The Wartime
Kitchen And Garden is nowhere near as successful. It has its moments, but
feels contrived, and where the previous series was concerned with an age
that is entirely lost, the present series is about a period which millions
still remember (8.30 BBC2). All Or Nothing At All is a cut above the sort of
drama we are coming to expect from ITV. Hugh Laurie, normally seen in
partnership with Stephen Fry, is impressive as a compulsive gambler who
longs to make all his friends happy by earning them a fortune (9.00 ITV).

FT  17 DEC 93 / Technology: Blocks on the superhighway - A warning that the
US communications industry could be strangled by red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Excessive government regulation could put a road block on the 'information
superhighway', the US Council on Competitiveness, an independent group of US
industry executives, academics and labour leaders, warns in a new report on
communications competition policy issued yesterday.
'Just as the nation is poised to deliver a seamless web of communications
and information products and services, we find ourselves stymied by a
tangled web of regulations and public policies,' the report says.
The vision of multi-media information, communications and interactive
entertainment services distributed on high-speed networks is spurring a
frenzy of mergers and alliances which is reshaping the US communications
industry.
Cable television, telephone, broadcasting, computing, publishing, wireless
communications and power companies are currently rapidly converging as new
technologies create overlapping markets.
As this industry fusion takes place, US regulators and legislators are
struggling to keep pace. Next month, the Clinton administration, which has
made the creation of an advanced 'National Information Infrastructure' the
central element of its technology policy, is scheduled to publish proposals
for a new Communications Act.
This landmark legislation, drafted by an inter-agency team headed by vice
president Al Gore, will establish new 'rules of the road' for the
information superhighway. Industry leaders hope it will also dismantle the
restrictions and regulations that provide US regional telephone companies
and cable TV operators with local market monopolies while preventing them
from directly competing with one another.
The Council report states: 'The National Information Infrastructure will
only develop fully if competition can flourish at all levels. It is
imperative that industry and government focus on removing obstacles to
competition in the immediate future.'
The Council has achieved a consensus among key industry factions which are
often on opposite sides of regulatory issues. These include long-distance
telephone companies such as AT&amp;T, regional telephone companies such as
Pacific Bell and Nynex, and cable TV companies such as TCI and Viacom.
'We are all agreed that everyone should be able to compete in any part of
the communications business,' says John Young, retired chief executive of
Hewlett-Packard and co-chairman of the Council's 21st century information
infrastructure project. 'The question is what are the transition rules that
can get you from regulated monopolies to open competition.'
To enlarge competition, the Council recommends the 'unbundling of essential
services' by all communications providers, including regional telephone
companies. This would encourage new entrants into the market by enabling
them, for example, to make use of existing networks and switching equipment.
At the same time, the Council recommends dominant existing communications
companies should be given greater flexibility in determining prices for
their services.
Council members also agreed that all service providers should share the cost
of providing 'universal service' at minimal prices, a key tenet of the
administration's policy. Currently, local telephone companies provide basic
local telephone services at minimal prices. Typically, the phone companies
subsidise these by charging higher prices for business services.
'If some Teleport comes in and wants to compete in just the business market,
they are going to have to contribute' to the cost of universal service,
Young explains.
The Council also agreed on the contentious issue of allowing regulated
service providers to enter new markets. Regional telephone companies, for
example, are prohibited from entering the long-distance telephone service
market and from providing video programming.
Council members differed strongly, however, on whether new competitors
should be allowed to achieve a specified share of an established provider's
market before restrictions on entering new businesses are lifted.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Technology: Europe switches over to digital TV - Andrew Hill
explains why the political fizz has gone out of HDTV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago, a fierce political and technological argument about the future
of the European strategy to develop advanced, cinema-quality television
raged between European ministers.
Strong words were exchanged - particularly between Britain, which was
blocking funding for high-definition television (HDTV), and its EC partners.
The issue was even discussed informally by prime ministers and presidents
during last December's Edinburgh summit.
Since then, the political fizz has gone out of the issue. This month, the
same telecoms ministers who promised to fight to the final TV set to defend
certain HDTV transmission standards, passed a resolution supporting new
initiatives to develop digital television - a more versatile technology than
the analogue systems originally backed by Europe. The words 'high
definition' were not even mentioned in the ministers' final communique.
The change of tack follows June's meeting of telecoms ministers, at which
Britain finally agreed to back a much-diluted plan for Ecu228m (Pounds 174m)
of European Union funding to promote wide-screen television services over
the next four years. The plan, unlike the original Ecu850m proposal of the
European Commission, is not linked to particular satellite transmission
standards. Indeed, the latest ministerial meeting laid the groundwork for
the rewriting of a 1991 directive so as to remove most references to
mandatory standards.
This does not mean that HDTV has been abandoned completely. But in the
medium term, the Commission and the ministers have recognised that digital
television of standard or enhanced quality offers greater opportunities to
the European consumer electronics industry.
The EU is pinning its hopes on the Digital Video Broadcasting Group, formed
in September under the aegis of the German telecoms ministry. This group
unites 120 interested parties, including television manufacturers,
broadcasters, satellite operators, governments and the Commission itself,
behind a digital strategy.
One of the group's aims is to come up with common European standards for
transmission and pay-TV decoders, but it seems unlikely that these will be
made mandatory unless it is obvious that consumers have taken to them. The
digital group is expected to talk to the European standard-setting bodies,
Etsi and Cenelec, shortlyy about a multiplex digital standard for Europe
(that is, a standard which allows several channels to be broadcast on each
digital signal). This could be formalised by the end of next year.
This time round, common European standards will not be used to fight US and
Japanese competition. As Jos Kestens of Cenelec said last week: 'Standards
are tools and normally tools aren't used as weapons.' The Commission has
already said that it would be desirable for systems serving the main
worldwide markets to share as many elements as possible, although a
worldwide standard is unlikely because of technical differences.
But the Commission and ministers do want to avoid a proliferation of
competing systems in Europe. That applies to systems for encoding - or, to
use the satellite TV jargon, 'encrypting' - subscription satellite channels,
as well as the transmission standards themselves.
The hope is that co-operation under the umbrella of the digital group will
deter broadcasters and manufacturers from developing incompatible
technological systems at great cost.
Ministers also hope that competing satellite broadcasters will think twice
before developing widely differing encryption systems to protect themselves
from increasingly sophisticated pay-TV pirates. Instead of living rooms
cluttered up with a variety of different decoders, one for each pay-TV
channel the consumer wants to receive, officials believe it should be
possible to develop a single European family of encryption standards,
perhaps based on 'smart' access cards.
Whatever happens, governments are unlikely to fall again into the trap of
dictating exactly what sort of pictures the European television viewer will
watch in the 21st century, and how these pictures reach the screens.

Testing for infectious diseases such as HIV can be time-consuming. A
Vancouver company has developed a test which can give the results in minutes
by testing saliva rather than blood.
The test, developed by Saliva Diagnostic Systems (SDS), involves placing a
specially developed swab in the mouth. When enough saliva has been collected
the stick attached to the swab turns blue. The device is then inserted into
a waiting fluid-filled tube. As the assay recognises the existence or
absence of the HIV antibodies, the colour changes. SDS: US, 206 696 4800;

Few businesses would even consider that their internal phone system could
help cut the lighting bills. But Morgan Automation, of Liss, Hampshire, has
developed a telephone-controlled lighting system which, the manufacturer
says, can cut lighting bills by more than 40 per cent.
As staff enter the building they trigger a core of essential lighting. They
then control the lighting around their desks by dialling specified numbers
on their phones. Typically 70 per cent of the lighting in an office block
could be controlled through the phone network.
The Morgan system incorporates a computer which links the lighting and phone
systems. The smallest system costs around Pounds 13,000. Morgan Automation:

FT  17 DEC 93 / Property: Signs of life stirring in house and home - A
climate encouraging steady investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH MULCAHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK residential property, which in recent years has been a burden round the
necks of many investors, is becoming an area worth looking at again.
The widely publicised problems of many individuals, who are suffering
negative equity with mortgages higher than the value of their property, and
companies burdened with debts should not distract potential investors from
current opportunities. Housing market activity and foreign investment appear
to be picking up.
One sign that the market is far from dead was the recent sale of the newly
renovated 9 Tregunter Road, Chelsea, for about Pounds 8m. And Far Eastern
confidence in the prime market in the core of London seems to be strong:
nine houses at Cambridge Gate, overlooking Regent's Park, have been sold on
a 150-year lease to Singaporean developers. They aim to convert the property
into flats and houses with a development value of more than Pounds 30m.
Foreign money has been attracted into the prime market since the revaluation
of the pound, after its departure last year from the European exchange rate
mechanism. Overseas purchasers now account for about half of the prime
market, and are estimated to have invested more than Pounds 500m in central
London. Agents report a rise in residential land prices in and around the
capital.
But could investors and developers be mistaken in their optimism? Although
the prime market depends, to a large extent, on cash-rich foreign investors,
it cannot be entirely separated from the UK market as a whole.
The residential market is driven by first-time buyers. Next year, the number
of 28-year-olds - the average age of a first-time buyer - in the population
is set to peak, as the effects of the 1960s population boom work their way
through. This group contains many who have been resisting home ownership
since 1988. It is also the section of the population most likely to have
children, and to want a family home.
But this market includes those who can wait a little longer for a home and
those whose domestic requirements have changed while they have been waiting
to buy. As a result, in the medium term, the UK residential market is likely
to be more mature and more stable then in the 1980s. A steadier demand for
homes should reduce the likelihood of the market overheating - and produce
the ideal climate for the overseas investor.
The stability of the market does not preclude opportunities to make profits,
but developers will be expected to provide larger units and sell them for
less. So even though building costs are low at the moment, developers'
margins will be squeezed. While the market remains weak, developers have to
increase building density to maintain profit. It is a happy coincidence that
the Department of the Environment has indicated in recent Planning Policy
Guidance notes a shift in attitude towards residential development in inner
urban areas.
In March 1992, PPG3 (Housing), for example, emphasised the importance of
developing urban sites to take pressure off green belts. Local authorities
were told that, where city-centre sites showed no realistic prospect of
redevelopment with existing permission, they could redesignate the site for
housing use.
The draft revision of PPG13 published earlier this year further emphasised
the desirability of inner-city living. Stressing the government's wish to
'reduce the need to travel', the paper identified that there was a
relationship between low residential densities and increased travel,
particularly by car. The DoE has indicated it will encourage higher-density
developments at or near public transport facilities.
Until now, many London authorities have adopted lower density standards  -
as low as 70 habitable rooms per acre (hra). As long as there is no loss of
amenity and good use is made of existing public transport, developers can
make residential developments profitable. Sites in London around King's
Cross and Paddington Basin, for example, could offer this potential.
One part of the market that could be set for revival is residential
lettings, which have traditionally proved unpopular with investors,
particularly institutions. Now that a proportion of the population defers
the purchase of a home, legislation exists to protect landlords and higher
building densities may be permitted, investors should not ignore
opportunities in this sector. Even the requirement, often dreaded, to
provide affordable housing could be turned to the advantage of developers
who enter into partnership schemes.
Sectors must be correctly identified and targeted: the costly mistakes made
in Docklands in the last boom illustrate the danger of missing the target.
Some of the demand from overseas investors is being met through the change
in use of commercial sites and buildings to produce new residential
accommodation or by developing outside the traditional residential core.
Such sites could provide prime residential property and secondary
accommodation to sell and to let. The government, by signalling its desire
to house people closer to the workplace, has given many of those holding
redundant commercial sites a way out of problems.
In addition, since the recent Budget, when the option of depreciating
property assets for tax purposes was removed, there is no longer anything to
be gained by holding property.
Moreover, it is now possible to finance residential schemes, whether large
schemes for rented accommodation or small, high-value developments to be
pre-sold in the Far East. Residential property can also be efficiently
managed as a long-term investment.
Many developers and investors have already taken the plunge and acquired
buildings and sites, driving up land prices, yet there are still many
opportunities for those who can identify and provide what the occupier
really wants.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing &amp; Advertising): Conventional strategic
wisdom takes a knock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget what you learned at business school or from an executive training
programme about the supremacy of those cornerstones of strategy: market
share and 'value chain' analysis. They are still relevant, but their
character is being altered, and their significance undermined, by the
changing nature of industrial competition.
This is the controversial thesis of one of the most influential strategy
professors in the US, C. K. Prahalad of the University of Michigan. Prahalad
teaches and consults for a large number of top companies around the world.
So his views are likely to affect how at least some of them behave in the
marketplace.
To managers brought up on the best-known writings of the Boston Consulting
Group and Harvard's Michael Porter, Prahalad's prescription for more
effective competitive analysis reads like a revolutionary tract.
Instead of being obsessed with their brand and market shares in finished
products, he says, manufacturers should become far more concerned with their
share of the market in key 'modules' within those products - what he calls,
confusingly, 'core products'.
Just as trends in the cotton industry helped to spark the revolutionary
fervour of Marx and Engels, it is those in the electronics and motor
industries that have now triggered Prahalad's.
He unveiled his thesis to a packed room of executives and academics at a
recent Strategic Management Society conference.
Taking video cassette recorders as his first example, he showed that when
Matsushita and its JVC offshoot held only a 24 per cent brand share of the
world market, they had a 42 per cent share of total production, and more
than 65 per cent of the 'core product' within a VCR - its recording head and
the other key sub-assemblies which surround it.
Among a long list of similar examples, other speakers cited the growing
world market share of specialist suppliers of key modules such as complete
engine pistons.
The strategic importance of the trend towards 'core products' lies partly in
their characteristics, says Prahalad. Most are technology and
investment-intensive, and therefore require increasingly large-scale
development resources - a factor which is being reinforced by the
accelerating 'time-to-market' (development cycle) of the finished products
for which they are destined.
Together, both these tendencies are forcing companies to narrow still
further their range of specialised 'core products', and to outsource more
and more of them. In order to surround their own 'core products' by the most
innovative components and sub-assemblies on the market, they have to buy not
only from their traditional suppliers, but also from their competitors. Thus
many Japanese and other Asian electronics companies buy compact disc
mechanisms and lasers from Sony, which has a 60 per cent world share in
them.
By the same token, in order for Sony to create the necessary scale of
development - and, in some cases, manufacture - it has to sell to its
rivals. As Prahalad puts it, 'competitors become one more distribution
channel for one's core technologies'.
When a company's rivals also start acting as its suppliers and customers in
this way, things get very confusing for its managers. Especially perplexing
is how to manage all the internal and external dynamics of these links.
A good start, says Prahalad, is to recognise the importance of the
technology trade balance between two companies - which in the case of
multinationals 'is increasingly more important than that between countries'.
This recognition, in turn, underlines the vital importance of developing the
company's core technology and its other 'core competencies', such as the
managerial skills required to operate in fast-moving markets and within a
network of partners.
Despite the growing competitive importance of 'core products' and the
competences which underpin them, Prahalad complains that 80 per cent of
managerial attention and 99 per cent of academic literature on strategy is
still devoted either to mundane manoeuvring for market share, or to the
achievement of better price performance between low-margin finished
products.
'Yet such measures are becoming less and less relevant as a way of measuring
market power, influence over standards, and the creation of new businesses',
he argues. 'It's like focusing only on today's skirmishes and forgetting the
full-blooded war tomorrow'.
Apart from paying more attention to their share of 'core products', Prahalad
says companies should cease to be preoccupied with their degree of vertical
integration and their own 'value chain' - their various value-creating
activities, such as production, marketing and service. Instead they should
pay more attention to their ability to create 'virtual integration' by
allying with, and purchasing from, competitors.
Rather than analysing competitiveness purely on the basis of individual
companies, Prahalad also argues that managers - and their attendant
consultants and academics - should realise that the most relevant unit of
analysis in a growing number of industries is becoming what he calls 'open
clusters': shifting networks of companies which form supply relationships
and other types of collaborative arrangement.
This must, by definition, be an overstatement: the competitiveness of
individual companies remains vital, even in an era of what Prahalad calls
'inter-cluster competition' - as between Matsushita and Sony/Philips in
compact disc players, for instance, or Intel versus Motorola in computers.
Allowing for such exaggeration, Prahalad's revisionism is correct - as it is
on market share.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing &amp; Advertising): New just in time zone
 -A plan by US supermarkets to integrate the supply chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Taiichi Ohno, then Toyota's chief engineer, visited the US in the late
1940s, he was more impressed by the country's supermarkets than its car
industry. Their organisation and expertise, he said, inspired the
just-in-time production system pioneered by Toyota and since adopted by
manufacturers worldwide.
Today, it is the supermarkets which are scrambling to catch up. Beset by
mounting competition, shrinking market share and meagre profit margins, they
have launched an ambitious joint project to modernise their business by
adopting the latest just-in-time techniques.
Known as Efficient Consumer Response, the project aims to squeeze Dollars
30bn (Pounds 20.1bn) in costs out of the Dollars 360bn-a-year US grocery
trade through co-ordinated action by retailers and suppliers to slash stocks
and speed up distribution.
If all goes to plan, the efficiency gains will not only enable supermarkets
to cut prices by as much as 11 per cent; ECR will also transform their
relations with suppliers and may hasten restructuring by consumer goods
manufacturers.
Although supermarkets in much of Europe - notably the UK - are more
efficient than in the US, the project is arousing interest across the
Atlantic. Several large supermarket groups, such as Ahold of the
Netherlands, Delhaize of Belgium and Britain's J. Sainsbury, own north
American chains.
ECR was hatched earlier this year by five retailing and manufacturing
associations. It is backed by supermarkets including Kroger, Safeway and
Shaw's, and suppliers including Coca-Cola, Kraft General Foods and Procter &amp;
Gamble.
The driving force is the US supermarkets' growing alarm at losing business
to discount chains such as Wal-Mart and warehouse clubs such as Costco,
which charge 10-15 per cent less for many grocery lines.
Their lower costs reflect superior productivity. At Wal-Mart, for instance,
tight links with suppliers and extensive investment in computerised
technology allow sales to be monitored continuously and ensure that products
are made and delivered when they are needed.
While US supermarkets installed electronic point-of-sale scanners more than
20 years ago, they have used them mainly to speed up check-out transactions,
rather than to generate information about their business or manage it
better.
Furthermore, their relations with suppliers remain antagonistic, partly
because US food and household goods manufacturers have not faced the
competitive spur of cheap imports which prompted makers of textiles, toys
and consumer electronics goods to co-operate closely with chains such as
Wal-Mart.
Things have been made worse by a uniquely American system of short-term
promotional discounts on manufacturers' list prices. This encourages
bargain-hunting supermarkets to purchase as much as three months' stock at a
time and store it in warehouses.
So common is the practice that more than 80 per cent of some grocery lines
are bought in this way. As well as undermining producers' pricing policies,
it has led to uneven distribution flows and a costly build-up of finished
products, while draining funds from advertising and marketing.
Although manufacturers originally launched promotional deals to drum up
sales, many have grown disenchanted. Some, such as P&amp;G, have recently tried
unilaterally to restore price stability. But such efforts have been patchy
and yielded mixed results.
ECR aims to end this anarchy through an industry-wide effort by retailers,
wholesalers and manufacturers to integrate the supply chain by installing
advanced electronic systems and sharing detailed information about sales,
orders, production schedules and payments.
Kurt Salmon, an industry consultancy, estimates ECR could cut stock levels
by 37 per cent and reduce the time taken by a typical grocery product to
move from factory gate to check-out counter from 104 days to 61.
Industry co-operation would also improve supermarkets' use of sales space,
speed stock replenishment and enhance the quality of product innovation and
marketing by freeing suppliers and retailers to concentrate on consumers
instead of fighting each other.
'We have to move from a 'push' approach, which relied on putting products in
a warehouse and hoping they would sell, to one where the industry is pulled
forward by consumer demand,' says Phil Marineau, president of Quaker Oats.
Quaker began applying some principles of ECR in the late 1980s, shaking up
its sales and marketing effort and working with supermarkets to eliminate
surplus stocks and streamline distribution. It has been rewarded with
increased margins and market share.
ECR's sponsors have set a tight timetable. Trials of the techniques and
information systems involved are already under way.
The aim is to have the project operating throughout the industry by the end
of 1996.
But some observers think the really tough issues have yet to be tackled.
'Everyone is still just picking the low-hanging fruit,' says Douglas Adams,
an ECR expert with Nielsen, the market research firm. 'From now on, progress
will be more difficult,' says Winston Taylor, a vice president of Campbell's
Soup.
The biggest obstacle is not the technology, which is already widely used in
other industries, but getting supermarkets and suppliers to behave as
partners, not adversaries.
Even ECR's most enthusiastic backers admit they will need extensive
reorganisation and staff training to overcome ingrained mutual mistrust and
the urge to seek short-term advantage at each other's expense.
Further hurdles are uncertainty among wholesalers about their future role
and manufacturers' anxiety about the impact of the planned elimination of
surplus stocks from the supply chain.
David Rabinowitz, of stockbrokers Kidder Peabody in New York, estimates that
adjustment could cut food manufacturers' production by 40 per cent in a
single quarter. Even if phased in over two years, it could still depress
manufacturers' sales growth during that period.
Yet the supermarkets' continuing loss of market share provides a powerful
incentive to press ahead, as does manufacturers' concern that if they miss
the bandwagon, they may lose to competitors.
Those with the most to fear are manufacturers of weak brands. Many have
survived largely because US supermarkets lacked the tools to measure the
performance of individual grocery lines.
Once ECR provides that information, it seems certain to add to the pressures
for a further shake-out of products which are failing to earn their keep on
supermarket shelves.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Littlechild pegs nuclear levy at 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fossil-fuel levy, the surcharge on electricity bills in England and
Wales which subsidises the nuclear power industry and renewable energy, is
to be held at 10 per cent for a further 12 months to avoid another row over
rising fuel bills.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator who sets the levy
each year, said he considered this level to be the minimum necessary to
raise the required Pounds 1.3bn a year.
In the past Prof Littlechild said he thought the levy should come down each
year. Last year he cut it from 11 per cent. Nuclear Electric, the
state-owned power utility which receives most of the levy proceeds, is also
keen to see it come down to reinforce its claim that nuclear power can
operate commercially.
Last year's cut, however, meant that the levy did not raise enough to cover
subsidies. It should have gone up next year to recover the shortfall and
Prof Littlechild is believed to have proposed an increase to the government.
But the Department of Trade and Industry, shaken by the row over the
decision to impose value added tax on home-heating fuels, is said to have
rejected his proposal and told him to freeze it for another year.
Mr John Collier, chairman of Nuclear Electric, last night welcomed the
freeze. 'Nuclear Electric gets less income from the levy in real terms each
year, and we are firmly on course to be profitable before taking account of
the levy within two years,' he said.
The government is shortly to conduct a review of the future of nuclear power
in the UK, in which the size of the levy is likely to be closely
scrutinised. Ideally, the nuclear industry would have liked to see the levy
come down again to drive home the message that its finances are improving,
but in the circumstances a freeze is the best it can hope for.
Prof Littlechild said the 10 per cent rate 'will apply until any further
change in the rate is introduced. Barring unforeseen circumstances, I expect
the 10 per cent rate to apply for at least 12 months from April 1 1994.'
Prof Littlechild yesterday rejected an appeal by large energy users against
reforms in the wholesale power pool, Michael Smith writes.
Large users say the reforms miss an opportunity for significant change.
Imperial Chemical Industries, one of the complainants, said the reforms
proposed had been universally rejected by large users. It was 'yet another
example of customer's interest not being taken seriously'.
Under the proposed reform the pool is to introduce a system known as
demand-side bidding through which large customers can agree to reduce
consumption if the price goes above a certain level.
This is expected by the pool to lead to average price cuts of about 1.5 per
cent.
ICI and other companies want demand-side bidding, but said the system did
not go far enough in addressing their needs. They wanted a system which
provided more incentive to cut consumption.
Unlike the majority of electricity consumers, some intensive users of
electricity have had to pay considerably more for electricity since
privatisation.
In rejecting the appeal, Prof Littlechild asked the pool to give careful
thought to introducing the system and suggested a three-month trial.
ICI said the system would bring no benefit to customers.
The pool's reform had been due for implementation in October, but is now
likely to be introduced early next year.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Power station clean-up begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power, the electricity generator, took formal receipt yesterday of
the first two of six units which will significantly reduce the amount of
sulphur dioxide it emits from its Drax power station in North Yorkshire,
Michael Smith writes.
Babcock Energy, part of Babcock International, handed over the two flue-gas
desulphurisation (FGD) units a day early after five years' work on the
project. Work on the remaining four units at National Power's largest power
station is expected to be completed by the spring of 1996.
The project, which is costing National Power Pounds 680m, is one of the
world's largest environmental clean-up projects. PowerGen is installing
another set of FGD units at its coal power station in Ratcliffe,
Nottingham-shire.
The high cost of installation makes it unlikely that FGD units will be built
at other coal-fired power stations in the UK. The generators are more likely
to reduce the amount of coal burnt at the stations as the amount of
gas-fired generation increases.
The FGD process at Drax uses large quantities of limestone which contains
alkaline calcium carbonate. This 'captures' the sulpur dioxide in the flue
gas and ends up as gypsum, which can be used in construction.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Lanchashire County Council decides to join Greenpeace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lancashire County Council yesterday decided to join Greenpeace, the
environmental group, in pressing for judicial review of the government's
approval for the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria,
Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
Greenpeace has indemnified the council against any costs. The
Labour-controlled council passed the resolution in spite of opposition from
Conservatives and from some unions which say Thorp will generate jobs in
Lancashire as well as Cumbria.
The Lancashire coast is between 35 and 50 miles south of Sellafield. The
council can appeal for review under the Local Government Act 1972 over what
it believes are possible public health issues.
Mrs Louise Ellman, council leader, said Radmil, an independent radioactive
monitoring service, had said that opening Thorp and changing discharge
authorisation levels at Sellafield could increase health risks for people in
Lancashire.
But Mr Nick Johnson, clerk to the Nuclear Workers' Thorp campaign, asked
Greenpeace not to proceed. 'In the name of the 8,400 nuclear workers at the
Sellafield nuclear site, their families and the further 12,000 jobs that
depend on Sellafield, we call on you to accept the outcome of the democratic
process,' he said.
Labour-controlled Copeland Borough Council, where most people likely to be
employed at Thorp live, has also backed the government's move.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Profit not the main factor in Thorp go-ahead: Bronwen Maddox
examines the government's reasons for granting a licence to the reprocessing
plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers have made clear that Thorp's profitability was not a central
concern in their decision to give the nuclear reprocessing plant the
go-ahead, even though British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, is a
state-owned company.
That is one of the most startling admissions in the 73-page document,
published on Wednesday, setting out the government's reasons for granting
BNF its licence.
The report's analysis of the economic case for Thorp, one of the central
questions raised in this autumn's public consultation, is particularly
flimsy. It says many of the 42,500 responses to the consultation - 63 per
cent of which opposed Thorp - criticised BNF's claim that Thorp would earn
Pounds 900m for the UK in its first 10 years.
One of the critics' main concerns is that Thorp's customers may try to pull
out of their contracts, undermining the plant's profitability. Reprocessing
extracts re-usable uranium and plutonium from used nuclear-reactor fuel.
Since construction of Thorp was given the go-ahead in 1977, the price of
uranium has fallen and fears about proliferation of plutonium weapons
capability have risen. Ministers say they accept 'circumstances have
changed' but say 'the contractual arrangements between BNF and its customers
are the best and clearest evidence of the utility of reprocessing and
Thorp'.
In a phrase which may prove a hostage to fortune, ministers say they 'are
not persuaded that so much weight should be placed on calculations relating
to BNF's profitability'. Instead they conclude: 'While it is important that
BNF should have the resources to be able to fulfil its financial and
environmental obligations, this does not depend on any part-icular level of
profitability'.
Ministers have also noted, however, that BNF's shareholder is the state. The
report does not examine whether, even if Thorp is profitable, alternative
disposal methods might be more profitable when considered from the UK's
perspective, including that of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, its UK
customers.
Wider diplomatic questions have also been dismissed. Ministers say they are
convinced that agreed procedures for guarding plutonium at every stage are
'satisfactory'.
The document gives the impression that ministers found that to license the
Pounds 2.8bn plant was less politically troublesome than to scrap it, almost
regardless of the merits of the economic arguments.
The granting of the licence does not jeopardise relations with foreign
governments, particularly the Japanese, and it provides jobs in a depressed
part of the UK.
Perhaps most important, it avoids the embarrassment of making Thorp, in
environmentalists' words, 'Britain's biggest white elephant'.

FT  17 DEC 93 / People: ICI appoints finance director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Spall, 49, has been appointed finance director of Imperial Chemical
Industries as part of a move to bring some younger faces into the
increasingly elderly boardroom of Britain's biggest chemicals company.
Spall, who joined ICI in 1970 after qualifying as a chartered accountant
with Thomson McLintock, takes over from Colin Short, 59, who is being moved
sideways. Short, a former treasurer of Chevron who joined ICI in 1990, has
been given responsibility for the eastern hemisphere, which will enable him
to devote more time to his new job as deputy chairman of ICI Australia,
ICI's biggest affiliate. Short retains responsibility for planning.
ICI plays down any suggestion that Short, who played a key role in defending
the company against Hanson, has been demoted. Short is less than three years
away from retirement and knows the eastern hemisphere well from his days in
the oil industry.
Sir Denys Henderson, 61, the chairman of ICI, and chief executive Ronnie
Hampel, 61, are both expected to retire in 1995 and ICI is keen to bring a
younger generation of managers into the boardroom. The effect of the current
changes is to reduce the average age of the ICI executive directors from 57
to 54.
The company announced yesterday that Chris Hampson will leave next April
when he reaches the normal retirement age of 62 and will be replaced on the
board by Mike Brogden, 55, who joined ICI in 1960 as a technical officer in
the dyestuffs division. Brogden has been chief executive of ICI Chemicals
and Polymers since May 1992 and will retain his responsibility when he joins
the board next May.
The latest reshuffle does not appear to give any more clues as to the likely
successors to Henderson and Hampel, who have both agreed to stay on after
the normal ICI retirement age. Although Spall, ICI's general manager in
charge of finance, is under 50, Rob Margetts, 47, who has been on the ICI
board for over a year, is still regarded as the front runner.

FT  17 DEC 93 / People: Bond resigns from Arjo Wiggins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, has dismayed UK
institutions again with its announcement yesterday that the charismatic
Gordon Bond, its American executive director, has resigned.
Bond, who previously ran the US Appleton operations, was only appointed in
January as chief executive of the company's printing and writings division,
which included the European carbonless papers, fine papers and coated papers
businesses, as well as Ceasa, the group's pulp mill in Spain.
The move is a serious blow for AWA. Of the group's operational directors,
Bond was undoubtedly the most successful and had the highest profile. AWA's
shares closed down 23p to 226p.
Although AWA would not say what had caused the boardroom bust-up, there
appears to have been a personality clash between the strong-willed French
chief executive Alain Soulas and Bond who was used to running his operations
with considerable freedom.
Behind the scenes AWA stressed the resignation had had nothing to do with
any deterioration in the performance of Bond's division, nor any
disagreement over the group's strategic direction, nor by any desire to
relocate the group to France. The group has a substantial minority French
shareholder.

FT  17 DEC 93 / People: Medeva picks internal candidate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Medeva, the drugs company which saw its share price battered after a profits
warning in July, has picked its one internal candidate, European regional
director Bill Bogie, for the new post of chief executive with effect from
the beginning of next year.
Executive chairman Bernard Taylor, who announced his intention to split the
top management spot at the interims in August, says that as the headhunters
got to work, it became clear that Bogie, who arrived only in April, was
'head and shoulders' above the other candidates.
Bogie, 49, has impressed his new chairman by 'grasping the nettle' over
Europe, 'neatly executing a potentially painful rationalisation'.
His background also matches the company's requirements for a chief executive
'steeped in pharmaceutical lore'. A medical doctor by training, Bogie spent
four years in the Health Service before joining Hoechst Pharmaceuticals,
initially on the research side, in 1972. He worked in Germany and the US in
the early 1980s, and later ran Hoechst Pharmaceuticals in the UK before
joining Medeva.
When Bogie takes over, the company's founder Ian Gowrie-Smith will
relinquish his title of managing director. 'That will not change his task
qualitatively; he was always the corporate development man,' says Taylor,
conceding that, given the company's enfeebled share price, 'we have
difficulty in generating enough acquisition work to keep him interested'.
While no directors would be getting bonuses this year, Gowrie-Smith's basic
salary of Pounds 287,000 would be reviewed when the company had 'a better
assessment as to what the future holds for near term acquisitions', Taylor
added.
The shares closed up 1 1/2 p at 139p yesterday.

FT  17 DEC 93 / State spending pushes up PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher government spending, compared with a year ago, pushed up the public
sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 3.13bn last month, the Treasury said
yesterday.
In the first eight months of the financial year overall government borrowing
totalled Pounds 30bn, compared with Pounds 22bn in the corresponding period
last year.
Local authorities repaid Pounds 1.21bn of debt in November, however,
continuing their recent record of reducing borrowings.
The figures underline how the recession has increased borrowing, partly
because higher unemployment has pushed up social security spending and lower
growth has held down tax revenues.
Spending by central government departments, combined with interest payments
and taking into account privatisation proceeds, came to Pounds 21.5bn last
month. This compares with Pounds 21.32bn in October and Pounds 19.93bn in
November last year.
Central government revenues held up fairly well last month, totalling Pounds
17.14bn, after Pounds 18.1bn in October and Pounds 16.92bn in November 1992.
Inland Revenue receipts were relatively buoyant at Pounds 4.06bn last month,
after Pounds 3.85bn in the same month last year.
The PSBR, which takes into account the gap between spending and revenues for
both central and local government, was Pounds 2.69bn in October and Pounds
2.06bn in the previous November. In the last financial year the deficit came
to Pounds 36.68bn. The Treasury's forecast in last month's Budget puts the
1993-94 deficit at Pounds 49.8bn.
November was the fourth successive month in which local authorities repaid
debt. In November last year they repaid Pounds 570m. So far this financial
year local authorities have repaid a net Pounds 3bn, compared with
repayments of Pounds 7.1bn in the equivalent period of 1992-93.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Jobless total declines in all regions again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rate at which people are joining the dole queue has slowed considerably
since last year, the Department of Employment said yesterday as it revealed
the eighth monthly fall in unemployment since January.
Last month, after seasonal adjustments, 342,700 joined the unemployment
count - compared with 392,900 in November last year - and 378,500 left it,
21,000 fewer than a year earlier.
These were just two encouraging indications to emerge from last month's
official jobless figures, which showed the unemployment rate falling to 10
per cent, from 10.1 per cent in October, the lowest rate for more than a
year.
Overall employment rose 86,000 in the third quarter, after a rise of 35,000
in the second.
Some analysts cast doubt on the second-quarter figure, pointing out that it
depended on a somewhat implausible 75,000 increase in the number of
self-employed, a rise that exceeded any quarterly gain in the boom years of
the 1980s.
But the third-quarter figure looks more genuine. It includes a significant
increase in service-sector employment and the first quarterly rise in male
employment since the end of 1989. The department added that part-time jobs
accounted for most of the increase.
Two quarterly rises in manufacturing employment were reversed in the third
quarter. The number of people employed in manufacturing industry fell a
seasonally adjusted 27,000 in the three months to September, after a rise of
10,000 in the three months to June. In the service sector a 149,000 increase
in the third quarter followed a 28,000 rise in the second.
As in October, unemployment fell in all regions last month. The rate fell to
9.9 per cent in the south-east, the first time it has fallen below 10 per
cent for a year. It remains highest in Northern Ireland, the north and
Greater London.
The Department of Employment's quarterly labour-force survey was also issued
yesterday.
It is a sample survey of about 60,000 households designed to capture those
people who are unemployed but who do not qualify for benefit and therefore
do not appear in the monthly count.
This showed that the jobless total, according to the labour force survey
definition, was 53,000 higher in the summer than the average monthly number
of claimants in June to August.
It also showed that between the spring and the summer unemployment rose a
seasonally adjusted 26,000, compared with the claimant count's finding of a
14,000 fall. However, between last year's winter survey and the latest
summer survey unemployment, according to the labour force survey definition,
fell 67,000 while unemployment on the claimant-count measure fell 57,000.
Other findings of the survey were that:
24.8m people were in employment between June and August, a fall of 0.1 per
cent on the previous quarter.
3.1m people were self-employed, a 0.3 per cent rise since spring.
The number of part-time workers rose for the second quarter running.
The proportion of people working part-time rose from 20.8 per cent in the
spring of 1984 to 24 per cent in the spring of this year. The unemployment
rate remains the highest for people aged between 16 and 19.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Average earnings rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Average earnings rose an underlying 3 per cent in the year to October,
unchanged from September and still the slowest rate of growth for 26 years,
Emma Tucker writes.
Earnings growth in manufacturing held steady at 4.25 per cent, while the
government-imposed 1.5 per cent limit on public-sector pay increases helped
keep service-sector earnings growth down to 2.25 per cent. Both rates were
unchanged from the previous month, but the September figures for services
and manufacturing were revised down by 0.25 per cent.
The rate of decline for unit wage costs slowed in October, reflecting rises
in employment.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Major lauds 'whole host of improvements'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, KEVIN BROWN and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister yesterday set the scene for better political fortunes by
outlining prospects for a sharp improvement in the British economy.
Mr John Major told MPs his government had recently pulled off a string of
successes that would put British industry in a strong position in the new
year.
He said: 'The government has got interest rates at the lowest level for 20
years, unemployment falling while it is rising everywhere else in Europe,
growth faster than in any other country in Europe, a Gatt deal for industry,
retail sales up and a whole host of other improvements.'
Mr Major said that the Gatt agreement could add up to 4 per cent to
Britain's national output, generating 400,000 extra jobs in the next decade.
Mr John Smith, opposition leader, pressed home Labour's claim that the
government misled voters at the last general election by promising not to
increase taxes. But Mr Major and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
repeatedly dismissed the attack.
Mr Clarke gave one of the most optimistic assessments since he became
chancellor, suggesting that unemployment could fall 'month after month after
month' because of the tax and spending decisions outlined in his recent
Budget.
He said: 'It is the first time since 1960 that inflation has been below 2
per cent for consecutive months in the year.'
On trade, however, Mr Clarke warned that rising demand in Britain meant that
there were greater opportunities for European countries to sell goods to the
UK. 'But otherwise,' he said, 'I think our trade figures are extremely
good.'
Meanwhile, a Mori poll published in The Times today shows that the November
30 Budget was the most unpopular since the mid-1970s, apart from Mr Norman
Lamont's final Budget last March. Mori interviewed 1,738 adults last
weekend.
Order books in manufacturing have improved but expectations about output
have slipped, says a Confederation of British Industry survey published
today.
Export orders are still ranked below normal by a third of companies, but are
still at their highest level for six months.
Inflationary pressures continue to be extremely weak, with more
manufacturers expecting to cut domestic prices in the next four months than
to raise them.
The results from the CBI's latest poll of manufacturers indicate that output
should continue its recent slow and patchy rise in the next few months.
The survey covered 1,383 companies across 50 industries. It was conducted
between November 26 and December 14, with most of the replies coming after
the Budget.
Overall orders covering both the UK and export markets were ranked below
normal by 37 per cent of companies, with 18 per cent saying they were above
normal.
The 19 percentage point difference establishes an improving trend compared
with the corresponding negative balances of 23 points and 31 points in the
CBI's November and October surveys.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Bifu tells Bank to fight harder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The management of the Bank of England has been urged by the Bifu, banking
union, to fight harder for new business.
The union says it is concerned that the Bank lost an important bulk clearing
contract in one of the few banking areas where it is still prepared to
compete.
The bank's tender for the clearing house automated payment system was lost
to the Royal Bank of Scot-land.
Mr Jim Lowe, assistant secretary for the union's Bank of England section,
said: 'There are a number of other areas where the Bank has contracts up for
renewal and we are concerned about it keeping that work.
'We are also concerned that the Bank is not actively seeking new business.
Our interest is in maintaining jobs and careers.'
The Bank of England said yesterday that it was only prepared to tender on a
limited range of business.
It said: 'Bulk clearing is one of the areas where we do try to compete as
competitively as we can.'

FT  17 DEC 93 / Vacancy counting system may alter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Department of Employment statisticians are considering a move to a more
accurate measure for the number of job vacancies in the economy, which are
substantially understated by the current method.
The November vacancy figure announced yesterday was 140,900 - 6,500 up on
the previous month, 24,000 up on a year before and the highest since October
1990. But most labour market analysts believe that the real figure could be
three or four times more.
The present figure counts vacancies notified to Jobcentres, but many
vacancies are advertised in newspapers or through private employment
agencies. The largest single way in which vacancies are communicated is by
word of mouth.
Mr Peter Stibbard, director of statistics at the employment department, said
it would be difficult to capture vacancies that never enter the public
domain, but information from newspapers and employment agencies could be
used.
The new system was likely to establish an index of the change in vacancies
rather than a new number. Mr Stibbard added: 'We want to establish a rapidly
available barometer of the vacancy position in the labour market.' Ministers
have not yet discussed the proposal but are unlikely to oppose it. The
department already does occasional spot checks of vacancies using a broader
measure than Jobcentre notifications. It found that in some areas the number
is up to three times higher.
The seasonally adjusted official figure for the inflow of vacancies now
stands at 199,500, the highest figure since June 1990. Jobcentre placings of
150,400 are also at the highest level since March 1990.

yesterday said the Bank of England should have greater autonomy over
monetary policy but be made more accountable to parliament.
The committee agreed by a 9-1 majority, with Ms Diane Abbott, the Labour MP
for Hackney North dissenting, that the Bank of England Act should be amended
so that the primary objective of the Bank would be to 'achieve and maintain'
price stability.
Publication of the committee's keenly awaited report gave an immediate boost
to supporters of more autonomy for the Bank. The Commons will debate the
commit-tee's proposals early next year.
Mr Nicholas Budgen, the Conservative MP for Wolverhampton South-West and a
committee member, is preparing a private member's bill, based on the
committee's recommendations, that will be given its second reading on
January 28.
The committee's report recommended that the Bank should be operationally
responsible for achieving stable prices, a move that would transfer power to
change interest rates from the Treasury to the Bank.
The committee said that the government and Bank should agree publicly stated
targets for price stability which would be open to debate in parliament. The
targets, it said, should be set in the light of monetary and other
indicators 'including the extent of spare capacity in the economy and the
overall stance of fiscal policy'. It said the Bank should be made far more
accountable to parliament through an annual report, which would be debated
in the Commons, and through appearances of the governor before the Treasury
committee.
The committee said its proposals would require changes in the Bank,
including the creation of 'a strong and independent monetary policy
committee' comprising the governor, the deputy governor and other executive
directors.
It said, however, that the government should have power to override the
Bank's objective of price stability temporarily and in exceptional
circumstances.
The committee gave lukewarm support for the Bank retaining its role as
supervisor of the UK banking industry.
It said this position would need to be reviewed if there were to be a
complete reorganisation of banking and financial services regulation.
The committee plans to investigate supervision under the Financial Services
Act in the new year. It will also look into recent revelations on the
inappropriate selling of private pension schemes.
The committee emphasised the importance of greater transparency in monetary
policy. It recommended publication, after a lag, of the minutes of existing
monthly meetings between the chancellor and Bank governor and said the
minutes of the proposed monetary policy committee should also be published
after an interval.
The Bank welcomed the report, and a spokesman pointed out that Mr Eddie
George, its governor, believed institutional changes such as those proposed
would help it to achieve price stability.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said he had an open mind. 'I will give it
careful consideration,' he said in a Commons reply. 'We need further
discussion and debate. I have a feeling that at the moment it has become
something of a fashionable cause.'

FT  17 DEC 93 / BR to sell track maintenance units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail is to sell its track maintenance and renewals operations, which
employ 33,500 people and have an annual turnover of Pounds 1bn, the
government announced yesterday.
The aim of the sale is to give Railtrack, the company which will manage BR's
track and signalling, a choice of contractors, Mr Roger Freeman, minister
for public transport, said yesterday.
It is not clear how profitable these activities are for BR but the
government hopes for bids from civil engineering companies, electrical
engineers and construction companies.
It does not expect management buy-outs to emerge.
Maintenance contracts typically run for between three and five years while
track renewal programmes last two to three years. BR currently operates
these businesses from 14 profit centres but plans to separate the
maintenance operation from track re-newal.
The intention is to create a new division - British Rail Infrastructure
Services - in April and to separate the two sides of the business a year
later.
They will be offered for sale in 1995 and the transfer to the private sector
will take place by April 1996.
The Department of Transport yesterday announced the signing of a 13-year
contract for BR to carry mail for the Post Office. The Post Office is to
build a distribution centre linking road and rail connections in Willesden,
north-west London.
The Post Office will also buy 16 new mail trains for Pounds 40m.
They will be built at the Derby workshops of ABB, the rolling-stock
manufac-turer.
BR runs 62 trains a day for the Royal Mail, of which 24 are travelling post
offices on which mail is sorted in transit. A quarter of all mail is carried
by rail.
Responsibility for the Ashford International railway station on the Channel
tunnel link has been handed over to the John Laing construction company.
Laing will build the station and car parks at its own cost and risk in
return for a fee related to the number of passengers who use the station.
The Pounds 30m project is due to be completed at the end of 1995. More than
2m people are expected to be using the station by the end of the decade.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Building societies urged to merge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Medium-size building societies face the choice of merging with each other or
being taken over and - probably - eliminated.
That is the message of a study published today by Morgan Grenfell, the
merchant bank, which says that medium-size building societies need to
achieve cost savings and to form their own regional branch networks to
enable them to compete more effectively with the banks.
The paper highlights the effectiveness of mergers for larger societies,
where they take over a small society and close its head office and most
branches, over combinations between the largest societies.
The paper says that when serious competition from the retail banks
intensifies societies will be unable to rely on wider margins to maintain
profits at an acceptable level, and will need to cut costs.
But while banks can cut branches and transfer business, an individual
society will almost certainly not be in that position - in total, societies
have only half the number of branches that banks have.

FT  17 DEC 93 / MP raps MMC on 'perverse' rulings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of the Commons all-party Treasury committee has tabled an
early-day motion criticising recent recommendations of the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission for failing to uphold the public interest, Roland Rudd
writes.
Mr John Watts, the Conservative chairman, yesterday attacked what he called
the commission's recent 'perverse' ruling that the so-called 'complex
monopoly' created by the perfume industry was not against the public
interest.
His motion, which has been signed by members of all three main parties,
calls on the commission 'to be fearless in eliminating anti-competitive
behaviour in the distribution of consumer products'.
Mr Watts said he had in mind the commission's investigation into competition
in the Pounds 800m-a-year ice-cream market.
The commission is examining the widespread practice among manufacturers of
supplying freezer cabinets free of charge to small retail outlets, on
condition that the cabinets are not used to stock competitors' products.
Mr Watts singled out Walls, part of the Anglo-Dutch Unilever group, as an
example of an ice-cream maker which was using its muscle as a freezer
supplier to discourage small retailers from supplying other ice creams.
Mars, the US-owned food manufacturer, has repeatedly challenged Unilever's
domination of the European ice-cream market in Brussels and in national
courts. It started making ice-cream versions of its chocolate bars in 1989
and now has about 10 per cent of UK impulse sales, which are the
fastest-growing part of the market.
The all-party early-day motion on the commission says it 'regrets that a
number of recent MMC recommendations have favoured current market structure
at the expense of the consumer interest and therefore the public interest'.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat industry spokesman, who signed the
motion, said: 'This is a direct message to the MMC that they are too
cautious and too conservative.'

FT  17 DEC 93 / Bifu tells George to 'fight harder'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The management of the Bank of England has been urged by the Bifu banking
union to fight harder for new business.
The union says it is concerned that the Bank lost an important bulk clearing
contract in one of the few banking areas where it is still prepared to
compete.
The bank's tender for the clearing house automated payment system was lost
to the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Mr Jim Lowe, assistant secretary for the union's Bank of England section,
said: 'There are a number of other areas where the Bank has contracts up for
renewal and we are concerned about it keeping that work.
'We are also concerned that the Bank is not actively seeking new business.
Our interest is in maintaining jobs and careers.'
The Bank of England said yesterday that it was only prepared to tender on a
limited range of business.
It said: 'Bulk clearing is one of the areas where we do try to compete as
competitively as we can.'
The Bank has said, however, that it does not intend to pursue new areas of
business in direct comp-etition with the clearing banks outside its core
area of bulk clearing.
The bank has not competed with clearing banks in most traditional domestic
and commercial banking services for more than 100 years, although it still
allows about 200 individuals to maintain private accounts and retains a
small number of company accounts.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Industrial orders 'improved'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Order books in manufacturing have improved but expectations about output
have slipped, says a Confederation of British Industry survey published
today.
Export orders are still ranked below normal by a third of companies, but are
still at their highest level for six months.
Inflationary pressures continue to be extremely weak, with more
manufacturers expecting to cut domestic prices in the next four months than
to raise them.
The results from the CBI's latest poll of manufacturers indicate that output
should continue its recent patchy rise in the next few months.
The survey covered 1,383 companies across 50 industries. It was conducted
between November 26 and December 14, with most of the replies coming after
the Budget.
Overall orders covering both the UK and export markets were ranked below
normal by 37 per cent of companies, with 18 per cent saying they were above
normal.
The difference between the two readings of 19 percentage points establishes
an improving trend compared with the negative balances of 23 points and 31
points in the CBI's November and October surveys.
A balance of 9 percentage points of companies said output volumes were
likely to rise in the next four months. The balance was 12 points last month
and 8 points in October. This month's survey is the twelfth in a row to
point to higher output volumes.
Although considered unsatisfactory by most companies, the export outlook
improved on November, with a negative balance of 14 points of companies
saying export order books are below normal. This is the best result since
the negative balance of 10 points recorded in June.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Ford to cut night shifts: Escort production reduced - Lancia
marque withdrawn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford is to suspend night-shift operations throughout January at its Halewood
plant on Merseyside. The company faces sharply lower demand in Continental
car markets.
The plant, which makes the Escort, has already been badly hit by the
Continental downturn and has been on a three-day week since November 25.
Its 4,700 hourly-paid workers will resume five-day working when they return
after the Christmas break on January 5, but suspending the night shift will
reduce daily output from 1,000 cars to about 600.
This means lost production of about 6,500 cars for the whole of January.
Employees fear the night shift may not be restored until the end of next
year's first quarter, and Ford is doing little to allay these fears.
Night-shift staff will be redeployed to other duties, such as training and
mainten-ance.
Most of Ford's other manufacturing plants in the UK have also been affected
by the market slump, and are taking extended Christmas breaks.
Halewood's workforce has also been told by Mr John Fleming, its plant
manager, that projected productivity improvements over the next four to five
years can be expected to lead to a further 1,400 job cuts in assembly and
body manufacturing.
However, he said the job shedding process would continue to be on the basis
of voluntary redundancy.
Productivity improvements have already seen the Halewood workforce falling
steadily. About 1,400 have been lost in the past two years alone.
Last year the plant - excluding gearbox manufacturing, which employs 1,200 -
produced 160,000 cars with a workforce of just under 5,000.
Ford managers point to rival plants such as the Toyota facility at
Burnaston, Derbyshire, as illustrating the need for continuing productivity
rises. Toyota plans to assemble 200,000 cars a year at Burnaston with a
workforce of 3,000.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, chief Ford negotiator for the AEEU engineering and
electrical workers' union, said yesterday he was 'obviously concerned' at
the Halewood move. 'The government is saying we are coming out of recession,
but this does not square with the reality on the ground,' he said.
The company stressed that any redundancies would be voluntary. 'This is a
pro-jection based on demands for efficiency. It does not take into account
other factors which may come along,' it said.

<TEXT>
Leeds Building Society is to transfer Pounds 450m belonging to 1m savers in
14 obsolete accounts into new accounts paying mostly higher interest,
Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes.
The move, to begin in February, follows a similar announcement by National &amp;
Provincial on Tuesday. The societies, which called off a planned merger in
October, said they had agreed in merger discussions to abolish their
obsolete accounts. Leeds said 20 per cent of its savers were in obsolete
accounts, representing 4 per cent of the society's savings deposits.
A campaign launched in 1990 to move the savers into new accounts succeeded
in only halving their numbers.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Political Notebook: A seasonal mood change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the Conservative party 1993 has been about survival. Against the odds it
has survived. In spite of the best endeavours of the Tory right, Mr John
Major has too.
For Mr John Smith's Labour party the aim has been to prosper from the
government's misfortunes. Judged by the opinion polls it can claim success.
The opposition has rarely been less than 20 points in front.
But the demeanour of the party's MPs and shadow cabinet members tells a
different story. The confidence which comes with being ahead is mirrored by
self-doubt over whether the lead can be sustained.
Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats, the most visibly successful of the
opposition parties this year, are similarly ambivalent. The undoubted boost
from famous victories in the Newbury and Christchurch by-elections has not
been translated into additional punch at Westminster.
So it is hardly surprising that weary ministers hosting Whitehall's
traditional round of Christmas parties have been permitting themselves the
occasional smile. After lurching from crisis to crisis since the 1992
general election, still being there is enough. 'Who knows,' one minister
offered only half-jokingly, 'next year we might start governing the country
again.'
The mood is shared on the Tory back benches.
Peace in Northern Ireland would be an inestimable prize. Mr Major looked
this week like a prime minister. His style during the Commons debate on the
Anglo-Irish agreement was the most relaxed of the year. It encouraged him to
return to the despatch box yesterday to take personal credit for Britain's
role in brokering the Gatt world trade deal.
There is more unease than has yet surfaced publicly over the implications of
the accord. Dealing with the IRA promises to be a messy business for a party
trying to rebuild a tattered reputation as the guardian of law and order.
But the fact that the disquiet has remained below the surface - save for Mr
Norman Lamont's intervention yesterday - says something about the changed
mood on the back benches. It is no longer possible to state with confidence
that the Conservative party is bent on self-destruction.
It has brushed aside the revelation of Mr Major's clandestine contacts with
the IRA, and it has swallowed a dilution of the government's commitment to
the unionists. More broadly, it has actually applauded a Budget that will
pave the way for bigger tax increases than ever contemplated by the Labour
party. It has concentrated instead on the latest encouraging batch of
economic statistics.
The legislation this week to curb statutory sick pay and increase National
Insurance contributions have raised hardly a murmur. The party's
post-Maastricht tension has also eased as Mr Major has absorbed the rhetoric
of the Euro-sceptics.
The turnaround has been mirrored by restlessness on the Labour benches.
Never mind the opinion poll lead. Direction is what counts in politics.
Labour MPs fear the wind may be about to change.
Grumbling about Mr Smith's leadership has spread from dissident leftwingers
to the shadow cabinet. The modernisers are fearful that the compromises made
to win the one-member-one-vote confrontation with the trade unions have
stalled the process of change.
Mr Smith is criticised even by some of his friends as remote. His timid
shadow cabinet reshuffle did nothing to enhance his reputation for
decisiveness. 'What do we stand for?' is a question asked these days as
often by Labour as by Tory MPs.
But this picture is an uneven one. If Mr Major is rebuilding his
self-confidence his colleagues say that his private mood is still brittle.
Few miss the contrast with the instinctive ebullience of Mr Kenneth Clarke,
never more obvious than since the Budget.
The prime minister has taken to drumming his fingers on the table during the
irrepressible Mr Clarke's lengthy interventions at cabinet committee
meetings. The line between friendship and rivalry in politics is a fine one.
Then there is the real world, untouched by the pathological swings of mood
at Westminster. Out there the voters will feel the pain of higher taxes, a
squeeze on wage increases and the spending crunch for the welfare state. A
modest economic upswing may not be enough to buy forgiveness.
Mr Major has something to celebrate this Christmas. He is still in the game.
He is more resilient and more willing to take risks than many of his critics
have allowed him.
The Conservatives are starting to rediscover self-discipline. But so far it
adds up to a seasonal change of mood rather than a sea change.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Restaurants hit at discount scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A trade association rep-resenting small restaurants has criticised a
discount scheme which the Financial Times plans to promote next year.
Mr Michael Gottlieb, vice-chairman of the Restaurateurs Association of Great
Britain, said the scheme, which offers 25 per cent discounts at
participating restaurants, would result in customers' assuming that the
industry made far bigger profits than it actually does. The association
represents 700 restaurants.
Transmedia, the US-based company running the scheme, said 99 UK restaurants
had agreed to participate and that it offered a fair deal to customers and
the industry.
Diners who take advantage of the scheme will use a restaurant card to pay
the full cost of the meal. The amount will then appear on their credit or
debit card bill, less 25 per cent of what they spent on food or drink. There
is no discount on the value added tax or service.
It is planned to offer the card free through the FT for the first six months
of next year. After that it will cost Pounds 35 a year.
Participating restaurants can negotiate loans with Transmedia which are paid
off when customers with restaurant cards have spent twice the amount
advanced.
For every Pounds 100 spent on food and beverages, Pounds 25 is returned to
the customer, Pounds 25 is retained by Transmedia and Pounds 50 goes towards
paying off the loan.
Mr Gottlieb, who owns the two Smollensky's restaurants in London, said he
feared the card-holding customers would displace full-paying clients on busy
evenings. Restaurateurs would be giving 25 per cent back to the customer and
25 per cent to Transmedia, badly damaging profits.
Mr Gottlieb admitted that he had 'flippantly' asked Transmedia for a Pounds
250,000 loan, which had been refused.
Mr Richard Exham, managing director of Ebury Wine Bars, which has subscribed
to the scheme, said the loan would enable him to invest in new equipment in
his five London outlets and attract customers he would not otherwise have
had.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Fiat to stop selling Lancia cars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat is to stop selling its Lancia cars in the UK and phase out production
of right-hand drive Lancia models.
The decision marks the defeat of Fiat's decade-long struggle to revive the
marque's fortunes in the UK, after sales were devastated by a controversy
over rusting at the end of the 1970s.
At their peak in 1978 Lancia sales reached 11,800. But allegations a year
later of excessive rust in the then best-selling Beta model badly damaged
the marque's reputation, in spite of Fiat buying back cars from dissatisfied
owners.
Since then sales have declined inexorably. In 1989 - the record year for
total car sales - they were down to just over 3,000. Last year they totalled
only 701, and up to last night 569 had been sold this year.
Fiat Auto (UK), the Fiat parent, said last night that it was contacting all
Lancia owners to assure them of continuing service, parts and warranty
assistance.
Lancia owners with vehicles registered since August 1990 are also being
issued with a coupon worth up to Pounds 1,600, redeemable on either a new
Fiat or Alfa Romeo, another marque owned by the Fiat group.
Most of the 46 Lancia dealers, which are on 12-month contracts, have a dual
franchise with Fiat, whose own sales have risen by more than one third, from
31,000 last year to 42,000 so far this year. Some dealers will be offered
the Alfa Romeo franchise as a Lancia substitute.
Before the rust scare the UK was Lancia's largest right-hand drive market.
Its collapse has significantly reduced the incentive for Fiat to keep
right-hand drive cars in production. The Irish Republic, New Zealand, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Cyprus and some African and Pacific rim markets have
accounted for a small volume of sales but future Lancias will not be
engineered for such markets.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Building societies urged to merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Medium-size building societies face the choice of merging with each other or
being taken over and - probably - eliminated.
That is the message of a study published today by Morgan Grenfell, the
merchant bank, which says that medium-size building societies need to
achieve cost savings and to form their own regional branch networks to
enable them to compete more effectively with the banks.
The report also argues that larger societies need to concentrate on selling
services and products to their savers rather than to borrowers, where the
emphasis has been so far.
The paper comes against the background of the abandonment in October of the
merger plans of the Leeds Permanent building society, the fifth largest, and
the National &amp; Provincial, the eighth largest.
It highlights the effectiveness for larger societies of mergers, where they
take over a small society and close its head office and most branches, over
combinations between the largest societies.
While banks have cut their staff numbers by 10 per cent since 1989,
societies' staff numbers have risen by 6 per cent, and the falls in
societies' cost-to-income ratios have come largely from higher income rather
than lower costs.
When serious competition from the retail banks intensifies, societies will
be unable to rely on wider margins to maintain profits at an acceptable
level, and will need to cut costs, the paper says.
But whereas banks can cut branches and transfer business to an alternative
convenient for the customer, an individual society will almost certainly not
be in that position - in total, societies have only half the number of
branches that banks have.
On savings, the study recognises societies' concern that they may be
'cannibalising' the retail savings base they need to support their mortgage
lending, by selling their investors other products such as Peps or unit
trusts.
It argues, however, that unless they offer such services, savers will seek
them elsewhere, and societies will find they are excluded from a growing
area of the market.
It is particularly important for a society to own the supplier, rather than
acting as agent for another institution, which can then build its own
relationship with the investor.

Total domestic waterborne freight movements last year fell 5 per cent to
54.9bn tonne-kilometres, while the amount of freight lifted was 140m tonnes,
a drop of 3 per cent, the Department of Transport announced yesterday.
The reduction in freight movements was due mainly to a fall in the transport

FT  17 DEC 93 / Parental payments to students decrease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The introduction of student loans has allowed a cut in the contributions
which parents make towards university education, according to a survey
published yesterday by the Department for Education, John Authers writes.
It found the average cost paid by parents fell by 19 per cent between
1988-89 and 1992-93, with 57 per cent of parents paying more than their
formally assessed contribution and 3 per cent paying less. Only 6 per cent
of students' income came from earnings.
Over the period the proportion of students from the 'AB' socio-economic
groups fell from 55 per cent to 49 per cent, which the department
interpreted as evidence that loans had not deterred children of poorer
families from applying to university.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Securicor beats Group 4 to escort job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Securicor yesterday gained its first stake in the growing penal services
market by winning the contract to provide court-escort services in the
London area.
The five-year contract to handle about 11,000 prisoner movements a month
between prisons, police stations and courts is worth Pounds 96m.
The first private court-escort service, taken over by Group 4 in the east
Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside region earlier this year, led to a series
of escapes and other incidents in the first weeks of the new operation. As a
result, the Prison Service has decided Securicor will take over the London
service in five stages between next July and July 1995.
Mr Derek Lewis, chief executive of the Prison Service, said Securicor
Custodial Services had won the contract 'against strong competition'. He
said it was evident that privately run escort services reduced duplication,
led to more efficient use of police and prison officers' time, and
represented better value for money for the taxpayer. Transferring the
services to the private sector enabled police and prison officers to
concentrate their skills and energies on the work for which they were
trained.
Securicor will handle all prisoners except those in the highest security
category.
Group 4 was among the unsuccessful bidders for the London contract. The
company remains a strong contender for the contract to manage the new
Doncaster prison. Group 4 already runs Wolds remand prison on Humberside and
winning the Doncaster contract would give the company a basis for building
up a range of privately managed penal services in a single region.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Pension clients fall victim to suspect advice: A report
commissioned by SIB on transfer business reveals an almost uniform flouting
of guidance rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The picture that inexorably emerges from a pilot study of the pensions
transfer business is of sales agents routinely failing to seek enough
information to give good advice, customers commonly given suspect advice and
only a small minority of cases handled in accordance with regulations.
The study by accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick was commissioned by the
Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. It covered 735
case files of those transferring out of occupational schemes over 2 1/2
years from the beginning of 1991.
It showed an almost uniform failure to comply satisfactorily with regulatory
requirements before the self-regulating organisations issued their members
with guidance. Four-fifths failed to meet proper standards even after
guidance was issued.
Members of three regulators were covered in the research - Fimbra, which
regulates independent financial advisers, Lautro, which regulates sales
agents directly employed by or exclusively contracted to life insurance
companies, and Imro, which regulates independent sales agents employed by
fund-management companies.
Examples were taken both from before and after each of the regulators issued
their guidance. They covered issues such as taking proper account of the
particulars of the pension scheme the customer might transfer out of (the
'ceding' scheme); ensuring that the client had enough information and
understood it; and looking at the range of options available to the
customer.
Following earlier concerns about standards, Fimbra and Lautro issued
guidance in July last year, Imro followed in March.
For all three areas, between two-thirds and four-fifths of the samples were
taken from the period before the guidance was given.
KPMG divided the case files into four categories:
Unsatisfactory: where there was not enough written information to support
the advice the adviser had given. Suspect: where, at first sight, the
adviser seemed to have acted suspiciously or misleadingly - for example by
giving apparently perverse advice.
Unsatisfactory and suspect: where a file was both of the above.
Pass: where there was evidence that the adviser had sought enough
information to give good advice, and that advice appeared to have been
understood by the customer.
More than 400 ceding schemes were represented in the sample, with the most
common scheme accounting for 31 cases.
About a quarter of transfers came from public-sector, nationalised-industry
and former nationalised-industry schemes. Across the whole 2 1/2 -year
period, 89 per cent of cases involving Fimbra members failed to meet
compliance standards. The figure for Lautro was 95 per cent, and for Imro 89
per cent.
After the action by the regulators, the number of cases properly handled
rose from one in 20 to one in five. This was true across sales agents and
advisers covered by all three regulators.
For Fimbra members, the pass rate rose from 6 per cent to 21 per cent; for
Lautro members it rose from 1 per cent to 19 per cent; and for Imro members
it rose from 9 per cent to 18 per cent. The most noticeable change seems to
have been in providing information rather than in the quality of advice.
The total proportion of cases where not enough information was on file fell
from 88 per cent to 69 per cent. But the proportion where suspect advice was
given fell only from 39 per cent to 33 per cent.
The proportion where there was doubt about the advice given but the file
contained enough information to make a judgment - thus reducing the prospect
that it would longer seem suspect if all the relevant information was there
 -stood at 11 per cent before the regulators took action, and remained at 7
per cent.
The method of selling seems to have been less important in determining
whether the sales agent acted in accordance with regulation than other
factors such as the sort of analysis of transfer value used and the value of
the lump sum being transferred.
Where a computerised transfer analysis was used, 24 per cent of files were
passed compared with a 5 per cent pass rate where this analysis was not
employed.
Where the transfer value was more than Pounds 30,000 the overall pass rate
was, at 17 per cent, almost twice as high as the overall pass rate of 9 per
cent.
KPMG also examined the areas of information which were most often omitted
from the sales agents' 'know your customer' checklists.
These included details of the ceding scheme's early retirement options and
the discretionary increases in benefits it might offer. In only two-fifths
of cases was the client's attitude to risk recorded.
The overall average age of an investor at the time of transfer was 41, and
the average transfer value was Pounds 19,372.
Fimbra, Lautro and imro are all self-regulating
organisations for the retail financial services
idustry:
Fimbra regulates independent financial advisors
Lautro regulates sale agents directly employed
or exlusively contracted to life insurance
companies
Imro regulates the independent sales agents
employed by fund management companies

FT  17 DEC 93 / Airport's ownership plans approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has approved a development plan for Birmingham International
Airport which will give the private sector majority control, and involve the
raising of up to Pounds 400m for investment over the next 10 years.
The seven district councils which own the airport yesterday said that Lord
Caithness, aviation minister, had been informed of their scheme 'and looks
forward to seeing these plans carried through'.
'We will be proceeding as quickly as possible with our plans,' added the
owner councils, which are Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull,
Walsall and Wolverhampton.
By mid-1994, airport shareholders expect to be negotiating with potential
private-sector investors. They would like two or three partners.
'The preference would be organisations which are committed to the region and
understand the Midlands and see the long-term view of the Midlands we must
take,' said Mr Brian Summers, the airport's deputy managing director.
Companies meeting those criteria would include West Midlands Travel,the
region's largest bus operator.
Once private-sector shareholders have a majority of the equity, the airport
company would be freed of public borrowing restrictions.
Singer &amp; Friedlander, merchant banker, has been retained to advise the
shareholders on the options for a new capital structure.
The corporate and financing plans are being drawn up in the expectation that
passenger numbers handled will more than double to 11m by the year 2005.
This would require substantial investment in new technical facilities.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Independent to consider refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of The Independent newspaper will decide next week on a
comprehensive business plan for the future which will involve a
'redefinition' of the paper and a multi-million-pound refinancing.
One strand of the redefinition would be to take the target audience of 20 to
40-year-old ABC1 and produce 'a paper that looks at their lives from their
perspectives as consumers'.
The business plan, which will cover the next three years, has been put
together by Mr Patrick Morrissey, the new chief executive of Newspaper
Publishing, publishers of both The Independent and the Independent on
Sunday.
Mr Morrissey said yesterday: 'The key is to protect the independence of the
titles. If the independence of the titles is compromised I don't think there
will be a business in the long term.'
The statement by the chief executive, who joined the company on October 1,
would appear to rule out a takeover by either Associated Newspapers or
Mirror Group Newspapers, both of which have expressed an interest, unless
the company's financial position worsens.
It is believed that Mr Morrissey and Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of
Newspaper Publishing, have been visiting the company's institutional
investors and found them broadly sympathetic to a refinancing if a viable
business plan is produced.
This makes it possible that existing shareholders, including El Pais of
Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, could finance the plan without the need
for a drastic change of ownership.
El Pais and La Repubblica are believed to be keen to introduce a new UK
minority shareholder from the national newspaper industry.
The plans will go before a board meeting on Tuesday against a background of
falling circulation - The Independent is only just keeping sales above
300,000 - and a move into loss. In the year to September 26 the company
suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds 486,000, although Pounds 350,000 of this
resulted from the failed Observer takeover attempt.
Mr Morrissey declined to say how much money the company will need to raise
but it is unlikely to be less than Pounds 10m and could be much more.
Asked whether the company would now review the policy of charging 50p for
The Independent while The Times sold at 30p, Mr Morrissey said he would not
comment on revenue matters before the board meeting.
He refused to discuss personnel matters, such as rumours that one of the
founders, Mr Matthew Symonds, would lose his seat on the board.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Ex-BCCI official denies six charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former senior employee of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International pleaded not guilty to six charges of fraud at the Old Bailey
yesterday.
Mr Imran Imam, a former official at BCCI's London offices, faces two charges
of conspiring to conceal documents, three of furnishing false information
and one of conspiring to falsify records.
His trial, expected to last between eight and 10 weeks, is set to begin on
April 11 next year. Mr Imam was released on bail with sureties of Pounds
75,000.
Earlier, Judge Pownall QC rejected an application for the prosecution to be
dismissed. Mr Imam had claimed that the Serious Fraud Office had given an
undertaking to the US authorities investigating BCCI that he would not be
prosecuted in the UK.
Mr Imam gave evidence to the US authorities as a witness which was then
passed to the SFO before his arrest.
The judge ruled that the SFO had given no undertaking that Mr Imam would not
be prosecuted.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Joint declaration was agreed after more than 20 drafts

The men of violence in Northern Ireland will be forgiven if they take some
time to understand the Downing Street declaration.
As one of the senior officials most closely involved in its drafting
admitted this week, it is not a document that would win any prizes for plain
English.
A Whitehall colleague was less polite, describing the product of nearly two
years of negotiation as 'the most badly-written declaration in Anglo-Irish
history . . . and that's saying something'.
But as the leaders of Sinn Fein yesterday got down to their line-by-line
analysis of the Major-Reynolds plea for peace, the officials provided
explanation, if not justi-fication, for its tortuous phrasing.
The seven-page document released by the two prime ministers was the last of
more than 20 substantive drafts which had winged backwards and forwards from
London and Dublin over the past few months. If minor changes are taken in
the account that number rises above 100. On Tuesday alone, as the prime
ministers and their aides engaged in a frantic exercise to complete the
document, they went through at least four versions.
Each government had to be sure that it could declare with credibility that
the document offered something radically new while insisting that it
compromised no principles. 'Every word had to be fireproof', said one
Whitehall official.
The process started two years ago when Mr Reynolds met Mr Major in Downing
Street. But the real work got under way only in the summer, when the Irish
prime minister sent a draft declaration to Mr Major. That - amended,
rewritten, added to and subtracted from - provided the basis for the final
declaration.
Whitehall insiders were prepared to admit yesterday what their political
masters would not - although work was going on before Mr John Hume of the
SDLP started his talks with Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, the Hume-Adams
initiative provided a decisive impetus towards an agreement.
So too did the British government's clandestine contacts with Sinn Fein. As
one insider put it: 'You do not make an offer to a bunch of terrorists
unless you think there is a fair chance they will accept it.'
Mr Major's meeting with Mr Reynolds in Brussels in October provided the
first breakthrough, with an agreed statement of general principle and an
explicit call for an end to violence. From there the process went to Dublin,
to Brussels again and back to London. The teams of officials on both sides
make literally thousands of phone calls.
After the revelation of Mr Major's Sinn Fein contacts, Mr Reynolds came
close to cancelling the Dublin summit.
The key passages relating to unionist consent, self-determination, changes
to the Irish constitution and the establishment of an all-Ireland forum all
at one stage or another threatened to derail the negotiations.
Sinn Fein must take what it will from the resulting linguistic tangle. It
will focus on paragraph four, which sets out Britain's acknowledgement of
the right to self-determination for the people of Ireland, north and south.
An author of the declaration has some advice. To understand it 'you must
read every sentence as a whole, every paragraph as a whole and then the
statement as a whole'.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Court refuses insurance plea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Decisions by the insurance ombudsman cannot be judicially reviewed in the
courts, the High Court in London ruled yesterday.
Lord Justice Rose and Mr Justice McKinnon dismissed a challenge by Aegon
Life Assurance to a series of ombudsman decisions which will cost the
company an estimated Pounds 2m in payments to investors.
Aegon had sought to overturn 23 of 49 decisions by Dr Julian Farrand, the
ombudsman, in March. These held the company responsible for alleged
guarantees of income made on broker bonds sold by South West Investment
Management of Truro in 1985 and 1987, before the Financial Services Act came
into operation.
South West had sold bonds for Trans Life, later renamed Regency Life and
bought by Aegon in 1991. Aegon argued that any promises by South West as an
agent were made without authority.
The court refused leave to appeal. Aegon has 28 days to apply direct to the
Court of Appeal.
Mr Peter Baines, Aegon chief executive, said any further legal action would
not affect payments to investors, which would be made immediately.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Nuclear review will be delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Differences between government departments have prevented ministers from
announcing the terms for a review of the British nuclear industry. The
government had previously indicated it would announce the terms this year,
Michael Smith writes.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, told the Commons yesterday that the
government would announce the terms as soon as possible in the new year.
Last March the government signalled in a white paper that it would bring
forward the start of the review to this year. It was originally promised for
1994.
Disagreements between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Treasury
have further delayed the terms of reference.
The Treasury wants a thorough consideration of whether nuclear generation
should be privatised but the DTI is far more cautious about the
possibilities of selling off the industry.

FT  17 DEC 93 / IRA internal talks aim to prevent split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SOUTH ARMAGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA and its political wing Sinn Fein were yesterday continuing a series
of consultations within their own ranks in an effort to avoid a damaging
split over the Major-Reynolds proposals.
Sinn Fein yesterday made its second statement in two days, underlining the
need for more detailed consideration of the proposals and warning the public
not to expect a 'quick-fix' response from the IRA.
The Provisionals themselves had by last night not made a statement, but
hardline IRA members are believed to remain unconvinced that the pressures
emanating from Dublin and London are anything other than an attempt to force
them into an unconditional military surrender.
Yesterday in the IRA heartland of south Armagh, next to the Irish border,
the hurdles to be overcome still seemed enormous.
In the staunchly republican town of Crossmaglen, the only war memorial is to
the IRA dead. Republican tricolours fly above the rooftops.
Army helicopters circled overhead as troops ran through side streets. Seven
members of the security forces have been shot by IRA snipers here in the
past year.
A local security source said: 'The prime ministers might have signed their
peace deal, and the IRA army council might be considering it, but the
terrorists here on the ground are still waiting to kill us.'
Two IRA groups are believed to operate in south Armagh, comprising 40 men
and women.
Among the people of Crossmaglen yesterday, a feeling of war-weariness was
matched by a conviction that the IRA should not allow itself to be forced
into a permanent ceasefire without further concessions guaranteed by the
government.
Local publican and former civil rights activist Mr Paddy Short said: 'The
terrorists here are not the IRA but the British army. The troops should go
back to barracks first.'
Ms Margaret Caraher, whose husband was shot by the British army three years
ago, said: 'I go along with the temporary ceasefire to see what comes out of
the talks between Sinn Fein and the government. But at the moment I would
feel like a sitting duck to be picked off by loyalist paramilitaries if
there was a permanent ceasefire.'
Only when she was joined by her four-year-old son Brendan did she
contemplate peace in the long term.
'I grew up with the troubles and no way do I want Brendan to have the kind
of memory I have. We have to try to prevent this happening to the next
generation. I think it would be unforgiveable if everything collapsed, and
there are some people in the IRA who realise that.'
