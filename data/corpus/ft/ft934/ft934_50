FT  04 OCT 93 / A crowd with only one aim: armed rebellion - John Lloyd
witnesses the turmoil on the capital's streets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CROWD, gathering in October Square under the capital's largest Lenin
statue, wasted no time on speeches.
With tough young men, many in camouflage, in the vanguard the crowd launched
itself on the police line across the Moscow River bridge just past Gorky
Park.
It was a march which by nightfall would take many of them into a pitched
battle with forces loyal to President Boris Yeltsin in a fight for control
of Moscow.
The speed of their advance along the ring road left police and interior
ministry trucks and buses abandoned: these were smashed, their contents
looted. From one, bizarrely, came a big carton of Wagon Wheel biscuits,
which were grabbed hungrily. 'See what the democrats give to their
defenders', screamed one woman.' I can't buy these for my kids'.
At Smolenskaya Square, in front of the Foreign Ministry, the police again
tried to hold them with smoke bombs and water cannon: again they were swept
aside.
Between the Foreign Ministry and the US Embassy, also on the ring road, a
bus full of troops was surrounded by men and women hurling rocks through the
windows as the troops huddled behind their shields. A few leaders tried to
tear away their enraged comrades, shouting: 'Don't waste your time, get to
the White House'.
Through the perfect autumn afternoon the crowd swept on towards the
parliament building. As they surged up to the barricades blocking the
entrance to the White House, automatic fire rang out. Most dived to the
street or cowered behind trees and lamp posts. The firing, however, seemed
mainly into the air - though it was then, probably, that a policeman was
shot dead and another injured. Again the troops fell back and scattered.
The crowd broke through and charged up the ramp and round to the back of the
parliament, where they were embraced by the long-term defenders. On the
balcony stood a cheering group of deputies and staff.
Then, to a huge cheer, out came General Alexander Rutskoi, his bodyguards
holding a flak jacket before him as he gripped the microphone. His suit
freshly-pressed, he addressed the crowd.
'All able men who wish to join us, form yourself into detachments before the
White House. You'll be given arms: we'll take the mayor's office and then
Ostankino (the TV centre, some 4-5 kms away)'.
Some 30 to 40 armed defenders then attacked the mayor's office. A captured
truck was reversed against the barred glass door, smashing it back into the
foyer. The firing stopped. Minutes later troops sheltering in the building
smashed through a window to one side and trotted away across the street as
White House defenders contemptuously fired into the air above them.
The crowd invaded the mayor's office, taking hostages almost at once. Their
captives were spat on and beaten.
Behind the building, some dejected soldiers led by a corporal named
Alaxander were also held captive. Asked if he would now join the
parliamentary side, he said: 'I don't want to fight against the people . . .
I can't answer that.' A doctor standing by said three people had been
injured seriously.
Many of the White House defenders wore flashes with 'Russian National Unity'
on them; others wore a swastika-like device. Mr Ilya Konstantinnov, one of
the hardest-line deputies and a leader of the Russian Unity political bloc,
appeared to be in command of the operation. 'Now,' he called to the men,
'forward to Ostankino'.
The crowd, many waving sub machine guns, baying with victory, swept back up
the New Arbat - to meet a second crowd of thousands of demonstrators coming
along the inner ring from the direction of the Foreign Ministry.
The crowd, which had begun the day at 5,000 - 10,000 strong had now grown to
30,000 - 40,000. All were intent on going to Ostankino, hated for its
unequivocal support over the past two weeks for President Boris Yeltsin.
Round the ring road they went, the banners out now - mostly the Soviet red
flag and a few portraits of Stalin. As they passed the newly refurbished US
embassy, they chanted, in Russian and English - 'Yankee Go Home' or
'Sovyetsky Soyuz' (Soviet Union).
Ostankino appeared lightly guarded. It was already dark when the frontal
assault began, with heavy explosions punctuating the machine gun fire. From
within the building, fire was returned.
Behind the front line, youths smashed fences to form barricades and build
fires. 'What the devil do you think your hands are for?' one demanded. 'Help
us]'
By 11pm the firing had grown heavier and more frequent. Bullets raced down
the avenue leading to the centre, forcing people to their bellies. Fires had
broken out on the first floor and the deployment of the armoured personnel
carriers seemed to have halted the advance of the parliamentary forces.

FT  04 OCT 93 / Big changes likely for Lonrho board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, will take a big step towards
becoming a more conventional public company this week by appointing its
first non-executive directors for two decades.
The company's directors received a proposal at the weekend for the
appointment as non-executives of Mr Peter Harper, a director of Hanson, the
Anglo-American conglomerate, and Mr Steven Walls, the chairman of Albert
Fisher, the food processing and distribution group.
They have been recruited by Mr Dieter Bock, who at the beginning of the year
acquired an 18.8 per cent stake in Lonrho and was then appointed joint chief
executive with Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's guiding force for 30 years.
Mr Walls and Mr Harper - whose remuneration will be Pounds 30,000 a year -
are expected to set up Lonrho's first ever audit committee, to review its
financial performance.
Mr Rowland, who has been opposed to non-executives since 1973 when the
so-called 'straight eight' directors, led by Sir Basil Smallpeice, then
deputy chairman, tried unsuccessfully to remove him as chief executive. Mr
Rowland is not expected to try and block this week's appointments because Mr
Bock made it a condition of his investment in Lonrho that non-executives
should be appointed.
In the coming months, Mr Bock is expected to recruit one or two further
non-executives. In the longer term, he is also likely to seek to reduce
significantly the number of full-time executives on the board from the
present 12.
Reductions in the number of executives will also help him cut the costs of
running the company's headquarters in the City of London's Cheapside, which
are more than Pounds 20m a year.
Mr Bock sees the appointments as the first step in his plan to make the
company more transparent to outside investors and persuade investment
institutions to acquire shares in it.
One of Lonrho's biggest shareholders, the Genting Group of Malaysia, the
plantations, gaming and rubber group, has recently approached Lonrho
shareholders trying to sell its 3.9 per cent stake.

FT  02 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Malaysia advances to
record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDEX-linked buying of large capital issues prompted short covering, and the
Nikkei average advanced in active trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei rose 177.42 to 20,283.13 in volume up from 276m shares to 350m;
it fell to the day's low of 20,056.31 in the morning, but gained in tandem
with the futures market, hitting a high of 20,328.13 in the afternoon. The
market was barely moved on the week.
Advances led declines by 689 to 303 with 181 unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks gained 7.84 to 1,634.09 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.19 to 1,261.48.
Traders said that buying by investment trusts took investors by surprise;
they had been expecting the Nikkei to fall below 20,000. Buying by public
funds was noted, while the dollar's rise against the yen also supported
exporters.
Large-capital issues, weak last month on profit-taking ahead of the interim
closing of investment books, advanced with NKK up Y3 to Y269 and Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries Y9 to Y653.
Investors bought Nippon Telegraph and Telephone which rose Y49,000 to
Y880,000. The issue had been previously sold on margin calls and reports of
rate cuts.
Some issues were bought on the restructuring theme. Isuzu Motors rose Y27 to
Y400 and Mazda Motor up Y9 to Y492. High-technology exporters were higher,
with Hitachi gaining Y1 to Y820 and NEC rising Y17 to Y969.
Retailers lost ground on profit taking, with Ito-Yokado, a leading
supermarket chain down Y80 to Y5,380, as did pharmaceuticals, with
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical losing Y40 to Y2,450.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 101.09 to 22,287.86 in volume of 18m
shares. The index rose as individuals sought small-capital issues, but lost
its impetus towards the close.
Roundup
SELECTED Pacific Rim markets continued to demonstrate strength, while Hong
Kong and Seoul were closed.
KUALA LUMPUR extended its recent rise and the composite index added 6.04 to
a record high of 859.87, for a 2.6 per cent rise on the week, in volume that
dipped to 639.7m from Thursday's 763.4m.
Mr Michael Franklin of James Capel noted that the market was supported by
expections of an expansionary 1994 budget to be tabled on October 29;
forthcoming ruling party elections next month, ahead of the general election
in the first half of next year; and the granting of large infrastructure
projects, including a second airport, as part of the next five year
development plan.
He added that other contributory factors included the release by the
government of some timber concessions in east Malaysia and the conclusion of
business deals in China.
The index was helped ahead by strong rises in some of its main components.
Genting rose 80 cents or 3.3 per cent to MDollars 25.
Renewed US interest was seen in the wake of a Credit Lyonnais roadshow in
New York. Among the four featured companies, Ekran firmed MDollars 1.10 to
MDollars 14.20, while Telekom Malaysia rose to a high of MDollars 17.60
before closing 10 cents ahead at MDollars 17.30.
BANGKOK saw heavy institutional buying of leading stocks lift the SET index
20.90 or 2 per cent to 992.34. However, turnover was thin at Bt4.3bn, as
retail investors remained absent on worries over new rules on margin
requirements.
The market gained 1.3 per cent on the week.
AUSTRALIA recovered from early losses and the All Ordinaries index put on
8.3 to 1,972.7 in turnover of ADollars 261.8m, for an improvement of 1.3 per
cent on the week.
Foster's saw 6.7m shares change hands as the stock ended steady at ADollars
1.33, with strong institutional interest being seen in the brewer.
SINGAPORE finished ahead, but off the day's highs, as investors took profits
and trimmed positions ahead of the weekend. The Straits Times Industrial
index closed 9.08 higher at 2,018.10, 1.7 per cent up on the week.
MANILA weakened further as the peso continued to depreciate against the US
dollar and foreign investors remained absent. The composite index fell 14.21
to 1,959.55, little changed over the week. Turnover fell back to 476.2m
pesos from Thursday's 637.5m pesos.
Analysts also noted that there had been some switching out of equities and
into Treasury bills on expectations of a rise in interest rates.
TAIWAN continued its downward consolidation after Thursday's holiday amid
concern about corporate profits and the approach of local government
elections at the end of November. The weighted index shed 26.29 to 3,806.40,
1.9 per cent lower over the week, in very slow trade of TDollars 10.44bn.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): London coffee market in
retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN COFFEE prices rebounded from early lows on Tuesday, traders at the
London Commodity Exchange were under no illusions that the retreat from
recent 2 1/2 -year highs was over. 'The market looks very weak,' one told
the Reuter news agency, 'it should, by rights, move lower.'
His worlds proved prophetic. Tuesday's low of Dollars 1,235 a tonne for the
November robusta futures position was quickly left behind and expected
psychological support level at Dollars 1,200 a tonne gave way without a
struggle. By yesterday's close the November contract was quoted at Dollars
1,160 a tonne, down Dollars 104 on the week and Dollars 175 below the
late-August high.
The irony is that this week's plunge came as producers were counting the
hours to yesterday's commencement of their much-vaunted scheme to withhold
20 per cent of production from the market, which had been largely
responsible for the July-August rally that lifted the November position by
more than Dollars 400 a tonne, or 46 per cent.
As is often the case, the market's confidence in the plan began to wane as
the moment of truth approached. 'The retention plan's positive implications
have been fully absorbed,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodities analyst at
GNI, the London trade house, after Wednesday's Dollars 59 fall. 'And
investors are now beginning to wonder how effective it will be and how long
it will last.' For his own part he thought the producers' resolve was strong
and that the scheme would operate 'for a few years at least'.
After an edgy week the cocoa market ended on an upbeat, with the December
position, which had see-sawed between Pounds 892 and Pounds 940, closing
yesterday at Pounds 936 a tonne, up Pounds 20 on balance. Meanwhile, the
March 1994 contract, the new second position, rose to Pounds 969 a tonne
breaking, though hardly decisively, chart-based resistance at Pounds 967,
the long-time high for the second position reached in May 1990.
Tempering cocoa traders' enthusiasm, however, was the knowledge that some of
this week's rise, reflected a decline in sterling against the US dollar. In
late trading yesterday the March futures position at New York's Coffee,
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange was trading at Dollars 1,228 a tonne, up Dollars 19
on the week.
Copper, the London Metal Exchange's flagship contract, led its convoy into
shallower waters this week as, following the recent ending of the supply
squeeze that had been propping up nearby prices, bearish fundamentals for
the metal continued to drain market confidence.
The three-months position closed yesterday at Dollars 1,699.25 a tonne,
Dollars 36.25 above Thursday's six-year low but still Dollars 67.25 down on
the week. Dealers said the late rally, which came despite news of big rise
in LME warehouse stocks, was in reaction against an oversold market
situation.
The dismal performance of the copper market seemed to knock what little
stuffing they had out of the tin and nickel markets. Both had staged quite
spirited rallies last week, following four week's of heavy losses. But this
week saw the two metals' bearish fundamentals reasserting themselves.
What dealers described as a 'mini-collapse' on Monday wiped out Dollars 75
of three-months tin's Dollars 250 rally, and as persistent selling by the US
Defence Logistics Agency revealed a paucity of buying interest the price
subsided further to end Dollars 190 down at Dollars 4,437.50 a tonne.
The Dollars 150 nickel rally had been encouraged by news that Inco of
Canada, the biggest producer, was talking to unions about production cuts in
an effort to reduce costs after the three-months price slumped below the
critical Dollars 2 a lb mark. But as further details were awaited LME
stocks, already at a record level, continued their relentless rise and the
price fell to a fresh 6 3/4 -year low - the gloom being deepened by a
forecast suggesting that the expected Russian output decline might be
significantly less than western producers had been hoping for.
At yesterday's close three-months nickel was at Dollars 4,112.50 a tonne, up
Dollars 20 on the day but Dollars 277.50 down on the week.
The gold price price continued to move in inverse proportion to the dangers
perceived to attend the Russian parliament crisis, and after an edgy week it
closed in London yesterday at Dollars 355.20 a troy ounce, down Dollars 2.05
on balance.
For the oil market Geneva was the focus of attention as the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries met this week to set supply quotas for the
coming six months. The consensus among oil traders seems to be that the
agreed ceiling if 24.52m barrels a day, together with the inclusion of
Kuwait (which had stayed out of the last deal), was about as much as could
realistically have been hoped for, and prices regained some of the recent
losses.
In late trading yesterday at London's International Petroleum Exchange the
North Sea Brent crude futures contract for December delivery was quoted at
Dollars 17.55 a barrel, up Dollars 1.03 on the week.
This week's Opec-related trading boost put the finishing touches to a bumper
month for the IPE, with total turnover moving 8.7 per cent ahead of the July
record to 1.387m barrels. An exchange official said yesterday it was
particularly encouraging to see the IPE contract being used increasingly by
Middle East producers to hedge forward sales, at the expense of the New York
Mercantile Exchange's West Texas intermediate contract.

FT  02 OCT 93 / US pursues fillip for oil and gas
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Energy Department is examining various proposals to shore up the
domestic oil and gas industries, aiming to promote technology, stimulate
markets and develop an oil import policy.
The department is expected to intensify the emphasis on renewable energies
and seek a reduction of reliance on nuclear energy. A recommendation by US
industry for an oil import fee is 'definitely off the table', said a
departmental official.
The department's proposals will be published in a report late this month. No
draft legislation is likely to be submitted to Congress very soon, it being
busy with health care, the North American Free Trade Agreement, government
restructuring and welfare reform.
Debate over US energy policy was launched in April by Mrs Hazel O'Leary,
energy secretary, in a speech to the Louisiana state legislature.
Acknowledging her responsibility to establish a coherent set of policies,
she said she would aim to increase production of energy resources while
protecting the environment.
The Energy Department, working with the Interior Department and the
Environmental Protection Agency, has met industry and environmental groups.
The report has gone through various drafts, but has not reached secretary
level.
According to a summary of an early draft of the report, the industry
recommended a wide range of tax incentives for production and technology
advancement. The ideas include stimulating the use of oil recovery
technology through tax credits and depletion allowances, tax incentives for
environmental equipment, tax credits for low-production wells, and promoting
vehicular use of natural gas.
It is not clear how many of these will be in the final report. The
department is also considering foreign sales initiatives likely to win
approval from an export-minded administration. For example, the restrictions
on oil exports to Japan from Alaska could be eased. Exports of oil and gas
equipment services could be aggressively promoted.
An energy efficiency centre, now being opened in Moscow, could be joined by
an oil and gas centre, which would offer a focal point for industry efforts
to work abroad.

THE GOVERNMENT will set out ways of improving protection for wildlife in a
consultation paper on the European directive on wildlife habitats, to be
published on Monday.
Under the directive, the UK must establish a network of protected wildlife
sites across the country. The directive aims to compile an international
network, called Natura 2000, of important sites.
The government must incorporate the directive into legislation by June next
year, and must draw up the list of selected sites by June 1995.
Officials are basing the list on the existing list of more than 5,700 Sites
of Special Scientific Interest. However, only the sites richest in wildlife
are likely to be chosen. The list may also include some estuaries and
shorelines, which do not qualify for SSSI protection. This extends only to
the high-water level of waterways and coastlines.
Mr Simon Forrester, of the Worldwide Fund for Nature, said yesterday: 'It is
now clear there will be no new legislation - they will just be tinkering
with the existing Countryside and Wildlife Acts, and they will be relying on
voluntary compliance.'

THE Asia-Pacific region and Latin America will lead growth in international
airline passenger traffic in the five years to end-1997, says the
International Air Transport Association.
Total world scheduled airline passenger traffic will rise at an average
annual rate of 6.6 per cent, indicating a 38 per cent increase in passengers
by 1997, IATA forecast at a traffic outlook conference.
This could well be double world economic growth in real terms.
Cargo traffic is expected to rise at an average annual rate of 7.6 per cent.
North American passenger growth will be 6.1 per cent and Europe's 5.9 per
cent, reflecting more mature markets and persistent recessions, said Mr
Michael Brown, senior forecaster. Eastern and central Europe will grow at
10.2 per cent, from a low base.
Asia-Pacific growth is seens as averaging 7.5-8.5 per cent until 2000, based
on surging economic growth, improving infrastructure and booming
international trade, according to IATA figures. By 2001, Asia Pacific will
account for 39 per cent of international scheduled passenger traffic.
Latin America, with improving conditions in countries such as Chile and
Argentina, should grow by nearly 8 per cent annually until 1997.
Mr James Halstead, transport analyst with Swiss Bank Corp in London, said
traffic growth through 2000 implies a 30 per cent increase in the world
aircraft fleet.
'By 2010, the cost of re-equipment and fleet extension will reach Dollars
850m (Pounds 568m), against net book value of the present fleet of Dollars
125m. A few profitable global airlines will emerge, with a handful of good
regional carriers and another group of state-supported airlines,' he said.

FT  02 OCT 93 / US indicators hint at faster expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICIAL index of US leading indicators rose by 1 per cent in August,
suggesting the US economy could be poised for a period of faster growth, the
Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The increase was the biggest since December, reflecting gains in 10 of the
11 component indicators. The main positive factors were a rise in building
permits, a decline in weekly claims for unemployment insurance, and a rise
in orders for plant and equipment.
Other figures published yesterday painted a positive but somewhat less
encouraging picture. New orders for manufactured goods rose 0.9 per cent in
August, failing to make good a 1.9 per cent decline in July. Orders,
however, were 5.9 per cent higher than in the equivalent period last year.
The Purchasing Managers' Index - a reliable guide to manufacturing industry
conditions - rose slightly to 49.7 per cent last month against 49.3 in
August. This was the fourth consecutive month below the 50 per cent level
generally regarded as the threshold for expansion in manufacturing.
Mr Robert Bretz, for the National Association of Purchasing Managers, said
the index had failed to rise much, partly because new orders had been weaker
than expected. The outlook for employment in manufacturing, however, had
improved slightly.
Yesterday's figures follow a week of generally positive economic news.
Consumer confidence rose modestly last month and personal incomes were
stronger than expected in August. But new home sales were weaker than
expected.
The latest figures appear consistent with a consensus forecast of 2-3 per
cent growth at an annual rate in the second half, up from just under 1.5 per
cent in the first half.

FT  02 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Weights cut in Latam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES over growing US opposition to the North American Free Trade
Agreement have led Merrill Lynch strategists to cut their weighting in the
Latin American region from overweight to neutral, writes John Pitt.
Mr Thomas Robinson and Mr Douglas Johnson, international equity strategists
based at Merrill Lynch's New York office, commented that 'with the momentum
of opinion toward Nafta apparently shifting toward those opposed, the
schedule for timely passage looks less likely, particularly as Washington's
attention will be focused on health care reform over the near term'.
However, they remained confident that Nafta will eventually secure approval,
and consider the longer-term prospects for the Latin American markets, and
particularly Mexico, which has one of the lowest inflation rates in the
region, to be good.
In the meantime, the strategists noted that 'although fundamental factors
still support the region as a longer term opportunity, the relative risk for
Latin America in the near term compared with the emerging markets of Asia
and Europe is increasing'.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Microchip harvest: Truth of the Matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHURCH congregations will witness an event of mass self deception this
weekend. In churches across Britain, hundreds of thousands, most with
uncalloused hands and genteel voices, will launch themselves into that
seasonally resonant chorus, We plough the fields and scatter. It will be
sung with enthusiasm, yet that enthusiasm will not hide the fact that
probably none of the congregation has ever ploughed a single clod, and only
allotment holders and keen gardeners know what it is to scatter seed.
Once upon a time the church faced the problem of integrating heathen rituals
into the rhythms of the Christian year. Harvest festivals proved a
successful example of adaptation, a satisfying ceremony in most church
calendars, where quaint paganisms - the making of corn dollies, or the
offering of first fruits - translated easily into a context of Christian
thanksgiving.
But the festival has been sabotaged in two ways. First, the global failure
to co-ordinate food supply and demand has obliged western Christians to
divert pieties of thanksgiving into pieties of guilt. Second, the Christian
symbolism has itself become quaint and looks, to many, outmoded.
The ploughmen, if they are there, look to Brussels for their blessing, not
heaven; and Brussels, if it is listening, has probably just commanded them
not to plough at all. It seems clear that the church has failed to keep up
with the times.
This is not necessarily an accusation. Quite apart from the religious
consolation it already provides, the traditional harvest festival could be
said to perform a useful social function. So many people have been atrophied
from contact with the food chain that there is some value in preserving
primal concerns about rain, sunshine, germination and yield. For, however it
is packaged, the micro-waveable lasagne has not shed its dependence on those
elemental factors.
The Church Times is buzzing with debate about the survival of rituals. An
impartial judge would probably decide that a harvest festival is one of
those romantic occasions which are the quintessence of most churchgoers'
beliefs. But still there are clergy prepared to have their cake and eat it:
maintain domestic structure, and give it a contemporary gloss.
The Rev Peter Hayler is one. He is the chaplain attached to the Science
Park, at Cambridge. He styles his own forthcoming harvest festival as a
church public relations event.
The celebration is explicitly aimed at creating a new opportunity for
collective gratitude, for the 'harvest' there is taken to mean products,
services, and even ideas. There will be no piles of marrows at the altar,
but rather a display along the aisles, featuring companies based at and
around the science park.
It remains to be seen just how the microchip specialists and ink-jet
printers will rise to the challenge Hayler has laid down, but one thing is
certain: their representatives will not be asked to sing We plough the
fields and scatter.
Most vicars will admit that it is a thankless effort, to get the
congregation to sing new hymns. We cling to the melodies and phrases of our
past. So Peter Hayler has compromised his service, and inserted hymns which
feature words modern but tunes ancient. And he has even adapted one of these
modern hymns for his own particular science park flock. It goes to the tune
of All through the night and then:
For the fruits of his creation, thanks be to God,
For the life of innovation, thanks be to God
For the planning, buying, dealing, formulations full of meaning,
All that research is revealing, thanks be to God.
As its author would agree, this is not classic hymnnology, nor likely to
become so. But it makes a change from ploughing and scattering; and he may
rightly claim that change is better than decay.

FT  02 OCT 93 / A life on the Islington waves . . .: Lucy Kellaway discovers
why today's young sea cadets find drill such a thrill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TUCKED IN behind the elegant squares of landlocked Canonbury, in north
London, is a ship. This great vessel with its muster stations, its control
room, its metal bunks, and its velvet and gold officers' mess, is in perfect
working order and sets sail twice a week. On board are 40 inner-city youth
saluting, stomping up and down and bellowing orders as if a gale was
whipping around.
This is Islington's Sea Cadet Corps. Banned by the council from parading in
Islington's parks and from recruiting members in the borough's schools, the
unit is happy underground in its converted London Electricity Board
substation on Canonbury Road.
All over the country there are some 16,000 boys and girls between 10 and 18
who each week put on their sailors' hats and shine their shoes until the can
see their faces in the toe caps. They shake tin cans for good causes, play
in military bands, have their uniforms inspected, learn old-fashioned,
patriotic values and, if they are lucky, go to sea on their very own ship,
the TS Royalist.
Even more out of kilter with civilian 1990s Britain are the grown up
volunteers. By day they are lorry drivers or firemen, but at night are
fearless leaders, immaculate in their sea dress and commanding the
unquestioning obedience of their ship's company.
Lt Cmdr Bev Johns, Islington's commanding officer, is in the construction
trade. He designed and built the Canonbury ship, and spends nearly every
evening and weekend on sea cadet business. He is married to the movement:
his handsome wife is his First Lieutenant, his grown up daughter, his Petty
Officer.
The three of them run a tight ship. Kind and supportive to good boys and
girls, they brook no opposition. Aspiring cadets are told what they are
letting themselves in for from the outset: 'We are on first name terms here,
and my first name is spelt S-I-R', Johns tells each newcomer.
Those same 'first name' terms apply to his wife and daughter: everyone on
board is aware of their rank and behaves accordingly. Anyone who does not
tow the line is told by Johns: 'Knuckle under son, or it's O-U-T'. He tells
with satisfaction how he has recently done a little pruning among the older
cadets who were 'getting stroppy, not turning up, or not turning up in
uniform'.
There was no sign of stroppiness among the ships company on the Tuesday
night I visited. At precisely 20.00 hours a bugle sounded and Lt Cmdr Johns
and I joined the ship's company on deck. 'One minute to colours' someone
yells. 'Ships company turn right and left'. With perfect military timing
about three dozen boys and girls do as they are told. Some giggle a little
as I collide with a retreating flag bearer, but most are looking straight
ahead, intent on the job in hand. Eventually, with a good deal more shouting
and stamping, flags are hoisted, and the order 'Colours completed]' goes
out.
The bugle sounds again, and the company disperses into classes, to practice
in the band, to learn the history of the sea cadets or to prepare to climb
the greasy pole to the next rank up.
Upstairs in the officers' mess, which is modelled on Nelson's cabin in the
Victory, a nine-year-old in full uniform stands ramrod straight, staring in
front of him. 'Sir]', he salutes as he places a plate of wafer biscuits on
the table.
'He's my mascot', says Johns. 'He first came here with his older brother,
and used to be a real S-O-D, but look at him now.'
Of the 40 cadets in his unit, Johns reckons only five or six have what he
calls a 'proper family life'. For the rest he acts by turn as a surrogate
father, a welfare officer and a vigilante. 'We've had everything here', he
says. 'Females who've been sexually abused, males who've been sexually
abused, children with burn marks.' He has an effective way of dealing with
fathers who beat up their children. 'A young boy came here with a cut on his
head. I decided enough is enough, and summoned two of my sergeants and we
went round to see him. I said 'If your son has one mark on his body, we'll
be round to repeat whatever you have done to him.'
After tea and biscuits in the mess we descend the precarious ship's ladder
so that I can chat to the cadets themselves. The band's deafening rendering
of When the Saints Go Marching In is interrupted, and Petty Officer Johns
lines up a selection of cadets to be interviewed. 'You] You] You]' she
barks, picking out a selection and making sure each rank, sex and race is
represented. They stand to attention in a line of declining seniority, and,
like the Queen, I pass along saying a few words to each one.
Most said they joined because relations or friends were in the cadets,
although one girl had been inspired by a visit to the Royal Tournament, and
another had 'read an advertisement in a book'. All said they liked the
drill, the band, the trips, the camping, the uniform. One 11-year-old simply
liked 'evryfink'. They showed badges with pride: one has earned a cooks
badge, another the badge of electrical engineer.
Indeed, they like it so well, that almost all want to join the Royal Navy or
the Marines, so that they can go on being sea cadets forever.
The Islington sea cadets, it seems, are in blissful ignorance of the fact
that navy and the marines are in retreat, and that the Wrens are to be wound
up altogether. One boy said he was doing an arts and design course as a fall
back, although most seemed to think that a future at sea was waiting for
them.
Whatever the cadets themselves think, the movement's top brass has long
ceased to justify its existance in terms of creating future sailors. The sea
cadets, which are partly funded by, yet independent from, the navy, hope
that their fortunes can wax even while those of the navy wane.
Captain Peter Grindal, a retired naval officer who has been running the
cadets for a year, has a master plan for a nautical, rather than military
youth organisation with a powerful social conscience. He has called in the
image consultants, the advertising agencies, and the public relations
experts, in the hope of increasing the number of cadets, and filling the
movement's coffers with private money at the same time.
The advertising people have come up with the idea that being a sea scout is
'Serious Fun'. According to Grindal the serious bit involves teaching them
to to 'dress properly, stand still and do as they are told'. It is about
teaching young people 'willing obedience and then as they get older teaching
them to lead'. The fun part is the messing about on boats and the
camaraderie.
'We want to attract people for whom we can do the most, and that means the
people who have the least. We give them a sense of belonging when they don't
belong to anything else'.
The cadets themselves are not just recipients of charity, but donors of it
too. At Stoke Newington a group of 20 boys and 18 girls are to be found
weeding and scrubbing graffiti off the local war memorial, and running bingo
sessions at a nearby old peoples' home.
In spite of the good civilian work, the cadets remain heavily dependent on
the navy for both money and magic. Should the Navy decide it can no longer
afford to supply the Pounds 7m or so every year, the cadets would have to
shake their tin cans very hard indeed. And should one day the uniforms go,
one wonders if they would all turn up week after week if they could not
indulge in the fantasy of the regiment at sea.

FT  02 OCT 93 / As They Say in Europe: The confusing route to press freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPENDING a few days in the US always leads, at least in my case, to a
renewed awareness of the prestige of newspapers and the written word. I was
first struck by a story in the New York Times last weekend which opened with
the words, 'On an April evening this year, three women stopped outside the
student union building building at Pennsylvania State University and began
throwing thousands of copies of a conservative-run newspaper into their car,
plunging the campus into a debate over free speech and the limits of
protest.'
The problem had arisen over the paper's depiction of a female columnist on a
rival publication wearing a bikini. In the cartoon she sits on a bed whose
headboard reads, 'feminist at work.' A professor of women's studies at the
university called the theft of the newspapers a legitimate response to the
paper's campaign of harassment against women.
The next day the same paper carried a front page story about the mandatory
sexual consent workshops that are part of student life at Antioch College in
Ohio. The code, in the words of its advocate, one Karen Hall, starts: 'If
you want to take her blouse off you have to to ask.' It continues with a
litany of injunctions (I will not communicate them in a respectable
newspaper) that end always end with ' . . . you have to ask.'
This awareness of the role of the law and the word in relations between the
sexes in the US was further enhanced by a campaign launched by the powerful
gun lobby, the National Rifle Association.
It is putting advertisements in the Ladies' Home Journal. You do not
actually see a picture of an M-16 nestling against publicity material for
Calvin Klein's Obsession, just a plea to consider the nature of the right to
own an M-16.
In western Europe there is nothing to match the rich variety of American
freedoms and debate, nothing like the argument over whether the theft of
newspapers is a form of 'counterspeech.'
And no young man believes that his assumed right to investigate the
intricacies of his girlfriend's blouse might lead to his being blown away by
a semi-automatic rifle as the woman asserts her right to say, 'No]'
In Europe there are few strict laws on rights and wrongs: incitement to
racial hatred is one example, but rarely does a legal debate ensue.
Among the variations are the rigid British rules on reporting judicial
matters: you can read that the 'murderer has been taken into custody' in the
papers of almost any country. But in Britain one can go no farther than 'a
man is helping police with their inquiries.' At times news stories become
virtually incomprehensible as a result, since these 'inquiries' may take
place years after the original incident.
In the Mediterranean, it is not the word (and certainly not prisoner's
rights) that is sacred but the picture. Picture book news is an essential
part of Latin culture and accounts for the success of a magazine like Hola]
In Spain people know how to read the pictures.
They note that in British newspapers there are never pictures of mutilated
corpses, nasty wounds, or grimacing heads poking out of the ends of
stretchers. The grisly picture is an essential part of the Mediterranean
story, the public's right to know.
In the US the result is similar, for pictures enjoy the protection of
legislation guaranteeing freedom of speech, even pornographic pictures are
protected by the First Amendment even though they are decorated by scarcely
a word of print.
In Britain the concept of the 'inalienable right' seems to apply most
importantly to the right to publish trivia. These include information on the
identity and habits of cabinet ministers' mistresses, the long-forgotten
misdemeanours of those who appear in television soap operas and speculation
about what members of the royal family might have said in private.
But the 'right of the public to know,' as it is called, does not apply to
information on how decisions are reached to impose new forms of taxation or
to the nature of the advice received by those who run the affairs of the
nation.
In the US if newspapers wish to find out about such matters there are no
laws to stop them, in Germany they leak out through the amazingly diverse
components of the power structure in that country. But there 'the right to
know' seems to consist of the absolute right of German newspaper readers to
know what journalists think, for the opinions of these important people are
given pride of place on the front page of the better sort of paper. That
presumably is a reaction to the earlier situation where the opinion of only
one person appeared.
So it is that what one nation regards as an absolutely essential element of
a free society is prohibited or despised in another. How can those peoples
who have so recently embarked on the road to freedom and democracy must be
dazed and confused by the conflicting choice of routes on offer?

FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: Bristol romps along, London overreaches - Theatre on
the Fringe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE and MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEN &amp; Chicken Theatre in south Bristol is a rare bird in the South West
of England: pub theatre of national quality. Last year the resident company,
Show of Strength, won a London Weekend Television Plays on Stage award to
produce Fanny Burney's unperformed play A Busy Day (probably 1800-01). Now
the Pounds 14,000 prize has been spent, and the result is a fizzing
production of a very funny play in an exciting venue.
Burney's life (1752-1840) was a catalogue of adversity. Her mother died when
she was ten, she outlived her sister and son, and survived a mastectomy
without anaesthesia in 1811. Her husband, Alexandre D'Arblay  - who wrote
down the manuscript of A Busy Day - was exiled to France during the
Napoleonic wars, was kicked by a horse at Waterloo, and died in 1818.
Burney's reputation has rested on her diary and four novels; in the 1980s,
her work was the sine qua non of any politically correct university
syllabus.
A Busy Day draws on the restoration comedy of Etherege, Wycherley and
Vanburgh and continues the tradition of English social comedy from Ben
Jonson to Mike Leigh. It has the pace of Fielding and the whimsy of Peacock.
But like all of its kind, it deals principally with money and manners.
The text here is cut, with some initial confusion, but the plot romps along.
Eliza Watts, born to a working-class City family, but adopted and brought up
in a middle-class home, returns to London to meet her now very rich natural
parents. She will marry a Mr Cleveland of impeccable but impoverished stock.
The pretentious Wattses embarrass Eliza, while a stray fiancee and a raffish
younger brother add to Cleveland's difficulties; so City arrivisme meets
metropolitan savoir faire, with Eliza and Cleveland caught between.
Cleveland's condescending uncle and aunt preside over the mess. Never has
Bond Street been farther from St James's, nor Kensington perched more
precariously on the rim of the hub of decency.
The language rattles along with 'pish', 'devilled', 'deuced' and
'confounded' at every turn. There are more crafted moments, between
Cleveland's extravagantly romantic fiancee (played by Juliette Grassby) and
his needy brother (Ian Kelly): 'You're always very stupid, I must say that
for you', she says. Opposite her, he is all thesaurus: 'Allow me, Madam?
Nay, ordain, enjoin, command, insist]' Between them, they have the play's
best scenes. She asks him, 'Do you not think that young lady ugly?' and he
replies, 'she stands so near to you that I cannot judge.' The other
principals, Wendy Hewitt as Eliza and Richard Stemp as Cleveland are at the
mercy of their characters; in this game, the righteous are never as
appealing as the rakish.
The direction (Alan Coveney) could be tighter and the acting more fluid and
less forced, but overall the staging, the open in-the- round set (Elizabeth
Bowden) and the costumes are a delight. Burney would have approved. She was
Queen Charlotte's Second Keeper of Robes until 1791.
Sometimes even the best of the London fringe theatres overreach themselves.
This has happened on at least three occasions in the last few weeks. The
Bush put on a play - Chris Hannan's The Baby set in Rome 78 BC - in the
mistaken belief that the author is a maturing writer. The piece was simply
not good enough for the performance nor for the standards we have come to
expect from that theatre.
The Gate spoiled its re-opening, after some splendid refurbishing with the
help of Allied Lyons, by arbitrarily transposing Ramon Valle-Inclan's
Bohemian Lights from Spain to Ireland. The experiment might have worked if
most of the audience had been already familiar with the original setting.
One doubts if they were. In practice, the production was perverse: too
clever by half. And I also think that the Almeida, if it can still be called
a fringe theatre, made a mess of the staging of Harold Pinter's Moonlight.
It might look a much better play in another place.
The overreaching occurs again at the New End in Hampstead where there is a
revival of Andorra by Max Frisch. In the past year or two the New End has
had one of the best track records of any fringe theatre in London, including
revivals of Pirandello and JR Ackerley's The Prisoners of War. Andorra,
first performed in Zurich in 1961, is one of the most striking and memorable
of postwar European plays. The challenge of carrying it off on a small stage
in Hampstead in 1993 is enormous.
One hoped for the best, as always, but they just cannot do it. Andorra has a
large cast, a minimum of 15 if you include the silent characters. It also
has a huge subject. Basically it is about questions of Jewishness and
nationalism and what happened in in Europe in the run-up to, and during, the
second world war. In fact, it is more subtle and timeless than that. Germany
is not mentioned. Andorra is a fictitious place, not even a replica of
Frisch's native land of Switzerland. The piece is about outsiders anywhere
and suspicions within communities and across frontiers. The Jewish theme was
topical, but it could be black and white, catholics and protestants.
The man accused of being Jewish in Andorra is not Jewish at all. He is the
illegitimate child of an extramarital liaison. His father simply said that
he was Jewish as a way of adopting him and bringing him into respectable
family life. This was presented as an act of charity at a time when helping
poor Jews was seen as a good cause. Times change.
These are deep and fascinating waters, not easy to navigate. Anyone who has
not seen Andorra before and who lives in Hampstead should make a short
journey to see it. The defects are that the production is out of its depth,
that the set, which is meant to be a small square in a southern European
town, looks more like a sheet-lined waiting room in a hospital, and that
most of the cast are not up to their parts. It would be invidious to name
names, but if fringe theatre is to maintain its growing reputation, it
should remember that its abilities do not always live up to its aspirations.
A Busy Day until October 23 at the Hen &amp; Chicken, Bedminster, Bristol 0272
537735; Andorra at the New End, Hampstead until October 24. (071) 794 0022

FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: 'Cornet Rilke' arrives - Andrew Clark admires the
music of Siegfried Matthus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ASKED ABOUT artistic freedom in East Berlin during the Communist era,
Siegfried Matthus quotes a saying about how the city was divided into three
sectors - east, west and the Komische Oper.
Matthus should know: he has spent most of his working life as the Komische
Oper's resident composer. The popular opera company founded by Walter
Felsenstein after the war had a privileged existence under the Communists.
It promoted concerts of avant-garde music which was officially banned. It
taught Matthus much of what he knows about music theatre and premiered
several of his operas. But only now, as he approaches his 60th birthday, is
he winning the international recognition that is his due.
On Monday, Glyndebourne Touring Opera will give the British premiere of
Cornet Christoph Rilke's Song of Love and Death, the most widely-performed
of Matthus's eight operas and the first to be staged in the UK. Although
Matthus has written a large body of instrumental music, he has made a much
bigger impact with his operas. Like 18th century court composers who were
part of a working ensemble, tailoring their music to available resources,
Matthus has operated within clear boundaries - unwritten but understood by
artist and patron - and has always made sure his operas communicated
directly. Here is a composer who is modern but approachable, who understands
the theatre intimately and uses his own voice to build on German operatic
tradition.
Matthus was born in 1934 in East Prussia. As a child he played the piano and
accordion in his father's dance band. When the Red Army swept across eastern
Europe in 1944, the Matthus family fled west in a horse-cart, ending up at
Rheinsberg north of Berlin. Another day's journey and they would have
reached Allied territory. Instead, Matthus grew up in the newly-created
German Democratic Republic.
As a composition student in East Berlin, his most influential teacher was
Hanns Eisler - disciple of Schoenberg, friend of Brecht and advocate of the
'social' function of music. Matthus gained valuable experience composing for
radio plays and television, learning how to assign specific sound colours to
each role and situation. Foreign travel may have been out of the question,
but unlike colleagues in the capitalist west, Matthus developed within a
system that proclaimed a utopian view of art, protecting those with talent
from the need to sell it. When he was 30, he had his first opera premiered
at Karl-Marx-Stadt (now Chemnitz). Felsenstein heard it, and promptly
engaged him at the Komische Oper.
Matthus had learned from Eisler how to strip a text to the bone before
setting it to music; Felsenstein taught him 'how to analyse an opera from
the bottom up, from a standpoint not of knowledge but of ignorance  - like a
child, every detail questioned and researched. It was marvellous to discover
day by day how a work came into being, to see it take theatrical form on
stage'. The Komische Oper taught him what worked and did not work, and made
him realise that 'true operatic music must provoke theatre by characterising
situations and personalities'. Therein lies the key to Matthus's art. His
operas are neither experimental nor philosophical - they are concise,
singable and immediate in dramatic impact.
With few exceptions, they also have a strong political viewpoint. The Final
Shot (1967), a story about the Russian revolution, examines the conflict
between love and ideology. Count Mirabeau (1989), a portrait of one of the
more colourful French revolutionaries, is about the way individuals fashion
history - not the other way round, as Matthus's Marxist teachers would have
had him believe. Desdemona and her Sisters (1991) has a strong feminist
message.
Cornet Rilke, written for the reopening of Dresden's Semper Oper in 1985,
has an anti-war theme. The text is the composer's arrangement of Rainer
Maria Rilke's early novella, recounting the brief life of a 17th century
ancestor who was killed defending Europe against the heathen Turkish hordes.
Cornet, or standard-bearer, was the title given to the youngest officer in a
cavalry division. A special knapsack edition of the poem accompanied young
Germans to the 1914-18 front, inspiring them with visions of glorious death
in defence of the Fatherland.
Without destroying the dream-like mood of romance, Matthus interprets it as
'the tragedy of a young man caught up in the frightful events of war, who
overcomes the crisis of puberty by a great love experience . . . and goes
blindly to his death'. Subtitled an 'operatic vision', Cornet Rilke offers
little in the way of conventional dialogue or narrative. What it does
provide is a 90-minute sequence of thoughts, feelings and impressions,
clothed in music of lyrical power and dramatic sensibility.
Here are all Matthus's mature hallmarks - the undogmatic serialism, the
dense tone-clusters, the writing of vocal and instrumental parts in similar
or identical lines at narrow intervals, sometimes in canon. Another typical
device is the thought-voice, a 'double' for both the Cornet and the
mysterious Countess who provides his night of love. The Cornet is a trouser
role for mezzo, suggesting a Cherubino-like gallantry. With only 11
instrumentalists, Cornet Rilke has the air of a chamber opera, but conjures
grander visions when the chorus - in effect, Matthus's main orchestra - is
in full cry. Despite one or two over-extended scenes, the opera succeeds in
matching the emotional power of the poem.
Glyndebourne Touring Opera's London season at Sadler's Wells Theatre
continues till October 9, followed by visits to Norwich, Plymouth,
Manchester, Oxford and Southampton

FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: Tavener turns to Akhmatova
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERIC DUNNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR almost two decades Cricklade has hosted an intimate festival of music
based on the towered Cotswold church of St Sampson's.
The Moscow Orthodox Choir, Budapest Strings and Chilingirian Quartet have
all been featured, plus a stream of vocal and instrumental soloists of the
front rank. This year saw the commissioning, with help from Southern Arts,
of a new song cycle from John Tavener for the soprano Patricia Rozario, who
sang the title role in the premiere of Tavener's latest opera, Mary of
Egypt, at Aldeburgh last year.
Only last summer Tavener's A Village Wedding, a new set of Greek songs
written for the Hilliard Ensemble, was heard at the Vale of Glamorgan
Festival. Now he has turned to the writings of Anna Akhmatova, the poet who
witnessed the hopes and reversals of revolution and survived the cultural
attacks of Zhdanov, to be rehabilitated under Khrushchev as one of the
giants of Russian 20th century literature.
Tavener's Akhmatova Songs for voice and cello are, as one might expect of
this composer, simple and monodic. They are sung in Russian, though assisted
by clear translations. The first three poems evoke the work of other
writers: Dante, Pushkin, Lermontov and Pasternak. The first serves as a
prelude, a fragile melody in minor key in which voice and cello (Steven
Isserlis) echo each other; in the next, the vocal line rides high above soft
cello intervals of a rising and falling sixth.
Despite a beautiful sound, Miss Rozario never quite caught the fluid,
relaxed zeal of the third (marked 'innocent') while Isserlis' sforzandi
seemed unduly muted. Uncharacteristically, neither performer seemed fully
abreast of Tavener's flowing lines and measured pauses; while the church's
acoustic appeared muffled by the tendency of the sound to channel upwards.
The fourth song - a series of glissandoed arpeggios culminating in voice and
cello settling on a held D and E flat - proved a turning point. 'The Muse'
('. . . Did you dictate to Dante the script of Hell?') descended to
precisely the awesome close the composer intended; while the whispered final
song, and epilogue and recapitulation, saw a return to Akhmatova's favoured
theme of death.
This compact cycle may not easily stand alongside more revealing settings of
Akhmatova by Shostakovich and others, but in the last two songs in
particular Tavener made good use of both performers.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: Shaw and friends entertain in Ontario
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TANITCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHAW Festival at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, began in 1962 in the
Assembly Rooms of the Court House with eight week-end performances of Don
Juan in Hell and Candida. Thirty-one years later it has three theatres and
runs from April to November.
The Festival's mandate is the plays of Bernard Shaw and his contemporaries,
which is not as restrictive as may at first seem, since he was born in 1856
and did not die until 1950. The present season (artistic director:
Christopher Newton) includes three Shaws; plays by Henry Arthur Jones,
Harley Granville Barker, Carl Sternheim, Noel Coward; a Broadway musical;
and a famous thriller.
The major talking point has been Neil Munro's production of Saint Joan,
designed by Cameron Porteus. The 100 Years War is brought into the 20th
century with jets, jeeps, searchlights, automatic weapons and computers.
Nobody wears medieval dress until the Epilogue. The ethnic cleansing
prologue with its reference to Bosnia was unnecessary, the telephone
conversations artificial, the paper-shredder distracting and I was irritated
that so much dialogue was spoken behind Porteus's monolithic pillars. The
scenes with the Dauphin do not work at all in modern dress.
The Earl of Warwick pressing the Bishop of Beauvais to burn Joan should have
worked: unfortunately, it is staged too far back, under the huge wing of an
enormous bomber, and the argument plays a subordinate role to the sound of
machine gun fire and bombs dropping. The trial, conducted by Barry
MacGregor's excellent Inquisitor and acted with the houselights up, works.
The proceedings become a committee hearing, with the court seated in front
of microphones. Joan (Mary Haney) sits with her back to the audience, her
weary, bewildered, intelligent face seen in huge close-up on the banked
television monitors either side of the stage.
Neil Munro also directs an elegiac production of Harley Granville Barker's
The Marrying of Ann Leete, written in 1899 when he was 22, which has had
only two productions in England. The subject matter is class distinction,
politics, social rebellion and the role of women in society in the late 18th
century. Ann (Ann Baggley), observing the unhappy marriage of her sister
(Seanna McKenna, a beautiful performance), refuses to be a political pawn
and proposes to the gardener. The fragmentary scenes and half-heard
conversations in the garden at night are brilliantly orchestrated. The
acting of the whole company is a joy and Yvonne Sauroil's garden, designed
for the round, is charming.
I had no idea how funny Carl Sternheim's The Unmentionables could be until I
saw director Paul Lampert's very accessible update (written with Kate
Sullivan) which transfers the satire at the expense of the petit bourgeoisie
in Berlin in 1911 to suburban America in the 1950s. The action, directed at
a fast pace, is punctuated by commercial jingles, which can be enjoyed
either as social comment on consumerism or as nostalgia.
A civil servant's wife's knickers fall down in the street during a civic
parade. Shortly afterwards two men turn up seeking lodgings and her favours.
The only person, however, to have any sex is the pragmatic husband (Norman
Browning, hilarious), a belligerent philistine, who beds his wife's best
friend. William Vickers as a hypochondriac barber and Peter Millard as a
French diplomat are very funny as the lodgers. 'I am a church bell,' says
the latter. 'My rope hangs limp. give it a tug.' Sauroil's set, all vinyl
kitsch in ghastly yellows and pinks, matches the vulgarity of the action.
It takes a sophisticated audience these days to accept so naive and working
class an entertainment as Victorian melodrama. Henry Arthur Jones's The
Silver King tells a sentimental story of crime, suffering, repentance and
redemption. It is a measure of Christopher Newton's respect for the genre
that the audience is not encourage to boo the villain (Barry MacGregor,
first rate) nor cheer the hero (Stuart Hughes) until the final scene.
Designer Leslie Franklish erects a vast scaffolding and the production draws
on Dore, Frith, Dickens and images of the Industrial Revolution.
Newton also gauges the comedy, farce and pathos of Shaw's Candida perfectly;
but Noel Coward's Blythe Spirit needed a ghost less vulgar, more ethereal.
The Festival has the excellent policy of putting on a Shavian one-acter at
mid-day, an idea which out own National theatre might copy and extend to
other playwrights. The jokes at the expense of English imperialism in The
Man of Destiny go down extremely well with the Canadian/American audience.
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, the Jule Styne and Leo Robin musical, based on
Anita Loos's best selling novel and Agatha Christie's And Then There Were
None are aimed strictly at the tourist market (and why not?) and have been
playing to full houses. The strength of the Shaw Festival is that it caters
for both the serious theatregoer and the coach parties.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: Present day fairy tales - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAIRY tales in this century have chosen cinema as their natural domain.
Finding enchantment-mileage in Moviedom's facilities for fantasy - trick
photography, animation, modelwork, music - they have also broadened the very
definition of what they are. 'Fairy tales' for filmgoers are not just fables
about princesses, frogs and witches. They can be almost any romance which
raises the 'real' to the fantastical by exploiting the tropes of the medium.
Stars; exotic scenery; hi-fi moral lessons; ritualised, music-washed happy
endings.
Disney's Beauty And The Beast (Buena Vista) is October's field-leader in the
Traditional Fairy Tale stakes. But the new video month also boasts Scent Of
A Woman (CIC), Forever Young (Warner), Accidental Hero (Columbia) and a
dozen other runners and riders competing for the Romantic Fable Trophy
(sometimes incorporating the High-Class Schmaltz Medallion).
The Disney film is delight at 24 frames-a-second. The studio recaptures its
finest touch, scattering stardust over every component. Music; comedy;
artwork (wind-wracked castles, wolf-prowled snowy forests); romance (who
will resist a sob at the Beast's final love declaration?)
But Hollywood's live-action fables today are scarcely less artfully
choreographed for enchantment and moral parable. What is Scent Of A Woman if
not a buddy-buddy 'Beauty And The Beast'? Al Pacino plays the
heavy-breathing ogre, a suicide-prone blind Colonel going to New York for a
last night on the tiles; and young Chris O'Donnell is the innocent who
strays into his orbit, an ingenu schoolboy escort who first hates but
finally comes to love the old curmudgeon.
If your handkerchief is still dry after that film, how about the cryogenics
weepie Forever Young? This has love-bereaved airman Mel Gibson deep-freezing
himself so that he can wake up 50 years on, far from the pain of loss. Of
course he finds a New Love - or is it the Old Love disguised? - on a scenic,
violin-washed headland.
Then there is Accidental Hero, with Dustin Hoffman as the pauper who saves a
wrecked plane and becomes a media prince; and Boomerang (CIC), with Eddie
Murphy as the go-getting yuppie who finds true love; and Sister Act (Buena
Vista), with Whoopi Goldberg as the gangster's moll who hides in a nunnery
and becomes a Warm, Loving Person.
Transformation; moral uplift; celestial intervention. Hollywood knows when
there are fairies at the bottom of its in-tray. But so - let us be
evenhanded - does art cinema. In today's art cinema especially, storytelling
is back with a vengeance.
We start out watching Sven Nykvist's The Ox (Artificial Eye) or Agnieska
Holland's Olivier Olivier (Tartan) or Claude Sautet's Un Coeur En Hiver
(Artificial Eye) expecting dour, deconstructive works from European Cinema.
But lo] Nykvist's film, based on traditional folk yarn, is a fantasy-touched
fable about a man who rediscovers joy after a jail term for slaying an ox to
feed his starving family. Holland's story of a missing boy who magically
returns to his family - or is it a double? - is a bewitching kiddywink
variant on The Return Of Martin Guerre. And in Sautet's film we sense the
fairy-tale capitalised characters and upper-case emotions as Coldhearted
Violin-maker Daniel Auteuil warms the heart of Beautiful Violinist
Emmanuelle Beart. (But will Cruel Fate intervene?)
Some movies, of course, stretch fairy-tale traditions in a different
direction: away from romance towards farce. When you have had enough of
uplift or high emotion, you should try two cracking comedies that turn
social satire into pantomimic fantasy. Peter Jackson's Braindead (Polygram)
is a New Zealand 'splatter' comedy about the beastly things that happen in
suburbia once flesh-eating zombies are loose. And Paul Bartel's Scenes From
The Class Struggle In Beverly Hills (MGM/UA) does much the same for the land
of the movie stars: though for zombies read film producers, primadonna
actresses and other well known society carnivores.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: After Stevie Smith - Poetry in performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THERE'S ALWAYS another poet,' said that great humourist in verse, Stevie
Smith; but when she died in 1971, readers of poetry might have been forgiven
for wondering whether any of these poets were likely to be female. A quick
look back at some of the most influential poetry anthologies published in
the 1960s and early 1970s seems to suggest otherwise: AL Alvarez's
enormously influential The New Poetry (1963) gave us 18 men and just two
women; British Poetry since 1945 is even more strikingly unbalanced: 81
males to six females. Was this a true representation of the respective
merits of male and female poets at the time - or an example of gender bias
on the part of male editors?
One publisher that has been doing its utmost to let the voices of younger
women poets be heard is Bloodaxe Books of Newcastle, which this week
launched both a new anthology of women's poetry from Britain and Ireland,
Sixty Women Poets, and initiated a country-wide promotion of this book and
six new collections of poetry by women (all represented in the anthology) in
conjunction with Waterstones.
The reading to launch the anthology, convened in an upper room at
Waterstones, Charing Cross Road, was steamy with apostolic fervour. Sixteen
of the poets in the anthology read a single poem each; and then came a wide
ranging debate on some of the tougher issues of women and their writing.
The poets who read, like the anthology itself, ranged widely in mood and
subject matter: Pauline Stainer, in a remarkable short poem, memorialised
the firefighters of Chernobyl; novelist and poet Elaine Feinstein celebrated
the unexpected pleasures of ageing; Jenny Joseph wrote of the difficulties
of naming things, the problem of bridging the gap between the name and what
is named; Moniza Alvi, born in Pakistan, read 'The Sari', a poem in which
she imagined herself a foetus inside her mother's body who is able to look
out and see her future stretching ahead of her; Hilary Davies, in 'The
Ophthalmologist', described an eye examination, the eerie touch of prying
fingers on the skin; Connie Bensley, one of the older poets represented,
gave us in her small, meticulous, Home Counties voice, a delightful poetic
miniature of three elderly aunts in a garden, fat, comfortable, benign.
The anthology represents a selection of the best work from the past 20
years, taking Stevie Smith's death as its starting point. Many readers will
baulk at the very idea of a gender-based anthology: is not the purpose of
poetry - as of any art - to unite people and not to divide them?
But such an anthology as this one was needed. Women poets have been
under-represented; and anyone who dips into this one will find evidence
everywhere of the way in which female poets have gained a new confidence
both in their own abilities and their power to speak out on matters of every
kind in recent years.
This is not a collection of poems about 'purely domestic' or 'female'
matters. Erotic, rambunctious, gutsy, it reads like a celebration by women
as writers, equal, both in talent and thematic range, to any of the male
poets writing today. Nor is this a carping, defensive book as it might have
been if it had been published when the women's movement was at its most
vocal. It quietly assumes that certain battles have been fought and won. It
deserves to be read if only for the pleasure of discovering some of the
older women poets - Elizabeth Bartlett and EJ Scovell, for example - who
might have been in many earlier anthologies if the anthologists had thought
them worthy of attention. And - the greatest pleasure of all - the poetry is
unpretentious. You do not need an English degree to enjoy this book of
poems.
Sixty Women Poets, edited by Linda France, Bloodaxe Books Pounds 6.95. Poets
published this month include: The Country at my Shoulder, Moniza Alvi
(Oxford, Pounds 6.99); Angel, Ruth Padel, (Bloodaxe, Pounds 6.95); Other
Lovers, Jackie Kay, (Bloodaxe, Pounds 5.95); and White Eyes, Dark Ages,
Deborah Randall (Bloodaxe, Pounds 5.95).

FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: Artists open their doors - Lynn MacRitchie finds SPACE
full of community spirit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM THE East End to Vauxhall, more than 200 painters, sculptors,
photographers, printmakers, installation and film and video artists will be
'at home' to the public during the first three weekends in October, giving
an opportunity to glimpse their working environment as well as to admire -
or to buy - their finished products. The occasion is the 25th birthday of
SPACE, the remarkable organisation founded by artists in 1968 and still
going very strong today, finding, renovating and renting out cheap studio
accommodation.
Studio visits and tours are complemented by events and exhibitions
throughout the month. This weekend, things kick off with the opening of the
studios at Lea Bridge Road, Eastway Baths, and Britannia Works. Events
include jazz and performance arts at Lea Bridge accompanying an auction of
sculpture, painting, prints and works on paper, the proceeds from which will
go to the Robert Grace Trust, a charity which provides practical support for
people with Aids and their carers. Artists from the studios at Dace Road
have donated a portfolio of prints for the auction.
At Eastway Baths, an outdoor sculpture exhibition has been mounted including
site-specific installations, wall pieces and free standing work. Another,
limited edition print portfolio has been produced by the artists from
Britannia Works, which will be exhibited and on sale at The Gallery at John
Jones. All proceeds from sales of the portfolio, a limited edition of 12,
will go to fund educational workshops organised by the artists for local
community groups.
This commitment by SPACE artists to working with the communities in which
their studios are located has always been an important aspect of the
organisation. The acronym stands for Space Provision, Artistic, Cultural,
and Educational, and one of its aims is to offer cultural and educational
activities run by artist members or making use of its accommodation. The
artists are thus recognised not as freeloaders, dropping in to a poor or run
down area to get what they can out of it, but as a stable part of the
community, offering an open door to a creative and supportive environment.
The artists who founded SPACE Studios (and its associated organisation AIR,
the Art Information Registry) in the late 1960s were a wide ranging group
which including Bridget Riley and Peter Sedgley. SPACE and AIR merged into
the charity Art Services Grants Ltd (ASG) in about 1973 and it is under
these auspices that SPACE continues its work today, with funding from the
London Arts Board.
SPACE and AIR were not the only artists organisations set up in the late
1960s and early '70s but SPACE is one of the few to have survived with its
aims and methods almost intact. The notion of democracy in the arts was very
much part of the mood of those times. The artists associated with AIR and
SPACE and other organisations such as the Artists Union, the Artists
Placement Group and various women artists groups actively tried to intervene
in the Arts Council's awards procedures, for example, or protested at the
methods of selection of prestigious exhibitions. Much of the artwork of
those times was similarly questioning of the status quo, breaking down
barriers and exploring new materials and ways of making art and of making
art accessible.
Artists once again face hard times. Galleries are closing, funding has been
slashed and patrons are both few and cautious of new work. Once again the
empty buildings of the city hold out a promise - but this time it is
developers and landlords who are asking the artists in, to fill the empty
spaces nobody wants to rent. In response, SPACE has become professionalised.
Running a charity now, in the words of its director, Eva Woloshyn, is like
running a business, a business which must be as dynamic and efficient as
possible. Although SPACE had difficulties during the property boom of the
1980s, it managed to hang on to its property portfolio. During the
recession, its charitable status has proved a source of strength. A
prospective tenant who is entitled to a mandatory 80 per cent rebate on the
standard business rate is a welcome sight to landlords whose more
conventional tenants have been driven out of business by rate increases,
leaving behind empty properties. Offers of buildings are carefully
considered, with the amount of work required to convert them now seen not as
a labour of love but as a cost which must be recouped over time.
SPACE's days of taking on anything, working for nothing and moving on are
over. The old commitment to bringing artists into closer contact with the
community remains, however. Eva Woloshyn believes that, in the properties it
leases from the public sector, SPACE can take buildings which have been lost
to the public through local authority spending cuts back into community use,
as has been done at the Eastway Baths in Hackney, for example. The open
studio weekends are a vital part of this process, as well as a great deal of
fun.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: The scourge of God - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
RADIO 3 resumed its Marlowe season on Sunday with a whole evening of
Tamburlaine the Great, both parts. It took almost four hours. There was of
course a good deal of cutting, but not of narrative lines, only of
repetitive description or of lists of proper names. I was sorry, all the
same, not to hear the prologue; where Marlowe promises to lead us from
'jigging lines of rhyming mother-wits' to 'the stately tent of war', for he
put the same feeling into the play itself. Minor Asian kings yield their
crowns almost at once when confronted, not so much with conquest by
Tamburlaine, as with verbal challenge. But there is conquest enough later.
The plot tells of little beyond its account of the conquests of Tamburlaine,
'the scourge of God', over every middle-Eastern kingdom he set his eyes on.
There is not much account of the fighting; though the so-called incidental
music by Paddy Cuneen makes a quasi-military sound between scenes. There is
much interest in the encounters between Tamburlaine and his various
opponents. Even in appallingly sad moments, Marlowe is as poetic as
terrible. Six virgins sue for peace at Damascus. 'Behold my sword,'
Tamburlaine invites them. 'What see you at the point?' 'Nothing but fear and
fatal steel, my lord.' 'Your fearful minds are thick and misty, then - for
there sits Death, there sits imperious Death.' They are impaled on the
walls.
Not many characters emerge as heroic, apart from Bajazeth the Turk, captured
in the victory over the King of Fez and hideously ill-treated instead of
being massacred like most of Tamburlaine's captives. Rudolph Walker has an
attractive voice with a hint of the West Indies.
There had to be romance, and Tamburlaine is matched with Zenocrate, who
bears him three sons, two of them like their father, the third a believer in
humanity to one's enemies (no future for him). Zenocrate was beautifully
played by Samantha Bond, with the right touch of courage, even at her death.
Michael Pennington was an admirable Tamburlaine. On air, he did not have to
give a bravura performance, only to speak Marlowe's matchless verse just a
touch more importantly than his admirable associates, and this he did
exactly. The director, Michael Fox, might have been more particular about
the 'eds' in past participles, but I won't make any complaint against such a
beautiful programme.
Back to the 'stately tent of war' on Thursday in Dirty Tricks, a new Radio 4
series about the use of deceit in war, presented by Peter Snow. The first
programme was sub-headed The Lessons of Troy, the reference being of course
to the wooden horse. Those are fairly broad lessons, and in 40 minutes we
were in Yorktown with Washington, in Palestine with Allenby, on the coast
with Admiral 'Blinker' Hall, at Amiens with Rawlinson, in the Western Desert
with Montgomery. The examples given were based on varying schemes, but
clearly, as warfare gets more sophisticated, deceit will be easier to
contrive and harder to avoid. The Germans before Alamein relied on our false
'going' maps smuggled into their possession. The genuine wooden horses were
the dummy tracks, mock tanks, even the pipeline made of old petrol cans. I
look forward to the later programmes; so far we have hardly dealt with
aerial 'Tac. R' or codes.
The Classic Serial, The Small House at Allington, is going well. Trollope's
upper-middle-class characters find contact with the aristocracy bad for
them, Crosby has jilted Lily Dale in favour of Lady Alexandrina, although
she insists on being called, even at friendly times, 'Lady Alexandrina'.
This fictional quality of the people makes Trollope so good for radio.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: Once upon a town . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THINK OF a town near a capital city which has relics of Neolithic and Iron
Age cave settlements, an Archbishop's Palace with a great hall dating from
the 14th century, and as fine a set of Victorian churches as you will find
anywhere. This little town grew quietly, but its neighbouring capital city
spread and spread until the town was engulfed by the city and umbilically
linked by an iron road to that city's centre.
The iron road went in both directions so that people could flood into the
capital but they could also flood into what had been the little town. Soon
it was hard to tell the difference between the two places the little town
began to look more and more like the capital city with towers of commerce
and routes of concrete.
Poor Croydon, for that was the name of the little old town, lost almost all
traces of its past and settled for the strange role of office limbo,
occupied from nine to five by visiting worker bees. All this happened in the
1960s when East Croydon Station turned into a giant magnet and drew towards
it offices and towers and concrete roads and car parks like strings of giant
iron filings. By any standards the addition of over five million square feet
of offices to any town is a shock, but Croydon coped because, unlike the
doomed Canary Wharf, it had proper and efficient transport links with the
capital and was, whatever you may think of it, a place.
The trouble was that when this little old town decided to grow, it chose the
wrong fairy godmothers in the shape of architects. There is not one new
building of the 1960s of any serious architectural merit in Croydon. All the
old commercial favourites are there. R. Seifert and Partners built their
strange 23-storey octagon. Biscoe and Stanton tried to make concrete look
like folded paper in their building for General Accident - strangely well
named . . . Some 11 acres of Croydon were covered in five years from 1965 by
the dreadful Whitgift Centre designed by the architects Fitzroy Robinson and
Partners. Today it all looks desperately sad and should be demolished.
Instead of grasping the nettle of demolition, the city fathers of Croydon
have decided to go for some fashionable architectural cosmetics. The fact is
that Croydon is worried. It is landed, as are many commercial centres, with
out of date concrete office blocks which daily function less and less well
and embody a kind of an office culture that is increasingly out of date. But
it is highly questionable whether a place like Croydon needs the sort of
random fantasies that have been proposed by the Arts Council backed
Architecture Foundation in the exhibition tent that will stand outside
Croydon's Fairfield Halls for the next three months.
There are some 15 proposals from 15 architectural firms in the exhibition,
Croydon the Future. The centrepiece is a scale model of Croydon which can be
enjoyed with the help of interactive touch screen computer technology. But
the a real problem is that Croydon is not Paris, and this series of Grands
Projets can only ever be the icing on a very dull cake. Indeed some of the
architects, daunted by the terrible reality of the centre of Croydon, have
literally put some icing on the existing buildings.
The entertaining firm of Birds Portchmouth and Russum use the tops of
Croydon's multi-storey car parks as the bases for new inflatable structures
to house 'civic and cultural events.' Its a strangely 1960s idea, but one
that is practical enough to happen. Richard Rogers offers Croydon a skeletal
tower that provides the residents a permanent low energy light show. Future
Systems have designed an elegant bridge that leaps over some of the
dreariest parts of the town centre. The best scheme is one by Richard
Horden, which wraps up a four lane highway, and puts a sheltered pedestrian
zone in the centre large enough to house arts and eating activities.
How wise are the councillors of Croydon to hitch their wagon once again to
an architectural star. They got it commercially right but architecturally
wrong in the 1960s; will the emphasis on design rather than function this
time do the trick to make Croydon an agreeable place? I suspect that the
answer is no. Good makeup cannot hide bad bone structure.
What no one has proposed is that the centre of any city needs people to live
there. When will developers realise that what England badly needs is good
private housing, at least as good as the average Manhattan apartment. Tower
homes in city centres can be fine if they are well designed, well serviced
and supported by sports and leisure facilities. The architectural profession
should take the lead because more and more people are going to live and work
at home.
How exciting it could be if somewhere like Croydon had taken a serious look
at the way we are going to live in cities in the future instead of tacking
on to a decrepit and defunct vision of the 1960s the stylish and often
hopeless nostrums of the 1990s. Poor old Croydon, there is not much hope
here . . .

FT  02 OCT 93 / Collecting: Dealers play it safe - Susan Moore, in Florence,
finds the Italians curiously quiet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN uncharacteristically muted mood settled on last week's gala opening of
the 18th biennial international antiques fair at the Palazzo Strozzi in
Florence.
With most Italians preoccupied by the country's political and economic
uncertainties and worried by the new taxes, it seems unlikely that it was
simply the torrential rain that prompted the diminished attendance and
dampened spirits - and discouraged the usual exuberant immodesty of hemline.
Even the fair's future is in question. After years of discussion, it seems
that the 15th century palace will receive its long-overdue renovation. Top
priority is the removal of the disfiguring 1950s metal fire-escape from the
palace's elegant open courtyard that any number of swags of fruit and
flowers, banners, potted trees or obelisks fail to mask. Will the work be
finished by 1995? Will the exhibitors bear the burden of increased costs?
The fair is synonymous with the Palazzo Strozzi. The city fairground at the
Fortezza da Baso lacks its cachet.
Unlike its counterparts in Milan and Rome, the Florence fair has never been
a pre-eminently commercial event. Few dealers expect to do much business
here.
'I'm here to see that children don't touch anything on Saturdays,' one
gallery assistant quipped. Instead, the fair prides itself on being a
meeting place and a showcase for the best the dealers have to offer, an
elegant event to launch the Florentine autumn season.
Certainly the fair looks better than ever. The small over-stuffed stands
that seemed to transform the Renaissance palazzo into a souk have been
replaced by airier and more gracious spaces. Dealers have been taken out of
the sultry, basement which is now a 'strongroom' for silver and jewellery.
Florentine dealer Giovanni Pratesi, offers a grandiose mixture of the rare
and the historically important. Leone Cei presents fine 17th century
pictures which include striking canvases by the father of Neapolitan
still-life painting, Luca Forte.
A small but choice group of Old Master drawings, shown by Munich dealer
Katrin Bellinger, grace a stand shared with Harari &amp; Johns. Attracting most
attention at the gala, however, was the exhibition of erotic clocks and
watches brought by Swiss watchmakers Blancpain.
As for the top dealers bringing their very best, however: I think not. The
glaring exception is London Old Master dealer Richard Green, exhibiting in
Florence for the first time. His awkward corner stand, more thoroughfare
than gallery, is conspicuous by its quality. It boasts no less than a pair
of Bellottos, two pairs of Canalettos, including rare views of Florence, a
large Boudin, Fantin-Latour roses and a wall of Dutch cabinet pictures. 'The
most expensive corridor in Florence outside the Uffizi,' grins Jonathan
Green. With price tags amounting to some Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.70m) he is
probably right.
Most dealers are playing it safe. Few want to risk exposing their most
important - or their freshest - stock when there is a good chance of it not
selling. The days of frenetic, often indiscriminate buying of Italian art at
crazy prices, where perhaps 70 per cent of pictures sold at auction outside
the country went to Italian bidders, often paying in cash, are over.
It has been possible to do business at the top end of the market, however,
where prices have remained stable. The Italians have long preferred to
confine their bigs deals to the privacy of their own galleries, well away
from the beady gaze of the taxman. 'Perhaps more than ever, the most
important thing is to be discreet', says Alessandro Montanaro of Visconteum.
Most worrying, perhaps, has been the withdrawal from the marketplace of the
professional classes.
However, at least there seems to be some equation between quality and price
in the Italian art market.
Visitors to the Palazzo Strozzi fair will, however, find maddeningly few
descriptive labels and certainly no prices pinned to the walls.
The growing professionalism of the Italian art trade ought to extend to more
rigorous vetting procedures at its antiques fairs, as witnessed at the new
Turin fair recently.
It would also be in the long-term interests of both dealer and collector to
rid themselves of the so-called 'expertises' that plague far too many works
of art.
The fair continues at the Palazzo Strozzi until October 11.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Collecting: A warm welcome for a patchy revival - A whole
raft of fairs is transforming the selling methods of the antiques trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
indeed, throughout the UK - need reasons to open their shops these days.
Trade has been poor for almost three years and the arrival of the busy
autumn season with its rush of auctions, fairs and exhibitions does not by
itself promise any improvement.
If, however, business remains patchy, with some dealers welcoming back
long-lost clients while others wonder if the struggle is worth it, at least
there is a consensus that the worst is over. The economic revival, on which
the profitability of the antiques trade depends, might still be wobbly and
continental dealers, who enthusiastically filled the gap left by the
disappearance of American buyers, are sure to be less active as their
national economies falter. But few imagine a deterioration and many expect a
better year.
The first sprouts of a revival are emerging through the permafrost. Cork
Street, the high street of modern art in London's West End, welcomes two new
dealers: Beaux Art, which is already well established in Bath, and David
Messum who is renting The Gallery, at No 28, until Christmas.
For Messum, this is a remarkably quick comeback after being liquidated by
his bank last year. It discovered he was the best person to sell his stock
of British Impressionists and he is now concentrating on the lower price
range.
Prices this autumn will be no higher than a year ago. This is certainly true
of pictures and antique silver. Good furniture, especially country
furniture, has held its value although Georgian brown furniture is marking
time.
Another dealer to catch the new mood is Alastair Sampson. He is holding a
sale - a clear-out of his Brompton Road stock in west London - in
preparation for a move into smaller premises in Mayfair. Some ceramics are
going at cost, or less.
Also available in London at the moment (at Connaught Brown in Albemarle
Street until October 7) is the Affordable Art exhibition to which many
leading galleries have assigned work priced between Pounds 100 and Pounds
2,500.
Trading through small shops might not be the future for all in the antique
trade, though. Lord Derwent, chairman of the London and Provincial Antique
Dealers' Association (Lapada), lists the problems facing his members on top
of the collapse of the market: the business tax, fire regulations and other
bureaucratic red tape, burglaries, and ram raiders.
He is also concerned that, in the short term, changes in European Community
regulations - which have imposed value-added tax on some imported goods and
limited the traditionally free market in antiques enjoyed by the UK - will
allow France to reassert its historical role in the art trade.
Derwent believes that any substantial revival in turnover waits on a
recovery in the housing market. Not only would this help art-lovers to feel
richer - it would also quicken the rate of house removals, a potent reason
to buy more antique tables, chairs, decorative furnishings and the rest.
More and more dealers, under pressure from bank managers to reduce their
overdrafts, are closing their shops and operating from home, using the many
antique fairs to meet new customers, acquire stock and catch up with trade
news. The fair season never ends, but last weekend marked the start of the
autumn rush with the successful specialist fair of 20th century British art
at the Royal College of Art, which saw established names like Elisabeth
Frink and Graham Sutherland selling well.
On October 12 comes the third show organised by Lapada to promote the stock
of its members. It, too, will be held at the Royal College and the 60-plus
dealers will be working to the theme 'The human form in art.' All the
objects are vetted and range in price from Pounds 50 to Pounds 500,000.
Then comes the November Olympia (to be followed in February by another fair
at the mammoth west London venue, this time with no date restrictions on the
items for sale); the old City of London Fair, formerly at the Barbican but
now moved to the Business Design Centre at London's Angel from October 28;
and the eagerly awaited Harrods Fair, which aims to provide international
collectors with a wonderful excuse for Christmas shopping. These are just
the most prominent of a whole raft of fairs which are transforming the
selling methods of the antiques trade.
Even the dealers wedded to their premises see less of them these days: they
are out hunting for stock. Along with hesitant buyers, the main problem is
the shortage of quality antiques; potential sellers are waiting for prices
to rise.
Even the losses of the Lloyd's Names, many of whom were keen collectors of
antiques, have released few decent items on to the market. But the problems
at Lloyd's have undoubtedly reduced buying demand, especially in regions
like Sussex, although one dealer there is attempting a new approach to
marketing in a cold climate.
Michael Keehan, of Michael Norman Antiques, has just opened the largest
retail antiques furniture store in the country, if not the world.
He has acquired the freehold of the former Maples store in Hove, next door
to Brighton, and is displaying up to 5,000 pieces of 18th and early-19th
century furniture with a total value approaching Pounds 10m. Keehan is
hoping for an annual turnover of Pounds 4m.
The auction houses have few headline-making sales. Christie's has
potentially the top price in London before Christmas with a Gainsborough
landscape of peasants going to market - being sold, amid some controversy,
by Royal Holloway College - on December 10 and expected to make Pounds 4m.
The steady dispersal of the national heritage continues with Lord Radnor's
decision to sell three 16th century bronzes by Giambologna, the Florentine
master, three days earlier. He hopes to raise more than Pounds 750,000 to
secure his family home, Longford Castle in Wiltshire.
Sotheby's sales include a collection of many hundreds of botanical and
ornithological drawings amassed by a Major-General Farquhar in Malacca
around 1815; these are being sold by the Royal Asiatic Society, which should
be Pounds 500,000 richer on October 20. Some members, however, oppose the
sell-off strongly.
In recent months, the dealers have been asserting themselves again, fighting
against the dominance of the salerooms. Their trade bodies, like Lapada and
the British Antiques Dealers Association (Bada), have become more effective.
This autumn, Bada continues its 75th anniversary celebrations with a barrage
of exhibitions by members. These range from 18th century objects of vertu at
Halcyon Days (in Brook Street W1) from October 12, to The Monarchy in
portrait miniatures at DS Lavender (Grafton Street W1) from October 25.
Dealers in the Cotswolds alone have put together 14 exhibitions for the
autumn. In addition, there are such regular autumn exhibitions as the annual
October show of marine paintings at the Royal Exchange Gallery in London
EC3. Indeed, this gallery sums up the trade. Business had been quiet until
August; then, it took off, fuelled by the rise in the stock exchange.
The exchange depends on improving economic indicators for its recovery. If
these look better over the next month or two, then the antiques trade will
have a good year. It is as simple as that.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Books: A case of deception all round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE UNLIKELY SPY by Paul Henderson Bloomsbury Pounds 16.99, 240 pages
THE TRIAL of three former executives of Matrix Churchill, one of Britain's
biggest machine tool manufacturers, for breaching export regulations on
shipments started quietly for a case that was to erupt into one of the
biggest political scandals of our time.
There was little to excite the press as the Old Bailey plodded through
technical issues about lathes used to make weapons for Iraq. Reporters were
reaching for their coats on a typically dreary afternoon when they heard the
sort of words that are guaranteed to stimulate a Pavlovian reaction. Defence
barrister Geoffrey Robertson, QC, was questioning Ron Ash, the company's
head of defence projects.
'Did you know that throughout 1987 and 1988, Mark Gutteridge was working as
an agent for British intelligence?' asked Robertson. Ash looked shocked. He
knew Gutteridge who had been a close colleague at the company, but he did
not know this. 'No,' said Ash.
The deliberate injection of spying activities had the desired affect for the
defence. It made front page headlines in the New York Times the next day and
ensured that the press bench would be packed for the rest of the trial.
Publicity was vital for Robertson's game plan. He knew that his client, Paul
Henderson, Matrix's former managing director, had also worked for the
intelligence services. First he would build up the picture of a hero who
risked his life for his country and second, for good measure, he would
create in the minds of the jury a fourth defendant, absent from the
courtroom - the government itself.
When Alan Clark, the former trade minister, stepped into the witness box to
give evidence for the prosecution, he was the nearest the court would get to
a human manifestation of government. He told the defence that he had coached
machine tool manufacturers on how to couch their licence applications in
terms that would stress the general applications of the machines. He
admitted that he knew the machines would be used for military production.
and he agreed he been economical 'with the accualite.'
The trial was over. The prosecution could not continue with charges to which
the government was an apparent accessory. Clark's performance drew the
admiration of Henderson afterwards as he and his colleagues toasted their
acquittal. Clark had told it how it was. He had not gone along with the
deception.
While the Matrix three had been acquitted, the fourth defendant would be
dragged back for a re-trial in the form of a judicial inquiry before Lord
Justice Scott. Scott's brief was to examine the guidelines on the export of
defence equipment to Iraq.
The issue of the guidelines which has now eclipsed the Matrix Churchill
trial itself was regarded as irrelevant by the Customs and Excise, which
brought the charges. They were merely concerned with the product
descriptions on the licence applications which they said did not accurately
reflect the nature of the exports.
This is one of the remarkable elements of the Matrix case. There was
deception all round and in retrospect, even having read Henderson's own
account, it is difficult to judge just who was deceiving whom about what.
There was double-dealing too. No one was more surprised at Robertson's
question to Ash than Gutteridge. He had agreed to help the defence but had
not intended his name to be introduced in the way that it was. He had not
told his family about his spying. It would come as a shock to them.
The friendship between Henderson and Gutteridge was severly tested by the
revelation but has survived and they continue to work together in the same
company.
All Henderson ever wanted to do was to make machine tools. He began as a boy
apprentice at the company which, after a succession of takeovers would
become Matrix Churchill and which he would head.
His rise through the ranks, however, coincided with a gradual decline of the
British Machine Tool industry. When credit to Eastern Europe ran out, so did
the orders. Western companies sought new markets elsewhere. The emergence of
Iraq with money to burn would be the saviour of more companies than Matrix.
It did not matter to British, German, Swiss and Italian machine tool makers
that they were dealing with a regime that gassed its own people.
The Matrix directors entered into a Faustian pact with their Iraqi customers
who agreed to to buy the company. Because of debt write offs, the Iraqis got
the company for nothing. Only afterwards did Henderson discover that two of
his fellow directors were Saddam's henchmen, working for Iraqi intelligence.
Henderson is an ordinary Midlands businessman who wanted to make money,
agreed to help his country, undoubtedly risked his life, and found himself a
pawn in one of the great power plays of the 20th century - the struggle
between Western ideals and Moslem fundamentalism. His story is only a part
of the arms to Iraq affair, but an important part. It exposes corruption in
government, corruption in many parts of society, and should be read by all
those who ask themselves, how did it happen?

PURSUED BY FURIES: A LIFE OF MALCOLM LOWRY by Gordon Bowker HarperCollins
Pounds 25, 672 pages
FIRST AND foremost, Malcolm Lowry was a drunk - so much so that he deserves
a capital D. Second, he was a gifted writer of immense promise and
tragically truncated achievement. It is impossible to doubt that the booze
killed the books. He produced a promising 'young man's' novel, Ultramarine;
a masterpiece, Under the Volcano; and a posthumous succession of brilliant
stories and unfinished manuscripts. That's all.
Gordon Bowker's biography of Lowry is very long, pedestrian, exhaustive,
exhausting, often but not always interesting. (Dear God, why have
biographers forgotten that the essence of their trade is selection? Do we
really need to know that Bleriot flew the Channel three days after Lowry's
birth? And how many readers, apart from a tiny minority of publishers and
fellow writers, are interested in day-by-day negotiations over book
contracts 50 years ago?)
The story of Lowry's self-destruction is terrible and terrifying: every page
of this history is soaked in alcohol and, by association, in misery. The
focus never wavers, and is best expressed in a sentence from a letter from
Mexico attributed to the drunken ex-consul Geoffrey Firmin - that is to say,
Lowry's alter ego - in Under the Volcano:  - 'And this is how I sometimes
think of myself, as a great explorer who has discovered some extraordinary
land from which he can never return to give his knowledge to the world: but
the name of this land is hell . . .'
That is indeed the subject of Under the Volcano, and Lowry will be
remembered for having succeeded, in that novel, in giving his knowledge to
the world. There lies his main achievement.
His father was a Liverpool businessman: Malcolm Lowry was not the first
artist to rebel against the bourgeois family and yet to live off their money
for all his life. As a mixed-up adolescent before Cambridge, he went to sea,
and for the rest of his life made too much of that brief experience. In fact
the single trip lasted less than five months and was fairly disastrous (his
blurb writers still make it 18 months before the mast); he exaggerated,
understandably, rather as Hemingway for ever fantasised about his brief
service in the First War. But it produced his first book, Ultramarine, a
mildly experimental, unsurprisingly derivative, heavily autobiographical
description of the voyage.
He was already drinking. He fell under the influence of the American poet
Conrad Aiken, whom Mr Bowker believes to have been his Dark Angel as well as
a surrogate father. He was sexually immature and inhibited. He loathed his
parents. He had a close bisexual friend in whose suicide he seems to have
been implicated and for which he would suffer lifelong guilt. From these
early days, he was a solitary.
He would spend most of his life in chosen exile. He first visited Mexico in
1936, discovered Cuernevaca (which he fictionalised as 'Quauhnahuac'), and
one day saw an Indian dying at the roadside who was being robbed of a
handful of bloodstained coins: that was the germ of Under the Volcano.
His best years were in a simple shack on the seashore north of Vancouver
with his second wife, Margerie Bonner, a one-time silent-screen actress who
may be alternatively seen as an hysteric or a heroine. The shack was to be
their base from 1941 to 1954 and when Lowry was there, with Margerie, he
managed to keep the bottle more or less at bay. She believed that she was
the keeper of his genius and he became dependent on her, though that did not
stop him trying to kill her from time to time.
When he was dead, she published the manuscripts he had been fiddling over
interminably - Hear Us O Lord From Heaven Thy Dwelling Place, in 1961, Lunar
Caustic (1963), Dark As The Grave Wherein My Friend Is Laid (1968) and, more
controversially, the unfinished October Ferry to Gabriola (1970). (Picador
keep Lowry's books available in Britain in paperback).
Lowry died, aged only 47, in 1957, after aversion therapy, truth drugs,
ECTs, etc. It must surely have been suicide, though even his biographer is
not certain; 20 sleeping pills were missing, leave aside the gin and the
barbiturates and the vomit. Some years before he had written, 'I have to
confess that I am going steadily and even beautifully downhill: my memory
misses beats at every moment and my mornings are on all fours . . . In a
nutshell I am only sober and merry in a whisky bottle . . . I have now
reached a position where every night I write a novel in my imagination, have
total recall, but am unable to write a word . . . '
Mr Bowker believes that 'almost certainly Lowry is the least-known British
literary genius of the twentieth century'. Hence this labour of love. I
wonder whether he protests too much. We are offered comparisons with Joyce,
Proust, even Faust. But I suggest we should be more cautious, even if we
grant that Under the Volcano, in which the last day in the life of the
alcoholic diplomat Geoffrey Firmin is given a transcendent universality, is
certainly one of the great novels of this century.
Once the Volcano was achieved, Lowry staggered from one manuscript to
another, never settling on the successor which his publishers needed.
Everything he wrote, as Bowker agrees, was essentially autobiography: he
surely did not possess that wider creative imagination of the greatest
novelists, and nothing he wrote ever suggested that he was interested in
developing that wider dimension.
Which is not to deny that he had a lovely talent. If you are new to Lowry, I
suggest you turn to 'The Forest Path To The Spring', the concluding short
story in Hear Us O Lord From Heaven Thy Dwelling Place, an episode which
Lowry claimed would hold the Paradiso position in his never-written
six-novel scheme. Bowker describes it, rather nicely, as a 'prose anthem' to
his wife and their simple life in British Columbia. It survives re-reading,
and suggests a happier interval in a sad life. It ends:
'And I remembered how every evening I used to go down this path through the
forest to get water from the spring at dusk. Looking over my wife's shoulder
I could see a deer swimming towards the lighthouse.
'Laughing we stooped down to the stream and drank.'

LONG DISTANCE RUNNER: A MEMOIR by Tony Richardson Faber &amp; Faber Pounds
17.50, 313 pages
WHEN TONY Richardson was a schoolboy during the second world war Yorkshire
was bursting with live theatre. His friend William Gaskill explained why in
A Sense of Direction: 'With the war British theatre had become
decentralised; the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells had moved to Burnley under the
direction of Tyrone Guthrie and tours were sent all over the North'.
The Bradford Civic Playhouse not far from Shipley where the Richardsons
lived had a full-time professional theatre school. Donald Howarth, Bernard
Hepton and Robert Stephens started there. Gaskill and Billie Whitelaw
regularly attended Esme Church's acting classes. With an enunciation of the
English language that harked back to the days of Beerbohm Tree, Miss Church
was a dominant force among stage-struck locals.
'One person she didn't dominate (Gaskill continues) was Tony Richardson, the
son of a pharmacist who lived down the road. His elongated figure and
squeaky drawl singled him out in the artistic circles of the West Riding. He
was iconoclastic about anything that was sentimental and old-fashioned. He
would return from trips to London or Stratford with a description of the
newest work by Peter Brook, the 21-year-old whizz-kid, and pour scorn on all
our sacred cows.'
Richardson's iconoclasm continued when he and Gaskill went to Oxford where,
with John Schlesinger, they dominated the student theatre after Tynan had
departed. Both of them went on to try their luck in London and after some
years of obscurity both made theatrical history at the Royal Court Theatre.
Whereas Gaskill has remained faithful to theatre as an art-form and is
currently directing at the Cottesloe, Richardson aimed at and won all the
glittering celluloid prizes . . . Sloane Square and Shaftesbury Avenue,
leading via British film studios and Broadway, to Hollywood.
Richardson's astonishing trail of success and devastation was similar to
Alexander's; after Los Angeles there were no more worlds left for him to
conquer. He simply had to live there mucking in as a permanent resident,
even abandoning for long periods his idyllic rural retreat, Le Nid du Duc
near La Garde in Provence. He died of Aids in November 1991 at the age of
63. Shortly after his death his family discovered, in an obscure cupboard
where he kept his Oscars, a manuscript written six years before and set
aside. His eldest daughter, the actress Natasha Richardson, remembers asking
him what he was writing:
''I'm having a go at my life, a sort of memoir'. 'How great,' I replied  -
to which he guffawed, 'No it's not, it's not interesting, it's shit and very
boring but I'm doing it as a kind of exercise'.'
To publish it now, posthumously, just as it is, was obviously the right
decision. In the breezy, ruthless, incisive, spontaneous manner, that all
who knew him remember so well, the book gives us a fine overview of Tony
Richardson's career seen through the glowing eyes of its chief participant.
Much of it makes invigorating reading. It reveals his joy in adventurous
foreign travel as much as his dedication to work. He was a great believer in
location shooting and the two were were frequently combined. His candid
character-sketches of many of the theatrically great and good whom he
directed - John Gielgud, Katherine Hepburn, Tallulah Bankhead, Kim Stanley,
Joan Plowright, Mary Ure, Hugh Griffith to mention but a few - are often
masterpieces of insight. Whatever his reservations he is never mean or
ungenerous. He is especially acute about Olivier:
'At heart Larry was what the French call a cabotin. The term is difficult to
translate - not exactly a ham: a performer, a vulgarian, someone who lives
and dies for acting. The grand seigneur was one of the roles he played, but
at heart it was foreign to him. And at heart he knew or perhaps he didn't
know at the time - that his attempt to transform Vivien into a great
classical actress was a failure.'
Richardson's account of his collaboration with John Osborne will be collated
by future biographers with Osborne's account of Richardson in Almost A
Gentleman. Although they became estranged after making The Charge of the
Light Brigade the mutual indebtedness is made abundantly clear on both sides
 -as is the great debt both careers owed to George Devine, about whom
Richardson writes with particular warmth. Richardson's tracing of the
fortunes of the Royal Court Theatre up to and especially after the great
seasons of 1956 (Look Back in Anger) and 1957 (The Entertainer) will be
disputed; indeed, they have already by Lindsay Anderson in his introduction.
A glaring omission is any mention of Richardson's homosexual liaisons. He
never confesses at any point there was a gay side to him. But there are many
discussions of his affairs and would-be affairs with women. His courting of
Vanessa Redgrave opened in bizarre fashion. He sent her a letter while in
the same restaurant. It was delivered by hand to the table where she was
being wined and dined by Bernard Levin. As she did not have her
reading-glasses, it was read to her by an angry Bernard. Was ever woman in
this humour wooed? Was ever woman in this humour won?
While married to Vanessa, Richardson directed Jeanne Moreau and fell
hopelessly in love. The affair gave Richardson's life a fresh turn and led
to his living in France. But his passionate affair with her was like a real
life re-play of Jules et Jim and did not last. Richardson pays tribute to
his enduring relationship which followed with Grizelda Grimond, by whom he
had a daughter.
All of Richardson that ultimately matters is here. The less attractive, the
callous manipulative side is best forgotten. Richardson approached
friendships not merely as if they were games of chess but as if they were
games of simultaneous chess. He was a theatrical Kasparov turning from board
to board, moving rapidly on each, his head teeming with brilliant
calculations. He kept one so busily absorbed in one's own game one never
knew what was happening on the other boards. Reading Long Distance Runner
one can at last find some of it out.

THE LAST GREAT FRENCHMAN by Charles Williams Little Brown Pounds 25, 544
pages
CHARLES DE Gaulle was one of the most remarkable figures on the European,
indeed the world scene, during the 20th century. An obscure soldier with
very little active service experience, apart from being taken prisoner on
the Western Front in 1916, a brief interlude in the Polish Russian war of
1920 and a disastrous failure at Abbeville in 1940, he somehow became the
voice of France in the second world war. In his younger days the protege of
Petain he repudiated all that the old Marshal stood for after 1940.
Despite Roosevelt and Churchill who disliked him acutely, he established
himself as the symbol of French patriotism. President briefly in 1946 he
retired for 12 years, returned by acclaim to deal with Algeria though he did
it in precisely the opposite way to that expected by his supporters and
apparently endorsed by him. He got away with it and established the Fifth
Republic, which has lasted longer than any but one of its predecessor
regimes since 1789. He blocked British entry into the EEC - he hated Britain
 -and he took France out of NATO - he had no love for America. But nations
can have too much of single-minded patriotism. In the end just as Britain
became weary of Margaret Thatcher, so did France of de Gaulle, who lost the
1969 referendum and then bowed out with dignity.
It is an extraordinary story, and Char1es Williams has told it with
admirable clarity, scholarship and understanding. This is the most
comprehensive life since the three volumes by Jean Lacouture (1984-6) and it
is the best book in English to have appeared so far. It will not easily be
superseded. It has the advantage of many new sources - papers and memoirs
released by the celebration of the centenary in 1990 of de Gaulle's birth.
It is very readable and highly perceptive.
De Gaulle's family background was not at all typical of fin de siecle France
 -minor nobility, monarchism, Jesuit upbringing, narrow puritanical northern
Catholicism. His father, who taught at a Jesuit school, believed that every
regime since 1789 had been an usurpation. Family life was dominated by
discussion of the Dreyfus Case, which shook the Army to the core and the
Fashoda Incident, which impressed itself 'on the young Charles's mind as a
supreme example at one and the same time of French political impotence and
of deep British treachery'. During all his dealings with the British over
some 30 years he never forgot Fashoda. From time to time he needed to be
reminded not to hate his allies even more than the enemy.
The Free French forces which de Gaulle created did not make much difference
to the war. It would have been won by the Western Allies at about the same
time anyway. As for the French Resistance which de Gaulle strongly
supported, its courage was immense but its effect at best marginal.
What mattered was that he saved the soul of France and gave the French a
sense that they were, despite the fiasco of 1940, a great people. True they
showed little gratitude in the aftermath of war. When he pressed, quite
rightly, for a constitution which would not repeat the defects of the Third
Republic, they plumped for one which, though not identical, was equa11y
unstable and he promptly resigned. One of his liabilities was that, although
'a certain idea of France' had for him a semi-mystical quality, he had
remarkably little knowledge of the French. In the 50 years before he left
for Britain he had had an insulated life in Lille, Paris and military
stations at home or abroad. Churchill, too, had only the remotest idea of
how most of his fellow countrymen lived, yet both men could sound a clarion
call which was unforgettable and both came back after political defeat.
De Gaulle returned after a longer interval and in more sensational
circumstances. His political achievement was remarkable. No one could 'solve
the problem' of Algerie Francois, but it could be removed from the agenda of
politics in Paris; that was what de Gaulle did at great risk to himself (The
Day of the Jackal is by no means fanciful) and at the cost of lasting hatred
by those who felt themselves betrayed. He also established a new and so far
reasonably effective republican constitution.
It is something to have rehabilitated a nation, rid it of its most
disruptive threat and given it for the first time in 170 years a stable and
pragmatic system of government. 'The Last Great Frenchman' is a well
justified title for this excellent biography.

MAKING AN EXHIBITION OF MYSELF: by Peter Hall Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20,
419 pages
THERE HAS been a decline in the art of autobiography or perhaps one should
say, more accurately, in the standards of editing. The memoirs of Sir Peter
Hall, the theatre director, turn out to be quite as dismal as those of
Kenneth Baker, the politician, published a few weeks earlier. And they are
dismal for the same reasons. There is an excessive use of the first person
singular and a not entirely convincing parade of self-justification. Above
all, there is a failure to reflect, to stand back and put matters into
perspective.
Hall's Diaries were published in 1983 and were interesting raw material for
a studied work later that also took in subsequent years. The opportunity has
been neglected. Here is a man who directed the Arts Theatre at the age of
24, gave London its first production of Waiting for Godot, went on to lead
the Royal Shakespeare Company, then the National Theatre, and intermittently
produced operas around the world. It would be instructive to read his
considered thoughts on theatre and the art of directing, coupled with a view
of how a life in the arts has compared with developments in society as a
whole.
Hall has no such discipline. So far as he is concerned, nothing has changed
except for the worse, defined as an unwillingness on the part of the British
government to go on increasing subsidies to the theatre. Hall is a
reactionary posing as a radical. He writes that he 'never felt part of
Imperial Britain because I belonged to the wrong class and went the wrong
schools'. In fact, he went to perfectly decent schools and on to Cambridge
University.
His father was a station master, presided over a staff of three and had a
house to go with the job, although only five trains a day passed through the
station. One cannot help thinking that Hall believes the modern theatre
should be run much like the old railways: regardless of costs, regardless of
customers. At least the trains ran on time.
Hall has been through a lot of adventures, sometimes marriages, sometimes
affairs. His obsession is sexual. When he went to see an amateur production
of Robinson Crusoe at the age of five, he found it a 'very erotic
experience'. Even now, the most complimentary adjective he can apply to an
artistic performance is 'sexy'.
For a theatre director rooted in Shakespeare his vocabulary is limited. He
says he learned from FR Leavis that 'sloppy writing is the result of sloppy
thinking'. On the evidence of this book, he did not learn well. In the lines
'with a feeling of enormous relief, I gave up religion. It has worried me
ever since.' the reader is left to guess what the word 'it' refers to.
Hall writes that he has never been affluent. Yet on his 30th birthday his
first wife, Leslie Caron, gave him a vintage Rolls-Royce. That was to go
with the open Jaguar XK150 'in British racing green with tan upholstery'
which he already owned. When he took over at the National Theatre, he
appeared in an advertisement for Sanderson's wallpaper. Sanderson's
completely redecorated a room in his house for the occasion. The ad appeared
with the words 'Very Peter Hall, Very Sanderson's'
True, Hall now admits that the wallpaper episode was a foolish mistake, but
it is not surprising that the press should have begun to send him up. There
was also the suspicion that in the many productions he undertook
simultaneously he was beginning to look like an absentee landlord.
This is not the place to comment on his abilities as a director because the
art of theatre is not essentially what Making an Exhibition of Myself is
about. Yet one wonders how a man who claims to be punctilious with detail
can write such a sloppy book. One wonders even more about the publisher's
lack of an editor. Possibly no-one can direct Peter Hall.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Travel: Anguilla, where life's just a beach - James
Henderson finds himself lost for words on a made-for-sybarites Caribbean
island
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER YEARS of looking at Caribbean beaches I have come to the conclusion
that there are only a number of ways of describing them. Silken soft sand
washed by gin-clear water. Lazy waves lapping on an idyllic half-moon curve.
The sun-bleached sugar granules of a palm-backed strand. Etc. Etc.
The Caribbean has suffered pretty badly from the attentions of over-zealous
brochure writers anyway, but describing Caribbean beaches sends these poor
people into overdrive. When faced with a blank, glossy page, they become
linguistic thugs, wielding cliches like bludgeons and beating every word
senseless.
By this reasoning the island of Anguilla, which is not much more than beach,
almost defies description, particularly if you are trying to avoid a brush
with cliche. The island's 40-mile coastline has about 30 beaches. The sand
is superb and the sea absurdly blue. And on most of them you can be alone.
If beaches are your thing, Anguilla comes close to the proverbial paradise.
I reached Anguilla late in the day, but with time enough to throw down my
bags and skip out on to Mead's Bay, a mile-long curve of west-facing sand.
Laid out beneath the Malliouhana Hotel, Mead's Bay seems an ideal Caribbean
beach. It is so soft underfoot that your feet slip in up to your ankles and
when the waves break they meander, fizzing with spume and carving huge
scallop shapes on the sand. Digging my toes into the warm grains, I watched
the setting sun play tricks on the huge clouds. People must have been
staring at the sunset from here for centuries.
Next morning I set out in search of Anguilla's finest beach. Shoal Bay, on
the north coast, is probably the island's most popular - more than a mile of
mounded crystalline sand with the quality of talcum powder.
Hitching around the island presents no difficulty. Anguilla is the sort of
place where the chief minister stops and picks you up. On this occasion,
though, it was Vic, another island luminary, the proprietor of a beach bar
(Trader Vic's) on Shoal Bay itself, so he took me there and handed me a
beer.
Shoal is an old word for a reef: the bay has a double reef system right
offshore, which makes for superb snorkelling. As for snorkelling gear,
Skyline Beach Rentals had it all: Shady Beach Umbrellas, Beautiful Lounge
Chairs, Elegant Floating Rafts, Long Fluffy Towels and - just for me -
Reliable Snorkelling Gear. I spent a happy half-hour chasing damsels and
rock beauties in and out of the corals and stalking sergeant majors and
grunts among the elkhorn.
At times, Anguilla has something of a '30 square miles and a donkey' feel
about it. If this patch of scrub happened to be in the Arizona desert -
parts of it would not look too out of place - there would be a single donkey
and no other discernible characteristics to differentiate it from the land
around.
Instead it is a nation, with its own distinctive identity. The island is
more developed now than your average patch of Arizona scrub, but for all the
steady building, the feel of Anguilla remains the same. And the strongest
impression of island life comes from the Anguillians themselves, who are
without doubt the coolest islanders in the whole Caribbean.
There is an almost unnatural calm about the place. Here the statutory West
Indian greeting (saying hello to everyone you pass) becomes a barely raised
hand, a hint of a nod or a whispered 'yeah man'.
I was trying to find Back Bay (any beach you have to abseil to must be worth
a look), when I fell in with an Anguillian who took me half-a-mile out of
his way and pointed me to the path through the scrub down to the beach. It
was rather like a treasure hunt: through the bushes and over sunburnt rock
you come to a point high above the sea. Three pelicans were riding the
upward winds on the cliff-face, wheeling and folding their wings back
arrow-like in a dive for lunch.
Beneath them was Back Bay, a tiny sun-trap in a protected cove with blinding
white sand and gentle waves. To get to the beach you clamber down the cliff
with the aid of ropes fastened into the rockface.
Faced with a cool island, the Foreign Office in London has been
unwarrantably hip and has sent along a dead cool governor. He is a keen
cyclist and rides around the island to shouted greetings of 'Hey,
Government'.
Somnolence is a word that fits Anguilla well, though it is difficult to
gauge how fierce competition might be between two beach bars that face each
other across the bay in the fishing village of Island Harbour. Gorgeous
Scilly Cay is the offshore domain of Eudoxie Wallace, a former stateside
tennis pro, who has decorated his sandbar with conch-shell walls and
palm-thatch shelters. If you wave from the pier, they will come and pick you
up and you can spend the afternoon eating barbecued lobster, drowning
yourself in rum punch and soaking in the sea.
On the beach opposite, Smitty's is a ramshackle island affair, a sandy,
palm-thatch garden with discarded cable-barrels as tables and outsize pink
buoys for decoration. I joined a small crowd of Anguillians watching MTV and
mulling over island gossip.
After a few beers I began to think I was hearing things. The normal noises
of West Indian English had dissolved and the words were sounding curiously
Irish. This happens in other places in the Caribbean: they seem to speak
Welsh in parts of Trinidad, and if you close your eyes in Barbados you might
almost be in the west of England.
The Anguillians do have a lot of Irish blood in them. Looking around, it
seems that there is not much that could ruffle an Anguillian's calm. But
then it is worth remembering that in 1967 these people staged one of the
world's least known (and coolest) revolutions.
The Anguillians were threatened with independence from Britain as the poor
relation of St Kitts and Nevis (nearby islands), and so they revolted - all
5,000 - arming themselves and taking to the scrub. Britain dispatched
troops, who were bemused to find themselves greeted by islanders waving
Union Jacks and singing God Save the Queen. Nobody could quite believe it,
but eventually the Anguillians had their way, confounding colonial
administrative convenience. They remain a British crown colony.
On the south coast there is a cracking two-mile stretch of pristine sand,
glaringly bright and offset by an electric blue sea, on Rendezvous Bay. It
is a beautiful walk, through sand so thick that it makes you stumble, and it
picks up some flotsam when the wind is right, so you can go beach-combing.
In the dazzle looking south, there is a stunning view of St Martin, five
miles away. It is one of the curious facts of the Caribbean that islands so
close together can be so different. For all its beauty, St Martin is
frenetic, crowded and horribly overdeveloped.
The same sand as Anguilla and looser building laws have meant that over the
last 20 years it has grown into a nightmare in concrete. Now there is a
squeeze on and it has a problem filling hotel rooms that were quite smart 10
years ago.
Anguilla is building, but only slowly, and it seems to be maintaining its
reliably top-notch image. Strangely, you will see a surprising number of
half-finished houses around the place. Like the fishing boats of decades
past, which stood like skeletal hulks on the beach for seasons at a time,
they are built by travelling Anguillians who come back and continue building
when they can afford it. An unfinished house is a tax dodge; besides, it
leaves room to add on for extra kids.
Further east you might be forgiven for thinking that you were seeing a
mirage when you come to the moorish domes of Cap Juluca Hotel on Maunday's
Bay or the white, windswept facades of Cove Castles, which stands on Shoal
Bay West. Strangely it has no reef, but it is a magnificent curl of
steep-sloping sand where the waves clap and race and the swimming is
impeccable.
Yet to my mind the beach to beat them all in Anguilla is Captain's Bay in a
secluded cove in the far north-east. It is simply . . . wait for it . . . a
beach beyond description.
James Henderson, author of the Cadogan Guide to the Caribbean, stayed in the

FT  02 OCT 93 / Travel: High jinks on a voyage of sails and whales - Michael
J Woods takes to the seas on a traditional tall ship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SEEMED a long way up from the deck to the yard when I climbed the
ratlines. And once up on the yard, it looked even further back down to the
deck. I remember how warm and reassuring the honey-coloured wood of the
lower yard felt to my bare feet as I leaned over its higher counterpart in
order to remove the gaskets from the heavy square topsail.
I also remember how little there was to hang on to as the ship lifted on the
gentle swell of an Atlantic sheltered by the Canary Islands. But it was
satisfying when the sail fell free and, safely back on deck, we heaved and
sweated on appropriate ropes until the sail filled with wind and the throb
of the diesel engine was stilled.
Such gymnastics are not compulsory for passengers but it seemed to me that
if I was going to sail a tall ship, even a little tall ship like the Anna
Kristina, I ought to try at least once. Anna Kristina is a Norwegian topsail
ketch and was rescued by her present owner, Hans Van De Vooren, when she was
almost beyond repair. He already owned her sister ship, Anna Rosa, having
given up his farm in his native Holland and moved to Norway in order to
rebuild her.
Anna Kristina was one of a number of similar ships originally built by the
farmers of Hardanger Fjord in order to eke out a living in winter by
carrying fish south along the coast and bringing goods home in return. Most
of the ship was taken up by the cargo hold, with a small living area for
crew fore and aft.
The hold has been converted into the main saloon with a combined galley and
living area centred around a table constructed to Hans' design and made from
the ship's former hatch cover. There are small cabins off the saloon and
bunks let into the saloon walls so, with a full complement below decks, the
ship can get crowded and stuffy in tropical waters. At night, a pleasant
alternative is to sleep on deck, watching the clouds scud across a sliver of
moon.
Not all nights were spent at anchor, and more than once we sailed through
the darkness, riding foam-capped waves with a steady breeze filling the
sails. Down below the old ship creaked and groaned as the waves passed
beneath her; on deck we watched distant lights slide away while new ones
appeared as we tacked from Tenerife towards Gran Canaria.
Enjoyable as it was, we were not here just to sail a century-old tall ship.
We had come to look for whales, and the irony of doing so in a Norwegian
craft escaped none of us. There is a resident group of pilot whales around
the Canaries together with various dolphin species. A number of other
cetaceans pass through, so the chance of seeing something is high. We
encountered our first pilot whales within hours of joining the ship at Santa
Cruz, their rounded, slightly flaccid dorsal fins betraying their presence.
Quickly, half-a-dozen of us were in the inflatable Zodiac heading towards
these 15ft mammals.
One of our number, Graham, was passionate about whales, and along with mask
and fins he had brought a wet-suit. Almost as soon as we drew alongside the
whales, he slid into the sea and finned quietly away, diving occasionally to
watch them more closely. He had hardly left the boat when a bottle-nosed
dolphin flew clear of the water and splashed down close to the inflatable.
Graham surfaced to tell us that there were many more whales under the water
than there were fins on the surface, before sliding out of sight once more.
Lorenzo and Manuel, a pair of local marine biologists also on board,
explained that some 200 individual pilot whales had been identified around
the Canaries by using photo-identification of their distinctive dorsal fins.
Inspired by Graham's enthusiasm I was keen to experience swimming with
whales, but had to wait for several days until we found another pod. We had
hardly spotted the animals when a high-speed launch on a commercial
whale-watching trip came cutting through the sea towards them. Andy, our
normally taciturn skipper, who had previously worked with Greenpeace,
responded indignantly. 'That's how collisions occur. These would not be the
first whales to die from being hit by a boat', he said.
There is no apparent policing here, and the whales seemed remarkably
tolerant of these cowboys of the sea whose sole intention appeared to be to
push others aside in order to give their clients a glimpse of a dorsal fin.
For Lorenzo and Manuel the answer lies in requiring all whale-watching boats
to have a naturalist aboard, not only to explain the wildlife to the
passengers but to control the excesses of the skippers.
At least the sun was shining as I slipped over the side of the dinghy and
looked down through the ocean at a mother whale with her baby close to her
flank. They were moving leisurely, almost loafing in the water, but then I
noticed that they were rising, coming slowly up to the surface. They broke
through and breathed before going down in a single motion, arching their
backs and sliding gracefully away.
A week whale watching and exploring the Canary Islands aboard Anna Kristina
costs approximately Pounds 360 per person plus flights. Bookings can be made
through Twickers World in London, tel: 081-892-7606. Be prepared to live
closely alongside other people so take a sleeping bag.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Travel: Big, better and Cecil B De Mille - A Patagonian
mountain worthy of a Hollywood spectacular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE mountains and there are mountains. Everest is the biggest. K2, the
'savage mountain', may be the most brutal. Kilimanjaro, Africa's sunbaked,
snow-capped giant, is possibly the most startling. But the Torres del Paine
range, in southern Chile, is something else.
It is as if Cecil B De Mille had assembled his special effects people, given
them a huge budget and said: 'OK, build me a mountain that'll knock folks'
socks off. Give it peaks and crags, real spiky ones. And cliffs, sheer
cliffs. Knife-sharp ridges. Lotsa knobbly bits. Crevasses. Big rocks
balancing on itsy-bitsy stones. Glaciers. Snow. Ice. And lakes: blue ones,
green ones, clear ones. Waterfalls, great big waterfalls that roar like
thunder.
'Gimme animals: guanacos, floppy-eared rabbits, buzzards, a puma or three.
Trout. And lotsa salmon. Then build the whole shebang at ground level, so no
other mountains get in the way and folks'll get a crick neck looking up at
it. Go to it, boys.'
It looks as if they did. The Torres - literally, towers - of Paine soar to
2,500 metres above the level grassland of Chilean Patagonia like a
dreamscape. Other peaks have bigger peaks upon their backs to beat them, but
the Torres del Paine stand in glorious solitude, daring you to believe them.
From far off they look like a painted film set; close up the effect is
magnified, so that one is tempted to wander round behind them to wobble the
canvas. But they are real, and they contain in a small area every feature
you dreamt of in a mountain landscape.
The towers themselves are three sharp needles of granite isolated by erosion
from softer rock beneath, a geological accident that gives the whole range
its breathtaking sculpted appearance. In dawn or evening sun they glow like
rosy fingers jabbing at the sky; more often they loom out of the mist like
sentinels, stabbing the scudding clouds to release the torrential downpours
that periodically sweep the area.
On the other side of the towers stand the Horns of Paine, two sharply
defined peaks separated by a steep-sided bowl. They look a devilishly
difficult climb from any angle. The horns stand guard over an icy, clear
lake, the largest of many in this area, regularly churned into foam by
ever-present winds from Patagonia.
The Torres del Paine offers some of the most rugged and rewarding trekking
country in Chile. The most popular hike is El circuitio, a seven-day slog
past the bleak mass of the Grey glacier and behind the Horns and Torres.
Less ambitious walkers can find an array of day treks mapped out in the
park's visitor centre.
The area was made a national park in 1959 after a series of devastating
fires swept the sheep-grazing flatlands surrounding the Torres. More land
was added in 1962 and the area is now policed by national park officers, who
are instructed to turn back solo trekkers at the park entrance: several lone
walkers have vanished in the Torres' wilderness and theoretically only
groups are allowed in.
The fact that these 'groups' form largely on the three-hour bus ride into
the park and then unbundle themselves immediately their entrance visas have
been stamped is just part of the game.
The park is now home to herds of guanaco, flamingos, long-eared hares, foxes
and the occasional (shy) puma. More than 100 species of bird have been
logged, including black-necked swans and the Andean condor. In spring and
summer - roughly November to April, although one can experience all four
seasons in a day - the peaks are carpeted in Alpine flowers.
Accommodation in this wilderness is scarce and over-priced, but the Hotel
Pehoe deserves its luxury rating for its position alone. It stands on its
own tiny private island in the middle of Lago Pehoe, reached by a narrow
wooden bridge, and has a marvellous, ever-changing view of the Horns of
Paine. The rooms are small and dingy, and very expensive (for Chile) at
around Dollars 90 for a double, but the hotel's only rival, the spartan
Posada Rio Serrano, is scarcely cheaper at Dollars 55 a double and lacks a
grandstand view. There are four campsites (Dollars 10 a pitch) for hardier
souls, who are frequently seen counting their change while drying out in the
Hotel Pehoe's restaurant.
Getting there: An adventure in itself. Flights (around Dollars 220) from
Santiago leave daily for Punta Arenas, a small port at the end of the
Chilean mainland. From there it is a three-hour bus ride (around Dollars 10)
to Puerto Natales, a settlement on the shores of the Ultima Esperanza gulf,
and a further three-hour bus ride into the Torres.
The bus from Arenas to Natales gets in too late to connect with the
early-morning Torres run, so an overnight stop is unavoidable. The Hotel
Austral is recommended; its owner, Eduardo Scott, can arrange tours into the
Torres. A good restaurant in Natales is Don Alvarito, where the gargantuan
owner will greet you like a long-lost brother and ply you with grape brandy
all night long, sometimes longer. The Torres can be visited as part of
Patagonian expeditions through UK companies such as Journey Latin America,

FT  02 OCT 93 / Gardening: The rehabilitation of Stowe's great landscape
garden - An 18th century quest for perfection and beauty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a sale to remember. But luckily lot 3802 did not sell. It was the
year 1921, and the end-of-an-era auction of furnishings at Stowe, the ducal
palace in Buckinghamshire that had been a powerhouse of 18th century English
politics.
Lot 3802 was a bridge, Palladian in style, standing at the end of the
house's Octagon Lake. Auctioneers Jackson-Stops, of Northampton, gave the
bridge an enticing entry in its 1921 catalogue: 'An elegant structure after
the bridge at Wilton.' But on the 18th day of the sale were the buyers so
sated with statues and furniture that whole buildings were too much? The
Temple of Friendship (lot 3804) was among several structures not to sell.
Today, Gervase Jackson-Stops, architectural adviser to the National Trust
and one of the team rehabilitating Stowe's great landscape garden, searches
his grandfather's catalogue for clues to where buildings and statues used to
be.
Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham, and his Grenville heirs never stopped
moving them - and renaming them - in their quest for the perfect garden,
which would symbolise the blessed union of wealth, power, beauty, intellect
and artifice that they and their political allies thought they had bestowed
on England.
At Stowe every temple and every statue carries its message, often
anti-French, sometimes hard to decode, often whimsical, and always extolling
enlightenment and liberty. The Temple of British Worthies is a semi-circular
exedra, with busts of Bacon, Alfred ('crush'd Corruption, guarded Liberty,
and was the Founder of the English Constitution'), Hampden, Sir John Barnard
('an active &amp; firm Opposition to the perncious &amp; iniquitous Practice of
Stock jobbing') among its heroes.
At the back is a memorial to 'a perfect Philosopher; a faithful Friend, an
agreeable Companion, a loving Husband, distinguished by a numerous
Offspring' It cautions, 'Reader, the Stone is guiltless of Flattery, for he
was not a Man, but a Grey-Hound.'
To make a place of pleasure and recreation, that still takes us straight
into the mind of the 18th century educated nobility, the best people that
money and taste could find worked on the Stowe gardens - Vanbrugh, Bridgeman
(the king's gardener), Capability Brown (who began as an under-gardener at
Stowe), Kent and Gibbs. Cobham's motto of a pun from the Psalms, Templa quam
dilecta (How amiable are thy temples) is apt. What costly fun it must have
been to make the gardens and show them off to the smart world.
Such play emptied the purses twice. The place was parlous when Lady Kinloss,
daughter of the last Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, auctioned the
furnishings in 1921 and the new Stowe School bought the house and grounds.
Already in 1848 there had been a sale in bankruptcy, after generations of
prodigious expenditure on Stowe - plus the burden of entertaining Queen
Victoria in 1845.
With an anonymous gift of Pounds 2m as a starter, Pounds 4.5m from the
National Heritage Memorial Fund, grants from English Heritage, an appeal and
a kitty that has reached Pounds 11m - although more is needed to complete
Phase I by a 2005 - the trust has been hard at work resurrecting the 18th
century temple of delights.
The first task was to map any structures that survive or remnants of them,
with test digs by trust archaeologist Angus Wainwright as checks. He has
found, for instance, the site of the Pyramid, which Cobham started building
in 1726 to honour Vanbrugh. By 1786 Thomas Jefferson noted that it had been:
'Almost entirely taken down by the late Lord Temple, to erect a building
there, in commemoration of Mr Pitt, but he died before beginning it.'
Wainwright proposes a square mound to mark the site of this unusual
short-lived building.
One statue site was easy to find 'because it has been hit by mowers so
often', said Jackson-Stops. It was less clear if the figures had been The
Wrestlers or Hercules and the Lion. In this detective work old hollies and
yews are a clue to where the walks were, and the Stowe papers in the
Huntington Library in California (which bought them after they had
circulated for years on the London market in the 1920s) are a rich source,
which Jackson-Stops and his team are quarrying.
If you saw Stowe three years ago, it is astonishing how much the trust has
done since work started on the ground. Vistas have reopened - by trimming
trees and clearing undergrowth - that tie the monuments to each other and
impose a conceptual and visual unity across the acres. Look through the
Aurelian Arch (or Doric Arch) to the graceful Palladian Bridge and you see
on the horizon the contrast of Stowe Castle - an edifice emblematic of
English martial virtue - in a blend of might and art that we know in
Pericles's Athens and Louis XIV's France.
The trust has also cleaned the lakes and the infant River Alder that flows
through the glade of the Elysian Fields and relates the Temple of the
British Worthies to the Temple of Ancient Virtue, linked by the Monument to
Captain Cook who, in a sense, gave Britain the world. The Cook Monument has
been moved.
'We must put him back on his island,' Jackson-Stops said. And Cobham's ha-ha
wall, designed to resemble fortifications in the early days of artillery, is
being rebuilt at Pounds 150 a yard by a community action team of unemployed
under a paid staff member. Bath &amp; Portland Stone is supplying the stone.
There are only three miles to go.
From the hill behind the Worthies, the Gothic Temple (a building derived
from the symbol-packed Triangular Lodge at Rushton) the only monument at
Stowe in ironstone, looks across the Octagon Lake to the Temple of
Friendship, with its busts of Cobham and his political allies epitomising
the Whig coterie that ran the country.
Ancient Virtue is now restored, with statues of four great Greeks to suggest
that concept dear to the English; that life's standards never change. Next
is Concord and Victory, originally the Grecian Temple but altered to
commemorate successes over the French in the Seven Years War. Its sculptured
pediment, showing the four corners of the earth bringing tribute to
Britannia, was lifted from the Palladian Bridge, and cut to fit the new
space. This temple is in a desperate state and will cost Pounds 1.6m to
restore which, even so, will not retrieve its columns which the school took
to put in the chapel.
The papers in the Huntington Library give a vivid picture of the garden in
its heyday (before the school tuck shop had replaced the menagerie or the
sports ground poached the site of the walled garden).
In 1809 a man was convicted of stealing 'the whole of a (lead) hand from the
statue of Neptune' and 'the trumpet from the hand of one of the muses at the
Aurelian Arch'. Given the choice of transportation or joining the 14th
regiment, he signed up.
Frank Thomson, the head gardener, standing in his office, beside the head of
Lord Cobham which fell off his Monument when lightning struck in 1957, told
me he had recognised gardeners' names in the 18th century that still carry
on at Stowe. And he could explain to befogged academics in the Stowe group
the practicalities of 18th century gardening - even if he cannot now marshal
the labour that planted 13,200 larches one year.
The nurserymen's bills among the Huntington papers will help the trust in
replanting. It is a surprise how much colourful planting Stowe had under the
trees. In a few years our notions will change when we see dogwoods, roses
and honeysuckles as they were 200 years ago.
Stowe followed the fashions in planting and was eager for new species - such
as pineapples, snowberries and fern-leaved beeches and limes - which were
tried first in the kitchen garden. An American border was kept for
transatlantic introductions such as 100 'Accacia of Virginia' which cost
Pounds 2.10s in 1755. The plants from abroad are yet another sign that,
already in the 18th century, the world was Britain's oyster.
Stowe Landscape Garden (National Trust) is open in school holidays and
breaks, 10am-6pm (or dusk, if earlier) and, until October 20, Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays, 10am-5pm. The House (Stowe School), with a grand
view of the gardens from the South Loggia, is closed until next year.

and possibly a pistol or even a machine gun to the right of them, as into
the Trois Vallees, Val d'Isere, Valmorel and even the Val d'Aosta ski the
200 British ski guides who could be facing trouble from local guides anxious
to protect their jobs from 'foreign invaders' this winter.
Two or three years ago, a number of British ski instructors working in the
Alps were arrested for allegedly working illegally. Some were briefly jailed
and some were fined. Even Britain's best known ski guru, Ali Ross, was
briefly under arrest. Now, as the season beckons, the signs are that the
problem this year could be even worse. New regulations seem to suggest that
the French will deal severely with British ski guides this season - although
they may possibly recognise Grade 3 of the BASI qualification (British
Association of Ski Instructors) for the first time.
Ce n'est pas la guerre, but it certainly might become distinctly unpleasant
as French gendarmes take on the peculiar all-purpose British animal who
arranges airport transfers, works out the guests' entertainment programme,
organises their ski passes, ski school and ski rental, dines with guests,
and just happens to ski with them for all or part of the holiday.
Ski Hosts, Ski Leaders, Ski Directors - call them what you will, British
tour operators have tried desperately to think of a new title to escape the
unfortunate 'guide' connotations and pacify the locals. After a year or two
of relative peace, Mark Chitty, managing director of Mark Warner, which
pioneered the ski guide concept 15 years ago, is convinced there will be an
outbreak of hostilities this winter.
'The problem hasn't gone away' says Chitty. 'Now there has been a small but
significant change in French law No. 84-610. Article 43 used to state that
no one may teach a sport or physical activity without a diploma. The revised
article rules that no one may teach, supervise or lead people without one. I
fear that this winter, with pressure from the local ski schools, the
authorities will take action against our company. This would have a very
serious effect on our operations and future programme in France.'
Extracts from a Mark Warner official account highlight just one incident:
'On Friday the 2nd of April at approximately 11.30 hrs Jamie Bentley (Ski
Guide) and his group of 15 left the restaurant at the top of Blanchot.
Sitting opposite had been two gendarmes and an French ski instructor. Jamie
was stopped by the gendarmes, who were insistent that he had been
instructing his group, and asked to see his passport and papers.
'A member of the group who spoke fluent French asked how Jamie could be
instructing when he had no poles and a broken rib. Jamie showed them the
bandage on his chest and the police officer, apparently looking for papers,
hit Jamie on several occasions. He was then asked to appear at the police
station with all his papers and passport.
'The senior gendarme enquired what qualifications Jamie had to instruct. It
was explained that he had no qualifications and that is why he did not
instruct. It was highlighted that guests are regularly sent to Ski Cocktail
(a local French ski school) for lessons. By this time the gendarme seemed
relatively satisfied that the guides had not broken the law - which he
confessed was relatively unclear.'
Chitty and other tour operators like him - only a couple of months away from
the start of the season - is now trying to find out where he stands. He has
approached BASI to see whether it might consider running courses for British
ski guides to give them official status in the Alps. 'But they won't do it,'
he says. 'I think they are worried that just as BASI is on the verge of
being recognised in the Alps, to get embroiled with the ski guides issue
could be damaging.'
One company, Interski, already operates its own BASI ski school in the Alps.
Although based mainly in the Italian resort of Courmayeur, Interski also
operates in La Thuile (also Italy) and the linked French resort of La
Rosiere.
One would expect the problems to arise when skiing from Italy into French
territory. But Interski's Roger Walker says: 'For several seasons we were
hounded by the police in Courmayeur, with numerous inconvenient and
embarrassing arrests. One February, my group of schoolchildren from Hull
were a quarter of the way down a gentle green piste. I had been questioned
several times about my qualifications, and asked to produce my passport,
work visa and BASI licence by the local police.
'What I was not prepared for was my encounter round the next corner. As we
skied out of the trees, we were confronted by a policeman brandishing an
automatic machine gun.
'Coming to a stop with 11 children behind you, who had only been skiing for
three days, is no easy task, even when there is a uniformed officer pointing
a gun at you. The children seemed shocked into silence.
'Not only was the officer gesticulating with a machine gun, but he carried a
shoulder belt full of ammunition and a pistol in a holster - the 24 ski
poles we carried between us were no real match. A ski school official
informed me that I was working illegally and that I must stop teaching
immediately. As I stared down the barrel of a gun that was definitely
pointing in my direction, I pointed out that I had a class of 11 beginners,
who, if left to their own devices, would certainly never make it back to the
bottom alive] Begrudgingly, the pair agreed to escort me.
'Five other Interski instructors were informed that we were to go to the
local police station. One by one we were taken from the small room where we
were being held, into an interview room. Our paperwork and passports were
examined while the policemen whispered in a corner. They seemed to infer
that we were to be deported or imprisoned for our 'crime' of teaching skiing
without permission from the local ski school.
'Well after midnight, without warning, we were released. We were free to go,
but not to teach skiing - no explanation, no apologies.'
According to EC regulations, says Walker, Interski instructors should now be
legally allowed to teach skiing. 'But the authorities have just informed us
that our maximum class size must now be eight. With Italian ski classes of
12 to 14, are we not being singled out for special treatment?'
One organisation which may not experience ski-guiding problems is the Ski
Club of Great Britain. Article 43 specifically relates to ski guides
'working for financial gain'. The Ski Club does not pay its representatives.
Maybe in the end, tour operators may have to follow their example, and find
some way of only paying them for the other 'odd jobs' they do and perhaps
allowing them just out-of-pocket expenses.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Property: Finding a palace in Portugal - Old and new
properties throughout Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the oldest surviving private houses in Portugal is for sale. Quinta
da Bacalhoa, at Azeitao, 20 miles south of Lisbon, can variously be
described as a manor house, country estate or summer palace. Its owners have
included members of the Portuguese royal family and aristocracy who either
cared for, or neglected, it. Its last buyer was Orlena Scoville, an
American, who became so obsessed with the house when she saw it as a ruin,
on her first visit to Portugal in 1935, that she spent the last 30 years of
her life restoring it.
The house was probably built in the early 16th century but most of its
records were lost in the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. At the end of the last
century a Portuguese scholar published a book about it and from this, and
the advice of experts, Scoville restored the building to its original state.
Mysteries remain, such as why it was built in its Islamic/Italian style and
its name has never been satisfactorily explained.
Behind the high estate walls the main building is L-shaped, with domed
towers. The residential accommodation is on the upper floor. It is not large
but there are dining, drawing and sitting rooms, a library and bedrooms. A
sunken marble bath is in one tower, a chapel in another. The house can sleep
10 and there is staff accommodation at ground level. Decorated, glazed tiles
outline windows, doorways and skirtings and cover large sections of wall.
Some are the oldest in Portugal. Altogether Scoville catalogued more than 70
different designs.
There are also loggias, an arcaded pavilion, a vast reservoir tank, and the
garden which, with its box parterre, fountain, tiled seats and boxes, is
visited in its own right. Scoville died in 1967 but the property remained in
the family and is now owned by her grandson, Thomas, who lives in
Washington. Because he and his family are only able to spend a few weeks a
year at Quinta da Bacalhoa he feels he must sell. He employs six staff and
lets the house for eight months each year. Receipts from letting and from
the vineyard cover running costs. He is asking Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.10m) for
the property and its 14 acres, which include the vineyard.
Some 15 miles north west of Lisbon is Sintra, an area noted for fine, old
properties. One of these is the 19th century Quinta do Biester, a fairytale
mixture of turrets, steep-sided roofs and Gothic windows, built by a German
industrialist. Restored frescos are a feature of the property. The house has
35 rooms on four floors and stands in 22 acres, part of which is an
arboretum. Hamptons International is asking Pounds 2.8m.
By contrast, in the same district is the square, dusty pink Quinta da Ponte
Redonda, an 18th century home on three floors, with seven bedrooms, an
annexe, farm manager's house and several outbuildings in 27 acres. Price
Pounds 1.4m, also through Hamptons.
Developers the world over complain of planners and Portugal is no exception.
Beltico is a Portuguese/British consortium which took over the 550-acre
Praia d'el Rey estate, near Obidos, on Portugal's 'Silver coast'. It applied
for revised planning permission early in 1989 and has just received it, so
work on the development has been marking time. The delay was galling for the
developer since it is eligible for an EC grant and possible tourist
authority aid, but neither could be obtained in advance of planning consent.
'The bureaucracy is an absolute nightmare,' says London solicitor Stuart
Swycher, a director of the consortium. 'It is almost unbelievable. Every
time you go through one door you face another three. We have got the
planning we wanted but it has taken so much longer . . .'
Now work can go ahead on the golf course, tennis courts and other
facilities. Eventually there will be 150 villas, town houses, apartments,
hotels and an equestrian centre.
The wait will bring benefits for eventual buyers. The recession in Portugal,
and competition for work, has cut building costs. Starting prices for
two-bedroom town houses in the development are down from Pounds 80,000 to
Pounds 55,000. Also, with new roads now open, driving time from Lisbon to
the estate has been cut from 80 minutes to 45.
Northern Portugal is a world of its own with few agents offering property
there. CTI, in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, is one which does, working with
associates in the region. It operates most in the area between Braga and
Daminha, at the entrance to the Minho river. Jeremy Lawrence, of this
agency, whose wife is Portuguese, says he has rural properties from Pounds
30,000. One might expect to spend as much again on renovation (which his
agency could arrange).
If you want something a little better he can go up to Pounds 6.3m. This
would buy a 17th century hilltop mansion with views over the Douro river.
The house has 14 ensuite bedrooms, five reception rooms and a ballroom. The
price includes furniture. The property has two swimming pools, tennis
courts, two smaller houses and 100 acres of port-wine grape vineyards.
One advantage of the area is the low cost of living. 'One can eat out in a
good restaurant for a fiver a head, inclusive of wine,' says Lawrence, 'and
where else could one get a puncture fixed for Pounds 1.60?'
One might think that only a supreme optimist would launch a housing project
in the Algarve at present. But work has begun on the Quinta do Rosal
development of 30 villas and 12 town houses on a 14-acre site near
Carvoeiro.
Prices range from Pounds 90,000 for a three-bedroom house and Pounds 112,000
to Pounds 132,000 for a four-bedroom villa, including land. Just to get
things going, the development company, Passarro Verde, has announced a
'special offer' - four two-bedroom houses with roof terraces are available
for Pounds 65,000 each. The properties are being marketed in London by
European Partnership.
Salisbury-based Euro Property Advisers used to handle both new and resale
property in the Algarve but says it is now only dealing in resales because
it became embarrassing offering resales at half the price of similar new
properties on the same estate. Apartments start at around Pounds 50,000 and
villas around Pounds 100,000. Within the Algarve's Quinta do Lago estate,
Bovis Abroad is a long-standing developer. It has 35 villas and apartments
to build in its lakeside village there and expects prices to start at Pounds
115,000. In high season a three-bedroom villa with pool will let there from
Pounds 1,200 week.
Its Sao Lourenco project, on the same estate, has a golf course on one side
and a lake on the other. That development is entirely apartments, with
communal pool and bar. Some 40 units, from Pounds 102,000, have still to be
built. Free golf membership goes with every apartment. There is also a
deferred payment scheme. Lakeside sells to British buyers; Sao Lourenco
attracts Germans and a mixed market.
With the recently completed Pinheiros Altos course adjoining Quinta do Lago,
the estate claims that the area is now the largest golfing complex in
Europe. Pinheiros Altos' developers, Firago, formerly LET Leisure, allocated
91 plots with secured golf membership, around the course. The first
four-bedroom show house has been built and sold for around Pounds 485,000.
Away from Quinta do Lago, farther along the coast, Bovis has its Quinta da
Boavista project, with 350 plots for sale from Pounds 50,000, in 217 acres.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Sport: How Bath play the power game - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JACK ROWELL is the managing dictator of Bath rugby club. The charismatic
coach from Hartlepool in north east England has created a centre of rugby
excellence that is the envy of the world.
His record since becoming coach at Bath in 1977 is extraordinary, having
already achieved success at the helm at Gosforth (Cup wins in 1976 and
1977), he has won 11 trophies since 1984 (four league titles in six years;
seven cup victories out of 10) at Bath.
After Bob Dwyer, the Australian coach, took his club Randwick to five Sydney
premiership titles he became national coach. Rowell has not had such luck.
He has only just been re-admitted to the inner sanctum at Twickenham. Last
year Rowell took the England B side to New Zealand. This year he was shunned
and did not accompany the England A side to Canada in the close season
(where England lost a test to Canada for the first time). This was a
disgrace.
Three weeks ago, Rowell was given back the England A side and will prepare
it for the battle against the All Blacks at Gateshead on November 7. Rowell
should have his sights set on succeeding Geoff Cooke, the England manager,
after the 1995 World Cup and Bath know they must find a successor.
The favourite is Stuart Barnes, the England fly half, but he said: 'It's not
for me. It's natural that people should speculate that as I have been
associated with most of Bath's successes of the last decade that when I
retire I would want to take on Jack's role. But, I see it very differently.'
The balance of power in the club is changing. Many of those who have run the
club for the past four decades have found recent changes hard to accept.
Several were forced to resign at an extraordinary general meeting this
summer.
Roger Berry, a former chairman and player, said: 'The way rugby is going it
is inevitable that there are two heads to a club, the administration which
makes it possible for the game to be played at all levels right down to
minis, and the coaching and playing staff who create our success on the
field.
'It's clear that most senior clubs will have a chief executive officer
before the decade is out. The game is simply so big. No individual can run
the club. It's a 24-hour, seven days a week business and it has to be
professionally managed.'
'The problem,' said John Roberts, a former chairman and ckub captain, 'is
that a paid officer cannot vote under the existing rules of most clubs and
so might feel hemmed in. The ideal scenario would be two paid officials -
one who is head of administration and the other who is head of coaching but
they would be answerable to the executive committee of the club.'
Such a development would mean clubs having to pay Pounds 80,000 in salaries
which in turn means they would have to be turning over Pounds 800,000
(assuming a 10 per cent profit). Bath is not in that position.
Colin Gale, the recently retired honorary treasurer, said: 'Bath made a
profit of Pounds 35,000 after depreciation in 1989, less in 1990, a loss of
just under Pounds 5,000 in 1991 and a Pounds 55,000 profit in 1992. I doubt
if it will be more in 1993 because we were knocked out of the Pilkington
Cup.' The turnover of the club in 1992, net of VAT, was Pounds 450,000.
Bath is a small city with a population of 80,000. The ground could hold many
more than the 8,000 who regularly cram into its tight borders.
Bath's success has meant they have not had to enter the 'transfer' market.
Most of its players are local and in a previous decade would have gone more
naturally to near neighbours Bristol or farther up the road to Gloucester or
Newport. Those who have come from afar include Tony Swift from Swansea, Ben
Clarke from Bishop's Stortford, via Saracens, Victor Ubogu from Richmond (he
lives in London and travels down to Bath three times a week) and Stuart
Barnes and Jon Webb who both came from Bristol.
The rest - Guscott, Hall, Reed, Chilcott, Sole, Halliday and so on - were
drawn from the club's hinterland. Rumours abound that somehow the players
are either given incentives or paid. This was denied by Gale: 'We have to
send our audited accounts to Somerset RFU and they have raised the
occasional comment with respect to players expenses mainly in the region of
medical expenses (Pounds 25,000 in 1992) and travel expenses (Pounds 35,000
in 1992). But they have always confirmed to the RFU that our accounts are in
order.'
'The point is,' said Barnes 'that we do spend money on our preparation.
'Every one wants to beat us and most weeks our games are like an FA Cup
final for our opponents. This year with home and away in the Courage league
this will be heightened farther. For away games we leave Bath on Friday
afternoon and stay overnight in a quality hotel so that we are ready
mentally and physically the next day. (Away expenses, for all the club's
four senior and many youth teams, were Pounds 33,000 in 1992) There simply
isn't any other way to stay on top. We must be as professional prepared as
any first class athlete.'

FT  02 OCT 93 / Motoring: Two hot favourites for Europe's big car prize -
Stuart Marshall has his own ideas on who will take the laurels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGHTS DRAW in, the London Motor Show looms and marketing directors of car
makers have but a single thought; will we win Car of the Year 1994?
There are more car of the year competitions than you could shake a gear
stick at, but the big one is European Car of the Year, decided by a panel of
nearly 60 motoring journalists. I am not among them so I feel free to
forecast the result.
A potential Car of the Year must have been available in five markets with
the prospect of at least 5,000 sales each year. This rules out exotica such
as Ferraris and Bugattis. The most extravagant cars ever to have won were
the Porsche 928 in 1978 and the Mercedes 450 V8 (1974).
A win is worth millions in free publicity although it does not mean the car
is a technological masterpiece or a sure thing in the showrooms.
Would you believe the Rover 3500, Chrysler Horizon, Lancia Delta and Renault
9 were European Cars of the Year in their time? And that the first,
trend-setting, best-selling VW Golf was passed over. Sometimes - like last
year when the British-made Nissan Micra was the jury's choice - the entries
are so thin the result is almost a foregone conclusion.
In others - as in 1991 and again this year - the field is so large that
picking a likely winner can be tricky, even assuming all members of the jury
put national prejudices to one side and vote objectively.
This time there are 15 names in the frame and two hot favourites, the Ford
Mondeo and Citroen Xantia. They replace mid-range favourites - Mondeo the
Sierra, Xantia the BX - and have been selling well. Mondeo can be had as a
four-door saloon, five-door hatchback or estate; Xantia only as a five-door
hatchback at present.
Both are all things a modern car should be; mechanically refined, quiet and
comfortable performers, with good safety features. If the jury gives more
weight to passive safety than, say, the benefits of self-levelling,
semi-active suspension, then Mondeo will win. (It comes with a standard
driver's airbag which the Xantia lacks).
But the Xantia's styling - unlike the Mondeo, you would never take it for a
Mazda, Nissan or Toyota - and its ride, handling and roomier rear seats must
pick up extra votes. The clincher could be the sheer urbanity of the
higher-geared turbo-diesel versions of Xantia which currently have no rival
in their size and price class.
Renault's Twingo, which looks like a miniature Espace and took the 1992
Paris salon de l'automobiles by storm, and General Motors' (Opel or
Vauxhall) Corsa should be well up in the field. But neither is likely to
win, if only because last year first and second places went to a brace of
little cars, the Nissan Micra and Fiat Cinquecento.
Also likely to be among the front runners is the Saab 900, first fruit of
the marriage between Saab and General Motors. In every way a worthy car, it
is still strongly Swedish though less overtly masculine in character than
the old 900.
A strong mid-field challenge to the Saab is likely from the Mercedes
C-Class, replacement for the very successful 190 and crucially important for
its embattled manufacturer. Those not quite identical twins, the Honda
Accord and Rover 600, are slightly upmarket of Mondeo and Xantia and have
been entered separately. Will the jury come down on the side of the Accord's
price-for-price better equipment or the Rover's lovely interior?
If the Citroen ZX could not take last year's award - many thought it was
voted down simply because too many French cars had been winning - the
Peugeot 306 which shares all its mechanical components is unlikely to be
among the leaders this year.
Of the remaining six long shots, the new Seat Ibiza will probably attract
more votes than the Daihatsu Charade, Lancia Delta, Mitsubishi Galant,
Nissan Serena or Hyundai Impreza.
The jury is out and its verdict will be delivered a few weeks hence. Were I
to be making a book on Car of the Year, the odds I would chalk up on the
board are: 4-5 Citroen Xantia; evens Ford Mondeo; 2-1 Renault Twingo and
Opel (Vauxhall) Corsa; 3-1 Mercedes C-Class and Saab 900; 5-1 Rover 600; 9-2
Honda Accord; 12-1 Seat Ibiza and Peugeot 306.
The contenders include: Citroen Xantia, Daihatsu Charade, Ford Mondeo, Honda
Accord, Hyundai Impreza, Lancia Delta, Mercedes C-Class, Mitsubishi Galant,
Nissan Serena, Peugeot 306, Renault Twingo, Rover 600, Saab 900, Seat Ibiza,
and the Vauxhall (Opel) Corsa.

BATH rugby club is in a win-win situation. In January, the Department of
Environment will rule on whether or not their training ground at Lambridge
can be sold to Tesco's for Pounds 17m.
The ground lies at the edge of the city at the junction of two of the
busiest roads. If Tesco's planning application is turned down, the city
council must build a park and ride on the site. Sadly for the club this will
mean they only receive, depending on who you talk to, a cool Pounds 5m, or
after the third bottle, a rather less modest Pounds 14m.
In some ways, the club has stopped thinking about the 'what-if' situation.
It has already taken an option on another training ground but is in a
quandary about whether it should keep playing at the Recreation Ground, move
up the hill to the university and build a 20,000-seater stadium or opt for
an even more spectacular solution, perhaps with Bristol Rovers soccer club.
The problem is that the club does not own its ground. It is leased from the
city until 2065, and other sporting organisations share it, including
Somerset County Cricket Club whose square limits building possibilities. The
shift to four-day county matches has made Bath Festival Week less attractive
financially to Somerset. If the county retreats entirely to Taunton, this
would allow the rugby club a freer hand.
Bath rugby club probably wants to stay at the Recreation Ground and see the
site fully developed. But this is unlikely. The city council, though more
supportive of late, would not welcome an all-seater stadium.
The compromise? Well, just to stand still, the club hopes to raise Pounds
1.5m by the end of the year to build a new stand on the south face of the
hideous sports centre the council built by the pitch in the 1970s. The money
was more or less committed but last week Courage, the brewer, withdrew
Pounds 500,000 of sponsorship for the stand. The stand will hold seating for
400 and 19 hospitality boxes which are being offered at Pounds 10,000 a year
 -a minimum of 20 home games. Even sub-let for one match the price compares
favourably with Gloucester, Pounds 1,000 per match day and Harlequins,
Pounds 2,500, albeit for groups of 25 or more, or, outside rugby, with
Pounds 1,200 at Arsenal and Pounds 1,600 at Surrey cricket club.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Sport: Life as a heavy hitter - American Football / Patrick
Harverson meets Ronnie Lott, master of the kamikaze tackle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON AN overcast, humid day, a squad of American football players strolls off
the New York Jets' practice field after the whistle sounds to end the
morning session. In a distant corner, a lone figure stays behind.
For the next 10 minutes, he charges a tackling dummy. Knees bent, body low
to the ground, he hits the padded dummy at full speed. Each time, he drives
the dummy back a few yards before wrestling it to the ground. When he
finishes, uniform soaked in sweat and helmet pushed high up on the top of
his head, he walks back to the locker room, stopping to sign autographs for
a small crowd of children.
Showered and rested, Ronnie Lott, the Jets' star defender, sits down happily
for a chat in a cramped office behind the practice facility. The extra
workout on the tackling dummy was typical of Lott. 'I think it's important
to spend a little extra time practising,' he says. 'It makes you more
confident.'
Lott is 34 and in his 13th season in the National Football League, yet he
displays the enthusiasm of a player fresh from college. In the 1980s, he
anchored the defence of the San Francisco 49ers. He helped the team to win
four Super Bowl in nine years.
In 1991, he left San Francisco for a brief stint with the Los Angeles
Raiders before signing this year with the Jets, who have won two of their
first three games and are tipped to make the playoffs.
Most NFL players are fortunate if they last four years. For a defensive
player who hurls his body into opponents, Lott's longevity is miraculous. It
has surprised even Lott himself. 'When I started, I expected to play about
eight years.'
He says fitness, extra training and a mix of conventional medical treatments
and unconventional healing techniques have allowed him to survive for so
long. A lot of it, he says, is about adopting a positive attitude: 'It's
amazing how strong your mind can be in helping your body heal.'
Lott is a 'safety'. He roams behind the defensive lines bringing down
runners or intercepting passes. 'You're the last line of defence, the guy
that tries to make sure everything stays in front of you.'
The safety must be a leader and possess a good footballing brain. 'You spend
a lot of time directing people and coordinating positions. If someone blows
an assignment, you have to cover up for them. You have to understand
everything that's going on in the game. Your job is to make sure you give
your team one more chance to line up.'
Lott's tackling is legendary. Even if you rarely watch American football,
you have probably seen him on one of the highlight videos that show the
sport's brutal collisions, hitting opponents with bone-jarring tackles. The
secret to good tackling, or 'hitting', is catching the target off-guard, he
says.
'Some of the best hits you see are when a player is running, and all of a
sudden he doesn't see the other player, and BOOM, the guy whacks him,
catching him off balance. You have to be able to hit him before he's ready
for you.'
Lott talks about his art with little emotion, just a cool description of how
to create mayhem. 'When you go to hit somebody, it's like you have blinkers
on - you cannot see anything but the target. As soon as you hit the target
you release your energy . . . you need that to make sure they go down.'
What is it like to bring down a charging 250-pound running back?
'Sometimes it hurts, sometimes it doesn't. It's like if you're a baseball
player, and when you hit a pitch at the end of the bat and your hands start
to ring . . . that's because you didn't hit it at the right spot - the sweet
spot. A lot of the time it's the same thing in football. If you do not hit
them in the right spot, you ring a little. Yet, sometimes you hit a guy and
you get right up as if nothing happened.' That, he says, is when you know
you have hit the sweet spot.
Lott says he never intends to put an opponent out of the game. 'I don't want
to ever hurt someone deliberately. But I want that guy to know that I've
given him everything that I have. If I'm out there to hurt them, they are
not going to respect me.'
Lott is famous for the burning glare he turns on opponents during games. He
admits he can be intimidating.
'I don't try and intimidate people with the way I look, that's just part of
who I am. I walk out on the street and people go: 'Why don't you smile?
What's wrong with you?' And I say: 'That's just me.' Some days it frightens
people.
'To a certain extent, I do enjoy violence. Violence is not necessarily
destructive. Violence can be constructive. Everybody has a little violence
in them. Some people use it the wrong way, some people use it a positive
way.'
Although he has suffered countless concussions, Lott is still in one piece.
Well, almost. In 1986, he chose to have the tip of a mangled finger
amputated rather than miss part of the season recovering from the surgery
needed to save it. Lott views the threat of serious injury as an unavoidable
part of the sport.
'You've got to have that Chuck Yeager attitude - the Right Stuff - to play
this game. You can't be defeated by the fear gods. They're there, always
tapping you on your shoulder, but you have to somehow block them out of your
mind.
'The game is a lot tougher than fans think. If someone thinks they can play
football, throw a ball up into the air for them, and just before it hits
their hands, grab a baseball bat and hit that guy on the back of his head.
If he can hold on to the ball, then he can play.'
In this game, Lott is always the one with the bat.

FT  02 OCT 93 / How to Spend It: Chanel's secret classics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANEL No. 5 is possibly the world's most famous perfume and Cristalle and
Coco also have their fans but what few know is that there is a clutch of
Chanel perfumes that are more exclusive still - Gardenia, Cuir de Russie,
Bois des Iles and No. 22. All four were originally created in the 1920s in
the heyday of Coco Chanel at roughly the same time as the ineffable Chanel
No. 5 and by the same parfumier, Ernest Beaux.
While Chanel No. 5 caught the imagination of the sophisticated world, the
other four found smaller audiences in the Chanel boutiques in London and
Paris where devotees buy them to this day. Those who wear them know that
they are members of an exclusive little club for so few know of these
perfumes' existence.
For those looking for a perfume that stood the test of time but still has an
aura of recherche glamour, go to the Chanel Boutiques (which are the only
places to sell them) and ask to sniff the perfumes.
Some like the sweetness of Gardenia, others the spiciness of Cuir de Russie,
the exotic floral notes of No. 22 or the rich boskiness of Bois des Iles but
whichever is the one for you, rest assured you will not be smelling it
everywhere.
200 ml bottles of Eau de Toilette sell at Pounds 59 each, 14 ml and 28 ml of
the parfum at Pounds 69 and Pounds 113.
A splendid present would be the set of three crystal bottles of 7.5.ml of
parfum of Gardenia, Cuir de Russie and Bois des Iles for Pounds 165.

FOLLOW the silk road to Clapham and you will be amazed at what you will
find. There, in her own house, Helen Hardy sells an amazing collection of
vibrant fake flowers: daisies, Easter lilies, sprays of fuchsia, purples
bunches of lilac and roses, roses, roses.
These are not the fake flowers of yesteryear, all hideous plastic and harsh
colourings. These are enchanting versions made from silk and parchment that
can save the day for those who love rooms filled with bowls and vases of
flowers but cannot always be sure of finding real country roses, the right
greenery or the particular collection of sweet spring flowers they crave.
Hardy sells all the stems individually (including a big selection of
greenery) and she will send out a price list on request. A fuchsia spray,
costs Pounds 3.20, a single medium rose, Pounds 1.40, a bud blossom, Pounds
2.30. She will also happily make up arrangements - some customers just ask
for a country look or a collection of country roses and are usually, it
seems, well-pleased with the result.
A formal collection in a large container - like the one shown left -
suitable for a grand reception or a large drawing-room, might cost as much
as Pounds 240, but a simple collection of country flowers could be had for
about Pounds 30 (and just think how long they will last]).

FT  02 OCT 93 / How to Spend It: Big spenders are hitting the factory floor
 -Lucia van der Post reports on the latest shopping fad - one-stop retail
'happenings' that sell top brands at low prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IT IS fashionable to think that most of the ills the Western world has been
suffering in recent years are due to a familiar cyclical event known as a
recession. Some of us - what you might call the deeper thinkers - have other
views. We perceive more profound shifts in the psyche than are accounted for
by mere economic downturns.
Attitudes to life, to the things that really matter as well as to more
mundane, considerations such as expenditure: all have changed so much that
the entrepreneurs who make it successfully to the year 2000 will have to be
a fleet-footed mix of economist, accountant, trader, sociologist and
clairvoyant.
Retailers, in particular, are going to have to be exceptionally nifty.
Anybody who nurtures an old-fashioned nostalgia for the days when shopping
meant a cosy chat at the corner shop and a dear little man in a striped
overall trimming your Sunday joint had better fasten their seat-belts and
prepare for a bumpy ride. In the pipeline is a whole range of different
retailing experiments to cater for new-age shoppers.
Yesterday, for instance, television shopping in the shape of QVC (Quality
Value Convenience) Channel started on BSKyB and though nobody can be sure
that we in the UK will embrace it as enthusiastically as our transatlantic
cousins it clearly marks a new era.
Factory outlets are another of the coming things. In America they are the
fastest growing sector in the highly competitive retail world. They are what
students of the genre call 'Destination Shopping Centres'.
Chuck Bloom, perhaps the daddy of the whole outlet business and the man
behind the hugely-successful Woodbury Common and Liberty Village in New York
state, has defined the ideal of outlet shopping: 'It should never sell stuff
that nobody wants. It is over-runs or samples of mostly current ranges that
bring in the customers. There should be a good mix of designer labels as
well as dresses and shoes and things for the kids. Then you need to be a
'happening' as well, somewhere worth visiting for a fun day out.'
Outlets are not round the corner from anybody. Nobody goes there once a
week. What Mr and Mrs Middle America (or a whole gaggle of Mrs and Miss
Middle Americas) seem to do is to plan a visit as they might a jaunt. They
make a day of it, buying junior's new trainers and anorak at the same time
as they pick up a new designer frock, a few presents, Dad's socks, having a
jolly good lunch and coming home all the cheerier for a good day out.
'The mall,' say some observers of the American scene, 'is the latterday
village green,' and nowhere more so than the outlet mall. Whether the
concept will work as well in Britain remains to be seen . . .
In Hornsea, East Yorkshire, the Hornsea Freeport Shopping Village has been
operating successfully for three years, selling a range of reduced price
clothing and china from 17 different tenants. However, few in the more
densely populated south east and Midlands seem to know about it.
At Street in Somerset, Clarks Village, modelled carefully on the American
genre, is up and running. A themed village with plenty of parking, nicely
arranged shops, good restaurants and children's play areas, it sells a raft
of merchandise from 22 well-known names (Laura Ashley, Benetton, Aquascutum,
Dartington Crystal, Royal Worcester) all at prices discounted by up to 60
per cent.
More factory outlet malls are in the pipeline. Gerald Ratner, the former
jewellery shop magnate, is advising the consortium that bought Tobacco Dock
in London from the receiver when it went bust. 'I first decided outlet
shopping was the coming thing,' he says, 'when I found that the Calvin Klein
boxer shorts I paid Dollars 8 for in New York and Pounds 8 in London's
Harvey Nichols, were on sale at Dollars 1.75 at Bells in Orlando.
'What I want for Tobacco Dock is to get bargains in big designer names like
that - that is what gives the mall its glamour in America.'
Still angling for top-quality tenants, too, is Value Retail, a consortium
which opens a 105,000 sq ft purpose-built outlet village outside Bicester,
Oxfordshire, next autumn. Modelled on the Woodbury Common and Liberty
Village outlet centres it plans to make sure that the mix of shops is right
and that the merchandise is irresistible.
For the consumer perhaps the biggest disappointment initially is the prices
 -they are good but not as low as one expects. I arrived at Woodbury Common
and Liberty Village expecting the kind of free-for-all and mouthwatering
prices that I had found when bargain-hunting on the Lower East Side of New
York. I found nothing of the sort.
Here were smart shops, each clearly labelled - Calvin Klein, Donna Karan,
Cole-Haan, Stileman - selling current merchandise at prices that were
reasonable, but far from dead cheap. On average prices seem to be 30 per
cent lower than full retail on things such as china, glass, luggage and
shoes and about 50 per cent on the highly fashionable items. But - acid test
 -I (and my companions) all bought something.
Chuck Bloom himself admits: 'They're not giving the merchandise away. Nobody
is selling rubbish. The customer these days is sophisticated. He or she
knows the labels so although Dollars 600 may still be a lot to pay, it is
less than the Dollars 900 they know it will be selling for in Manhattan.'
If Value Retail can get those sorts of names at those sorts of prices, the
purveyors of the coach trips swanning through Oxford and Stratford-on-Avon
may soon find another destination even more popular with their punters. We
shall have to wait until next autumn to see but in the meantime watch this
space - factory outlets are on their way.

FT  02 OCT 93 / How to Spend It: Kits give a new meaning to DIY - decoupage
it yourself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST of us have come across decoupage work at some time or another and
marvelled at its beauty, its finesse, its intricacy but few of us, I
imagine, ever dreamed that we might do it ourselves writes Lucia van der
Post.
Decoupage, in case the you are unfamiliar with the technique, involves using
stencils, cut-outs, pictures, photographs to embellish anything from a tray
to a screen or a piece of furniture. The pictorial elements are stuck on and
then covered in coats of veneer to strengthen them. If you have the talent
or inclination for time-consuming creative work there is no reason why you
should not embark on this elegantly decorative craft.
Belinda Ballantine, who has run decorative painting courses and clearly has
limitless skill and patience for embellishing domestic objects, has produced
a little collection of decoupage kits which simplify the whole fiddly
business.
The simplest of Ballantine's kits is the starter. For Pounds 15 you get a
small box, the suggested designs and the rest of the necessary equipment.
Trays start at Pounds 14.50, candlesticks at Pounds 18, and a planter is
Pounds 18.50. She has written a book on the subject - The Decoupage Kit -
which covers the technique in much more detail and offers more suggestions.
The prime function of the kits, it seems to me, is to offer a smooth and
easy introduction to the skill - once the basics have been learned endless
decorative possibilities can be indulged in.
Write to Belinda Ballantine, The Abbey Brewery, Market Cross, Malmesbury,
Wiltshire SN16 9AS for her leaflet listing the kits and for any other
details.

READERS WHO have been faithful followers of the annual jewellery and
silverware fairs at London's Goldsmiths' Hall should note that this year's
fair runs from October 4-9.
The fair used to be called Loot. It has always been a mecca for those
looking for jewellery or silverware for themselves or for presents and,
possibly more important, it is a chance to see a wide range of work from
Britain's most talented designers.
This year's fair is no exception - from the glimpses I have had the
standards are as high, the innovations as interesting and the designs as
fine as ever. You could spend as little as Pounds 30 on a pair of ear-rings,
or a great deal more on commissioning a set of table silver. Two of the most
exquisite pieces on show are photographed here. Do not be discouraged by
their prices, there is a great deal of choice at less than Pounds 100 and
even more at less than Pounds 300.
The brooch, by Stephen Webster (above), is in 18 carat gold and features a
carved citrine in the form of a lion with blue / green tourmalines and
matching enamel highlighted with pave set brilliant diamonds for Pounds
7,000, while Maureen Edgar's silver pepper pot (right) is turned into an
object of great beauty by fine cloisonne enamelling. It costs Pounds 2,500.
The exhibition starts on Monday 4 and is on until Saturday 9. It is open
every day from 11 am to 7 pm except Saturday when it closes at 5 pm. The
Pounds 1 entrance fee includes the catalogue. The Goldsmiths' Hall is in
Foster Lane, London EC2V 6BN.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Fashion: Wearable Westwood passes the test - Jane Mulvagh
and five friends cast a professional eye over the clothes of a famously
outrageous designer - and are pleasantly surprised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIVIENNE Westwood has an image problem. While she is keen to be taken
seriously as a designer of wearable clothes rather than protest-laden
costume, to most her name conjures up platform shoes that Naomi Campbell
falls off or nude bodysuits decorated with modesty-feigning fig leaves. She
seems to have wilfully driven herself up a marketing cul-de-sac, destined to
dress only the impecunious and provocative under-25s.
But British fashion's class clown, like all class clowns, has grown up and
seeks our respect. She intends to capitalise on her indisputable talent by
building a design empire as impressive as those of her Continental copyists
and to harness her skills to a major European couture house.
She is, in addition, negotiating with a multinational pension fund, for the
use of a dignified and imposing building in Mayfair with a serious sartorial
history. If she pulls that off Vivienne Westwood will really be on the map.
Her company has reached that crucial transition point, like Biba in the
early 1970s, between cult and mainstream clothes designer, a point at which
it is essential to understand fully both customer needs and pricing points.
Over the past three years some working women, curious enough to break
through the popular misconception, have discovered that while 30 per cent of
her clothes tend to be impossibly, if entertainingly, unwearable the rest -
Miss Marple tweeds, 'New Look' tartans, velvet Lord Fauntleroy separates ,
Dangerous Liaisons corsets - are sassy and flattering. She indulges their
desire to, at times, adopt a slatternly prettiness.
Her curvy tailoring spearheaded the reaction against hard-edged power
dressing and she has long disliked the skeletal figure, often putting women
over 60 and pregnant or voluptuous women (regarded by the judgmental fashion
industry as fat) on the catwalk, and opening our eyes to sensuousness and
gentleness rather than predatory and commercial sex appeal.
Her efforts have earned her two Designer of The Year awards, front-row seats
at Dior, Lacroix and Alaia in Paris in public recognition of her penetrating
influence. Women's Wear Daily has elected her as one of the top five
designers of this century - alongside Chanel and Saint Laurent.
Acclaim within the industry is one thing, but women wearing Westwood for
everyday working lives is another.
The Financial Times invited five women, ranging in age from their 30s to 60s
 -a lawyer, a journalist, an auctioneer, a corporate development executive
and an entrepreneur - to comment on her autumn collection. Four of them had
never worn her clothes and shared the typical preconceptions about her work
but all share an enthusiastic appreciation of design, mind about what they
wear and have a reasonable budget but little time to shop.
Anna Somers Cocks, editor of The Art Newspaper, has never worn Westwood. She
is 5 ft 3 in and sports the kind of deliciously voluptuous figure that real
men love and the fashion industry loathes.
Scanning the rails she summed up Westwood's appeal: 'Her clothes are the
transvestite idea of what a woman should look like, converted back into what
women can wear and because transvestites have an acute and dramatic sense of
what looks feminine, in fact they look wonderful.'
Anna loves the way the corsets encourage you to 'play at being a 17th
century trollop' (her husband insists that she only wear them for him, so
winning is their impact]). 'The shop makes one feel one is trying on the
clothes of other generations, like fancy dress.' She feels, though, that,
given the price, some of the workmanship and materials are too cheap, though
the wools and tweeds are well-made.
Claire Enders, Corporate Development Manager at Thorn EMI, is 5 ft 11 in
tall and beanpole slim. She is no stranger to Westwood. 'I started wearing
her clothes three years ago - those narrow, stretchy gold 'boule' dresses.
Her jackets are first-rate and the large shirts with massive collars and big
sleeves are magnificent and incredibly comfortable to wear. Her clothes are
fun.'
For the office Claire sees her clothes as an armour. 'You're surrounded by
the enemy sex.' Mostly she dresses in generic executive woman mode, wearing
dark suits with longline jackets and short skirts, never trousers, and
seeking out clothes that 'create good feelings which you project and people
think - right, she's cool and in control.'
In spite of such self-imposed strictures for office dress Claire found
several suitable suits. She admires Westwood's interesting shapes, such as
the tucked darts, ruched skirts and romantic jackets, whose clever details
'may not be noticed by many but certainly give you a sense of style and
confidence. The popular image that she has - all those odd things - actually
make you feel good and completely different. They're not glamorous so much
as eccentric and interesting. They please me.' Her verdict: good jackets,
disappointing skirts.
Three of the women feel that the range of sizes is poor, that the
skirt/jacket options have not been practically thought out, that the skirt
shapes are too 'clever' and unflattering and that the shop presentation
could be off-putting to a first-time customer. All loved the jackets and
coats.
Eliza Mellor, a tax law solicitor at Nicholson, Graham &amp; Jones, believes
that the uninitiated would have difficulty making the most of the original
clothes.
'For example, I did not realise that her rose-bud shirts go with the
tartans.' Eliza does not have to dress to impress colleagues. 'I simply have
to ensure that my client feels comfortable and so I mustn't overaccentuate
my appearance as they can be scared by too unusual a dress.' She loves the
tartan jackets, and the capes, finding them warm and pretty.
Pauline Hyde, founder of Pauline Hyde &amp; Associates, an international
outplacement agency, is keenly aware of the messages her clothes communicate
and throughout her career has carefully dressed each morning with her latest
client in mind.
'I was genuinely surprised to find how wearable her clothes are for I had
thought of her as wacky and not for me. Her collection is much broader than
I had realised and I was delighted that I could find things to wear in my
business life. She offers something that is ahead of fashion and yet has
shelf life.'
Pauline was disappointed by the finish but would have bought some clothes if
they had been a little longer through the waist. 'I loved some of them but
as she does not do made to measure I couldn't walk straight into them. But
my perception has been totally changed and she will be one of the designers
that I look at when buying in the future.'
Susannah Pollen, a director of Sotheby's, is the most daring in her approach
to Westwood for, being immersed in the arts, she has a more experimental
approach. 'Curiously it's easy to make Westwood's clothes look quite
conservative and well . . . Sloaney and what's the point in that?' she asks.
She chose to wear the infamous platform shoes: 'They really have a point,
they elongate the silhouette making the clothes look marvellous.'
'The positive aspect of Westwood is her imagination. I think the outrageous
things are very glamorous and make you feel wonderful. On the negative side
some of the detailing can be difficult to wear unless you are very tall.'
She, too, felt that more help was needed to enable the customer to
understand the clothes and be shown various ways to put the separates
together. 'Her clothes can be daunting but once you've tried them on they're
wonderful.'
Four out of the five women ended up buying something for this season; Anna
will be kept behind closed doors in her corset, Eliza chose the tartan and
velvet outfit for wearing at the Salzburg music festival, Susannah opted for
a fake-fur trimmed Harlow-style coat and Claire continues to be a regular
customer. And while each lives up to the definition of a modern working
woman they have the confidence and femininity to break away from the
formulaic notion of working dress - but then Bertrand Russell did say that
'Orthodoxy was the graveyard of intelligence.'

Weekend FT has received a sackload of mail, following Nicholas Lander's
article last week, on how to deal with a partner or colleague who falls
asleep in a restaurant.
Just how widespread is this phenomenon is reflected in readers' letters from
Spain, Switzerland, Japan, the US and, of course, the UK. Some of your
replies and anecdotes were hilarious. We will be printing a selection of
them in next Saturday's Weekend FT and announcing the winner of our pink
champagne prize for best letter.
Dine-a-Mite is a new charity established to help the hungry and homeless in
Great Britain through the hospitality industry. Its opening event takes
place on the evening of Sunday October 17 when more than 11,000 hotels and
restaurants, covering every type of cuisine and price bracket, will open
their doors and donate 50 per cent of their takings to the charity.
To locate a participating restaurant there is a special helpline: for
restaurants in London tel: 0891-515525, outside London: 0839-300200. Calls
charged at 48p per minute peak time, 36p at all other times.
Richard and Peter Harden have launched Harden's London Party Guide (Pounds
6.95), a book that fills an obvious void at this time of year. It lists more
than 900 venues for functions, from the private rooms of restaurants and
hotels to the magnificent Wallace Collection museum and Wembley Greyhound
Stadium. Another section covers costs, caterers, party planners and party
shops.
Winemakers from Robert Mondavi, Beringer, Saintsbury and Stag's Leap Wine
Cellars in California's Napa Valley, are taking time off from their
fermenting vats next week and pouring complimentary glasses of their best
wines to lunchtime customers at Stephen Bull's Bistro EC1 (490-1970),
Christopher's, WC2, (240-4222), Zoe, W1, (224-1122), Le Pont de la Tour,
SE1, (403-8403), and Ransome's Dock, SW11 (223-1611).
Fresh foie gras is available in London at the delicatessen counter of
Selfridges in Oxford Street and at Vivians, 360 Kings Road, SW3. You can
either buy it by the 2oz slice (about Pounds 3.50) or in a 14 oz roll for
about Pounds 24. It comes from the Landes in southern France. The French
often fry it in butter and serve it on a bed of warm lettuce leaves. You can
be more adventurous: the chef at the Complete Angler, in Marlow, Bucks, uses
it as a stuffing for partridge en croute.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Hot, hot, hot. It must be Chile - The wine
trade's latest love affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHILLI IS hot, but Chile is hotter
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
if you happen to be a British wine merchant that is. Every few years the
traditional British wine trade falls collectively in love with a 'new' wine
region and this seems to be Chile's year. (Even though Chilean viticulture
is more than two centuries older than California's or Australia's)
Such is the price of a flight to Santiago that most wine merchants have to
rely on their traditional buying method: a wine trade tasting. At last
month's showcase of 28 Chilean wineries' wares in London, merchants from all
over Britain were slurping and spitting, all trying to decide between San
This and Santa That.
Brand differentiation, like record-keeping and ampelography (vine variety
identification), seems to be a relatively unfamiliar concept to Chileans,
and exporting wineries include not just San Pedro but Santas Adela,
Carolina, Emiliana, Helena, Ines, Monica and Rita.
Until recently Chile has concentrated its wine export efforts northwards,
and Chilean Cabernet, Chardonnay and Sauvignon are regarded in the US as a
handy cheap alternative to the domestic produce of California.
Indeed, according to one of New York's most famous wine merchants, the
reason Americans have been so slow to cotton on to the value on offer in
southern France is because they have ready access to the
easier-to-understand Chilean varietals - no need to grasp such geographical
concepts as Corbieres and Minervois.
It is true that Chilean wine comes in basically three flavours - Cabernet,
Chardonnay and Sauvignon - and this may well be an advantage in the mass
market, but it does illustrate the limitations of the country as a wine
producer. Of its 66,000 hectares of vineyard, more than half are still
planted with the very ordinary Pais and Muscat of Alexandria vines.
In spite of the admirable decision in the late 1980s to give Chile's wine
industry export credibility, involving Pounds 67m invested in more suitable
vineyards and modern equipment, there is still much work to be done.
For the moment Chile produces a plethora of perm-a-Santa Cabernet, mainly
from the Maipo region, which retails between Pounds 3.50 and Pounds 6 a
bottle and is usually perfectly respectable with lots of obvious fruit as it
hits the palate. But there is rarely much distinction or structure (oak
ageing is another new science), and many of the wines seem to share a
bloody, slightly salty character.
Most producers are well aware of the need to demonstrate that Chile can
produce truly exciting red wine, albeit in small, top-of-the-market
quantities. Santa Rita, one of the more dynamic producers, has developed its
beautiful Casa Real label for expressly this purpose, and it is getting
better (and more expensive) with every vintage.
Dedicated followers of wine fashion should certainly try a bottle of Casa
Real, although at Pounds 11 to Pounds 13, the 1990 which should reach
Harrods, Bibendum and Oddbins by the end of November, is probably less good
value than Santa Rita's basic 120 range of unoaked reds at Pounds 4 to
Pounds 5.
They should also try Montes Alpha Cabernet Sauvignon 1989 which is another
creditable effort likely to appeal to palates reared on claret, and is
available at about Pounds 7.99 from Majestic, Oddbins, selected Tesco and
Victoria Wine, Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester, Terry Platt of Llandudno,
Playford of Thirsk, Noel Young of Trumpington, Euro World of Glasgow and
Shaws of Beaumaris. Concha y Toro's Don Melchor is another ambitious Chilean
Cabernet.
For a straightforward, well-made, young Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon, the Segu
Olle Caliboro 1992 is good value at about Pounds 4 from Augustus Barnet.
Chile has made rapid progress in white wine-making recently, however. The
1993s, which should be in the UK before Christmas, show real finesse in some
cases (although the Montes Sauvignon 1993 made by Hugh Ryman is one of his
less concentrated efforts). An important ingredient here is fruit from
Casablanca, the new, ultra-cool, coastal region that proved itself so cool
that the 1992 vintage was substantially destroyed by frost.
The most bravura performance is from roving winemaker Ignacio Recabarren.
His 1993 whites, under the confusing Vina Casablanca label, will be fine
value once they have crossed the Atlantic. The white label versions are made
from fruit bought in from the Central Valley, while Casablanca Valley wines
are made exclusively from (young) Casablanca fruit.
The white label Sauvignon Blanc 1993 will be Pounds 4.99 from Oddbins from
late November, and about Pounds 5.99 from Wine Rack at the end of this
month. Recabarren calls it his 'Marlborough style', a reference to his stint
in New Zealand where he learnt to blend the produce of shaded and unshaded
vine rows, adding a dash of over-ripe grapes, to produce a Chilean answer to
Cloudy Bay.
The Casablanca Valley Sauvignon 1993 at Pounds 5.99 from Oddbins from
November, is more austere, more au Sancerre perhaps, and is a worthy
reflection of what Sauvignon can do if yields are restricted, with that
faint suggestion of Riesling in its combination of strong aroma and piercing
acidity.
The 1992 Casablanca Valley Chardonnay is a high tech wine that has been
snapped up by Sainsbury who expect to be selling it exclusively, in their 35
biggest stores, by Christmas for Pounds 7.99. The much more delicate 1993
vintage should be worth waiting for chez Oddbins at Pounds 6.99. Recabarren
is also involved in the Vina Porta label.
Chile is likely to produce better and better Cabernet, Sauvignon and
Chardonnay during the vintages to come, but it is difficult to see how it
will establish a definitively Chilean style of wine along the lines of
California's Zinfandel or Australia's Shiraz. Over the Andes in Argentina,
on the other hand, there is a rich mix of grape varieties reflecting
Spanish, Italian and French influences.
Some of the most exciting South American reds I have tasted this year were
made in Argentina: either the Weinert wines from John Armit of London W11
(071-727 6846) or those of Bodegas Norton.
Berkmann Wine Cellars, of London N7 (071-609-4711) is the importer finding
enormous difficulty in persuading wine merchants to take advantage of
powerful, characterful, juicy Norton reds labelled Sangiovese, Barbera,
Merlot and Malbec. (Except Davisons which has them at Pounds 5 to Pounds 6 a
bottle). Trouble is, the wine trade has decided that Chile is The Thing this
year.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Why Italians enjoy whisky galore - A man who
turned millions on to malt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MIGHT seem bizarre to sell a bottle of malt whisky costing thousands of
pounds in Milan but, believe it or not, Italy and Milan in particular - is
full of whisky maniacs.
Walk through the streets of the nation's commercial capital and you will
stumble across shops boasting collections that make most of Britain's look
insignificant.
One of the best is Donini in the Galleria San Babila (tel: 760-00461, fax
781413) which is run by the Marangione family and tries to stock every malt
released on the market. Nor are the prices excessive: recently, Emanuele
Marangione had to withdraw some 40-year-old Macallan from sale because
Japanese businessmen were buying it and selling their booty for a
considerable profit when they arrived home.
It is perhaps significant that Armando Giovinetti's first job in the drinks
business was with Emanuele's father, Guiseppe.
Giovinetti, who is credited with turning millions of Italians on to malt,
started unpromisingly. In the 1950s, he drifted away from his studies in
Rome and made a living sweeping the floors of an hotel.
His professional life began when he peddled a concoction called Gin Rosa.
Once he had left the Marangiones he graduated to selling small amounts of
whisky, a drink introduced to Italy after the war by GIs, which was seen as
a fashionable alternative to grappa.
With the profits he saved enough to make his first visit to Scotland and its
distilleries in the mid 1950s. He was too small an operator then to take on
a brand, so he looked for a distillery which could offer him a significant
part of its production.
Scotland he remembers as a primitive place then: Inverness airport boasted
little more than a hut selling tea and biscuits. However, he found the
people and the landscape highly attractive.
He found what he was looking for at Glen Grant on Speyside. He liked the
style of the 'Directors' Reserve', which was run off into new barrels and he
along with a young solicitor called Hugh Metcalfe, decided on a modest punt
of 2,000 cases of five-year-old malt. This was three years before the Grants
of Glenfiddich decided to launch their malt whisky.
Giovinetti thought he could turn malt into big business. He played on
whisky's image as a tough-guy's drink beloved of the heroes of Hollywood
films who drank neither wine nor grappa.
Besides, he reasoned, whisky was cleaner than grappa which all too often
showed traces of methyl alcohol under analysis.
While malt whisky's cleanliness was pointed out to the medical profession.
Giovinetti had Glen Grant bottled in miniatures and sent samples to doctors
telling them of its uses as a throat medicine. The doctors duly recommended
it to their patients - marketing that would not be tolerated today.
Sales of Glen Grant soared to the 200,000 case mark by 1980 and today they
are nearer 500,000. Success of this sort attracted the attention of
multi-national companies and, by the end of the 1970s, Seagrams had moved in
to buy Glen Grant at what Giovinetti feels was an inflated price.
At first Giovinetti stayed on with Seagrams as European president, latterly
he was shifted into the position of consultant.
In 1983 he decided to get out and would have retired had it not been for his
son, Fabio Massimo, who was just leaving an American university and wanted
to sell whisky.
At about that time Giovinetti was approached by his old friend Hugh
Metcalfe, then working for The Macallan. The Macallan was a style of whisky
which Giovinetti felt the Italians would take to.
He formed an agency business around The Macallan together with Bollinger
champagne and Janneau Armagnac (which he now owns). Eventually, it was
decided to launch a seven-year-old malt unique to the Italian market.
Giovinetti's nose for the Italian market did not let him down. The 'mellow'
style of the Macallan seven-year-old was perfect as a long drink with ice
for the new whisky drinker.
Macallan now sells 60,000 cases a year despite costing L25,000 (Pounds 11) a
bottle compared to L15,000 for Glen Grant or L10,000 for a top blended
whisky such as J &amp; B.
It is now the eighth best selling whisky on the market, a considerable
achievement in a country which is very discerning when it comes to malt: the
Italians buy 50 per cent more malt whisky than the British.
It is this connoisseurship which makes Italy so speciaI: 'This is the
country where malt whisky is best known,' says Giovinetti, which is
precisely why Macallan-Glenlivet decided to auction its last 12 bottles of
60-year-old malt in Milan.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Smile please, and just say British cheese -
Nicholas Lander introduces two Frenchmen to the joys of Cheddar, Cotherstone
and Spenwood
</HEADLINE>

CHEFS have two sources of job satisfaction in addition to their pay packet.
The first is cooking for a busy restaurant. The second comes from finding
the right raw materials to prepare, cook and serve.
These two pleasures are mutually supportive: without the raw ingredients you
will not attract the discerning customers. Often such pleasures leave time
for little else. Marjan Lesnik, executive chef at Claridge's, London, had
not been home for three nights last week because the hotel was so busy, but
at the weekend he was up early picking wild mushrooms in Epping Forest,
hoping that the rain had brought out the chanterelles.
Until this year, British chefs had seen much of the best produce whisked
from under their noses by wholesalers prepared to pay higher prices for
trailerloads of Scottish salmon, langoustines, Cornish seabass and Somerset
elvers. These were delivered, via Calais, to top French, Spanish and Italian
kitchens.
Today, the market is changing as the recession affects demand from the rest
of Europe. In Spain restaurants have been cutting prices to stimulate
demand. In France, two-star Michelin chef Andre Daguin led a demonstration
of more than 300 chefs, dressed in their whites, in an attempt to bring the
plight of the French restaurant industry to his Government's attention. The
'franc fort' policy has put off tourists, recession is cutting corporate
entertainment and the industry has little tax relief on its major
investment, the training of young chefs. (I took the opportunity of writing
to the head of the Federation National des Hoteliers et Restaurateurs in
Paris suggesting the French equivalent of 'Lunch for a Fiver', the Weekend
FT's scheme for eating out cheaply, only to receive a haughty non).
The same circumstances now prevail in Italy, according to Priscilla
Carluccio who, with her husband Antonio, has just put together an extensive
selection of the best Italian ingredients, available from their shop in Neal
Street, London (tel: 071-240-1487). This is the first time that small
producers of such delicacies as wild chestnut jam, eight-year-old balsamic
vinegar or panforte have welcomed orders from the UK. Perhaps this is
largely because restaurants in Italy are cutting costs and ordering less
expensive produce.
Joel Antunes, the talented chef of Les Saveurs, in Curzon Street, Mayfair,
London, (tel: 071-491-8919) is one French chef who has been extremely
impressed with the quality of British produce since he arrived here two
years ago.
However, because Les Saveurs is French, no-one had bothered to introduce him
to British cheeses.
Happily I was able to help bridge that gap. At a test meal organised by the
host, everyone was happy with the menu and wines but then came the cheese
course. Two mature clarets were being served. Which cheeses, I was asked,
would I suggest?
'British,' I replied, only too well aware that the chef, manager and
sommelier would never consider such an option. I waxed lyrical about mature
Cheddar, Cotherstone, Spenwood and Mendip. I even suggested, a cheese
tasting at Neal's Yard Dairy, Covent Garden (071- 379-7646). Within minutes
they replied: they would be delighted to taste British cheeses, something
they had never done before. We agreed to meet under the awning outside the
theatre in Cambridge Circus where Les Miserables is playing.
At 4pm, in between the lunch and dinner services, I met Joel Antunes,
Emmanuel Manjuzan, the restaurant manager and Yves Saubova, the sommelier.
As soon as they walked into Neal's Yard Dairy their jaws dropped. Truckles
of mature Cheddar; turrets of farmhouse Lancashire, Cheshire and Colston
Bassett Stilton; goats' cheeses in all shapes and sizes; buckets of creme
fraiche and large pats of bright, yellow butter. Just to make them feel at
home, was a shelf of organic jams and mustards from France.
They held out their hands in silence for the cheese tasting, only asking
whether the cheeses were 'sheep, cow or goat.' Twenty cheeses later they had
made their choice for dinner - Keen's Cheddar, Spenwood (a hard sheeps' milk
cheese from Berkshire) and Gubbeen, a soft cows' milk cheese from Cork, in
the Irish Republic) although the cheese they bought for themselves was
Harbourne Blue, a goat's milk cheese from Devon.
As they left, with samples for their staff to taste, I asked if British
cheese would soon be on their French-only trolley. Back came a very French
reply: 'As soon as we have our first Michelin star', which, if cooking is
the criterion, should be early next year.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Good knight out at the castle -
Suzanne Askham meets a baronet who pays the bills with corporate
entertainment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUZANNE ASKHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY DAY, Sir Thomas Ingilby has to find Pounds 300 to fund the running of
his family home, Ripley Castle in North Yorkshire. To do this, the baronet
has turned self-employed businessman.
His main asset is that same expensive castle, to which corporate clients
come for dinners and conferences. A typical group consists of 15 to 35
delegates. Other enterprises complement these VIP Events, as Sir Thomas
calls them. But the core of the business developed more or less
accidentally.
Sir Thomas inherited Ripley in 1974, aged 18. 'My chief regret is that I was
so young,' he says. 'As it was, I learned my mistakes at my own expense.'
His first move was to open the castle daily to the public. Other revenue
came in from tenant farmers (he owns 1,800 acres) and residential
leaseholders. But the real business began in 1981.
'It was the year that Harrogate Conference Centre opened,' he says. 'Several
people who knew of the castle asked if they could hold dinners and other
events here.
'For the first two years my wife and I did everything ourselves. She cooked,
on our own domestic four-ring stove. I laid the table and waited on it, with
the help of four cleaning staff. We used chairs, crockery and glasses from
all over the castle.'
Because the outlay was minimal, Sir Thomas was able to set attractive rates
that drew in, among others, a Channel Four launch dinner.
Initially, Sir Thomas added a small profit margin of 10 per cent over costs.
Turnover in 1982 was Pounds 15,000, and went on to double every year.
During the 1980s, Sir Thomas made the operation systematically more
professional. The first, essential move was to build up an in-house catering
staff. Ripley's total staff has risen from 17 in the early days to 76.
He also reassessed his price structure. Today, in line with industry
practice, he adds a profit margin of 60 per cent over the cost of food,
adding overheads and extras at cost. A typical rate for a party of 20
holding a one-day conference with light lunch and refreshments would be
Pounds 560 including VAT.
His second essential move was to market the castle, mainly on the trade show
circuit. 'I budget Pounds 35,000 a year for this. It's a hit and miss affair
 -you try to talk to everyone who visits your stand, but it's often the
quiet ones who pick up a brochure then run away who later make bookings.'
Sir Thomas tried, and rejected, advertising in the business press. 'I found
it impossible to tell which ads got a result.' By 1989, turnover had reached
Pounds 500,000. The Ingilbys decided the growth justified a major expansion:
opening a hotel. There was a suitable building on the estate, but it
required substantial funds to get it into shape.
'We took detailed projections to six different funding sources, and received
four offers. Our own bank, Barclays, with whom my family has banked for 200
years - longer than they've been Barclays - rejected our proposal.' The
Ingilbys switched their account to NatWest. 'We liked them because they went
into it in depth. We feel they will keep us on our toes.'
The loan is for Pounds 1.2m over 20 years, with endowment policies to cover
the repayment. 'God, we were nervous; we'd never done anything that big
before. But it's working out.' Paradoxically, the biggest business mistake
he has made seemed absolutely safe at the time. 'In 1990 we brought in
management consultants who advised us to appoint middle managers. It was a
disaster.'
The problem was that the Ingilbys became distanced from their clients.
'Suddenly, it was like going into a large anonymous hotel.
'It's taken us three years to undo the mess. One mistake was being too loyal
to managers. But today, out of a middle management of six, we've now got
three: head chef, admin and accounts.
'We lost hotel admin, marketing and personnel managers. These are the
activities my wife and I do - we feel they're the heart of the business.
Broadly, she runs the hotel, while I do the marketing and corporate side.'
In the past year, they have raised turnover by 10 per cent, to a total of
Pounds 450,000 in 1992 - less than the heyday, before the recession and the
management consultants did their work, but better than Sir Thomas expected.
At the same time, by trimming overheads, their profits have risen by 15 per
cent.
'We're concentrating on building up our customer base in America and Norway
 -both are expanding markets,' says Sir Thomas, who is spending an
additional Pounds 25,000 annually on marketing the hotel. 'My priority now
is to reduce the overdraft, and consolidate. In the meantime, we're always
thinking of new schemes to make our package more attractive.'

FT  02 OCT 93 / Minding Your Own Business: In fear of the bank - Keep an eye
on your business account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN HALLIDAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPORT in the Financial Times on August 12 that customers are 'fed up to
the back teeth with banks dipping into their accounts without notice to
extract charges and interest' will have struck a chilling note with many
small businesses. The quotation was from a Which? report into banking
practices. Are some High Street banks getting up to their old tricks again?
When my wife and I started our retail business in 1983, we approached the
bank at which we had our personal accounts and inquired about opening a
business account. The bank could not have been more helpful until we came to
the delicate question of charges. I asked how these were calculated for a
business account.
The bank manager was clearly embarrassed by the question. He explained, at
length, that the banks did not publish tariffs for business accounts; that
the amounts charged depended on too many factors for him to explain to me;
and that if he did explain I would not understand anyway.
Intrigued, I approached the other major banks and asked the same question.
Each time I received the same reply and left no wiser, although with the
feeling that my attempts to uncover the mysteries of bank charges were
regarded as indelicate.
We have come a long way since then. In the mid-1980s the banks, anxious to
increase their small business customers, started to publish information
about tariffs. The movement gathered pace in 1991 following a press
campaign, in which the Financial Times played a prominent part, which drew
attention to the poor treatment meted out to small businesses by some banks.
Our business suffered from a particularly outrageous example of high-handed
behaviour. I was astonished to discover, on examining our quarterly
statement, that our bank charges had tripled since the previous quarter. I
assumed an error had been made and wrote to the bank. The manager explained
that, since our sales had increased (by about 20 per cent), the bank had
decided to triple its charge on each transaction - each cheque written, each
sum paid in etc. Moreover they had done this without even informing us even
though we visited the branch at least once a week to pay money in. I pointed
out that in any other business such behaviour would be regarded as little
short of sharp practice. He replied that it was customary in banking and
would no doubt remain so.
He was wrong, as I discovered when I changed our bank and saved Pounds 1,000
a year in charges. Faced with many similar examples the director-general of
Fair Trading investigated the relationship between banks and small
businesses and the banks decided that they should do something to mend their
ways.
All the major banks publish 'Charters' that set out the terms on which they
will handle small business accounts. These include details of charges for
different types of account. The major banks also give an undertaking not to
change the charges without giving a month's notice, so my experience should
not be repeated, although the Which? survey suggests that vigilance remains
necessary.
Now that the banks publish their tariffs, it is possible to make
comparisons. Midland Bank has an Enterprise Account for small businesses
with a turnover of less then Pounds 100,000. A standing charge of Pounds
2.50 a month is levied on the account and 60p is charged for each cheque
issued, 60p is also charged every time money is paid into the account. These
charges are waived during the first year of trading provided the account
remains in credit.
The Co-op has a different charging structure, with a standing charge of
Pounds 13.50 a quarter but no charge for the first 18 cheques per quarter.
After that, a charge of 69p per Pounds 100 debit turnover is raised. Debit
turnover is the total amount of money paid out of the account. For a small
business with takings of Pounds 100,000 a year, raising 200 cheques a year
and paying into the account twice a week, I estimate that Midland would
charge about Pounds 220 a year and the Co-op about Pounds 640 a year. The
Co-op does pay a little more interest on funds held in the account but the
Midland would still offer a significant saving for such a customer and it is
worth shopping around for such deals.
For a smaller business, raising fewer than 18 cheques a quarter, the Co-op
would be cheaper but for very small enterprises there are building society
accounts aimed at small businesses.
The Nationwide Building Society has introduced a Business Investor Account
that makes no charges at all for the first six cheques raised each month,
charges Pounds 2 per cheque raised once this figure has been passed but
offsets this by paying 4 per cent gross interest on funds held in the
account. For a small business raising 13 cheques a quarter this would be
better value than the Co-op.
In an attempt to differentiate their services some banks are also beginning
to offer 'soft' benefits. Midland runs seminars to which small business
clients are invited to learn about Trading out of the Recession or Improving
Cashflow, to cite two recent seminars that I attended. The were greatly
appreciated by the small business proprietors to whom I spoke afterwards.
As the range of services becomes more varied, and as the banks and building
societies struggle to differentiate their services, it is worth a few
minutes of every small business proprietor's time to review banking
facilities to see where savings can be made. And if your bank behaves as
ours did, and tries to alter your charges without proper consultation, take
it up with the manager and tell him that, if the matter is not resolved
satisfactorily, you will take it as far as the Office of the Banking
Ombudsman at Citadel House, 5-11, Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1BR

THE TABLE shows unit trusts investing primarily in gilts and the fixed
interest securities of large companies. Some of the funds listed do not aim
to provide income. Whittingdale's short-dated gilt fund aims for capital
growth and has no yield.
Murray Acumen Reserve, which is one of Murray Johnstone's funds, was so
small five years ago that it was a cash fund, according to Ian Winship, its
manager. Its performance was helped by the high interest rates prevailing in
1988/89 and from holding long-dated gilts.
Murray Johnstone is one of a handful of fund managers to have cut initial
charges on its unit trusts. The initial charge now stands at 1 per cent
against an industry average of 5 per cent to 6 per cent, with an annual
mangement charge of 0.25 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 500.
Peter Geikie-Cobb, the manager of Mercury Asset Management's Government
Securities fund, attributes some of the fund's strong performance to its
overseas exposure. Unlike a pure gilt fund, it is able to get indexation
against capital gains tax because it has a minimum of 12 per cent in
overseas bond markets (and a maximum of 25 per cent).
Overseas exposure also helped performance, says Geikie-Cobb, when sterling
fell in value after it left the ERM. 'We've had a very good run in the bond
markets but we are taking a more cautious stance now. We are expecting the
market to fall but that will be a good buying opportunity.'

FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Cutting the cost of conveyancing -
Helga Drummond provides a 'good service' checklist for those planning to
move home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HELGA DRUMMOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMES MAY be hard in the property market, but the vast majority of people
still leave conveyancing to the professionals in spite of the cost. Most
believe it is worth the expense of 'getting it all done properly through a
solicitor' in spite of reports of the shoddy service clients sometimes
receive.
Although it pays to shop around for competitive quotes, fees can be a poor
guide to quality. Expensive firms are not necessarily the best and cheap
ones are not necessarily the worst. In the absence of a reliable
recommendation, how should you choose which solicitors' firm to act for you?
Large firms have the advantage of modern technology and a streamlined
service. However, your money rarely buys the attention of a partner and
sometimes not even an assistant solicitor. Large firms, moreover, are
extremely profit-conscious which may be reflected in a hard-nosed attitude
towards clients. Working practices and standards are designed to be cost
effective which means you stand to get the bare minimum.
The smaller high street practices provide a more personal service, but
before instructing one, ask what proportion of their work is conveyancing
and whether there is a conveyancing partner. Be wary of firms which deal
predominantly with crime, matrimonial and personal injury matters. Such
firms often do conveyancing because the money is useful, but, since it forms
such a small proportion of their work, their systems may not be properly
geared for it. The work may be delegated to an unsupervised clerk who is
expected to fit conveyancing round everything else.
This caveat applies particularly to firms deriving a large proportion of
their income from Legal Aid work. Legal Aid work is only profitable if done
in volume, and volume can create administrative burdens sufficient to defeat
small practices. If something goes wrong, the senior partner may not care
that much - after all, it is not as if the firm has a sterling reputation in
conveyancing to lose.
Even if you are promised the attention of a partner or an assistant
solicitor, beware. Solicitors in high street practices spend a lot of their
time in court. Where will yours be when you need him or her?
These caveats are becoming increasingly relevant as conveyancing is no
longer a source of easy money for solicitors. The firm that gave a good
service five years ago may now have different priorities.
The best choice may be the old-fashioned family solicitor. Such firms deal
almost exclusively with domestic conveyancing and probate. Your money
therefore is likely to buy the personal attention of the principal or a
partner. With some firms clients are ideally never seen and seldom heard,
but the old-fashioned solicitor will ask you 'to kindly attend this office'
where he (it is usually a he) will 'take down the particulars'.
The chances of a mistake being made are low. Conveyancing and probate
practitioners are typically schooled in a tradition of meticulous attention
to detail supplemented by decades of experience. The same goes for their
support staff. Further, long-established practitioners have the advantage of
knowing the local property market. They know which parts of town are prone
to subsidence, which properties sell easily and which ones habitually stick.
They may even know the antecedents and boundaries of your proposed purchase.
The 'after sales' service provided by traditional practices is likely to be
superior to that of large firms. Turnover in large firms is high so that if
a query arises later, the person who dealt with the conveyance may have
left, whereas the old fashioned solicitor is likely to still be around.
There are disadvantages in instructing an old fashioned firm. Many
practitioners qualified when deeds were still hand written and solicitors
travelled to each other's offices in order to exchange contracts. The
technology and working practices of some firms continues to reflect a bygone
era. They are the least likely to invest in a fax machine, for example. This
could prove a problem if you need to move swiftly.
Another drawback is that many conveyancing and probate solicitors are sole
practitioners. Some mortgage lenders will not deal with them because of the
risk of fraud. Before instructing a firm, you should visit it and trust the
evidence of your own eyes - if part of the lettering on the nameplate is
missing, then maybe the solicitor has lost interest in the practice, for
example.
Some firms employ a partner to act as a 'front' man or woman. Insist upon
meeting the person you will actually be dealing with. What is their status
in the firm? What are their qualifications and experience? Do they inspire
confidence?
The second purpose of a visit is to negotiate the fee. Although some firms
use rigid scales, others, especially smaller ones, base the quotation partly
upon an assessment of what they think they can wring out of a particular
client.
The minimum commercially viable fee for small practices is about Pounds 250.
That means any quotation above this figure is potentially negotiable. Some
firms quote a range, such as Pounds 800 to Pounds 950. The aim is to entice
the client by pitching the lower of the two figures but with every intention
of charging the larger sum. Turn the tactic against them by saying you will
accept a firm quote of Pounds 800.
Even the larger firms may be open to persuasion. As they well know, the work
involved in the conveyance of a Pounds 150,000 town house is about the same
as that entailed in the conveyance of a Pounds 28,000 'back to back'.
Although Pounds 1,000 in fees is preferable from the firm's standpoint,
Pounds 900 may be preferable to losing the instructions.
Check the level of service on offer and if appropriate negotiate on that
too. All solicitors will say, 'Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any
doubts or queries.' But what does that mean? Is the solicitor prepared to
visit the property if the boundaries are unclear? What if the conveyance
raises a difficult point of planning law or buildings regulations - is that
included in the fee? Is the solicitor willing to organise for simultaneous
exchange and completion if required? What will the charges be the the deal
collapses?
The benefits of negotiation go beyond the financial. Even the most
sophisticated clients are sometimes in awe of the legal profession, a fact
which some solicitors are not above exploiting. Your questions will teach
the solicitor respect, the factor most likely to 'assure you of the best of
attention at all times'.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Does the state have a claim?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1989, I gave my mother the money to buy the council house (under the
Right to Buy provisions) in which she was living. It was necessary to leave
the house in her name, but she made a will leaving the house to me on her
death.
Now, at 87, she is still living in the house and, although in relatively
good health, is becoming increasingly frail. I am concerned about the
situation with regard to the house (value around Pounds 50,000) should she
reach the point where we could not care for her and she requires supervised
state housing.
My mother believes that, should this happen, the house would be sold and the
proceeds appropriated by the state. Is this correct? Would she have no say
regarding how the money was dealt? What would happen if she lived for only a
short time under state care?
Suppose the house was sold, she moved in with us, the money was gifted to me
and the grandchildren, and she subsequently required state housing. Would
there be a claim on the money?
We have researched the law relating to the query raised in your letter, and
we have concluded that, as your mother has occupied the house for more than
three years after exercising her right to buy (and, indeed, buying the
house), there can be no interference with her ownership or with any of the
proceeds realised on sale. We can find no evidence that the Crown has the
power to appropriate anything.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When probate is required
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE recently been appointed executor by an elderly lady with a small
estate. What is the value of an estate below which probate is not required?
In nearly all circumstances, a grant of probate is required so that it can
be produced by the executor to prove his title to the assets of the estate.
In very limited circumstances, small sums of money owned by the deceased may
be paid or transferred on death to those persons entitled to them without
the need to produce a grant of probate.
The ability to do this depends on the amount owned by the deceased and the
source of the money. The upper limit on these payments is Pounds 5,000. If
the sum owned by the deceased is in excess of Pounds 5,000, grant is needed
for the whole amount. The payment can only be made in respect of:
1. Money held in the National Savings bank, Savings Certificate or Premium
Bonds.
2. Money payable on the death of a member of a trade union.
3. Money invested in a building society.
4. Arrears of salary and pensions payable to certain Crown employees.
In all these cases, the release of the monies by the Director of Savings,
the building society manager etc is within that person's discretion. The
executor cannot enforce them to hand over the money if, for some reason,
they require to see a grant.
It is clear, therefore, that it is not the overall value of the estate which
determines whether or not probate is needed, but whether monies owned by the
deceased are within the circumstances described above.
You will need to decide if the estate of the deceased comes within the above
terms. The Probate Registry will also be able to offer advice should you
need it.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Trustees and the law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A COUSIN and her husband were joint trustees of a small family trust. Her
husband died several years ago, leaving her as sole trustee. Although I have
suggested that she should appoint another trustee, she does not appear to
see any need to do so.
Is there any legal requirement that a trust should have more than one
trustee, and can you indicate the likely cost involved in making a further
appointment?
As a general rule, the number of trustees is unlimited by law, one being
sufficient and any greater number permissible. There is an exception,
however, where land forms part of the settled property, in which case the
minimum for giving a good receipt for purchase monies is two trustees who
are individuals.
While it is sufficient for there to be a sole trustee, this might be
unsatisfactory from the point of view of the beneficiaries of the trust
because of the opportunities for maladministration and fraud which then
arise.
The trust deed should be read to see if it provides for the minimum number
of trustees. Additional trustees may be appointed under an express power in
the trust deed, or by the exercise of a statutory power contained in section
36 Trustee Act 1925.
Section 36 confers on a surviving trustee the power to appoint new trustees.
The section also provides that the appointment be in writing, which usually
means the drawing up of a deed. You will need to ask a solicitor how much he
would charge for this and any other document which is required on the
appointment of a new trustee (eg, a vesting declaration).

FT  02 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: 'Spendthrift' solicitors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY MOTHER left me some property: two old cottages and a piece of land. The
solicitors have now whittled away the little money she had, engaging
surveyors etc to plot the properties on maps. The solicitors now say the
surveyors must be brought in to give an estimate of the properties for
inheritance tax and capital gains tax. This is going to cost Pounds
300-Pounds 400. Is this really necessary in law? Can I demand the cash that
is left before they think of some way to spend it?
It is not absolutely necessary for a professional valuation to be obtained
in respect of the property but it is often helpful. The property is likely
to be valued by the District Valuer of the Inland Revenue and you might be
happy with the valuation obtained.
But if you are able to provide a value, supported by a third-party surveyor,
then this could help your case. It is a case of weighing up the likely cost
of the valuation against the potential benefit to be obtained.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Life charges: just what do you pay?
 -Investors have faced daunting barriers to discovering the truth, says Eric
Short. But relief is at hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE charging structure of life companies, which has been notoriously opaque,
will soon become much clearer.
At present, the charges can be understood only with the help of an actuary.
But investors would like to know the answers to two questions: which are the
high and low charging life companies, and how much of an investment in a
life or pensions contract from any life company is taken out in fees?
Obviously, a life company must impose charges to meet the costs of issuing
and of servicing a contract. But are those charges reasonable?
The fee structure on a unit-linked life contract is extremely complex, with
five or six types of charge being the norm. The bid/offer spread, annual
management charge, capital/accumulation units and policy fee are the main
ones.
Faced with such a complex array of fees, most investors will have great
difficulty in discovering how much of their investment is eaten up by
charges. The problem is even more complex for with-profit contracts.
The only way in which the effect of charges can be shown to laymen in a way
they will understand is to show what the benefits would have been had no
charges been imposed for a given investment, followed by what the benefits
would be after deducting the company's charges.
But Sib and Lautro, the regulatory bodies, have always insisted that
illustrations showing the benefits of a policy on different assumptions of
growth rates should also assume a standard charge that applies to all
policies and not just the one. They claim that the standard basis
illustrations will not be misused by intermediaries selling contracts to
clients.
The Office of Fair Trading, however, has always insisted that using standard
charges is anti-competitive in that it denies investors the information they
need to answer the two basic questions posed above. Now, chancellor Kenneth
Clarke has accepted the OFT's argument and, next year, illustrations will be
based on the charges actually levied on each policy.
Nevertheless, information on illustrations based on actual charges has been
available to investors if they had known where to look for it. Money
Management, an FT monthly publication, has been allowed by Lautro to seek
such illustrations from life companies and to publish the results in its
periodic surveys of personal pensions.
The latest survey, published in the October issue*, includes a comparative
table of benefits assuming actual charges, no charges and the standard
charge. It provides enough information for investors to answer the two basic
questions above.
Since the aim was to identify the high and low charge life companies, and to
discover what those charges cost the investor, the table excludes specialist
companies which take business only from fee-based intermediaries.
These companies have the lowest charges and, thus, the highest
illustrations. But, to make a complete comparison, the investor needs to
allow for impact of the fees paid to his adviser in determining the overall
effect on his investment.
The table can guide the investor in his selection of a life company. The
wide range in the value of benefits between the lowest and the highest
charging companies shows the importance of making the right choice of life
company. Investors need to look at a company's charging record, as well as
that of its investments.
The charging structure used by a company has different effects for different
terms. The table shows that four of the five lowest charging companies over
10 years are not in the top five for 25 years, although an examination of
the complete table in Money Management shows they are still very
competitive.
So, the choice of life company on the lowest charge basis depends on the
term of the contract. An investor already holding a personal pension
contract, and who intends to take out another contract, needs to check if
that life company is still competitive on its charges for the new (lower)
term.
The highest charging life companies tend to market through their own sales
force or through tied agents. As such, the salesmen are under no obligation
to reveal this fact to clients. Investors have to check this themselves.
Independent financial advisers should be taking charges into consideration
when recommending a life company, but investors should check that this is
indeed the case.
At 10 years, charges can reduce the benefits by between 9 per cent (the
lowest charge) and 23.4 per cent (the highest charge), with an average
reduction of 14.5 per cent. At 25 years, the range is between 8 per cent and
32.7 per cent, with an average of 22.1 per cent.
Once this information is available widely, life companies are likely to come
under pressure to reduce their charges. The present Lautro illustrations
produce figures that exceed the vast majority, if not all, of the own-charge
illustrations, showing that the standard charges used are far too low
compared with present charging levels.
Under the present Sib/Lautro rules, a life company is not allowed to
reproduce the tables in Money Management in any of its literature or
promotional material. It can merely point out that the survey has been
published.
Since newspapers can reproduce the table, the ruling seems irrational. But
since it exists, it is up to investors to see for themselves.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Better news at last from the Wharf -
Matrix's EZT scheme claims it can offer a fast return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNSECURED creditors of Canary Wharf, the London Docklands office scheme
which went into administration last year, voted this week in favour of a
re-structuring package and the project might soon be able to resume trading.
The news has cheered Matrix Securities, which recently launched an
enterprise zone trust (EZT) near Canary Wharf on the Isle of Dogs.
Matrix South Quay has a novel structure which aims to give investors a fast
return on their money through the use of a loan facility, and it has an
arranged exit facility after 10 years.
Investors in EZTs are entitled to tax relief at their top marginal rate of
tax but, unlike the business enterprise scheme, there is no limit on
investments in enterprise zone property. Tax relief is available on loans
taken out to fund the property if the interest is paid using rental income.
Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, is providing loans to investors equating to
67.5 per cent of the amount invested. This means that, for a total
investment of Pounds 100,000, the amount of cash the investor would have to
produce would only be Pounds 32,500.
The investor then receives tax relief on the building costs of Pounds 95m
for the total investment; according to Matrix, this would be 98 per cent.
So, when the higher-rate taxpayer receives his rebate on a total investment
of Pounds 100,000, this should amount to tax relief at 40 per cent on Pounds
98,000 - or Pounds 39,200.
For an outlay of Pounds 32,500, the investor is making a profit of Pounds
6,700, which amounts to a return of 20 per cent. But James Higgins of
Chamberlain de Broe, a fee-based adviser, warns investors that they will get
the tax relief only if 'they do have the higher rate income to shelter and
if they are up to date with their affairs.'
He adds: 'The longer it takes to get the relief, the less the immediate
profit.'
The Hill Samuel loan lasts for 10 years, when the trust implements exit
arrangements. So, in theory, the investor has a loan outstanding for a long
time. But Hill Samuel guarantees sufficient rent to meet the interest
payments and to give the investor enough cash to repay the loan.
Hill Samuel is a creditor to South Quay Ltd, which is in administrative
receivership and owns the property, but Matrix denies that it chose the bank
for this reason. 'We were in discussion with a number of banks to provide
this structured finance and Hill Samuel were offered the mandate,' says
Matrix's Peter Bridgman.
'It was not until some time into our negotiations that we learned that Hill
Samuel was one of the lender banks.'
What if Hill Samuel was to go under and be unable to meet its obligations?
There is provision so that, if this were to happen, the receiver would be
obliged to treat the loan and interest as having been written off.
'It is not a non-recourse loan, so I do not imagine the that the last
Budget's rules will catch it,' says Higgins. 'Hill Samuel already owns a big
chunk of the property, so the loan of 67.5 per cent is really a discount.
The scheme is complicated, so investors should seek professional advice
before commiting themselves. But Higgins endorses it on the basis of the
guarantees given by Hill Samuel. The minimum investment in the Matrix EZT is
Pounds 25,000.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Please don't tell anyone . . . - . .
. but your life might be insured without your knowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIEN REECE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNTIMELY death of a soccer star could affect your business interests
severely if the sales of your football boot company relied heavily on his
endorsement. And if your brand of fizzy drink would not excite the taste
buds without the backing of a famous pop star, you could also lose out if
they were to die.
Similarly, an accountant or solicitor relying on one person to generate a
large proportion of fee income would be wise to seek protection should that
individual fall under a bus. But all these cases could benefit from a
relatively obscure form of protection known as confidential life assurance.
This allows a company - or, in some cases, an individual - to insure the
life of someone else without that person being aware that his or her demise
would compensate for lost business. But it is usually in the interests of
the policyholder to keep such cover secret because the individual insured is
normally under some form of contract.
Because such cover is open to abuse, it is underwritten by only a handful of
select individuals who form a little-known corner of the Lloyd's of London
insurance market. Yet, despite seeming to be something of a financial
backwater, the business of confidential life assurance is extremely
profitable and growing rapidly.
The most active provider is Lloyd's syndicate 429, otherwise known as Alder
Life. The 180 members, or Names, who made up the syndicate in the 1990
accounting year were told this year they had made profits of 22.3 per cent
on their capital.
The year before produced a similar rate of return - figures for which many
beleaguered Lloyd's Names yearn. No wonder that, since 1987, the total of
Names in the syndicate has increased from 78 to the present 319.
This performance is not entirely from confidential life assurance; the
syndicate is also an important provider of more straightforward individual
and group term assurance cover (such as key man assurance). But Kim Rowley,
the syndicate's chief underwriter, is convinced that confidential life makes
sound business sense for his members. 'It has been profitable to date, but
the maximum it represents is 10 per cent of our business,' he says.
Insuring the life of others once was common but it resulted in so many
murders by beneficiaries that it was outlawed in 1774. The Insurance Act,
commonly known as the Gambling Act, introduced the requirement that a life
assurance contract could be effected only if an insurable (financial)
interest could be proven.
The first cases of confidential life cover arose in the US where parties in
long court cases insured the life of judges so that, if they died, the costs
of any new trial could be met through insurance.
Confidential cover differs from conventional life assurance in several
important ways. Because of its nature, it cannot be based on any medical
data to help assess risk. Thus, syndicate 429 says, premiums are at least
three times more expensive than conventional premiums for people up to age
50. Over this, they can increase steeply because of increased mortality
risks.
Confidential contracts can be taken out for only a year at a time and must
then be renewed. This is one way the underwriter can protect his syndicate
from heavy losses. 'The nature of the business, running one year at a time,
means we do have a degree of protection if we feel the claims are coming in
too fast,' says Rowley.
Employers thinking about insuring individual staff on a confidential basis
can think again. This is one commercial relationship which will always be
refused by syndicates such as 429 because of the high risk of abuse, since
they will not have access to the employee's medical records.
In any case, companies can get much cheaper cover for employees through
conventional contracts which require medical underwriting.
Where the two parties in a confidential contract are unrelated - say, a
solicitor and his client - the underwriters believe the risk of having a
claim made against them is much less.
A solicitor wanting to insure the life of a client responsible for a large
proportion of fee income would first need to prove that he would suffer a
financial loss should the individual die and that he was not simply gambling
on that particular life. In addition, he would have to prove a justifiable
interest; this stops requests for over-inflated sums assured.
Thus, if the individual accounted for Pounds 50,000 of fee income, the
solicitor could not insure that life for Pounds 10m; a more realistic figure
of Pounds 100,000 would be justifiable to the underwriter.
In divorce cases, the divorce settlement will be examined closely to
establish if confidential cover is justified to protect one spouse's income,
normally the wife's, should alimony cease on the death of the ex-husband.
The secret of success for syndicates such as 429 is strict underwriting.
There has to be an insurable interest and financial justification for the
cover to be written. 'These two parameters have to be absolutely watertight.
There can be no deviation. There is no room for manoeuvre,' says Rowley.
But although he believes confidential life cover will continue to prove good
business, he - and others - will continue to err on the side of caution. 'We
throw out considerably more applications than we write,' he stresses.

DURING A fairly quiet week directors' selling out-weighed buying by some
considerable margin. Following the announcement of interim results by many
companies, a fair amount of the selling activity actually concerns options.
PizzaExpress has only spent about six months in its new guise as a fast food
operator for franchises and its own restaurants. The share price has
performed spectacularly since then but the sale by David Page of 380,000
shares was made to satisfy his outstanding obligations following the
acquisition of G &amp; F Holdings, in which he was a major shareholder. He still
retains over 2 per cent in the company.
The food retailing sector has been in the press recently as the giants line
up against warehouse discounters. Directors are ready to put their money
where it counts and have been buying. William Morrison Supermarkets recently
announced interim results that were flat, however four members of the board,
including the chairman and chief executive, have bought a considerable
quantity of stock. At Tesco, three directors bought shares in the company
though the value of the investment was relatively small.
ISA International manufactures ribbons, disks and fax paper for information
processing equipment. The company announced interim results in September
which showed pre-tax profits up 48 per cent on the same period last year.
Three members of the board, including the non-executive chairman and the
finance director, sold stock; in the case of the third director,
non-executive Bernd Triebel, this left him with a holding of nil.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: VAT blow for charities and schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARITIES and schools face having to pay value-aded tax on non-business
electricity and gas bills for the first time next year, when the tax is
imposed on fuel for domestic use.
They could, however, benefit from a tax loophole which will also be of use
to individuals. Residential homes for the elderly could also make
substantial savings.
Anyone with enough cash reserves can avoid the new tax simply by paying for
several years' worth of fuel before the end of March next year. VAT is
charged at the rate that applies at the date of invoice or payment,
whichever is earlier.
So, payments accepted before April 1 1994, when VAT is imposed on domestic
fuel at 8 per cent, will be zero-rated and payments made before April 1
1995, when the rate is increased to 17.5 per cent, will be subject to VAT at
8 per cent.
Chantrey Vellacott, the London-based accountancy firm, has calculated that a
charity with annual fuel bills of Pounds 5,000 could make a net saving of
Pounds 670 by paying two years' worth of bills in advance.
This comes from a saving of Pounds 1,275 on VAT, less Pounds 605 in interest
which would have been earned if the money had been kept on deposit at 5 per
cent.
Individuals could save smaller amounts, depending on their fuel consumption.
Independent boarding schools and grant-maintained schools, if they have
charity status, will be able to exploit the method, but independent day
schools will not. This anomaly is because of the distinction between
business and non-business activities.
Teaching at grant- maintained schools is seen as a charitable function, so
fuel used is zero-rated. Teaching at independent schools, even if they are
charities, is defined as a business activity because pupils have to pay for
it, so fuel is standard-rated. But fuel used to heat residential
accommodation at boarding schools is zero rated at present.
This means that grant-maintained schools should be able to avoid VAT by
pre-paying their entire fuel bills, while boarding schools could pre-pay the
portion of their bills relating to residential accommodation.
According to Jeremy Bird, secretary of the Independent Schools Bursars
Association, most schools are aware of the advance payment option.
'Schools will be thinking about it but, of course, to pay in advance you
have to have the money. It is a cost-benefit exercise,' he says.
In the same way, charities already pay VAT on fuel used for business
activities (eg, shops) but non-business activities are zero-rated, so tax
savings could be made by paying those bills in advance.
Anyone planning to take advantage of this loophole needs to make sure their
gas or electricity supplier is willing to accept advance payments rather
than simply treating them as mistaken overpayments.
Most electricity boards have said they are willing to co-operate in the tax
avoidance exercise, but will not be publicising it or offering discounts for
early payment. Payments should be accompanied by a letter to them explaining
the purpose.
One consideration for individuals hoping to avoid VAT in this way is how
long they expect to stay in their present home.
It is unlikely to be possible to transfer pre-payments between electricity
and gas suppliers while maintaining the tax benefit. But charities, schools,
and nursing homes, being less mobile, should not have this problem.
Another group which might be able to benefit is residents of blocks of flats
where heating is supplied centrally. It might be, however, that some blocks
have been paying VAT wrongly on this fuel since 1990 when the tax was
imposed on fuel for business use. This has yet to be clarified, though.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Planning for a better life in
retirement - How to get tax advantages from annuities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER QUINTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL TOO often, people approaching retirement overlook the importance of tax
planning as a way to boost the pension they will receive from their annuity.
Annuities provide a regular income, either for life (through the use of a
pension or life annuity) or for a specified period (temporary annuity) in
exchange for a lump sum payment to an insurance company.
There are considerable tax advantages to be gained for those who have
retired with a compulsory purchase annuity - one bought with the proceeds of
a pension fund which will, generally, pay out a percentage of the total fund
as tax-free cash. Those wishing to maximise their income on retirement will
usually find it more profitable to draw their tax-free cash and put it in a
life annuity.
Since the Inland Revenue applies different tax laws to the two annuity
groups, people who have retired can make use of these to supplement their
income, which is particularly important while annuity rates are at their
present low.
All income from compulsory purchase annuities is taxed in full as earned
income, which could mean a 40 per cent charge if the annuitant's income is
high enough. By contrast, life annuity payments are split into interest,
which is taxed, and return of capital, which is not. It follows that the net
income from a life annuity will be considerably higher than from a
compulsory purchase annuity.
For those annuitants who are married and paying tax at 40 per cent, the
financial anomalies between the two types of annuity offer another means of
maximising value. Retired people can pass their tax-free cash to their
spouse (providing the spouse is in the lower tax bracket) who can, in turn,
use it to buy a life annuity.
The transfer of tax-free cash is exempt from income tax, as is the gift made
to the spouse. Where the spouse is the sole buyer of the annuity, the
interest element is taxed in line with the income tax rate of the spouse as
long as he/she is alive, even though the annuity provides joint-life
benefits. Where the spouse dies first, the tax rate reverts to that of the
survivor.
The interest portion of the annuity would be taxed at their tax rate, or
even less, only if the spouse had not used up his/her allowances. So, in
addition to the savings on the tax-free capital portion, another 15 per cent
tax could be saved on the rest.
If a couple wished to purchase only a single life annuity, and the main
annuity purchaser is the husband, this arrangement would work best when they
are of similar age.
If he is much older, the standard reduction in annuity rates for a female
compared with a male of the same age (because of a woman's greater life
expectancy) would be exacerbated because of her relative youth. So, in these
circumstances, the husband could be better off keeping his tax-free cash.
This could change with the development of unisex rates.
Conversely, a married couple with the wife as the main annuity purchaser on
a single life basis would probably stand to gain if the wife transferred her
tax-free cash to the husband, allowing him to buy a life annuity.
If he was roughly the same age, or older, he would definitely get far better
annuity rates and would also enjoy the tax advantages, especially if his
wife was in the 40 per cent bracket and he was not.
It is clear that the scope for tax planning opportunities can transform even
further the value achieved from the best annuity available, even when
retirees have been shopping around on the 'open market.'
When the investor cashes in his pension contract, he can take the
accumulated fund value and buy his annuity from any life company he wishes.
He does not have to buy it from the life company with which he originally
took out the personal pension.
Take a 60-year-old man with a company pension fund of Pounds 100,000. He
could get a net annual income of Pounds 4,883.40 by using the whole fund to
buy an annuity with Equitable Life (at present, one of the top-paying life
offices for these specific benefits).
This assumes payment to be monthly in advance without a guarantee period and
with a spouse's benefit of 100 per cent for a spouse aged 50. It also
assumes that the annuitant is in the 40 per cent tax band and is using his
allowances elsewhere. But, by withdrawing the maximum tax-free cash (in this
case, Pounds 25,000), and buying a life annuity with the same company, the
net income would increase by Pounds 211.37 every year to Pounds 5,094.77.
If he had also used the open market option for a life annuity as well as for
the compulsory purchase annuity, he would have enhanced his income even
further: by purchasing the life annuity with MGM Assurance, his net annual
income would have increased to Pounds 5,110.25 using a 75/25 per cent split
between the compulsory and life annuity portion of the fund.
The total net after-tax income would be increased by Pounds 226.85 a year.
The present life expectancy of a female aged 50 is 29 years, so the extra
income gained over this period would be Pounds 6,578.65.
This again shows clearly that the top company for one annuity is not
necessarily the top for another, and underlines the need for independent
advice on the best rates available.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: You pays your money and takes your
choice - The Speculator / The esoteric world of equity options where gambles
are the order of the day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITY options are a way of speculating on share price movements without
putting up large amounts of money. You invest only as much money as you can
afford to lose, but your gamble can pay off with substantial gains.
Options are written (issued) by market-makers or other investors, who demand
a premium for giving you the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell a
package of shares at a certain price (the 'exercise' or 'strike' price)
within a fixed period. The right to buy is known as a call option, and the
right to sell is a put option.
Options on the shares of about 70 large companies, mostly in the FT-SE 100,
are traded on the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange
(Liffe, pronounced 'life'). Business is still carried out in the traditional
style, where traders gesticulate to each other in a crowded trading pit.
Private investors can access the market through stockbrokers.
By buying an option, you are gambling on whether you think a share's price
will rise or fall. The goal for investors is to end up with a call option
which has an exercise price lower than the share's actual price, or a put
option with a higher exercise price.
Options are available for various expiry dates and exercise prices, so you
need to judge how far and fast a share will move. Some people base decisions
on their opinion of a company's fundamentals, while others rely on technical
analysis of charts.
Expiry dates are fixed at three-monthly intervals, with a maximum life of
nine months. So, at any time, there will be three option expiry dates
available for each share and, for each date, there will be a range of
possible exercise prices, usually at 10p or 20p intervals.
The premium you pay for an option is determined by two factors. One is
whether the option already has some intrinsic value - that is, a call
option's exercise price is lower than the share price, or a put option's
exercise price is higher.
This is combined with the 'time value,' calculated from how long the option
has left before it expires and how volatile the share price has been. The
higher the strike price of a call option relative to the share price, and
the closer the expiry date, the cheaper it will be - but the more likely you
are to lose your money.
The jargon can sometimes be confusing for investors. When an option has some
intrinsic value it is said to be 'in the money.' If the exercise price of a
call/put option is higher/lower than the share price, it is 'out the money.'
And if it is roughly the same as the share price, it is 'at the money.'
Options are popular speculative instruments because of their gearing
potential: a small rise in the underlying share price can translate into a
much larger rise in the option price. The cash price of the option is much
lower than that of the share but, once an option's strike price has been
reached, its price goes up by the same amount in cash terms as the
underlying equity (less the dwindling time value). The proportionate return
on your investment is thus far greater (see the table).
Put options work in a mirror image fashion except that, rather than
increasing the size of your profit compared with buying shares, they
translate small losses into larger gains.
Although the potential loss is limited to the price of the option, the risk
of losing all the money invested in options is much higher than when buying
actual shares. This is partly because you are gambling on the size and
timing of movements in one direction, but also because options have a
limited life.
If your option does not make it 'into the money' by the expiry date, it will
expire worthless. You cannot hold on to an option for years, hoping it will
eventually regain its value.
More than 90 per cent of options are never exercised; they either expire
worthless or, if they increase in value, are sold back into the market. One
advantage in doing this is that you do not have to find large sums of money
actually to buy the shares; pay more commission; or be prepared to hold the
share long term. Additionally, you can profit from any time value still
attached to the option, as well as from the share price movement.
Dabbling in options is not for beginners or those with only small amounts of
money to spare. 'The money should be money that you are prepared to lose,'
emphasises Graeme Hatch, an options broker at Killik &amp; Co. He says options
should form a maximum of 10 per cent of an investor's portfolio.
Contracts are usually for 1,000 shares (although Liffe can adjust this to
take account of rights issues etc), so one contract could cost as little as
Pounds 20. Every time you buy and sell, however, you will have to pay
commission (minimum Pounds 30 at Killik), so each trade has to be reasonably
large to be worthwhile - at least Pounds 500-Pounds 1,000, Hatch recommends.
There is also a bid-offer spread on option prices just as there is on the
underlying equities.
Information on a limited range of option prices can be found daily in the
Financial Times and also on Ceefax. Brokers should have access to a full
range of up-to-date prices.
Liffe produces a free information pack on equity and index options,
including a list of brokers dealing in options and details of explanatory
seminars. For a copy, call 071-379 2486.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Rates continue to nose down -
Annuities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows compulsory purchase annuity rates for those with Pounds
100,000 to invest. The top three rates are shown for various ages. RNPFN
annuities are only for those in nursing and allied professions.
Peter Quinton, of the Annuity Bureau, says: 'Annuity rates have fallen
recently to their lowest level in two decades. Britannia Life, Canada Life,
Generali, Laurentian Life, Norwich Union, Providence Capitol, Royal Life and
RNPFN have all reduced their rates since September 10 1993. London Life is
the only company in the past two weeks to have raised its rates.'
Billy Burrows, of the London-based Annuity Direct, adds: 'Predictably,
annuity rates are still declining in line with falling yields on medium and
long gilts, and there is no sign that these yields will increase in the
short term. In today's climate of low interest rates, pensioners need to
spend more time planning their pension to avoid being locked into a low
pension for life.
'With-profits, phased retirement and Equitable Life's new managed annuity
provide good alternatives to conventional annuities. This is because the
annuitant is not locked into a low-yielding annuity but will receive a
pension with the potential to increase in line with the investment growth of
the underlying pension fund. Index-linked annuities will also give good
value for money if future inflation tops 5 per cent for any length of time.'

FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Mail delays hit investors outside UK
 -Expatriates miss out on share offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPATRIATE shareholders may be missing out on UK companies' share offers and
rights issues because of their inefficient mailing systems and other postal
problems.
George Kluge, an FT reader living in the Bahamas, has missed several share
offers plus enhanced scrip dividend and rights issue deadlines because
postal delays have eaten into the limited time available to take up the
offers.
Post between Europe and the Bahamas takes up to a week in normal
circumstances. The usual time allowed to respond to rights issues is three
weeks, so any delay can wreck an investor's chances of taking part. Post to
other parts of the world can take even longer.
'Our recent experience has been that UK companies farm out the posting and
could not care less about their overseas members,' says Kluge.
One UK company recently failed to frank or stamp an envelope containing
offer documents which was posted to the Bahamas. It was delivered weeks
after the offer closed, and Kluge was forced to pay the postage.
Sidlaw, the company involved, said that the company's offer documents
normally were posted in pre-paid envelopes by the printers, but could not
say what had gone wrong. It is now investigating the problem.
RTZ also had some difficulties with a shareholder mailing earlier this year
but, in this case, the Royal Mail accepted responsibility.
In some cases, even if the item is delivered promptly, expatriate investors
miss their chance to take up offers such as the BT3 share offer, which
allowed only nine days for applications to be sent out and returned.
Stuart Valentine, director of research at Proshare, the organisation which
promotes shareholding by private investors, says he does receive occasional
complaints about the length of time shareholders are given to respond to
rights issues and other share offers.
These complaints come not only from overseas shareholders but also from UK
residents worried about missing opportunities while away on holiday.
Extending the offer period, however, can expose companies and their
underwriters to increased risk of market movements in the intervening
period, which could affect the success of the issue. 'I think three weeks is
a reasonable balance between the companies' needs and those of the
shareholders,' Valentine says.
Having a nominee shareholder who will receive mailings on your behalf might
slow the process even further, as documents then have to be forwarded.
Valentine says the only answer could be to give someone in the UK discretion
to act for you although he accepts this has obvious drawbacks: you have to
rely on another person's investment judgment, and you might not want to
surrender control of potentially large sums of money to someone you do not
know well.
There is little action investors can take if they feel they have lost out
financially by receiving offer documents late - neither the company nor the
post office is liable to pay compensation, and it can be difficult to
determine whose fault - if anyone's - the delay might be.
If, however, enough shareholders let companies know about faults in the
system, efficiency might improve.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: The Perpetual search for long-term
growth - Unit Trusts / Scheherazade Daneshkhu meets professional investors
who feel it helps to make money if you live outside London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

FAR AWAY from City bustle, Stephen Whittaker runs Perpetual's UK growth fund
from an 18th century house in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. Perpetual has
had its offices in this building ever since the 1970s, when its founder,
Martyn Arbib, launched the first fund.
Whittaker finds distinct advantages in being distant from London. On Monday,
for example, news of the restructuring of Grand Metropolitan, the food,
drinks and retailing group, came over at just after 1.45pm. 'Instead of
being in a City wine bar, I was here and was able to add to my holdings
quickly,' said Whittaker. Grand Met's share price rose 10p by the day's
close.
Such short-termism however, does not characterise the fund which is run to
produce good long-term performance. It is is fifth in the UK growth sector
in the five and three years to September 1 according to Micropal but 24th in
the year to September 1.
Whittaker says he does not aim to be at the top because that is usually the
result of a risky or focused strategy which carries the danger of sliding
down the performance tables the next year. Instead he aims to be constantly
in the first or second quartile (the top 25 or 50 per cent). He argues that
the performance will come through in the longer run as other, less
consistent, funds drop out.
Whittaker runs the fund with the aid of Neil Woodford, who looks at the
income side, and John Sweet, who is a small companies specialist.
The fund is large and diversified and contains more than 100 stocks. The
largest holding is in British Telecom with 4 per cent: 'It is one of the
cheapest utilities around,' says Whittaker. Standard Chartered is the next
largest with over 2 per cent. 'I bought it for recovery and am now holding
on to it for growth. It has gone from Pounds 2 to Pounds 9 in those years.'
Perpetual, which had an established reputation for its international funds,
launched a UK growth fund in June 1987. Margaret Thatcher had just been
re-elected and, like many others, Perpetual thought that her victory would
underpin an already strong market. The Pounds 30m which the fund pulled in
within the first three days of its launch reflected general optimism.
Whittaker was recruited from Save &amp; Prosper in August that year to run the
fund which was languishing at the bottom of the performance tables. Within
two months, the stock market crashed and the unit price of the fund fell to
32p from 50p at the time of the launch. 'It was a baptism of fire,' says
Whittaker. 'We had to work hard to stem the flow of money out and having had
ideas about how to run the fund when I joined, I had to kick these out of
the window and develop a new strategy.'
Instead of focusing on aggressive acquisition-driven stock, Whittaker
decided, particularly after Nigel Lawson's deflationary 1988 Budget to move
to the sanctuary of large companies instead of a diversified portfolio split
between companies of all sizes. 'Although 1989 was a difficult year, if we
had maintained out weighting in in recovery and smaller company stocks, we
would have been much worse off,' says Whittaker.
By 1991 when the recession was well underway and small companies were
performing badly, Whittaker tried to predict what might happen in 1992. 'I
thought the next move in interest rates and inflation would be downwards and
that we should be thinking about a higher weighting in smaller companies and
recovery stocks. This became the strategy by the end of 1991 and into 1992.'
However, the government's decision to remain in the Exchange Rate Mechanism,
even if this meant raising interest rates, appeared to prove him wrong.
Whittaker says summer last year was difficult for his fund's recovery-based
strategy.
'Raising interest rates instead of cutting threatened to cause a depression.
I thought there would be rioting in the streets if this was to happen. In
the end the currency markets and George Soros did us an enormous favour by
pushing the government into a decision it had not wanted to make,' says
Whittaker. Soros, a New York hedge fund manager sold sterling and arguably
precipitated the UK's exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism last September.
Today over half the fund is invested in small- to medium-size companies and
Whittaker is gradually selling stocks and buying new ones because he expects
a shift in the economic cycle next year. He believes the return of inflation
is possible next year, arguing that the government is likely to be pressed
to deal with unemployment and may not be able to continue cutting spending.
If inflation returns, companies which are highly-rated now because of
expectations of growth next year, could turn out to be a disappointment,
particularly in a fragile market. Whittaker is therefore switching from what
he has identified as vulnerable areas - property, construction, engineering
and other capital goods areas - into those he believes are undervalued -
food retailing and brewing. He likes the financial sector and is overweight
in banks and insurance. Recent purchases have been in food retailers Argyll
and Tesco, and in leisure stocks such as Thorn EMI, Rank Organisation, Forte
and Granada.
'The difficulty is that I tend to be early so I have an uncomfortable
period. The difference between having an idea and being right is timing, so
when I have an idea I move carefully and slowly by putting in a little bit
of money and waiting and then putting in a bit more.'
Whittaker says that whenever he has reacted 'like a raging bull', he has
invariably been wrong. After Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president, invaded
Kuwait in August 1990, he worried that the portfolio did not contain any oil
stocks and bought into the market.
Within a few weeks, he realised that he had been mistaken and sold the stock
at a loss. 'You have to be prepared to do that and, by the same token, you
should nto become too wedded to any stock,' says Whittaker.
He is usually cautious. 'I move slowly and carefully. The key to the very
high ranking of the fund over the longer term is this inherent
conservatism.'
Charges. The initial charge is 5.25 per cent and the annual charge is 1.25
per cent. The bid-offer spread is about 6.5 per cent.
Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 or Pounds 500 through a Pep. There is a
savings scheme of Pounds 20 a month minimum. Peps must be taken out so via
the company's self-select Pep. The plan charge is 5 per cent plus VAT but
the 5.25 per cent initial charge on the fund is then discounted.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Let's hear it for Sir Sid -
Proposals for a new way to invest at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE bandwagon of corporate capital for the Lloyd's of London insurance
market has begun to roll. Those brave enough to wade into controversial
waters may soon have an innovative new way to invest. Tentative proposals
have been announced for at least 16 corporate capital vehicles (CCVs). More
detailed information is now beginning to circulate, and indicates a number
of significant differences between the products on offer.
Traditionally, investment in Lloyd's has come from the individual Names
(people who pledge their personal assets against the underwriting business
written by syndicates on the market). The problem has always been that Names
have unlimited liability. If the syndicates lose money, Names are required
to pay up - not just to the value of the capital they pledged initially but
pro rata to the total value of the loss.
As a result, many people have become insolvent in the past few years,
particularly those in syndicates forced to pay out for natural disasters and
environmental clean-ups.
The CCVs now being proposed waive the unlimited liability risks. The idea
was mooted in the Lloyd's business plan, put forward in April as a way to
complement the traditional unlimited liability business of Names. Corporate
capital funds would be required to pay out losses only up to the total
amount they pledged.
On the other hand, the traditional advantage of membership of Lloyd's
remains: that the individual's assets can be used twice, pledged to the
insurance market in the event of losses but, at the same time, available to
invest elsewhere.
Many of the CCVs are geared around investment from financial institutions
and will not be available easily to individual investors - except to those
who have large sums managed directly by investment houses. But others are
being targeted, at least partly, at individuals. As the adviser to one fund
says (referring to the mythical investor in the British Gas privatisation):
'We are not looking for Sid but, maybe, for Sir Sidney.'
The CCVs include the CLM Insurance Fund (advised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd)
and CLM Advisers, part of Sedgwick, which aims to raise about one-quarter of
its funding from individuals; and the Premium Underwriting and Premium Trust
planned by Noble &amp; Co. with Martin Currie and Wellington, which wants to
raise about 30 per cent of its Pounds 30m from individuals. Private
investors are also to be encouraged towards Syndicate Capital Trust, being
launched by Raphael Zorn Hemsley with Insurance Analysis and John Govett;
and to a fund-of-funds from Johnson Fry. Details of several others are still
to emerge.
Potential investors need to consider several elements in making a choice.
The structure of the funds varies between conventional investment trusts,
funds-of-funds, and the split capital arrangement proposed by Noble. The
choice of advisers varies, too, with some tied to a particular members'
agent and the syndicates it favours and others opting for independent
advisers.
Investment strategies also vary widely in terms of the number of syndicates
chosen and the nature of the business they write, and the ratio of capital
pledged to total underwriting capacity.
Lloyd's, meanwhile, has proposed a number of safeguards to reduce the risk
of large losses. These range through new regulatory requirements covering
the whole market to specific measures aimed at the corporate funds, such as
a conservative maximum ratio of 2:1 of underwriting capacity to capital
pledged. It also requires all the corporate funds to work with professional
advisers with knowledge of the market.
The arguments for investing in Lloyd's now include the new opportunities for
investment at a time when premiums are rising in response to the poor
results in the past few years.
A number of uncertainties remain. Most importantly, Names still have to
approve the introduction of corporate capital. Many - particularly among the
loss-making dissidents - have concerns about corporate capital and how it
will change their own role in the market. Dissenters were defeated at an
extraordinary general meeting they held in July which ratified the idea of
corporate capital. But, in an attempt to pre-empt further objections,
Lloyd's itself has called another for October 20. No final approvals for
funds can be given until after then.
The stock exchange and Lloyd's itself must approve the funds. Just as
significant, so must the Inland Revenue. There is still some question about
whether the funds will qualify for the tax status of an investment trust.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics group run by the ever-colourful Alan
Sugar, reports its full-year results on Tuesday. The group, which reported a
Pounds 71m loss last year, should have broken even at the trading level -
but there may well be exceptional costs of about Pounds 25m mainly related
to the closure of its Spanish operations.
Most interest will be focused on the new corporate strategic plan which
Amstrad's chairman has also promised to unveil and which will probably
involve a move away from personal computers towards new growth areas such as
telecommunications products.
Tuesday also sees the interim results of Silentnight Holdings. Projected
profits of about Pounds 5m pre-tax will be an improvement on last time's
Pounds 4.1m and will be thanks to the US and German operations performing
better.
Bank of Scotland reveals its interim figures on Wednesday. Estimates of
pre-tax profits vary from Pounds 80m to Pounds 97m, up from last time's
Pounds 74m. This would be in line with general banking industry trends, with
levels of bad debt provisions falling.
Further vigorous growth is expected at Lloyds Chemists, the expanding
retailing chemist which reports its final results on Thursday. Pre-tax
profits as high as Pounds 50m are anticipated, compared with Pounds 36.9m
last time.
Also due on Thursday are the interim results of Etam, the clothing retailer.
Forecasts range between Pounds 1.9m and Pounds 2.5m, against Pounds 1.7m in
the previous first half. The interim dividend should rise to 1.75p (1.65p).

FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Pension law: are the reforms Goode
enough? - Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Debbie Harrison consider its
implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT MAXWELL's theft of Pounds 400m from the Mirror Group pension schemes
raised serious questions about the ownership and safety of pension funds.
The government-appointed committee, headed by Professor Roy Goode of Oxford
University, to investigate the legal framework for occupational pensions,
made its recommendations public on Thursday. A bill may be introduced in the
1994-95 parliamentary session.
If you are in an occupational scheme, how would Goode's recommendations
affect the security of your pension? Much depends on how much meat is put on
the bones of the proposals.
Pensions Regulator
'The root of the problem is that there is no comprehensive legal framework
governing occupational pensions,' according to the report.
At present pension schemes are based on trust law which is complex and
ill-defined. Goode proposes to strengthen trust law with a Pensions Act to
protect the scheme member's 'pensions promise', namely that rights will
accrue the longer the employee contributes to the scheme, that these accrued
rights will be protected and that the benefits will be provided.
The rights enshrined in the Act will override a scheme's trust deeds. The
trustee's role is to act solely in the best interests of members and
beneficiaries.
If the trustee or one of the professionals the trustee appoints - auditor,
actuary, legal adviser or fund manager - is found in breach of the new
rules, they could be punished under criminal law. A Pensions Regulator would
be appointed to see that the law is implemented and to draw up a code of
conduct for trustees.
Alan MacDougall, managing-director of Pensions and Investment Research
Consultants, says much depends on what the code contains.
'We need to know what power and resources will be given to the regulator to
know if he will be able to do the job properly or if he will be a toothless
tiger.'
Compensation scheme
The report recommends that those deprived of pension rights should be
entitled to compensation but only in cases of fraud, theft and other
misappropriation. Compensation would be capped at 90 per cent of the value
of misappropriated assets.
The scheme will be funded by a levy on all schemes after a disaster. But
there is uncertainty about the ability of members to prove theft or fraud.
Robin Ellison, partner with pensions solicitors Ellison Westhorp, says:
'Members need more protection than this. Even now a case for fraud has not
been proved against Maxwell.' Member representation. It should not be the
sole right of employers to appoint trustees, nor should they be able to veto
any trustee selected by scheme members. Goode proposes that, for
earnings-related schemes, at least one third of the board should be members
and for money-purchase schemes, active members should be entitled to appoint
at least two thirds of the trustee board.
However, MacDougall, says that since there will be majority voting, the
member trustees will always be in a minority. Unfortunately, the member
representation proposals do not apply to small schemes - schemes with no
more than 50 active members and pensioners. It is often in schemes of this
size that problems arise.
More powers to Ombudsman
The Pensions Ombudsman, who arbitrates in disputes, and the Occupational
Pensions Advisory Service, which deals with queries and complaints from the
public and acts as a screening mechanism for the Ombudsman, are to have
their powers extended.
The report also recommends an extension to existing dispute channels by
introducing internal procedures to settle disagreements between members and
the scheme.
Alan Pickering, pensions consultant with actuarial consultants Watsons,
said: 'The internal dispute procedure is a welcome improvement and puts
pension benefits on a par with pay - which of course already can be
negotiated and resolved through the appropriate internal channels.
'A logical extension to this is the addition of paid conciliation officers
at OPAS who can intervene before it is necessary to incur expensive
litigation. In the more complex cases, the Pensions Ombudsman would have
power to take the lead in an investigation and would be encouraged to name
names - a much more effective deterrent than the current system which only
allows the publication of anonymous case studies.'
However, Ellison said: 'It would be far better to have a tribunal rather
than a single ombudsman. A tribunal would provide a balanced investigation
whereas under the proposed system too much power would rest with one
individual.'
Minimum solvency requirement
Schemes should have enough money to meet their obligations to scheme
members. The report introduces an important minimum funding requirement for
all schemes so that they would be able to fulfil all liabilities if they
were to be wound up.
A margin is allowed and a scheme will only be in violation of its obligation
if assets fall below 90 per cent of the proposed level.
If a shortfall of less than 10 per cent is discovered, the employer will
have three months to make it good. Two weeks after that the trustees must
tell scheme members if a shortfall remains, and try to recover the money
from the employer. The regulator may also take steps to force the employer
to make the necessary payment.
The trustees, the scheme actuary and auditor would issue an annual
certificate of solvency and report shortfalls in funding to the Regulator.
Some experts believe that these solvency margins are too low. Moreover
unapproved arrangements, such as funded unapproved retirement benefits for
employees affected by the earnings cap, would not be subject to these new
rules.
Pension fund surplus
The report does not recommend imposing restrictions on an employer's ability
to use a pension-fund surplus to finance a contributions holiday provided
the fund meets the solvency standard.
A big disappointment is that the report does not force employers to fully
inflation-link pensions before ceasing contributions.
Winding up
When a scheme is closed the winding up process can take several years
because of the difficulty in tracing or redeeming assets. Many scheme
members have complained to OPAS about these delays in receiving pensions or
transfers.
The report recommends that trustees should make interim awards to avoid
these cases of hardship and to settle any balance of payments once all the
assets have been recovered.
Employer contribution checks
Some employers fail to pay their agreed contributions and sometimes checks
are not made until the company has gone into liquidation.
Under a money purchase scheme - where the pension depends on investment
returns and is not linked to final salary - the report recommends that
trustees should set a time limit for the payment of contributions by both
the employer and employee and that they ensure this requirement is met.
Where a contribution is three months overdue the trustees would inform
scheme members. After six months' delay the regulator would be called in.
The ability of the proposals to protect scheme members hinges on the
competence of the trustees to implement and monitor the new controls. Many
experts believe that a big drawback of the recommendations is that trustees
are being given enhanced responsibilities and while they offer enthusiasm,
they often have little financial expertise.
Richard Malone, of Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, pensions consultants, said:
'There is nothing here to stop another Maxwell-type situation in its tracks.
What would have helped would have been to require trustee training and the
appointment of a professional trustee. All that's happened is a
recommendation to increase the number of amateur trustees on the Board - a
situation Robert Maxwell would have welcomed.'
Nevertheless, a framework has been proposed that should prevent the majority
of pension scheme abuses. Much depends on the scope of the Pensions Act and
the strength of the Regulator.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Giving information to members
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPORT stresses that providing information to members is important in
the smooth running of the pension scheme. Clearly, members must understand
the benefits to which they are entitled and must be told of any changes.
Access to information can also help members to investigate the financial
security of their scheme and to judge if it is being run properly.
Despite improvements in the past few years, the committee found evidence to
suggest that the sheer volume of information sent to members, much of which
is gibberish to most people, simply defeats the purpose. The report suggests
that the following basic information 'should be set out in a simple format
and in plain English and should be given to each employee before joining the
scheme and be available throughout scheme membership':
A statement of whether the scheme is registered with the regulator and its
registration number.
A full statement of the nature of the pension promise detailing
contributions payable, scheme benefits, and how these benefits are secured.
(The report also suggests that these rights should be enshrined in the
employment contract).
A statement of the scheme's past policy with respect to pension increases,
which should be contained in the annual report.
Details of trustee arrangements.
A general statement of the powers to make scheme amendments; the use of
surpluses; the application of funds in the event of wind-up; and the steps
to be taken if the scheme has a deficiency.
A statement of the member's rights to further information and how this can
be obtained.
In addition, all active members and pensioners should be sent automatically
an annual statement, in plain English, showing both their individual
benefits and key information about the scheme including its solvency level,
the basic distribution of assets, and fund movements.
The annual report and accounts should also be written in accessible language
and made available at any time to members.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EMERGING markets in Latin America, Asia and Europe have underperformed major
markets over the past one and five years, but emerging markets funds have
done better than developed markets funds, according to a report on global
emerging markets by Fund Research. Emerging funds grew by an average of
214.3 per cent over five years, compared to 40.3 per cent for developed
markets funds.
Fund Research attributes this success to lower portfolio turnover ratios and
the longer term views of managers in this sector. 'Emerging markets fund
managers, almost without exception, adopt a consistent, long term approach
in what they recognise are volatile markets,' Fund Research says.

At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER five days of talks in Geneva, the 12 members of the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries reached agreement on an accord which will cut
output to raise prices.
The plan, covering the six months from October to March, aims to halt the
sharp fall in oil prices and bring them closer to the Opec target of Dollars
21 a barrel. The agreement led to an immediate jump in oil prices, but by
Friday they were slipping slightly on speculation that the embargo on Iraqi
oil exports could be lifted earlier than expected.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Markets: Will the jolly Green Giant earn his corn? - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORGET the rest of the news. Grand Metropolitan has been hogging the
headlines this week.
A carefully orchestrated public relations blitz has had the drinks, food and
retailing group making announcements almost daily since the appointment at
the end of last week of George Bull as chief executive.
It is an unfortunate name, conjuring up bulls at gates or bulls in china
shops. But shareholders might hope it is an omen for the shares which, a
glance at the chart will show, have been on a bear tack for some time.
Sir Allen Sheppard, GrandMet's chairman, must have waved a red rag at his
new chief executive over the weekend setting off a week of hyperactivity. On
Monday morning Bull sorted out the 'jolly' Green Giant vegetable business,
where the ho-ho-hoes have been distinctly lacking, and the Pearle Vision
opticians business, which with hindsight was not a great buy. With a few
other bits and pieces, the restructuring has brought a Pounds 175m provision
with it.
By Wednesday, Bull had sold the Chef &amp; Brewer chain of 1,654 pubs, reaping
Pounds 830m according to GrandMet - Scottish &amp; Newcastle which is buying the
pubs says it is paying Pounds 622m - and bought Glen Ellen wines in the US.
On Thursday he bought a half share in a Scottish distiller valued at Pounds
84m.
So perhaps GrandMet is getting to grips with its problems and pursuing its
strategy of becoming an international branded business in food, drinks and
retailing. The share price has moved the right way over the week, after
falling 14 1/2 p on the day Bull's appointment was announced to 393p. It
closed the week at 416p.
The financing of S &amp; N's purchase of the pubs was partly through a Pounds
405m one-for-four rights issue, but also involved Morgan Grenfell, a
blue-blooded merchant bank, becoming a sizeable pub landlord - prompting a
vision of sober-suited bankers rolling up their sleeves, pulling pints, and
calling 'time, gentlemen, please'.
Rights issues have been another theme of the week, with Costain calling for
Pounds 84m - more than its own market value - through a hefty five-for-four
issue to repair a balance sheet tottering under the weight of debt.
Meanwhile, Takare asked for Pounds 68m through a two-for-five issue so that
it could speed up its expansion in the nursing home sector. Adwest, the
automotive components group, asked shareholders for Pounds 22.2m to pay for
acquisitions which it has yet to tie up.
Rolls Royce's recent Pounds 307m rights issue was 87 per cent taken up this
week, and the balance quickly sold.
Takare chairman, Keith Bradshaw, may have given the game away saying that
while the company did not need a rights issue, his advisers, SG Warburg, had
rung him and suggested now would be a good time to have one.
The fees involved in Takare's issue alone run to around Pounds 1 3/4 m,
which explains why merchant banks' shares have been some of the strongest
performers this year.
Clearly there is good demand for new equity at present. The sale of a 54.8
per cent stake in Mirror Group Newspapers was achieved apparently painlessly
at a price of 170p. It raised Pounds 373m gross - or Pounds 358m, after
Pounds 15m of expenses - more fees -for the City. Mercury Asset Management
emerged on Friday as a buyer of a 16.3 per cent stake, taking its share in
the supposedly left-of-centre newspaper to over 20 per cent.
While the flood of rights issues shows no sign of abating, the stream of
flotations is also continuing. Flotations have raised far less money this
year than rights issues. According to Stock Exchange figures, in the first
half of the year new companies joining the market raised Pounds 1.78bn, with
the average newcomer to the market taking Pounds 28m, while rights issues
collected Pounds 7.08bn.
One must wonder about the quality of some of the smaller companies coming to
market. However, none has matched for oddity one business seeking Pounds
300,000 of start up capital under the Business Expansion Scheme - Small Room
Media.
It plans to develop a new method for advertisers to reach an audience -
through public conveniences. You can imagine the poster. 'Now wash your
hands with Imperial Leather'. As the prospectus says, it is a great way to
target advertising to gender.
This week some larger names joined the list of forthcoming floats, adding to
the likes of Allders, the department store and duty free retailer, which is
expected to be worth Pounds 150m. Coming soon will be Gartmore, the fund
management group, likely to be valued at up to Pounds 300m, and DFS
Furniture, a retailer of furniture, whose executive chairman Graham Kirkham
hopes to raise Pounds 100m by selling half the shares he and his family own
exclusively.
In spite of the calls on investors money, the end of the third quarter, and
of the stockmarket account, the Footsie has shown continued resilience this
week, rising 34.1 points to 3039.3. Talk of interest rate cuts early in the
week is probably premature. The Conservative Party has surely broken free
from the knee jerk of cutting rates every time it has a conference.
The first November budget has been weighing on the market's mind though. If
a rate cut is to come it may be used to mitigate the inflationary effects of
raising more tax from VAT, a prospect which now seems certain. With the oil
price firming on the new OPEC production limiting deal, inflation is set to
pick up sharply in the coming months.
That must be bad news for bonds, especially if it means we are close to the
bottom of the interest rate cycle. But that need not be so bad for equities.
As recession turns to recovery, corporate earnings will rise and the usual
pattern in the markets is for equities to run ahead of bonds. The great bull
market is not dead yet.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Markets: Cheer for RMC and Redland - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN manufacturing industry may be in the midst of the worst recession
since the end of the second world war, but the news for shareholders in some
of Britain's biggest building materials groups remains positive.
Both RMC, Europe's biggest concrete and cement producer, and Redland,
Europe's biggest roof tile maker, reported strong first-half results from
German operations, buoyed by the strength of the housing market in east
Germany in particular.
Redland, which reported a 22 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
108m earlier this week, has a 51 per cent stake in Braas, Germany's biggest
roof tile manufacturer.
Operating profits from German operations rose to Pounds 56.2m from Pounds
41.1m a year earlier and represented over 46 per cent of total operating
profits.
Robert Napier, Redland's chief executive, argues that the German roofing
market has been 'de-coupled' from the rest of the economy thanks to
immigration, higher household formation and growth in housing activity in
east Germany - including repair of existing housing stocks which are
generally in poor condition.
Napier backed his optimistic outlook with figures showing an 18 per cent
increase in residential building permits during the first-half which, given
that some are for apartment blocks with flat roofs, should convert to a 9
per cent increase in second-half pitched-roof house-building.
The figures do not fully reflect the sharp increase in building activity in
the east where residential single and two-family building permits grew by
208 per cent in the first half and multi-family permits jumped by 359 per
cent - allbeit from a low base.
This east German weighting is particularly important to RMC Group which is
half-way through a Pounds 500m investment programme in its east German
cement operations.
In the first-half, RMC's German operations contributed operating profits of
Pounds 50.4m (Pounds 40.5m) on sales of Pounds 654.6m and helped offset
declines elsewhere in Europe, particularly in France and Spain.
Although the cost of RMC's Berlin investments were reflected in higher net
interest charges of Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 18.5m), the group also benefits
from tax breaks for investing in the east which are not fully reflected in
its reported 26 per cent tax charge.
The tax breaks flow from the merger of the group's east and west German
operations in April which enabled RMC to take advantage of substantial
German tax reliefs and incentives available on current and future investment
in eastern Germany.
But not all UK building materials companies stand to gain from the east
German construction surge. As NatWest Securities analysts noted, although
the radiator market in Germany is stable, the boiler market was down by over
10 per cent in the first half affecting Blue Circle's Celsius operations.
Other companies, such as Pilkington, straddle the two halves of the German
economy - construction and manufacturing. Pilkington's Flachglas subsidiary
has managed to defend its leading position in the architectural glass
market, but profits from automotive glass sold into the deeply depressed
German motor industry have fallen.
There are also some doubts among analysts about how sustainable the boom in
German construction will be. For example Mike Betts, of Goldman Sachs, is
forecasting that Redland's profits from Germany will peak at Pounds 150m
this year and could fall to Pounds 96m in 1997, Pounds 76m from west Germany
and Pounds 20m from the east.
Betts argues that the 'normal' relationship between interest rates and the
housing market does not seem to apply in Germany and that therefore the
eventual reduction in German interest rates would be bad news for the German
housing market.
By that stage most companies are hoping for a rebound in UK profits from
their cyclical lows. In the interim those building materials companies like
RMC and Redland which have invested in building up a strong market postion
in Germany still look like they have backed a winner.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Markets: A Blockbuster of Paramount importance - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOND YIELDS may be rising again, economic growth is still spotty, and
concern about the coming quarterly reporting season is growing - but US
share prices have been more than holding their own.
If anyone needs to know why market sentiment has remained so robust,
Wednesday's release of the latest mutual fund sales figures provided a good
part of the answer. According to the Investment Company Institute, a record
Dollars 12.1bn of investors' money flowed into stock mutual funds in August.
The numbers are quite startling. Not only was the August figure up 24 per
cent from the Dollars 9.7bn stock fund inflows recorded in July but, over
the first eight months of this year, stock funds have attracted a record
Dollars 82bn of new money. This is already more than the Dollars 78bn
recorded in all of 1992, itself a record year.
It has been said many times in the past couple of years, but it is worth
saying again: the flow of investors' money into the equity markets is
unprecedented, in both size and consistency, and it has been the most
important factor behind the present, and very long, bull market.
The impact upon share prices of the heavy buying of equity funds would have
been even more pronounced but for the fact that there has been an equally
unprecedented supply of new stock to meet the demand from individual
investors.
This week, the latest equity issuance figures were released by Securities
Data, the New Jersey-based financial information group. They showed that US,
and a growing number of foreign, companies have been raising capital by
issuing new equity in record amounts this year.
In the first three quarters of this year, 539 companies made their debut on
the equity markets; they raised a total of Dollars 40bn, already more than
in all of 1992. The past three months have been particularly busy, with
Dollars 13.4bn raised through initial public offerings, or IPOs
(flotations), more than half the Dollars 24.4bn raised through all stock
issues.
It is not difficult to discover why investors' appetite for IPOs is so
strong. US share prices have been at, or near, record levels for most of the
year but, more importantly, the performance of IPOs has been spectacular.
According to Securities Data, the average IPO stock gained 28.7 per cent in
price between the date of issue and the end of September. With short-term
money market funds returning not much more than 3 per cent, and bond funds
between 5 per cent and 7 per cent, no wonder investors are scrambling to buy
into new stock issues.
This week's deluge of data, however, did not carry an entirely positive
message for US stock markets.
The fund sales figures showed that more and more investors are buying into
foreign equity funds. Moreover, analysts who track fund flows say that much
of the money going into foreign funds is coming straight out of domestic
stock funds.
Of the Dollars 12.1bn that went into all stock funds in August, Dollars
6.64bn, or just 55 per cent, went into funds that invest only in US stocks.
The rest of that money departed overseas as investors, believing US equities
to be too costly and possibly fearing an imminent correction in US markets,
went in search of cheaper, more attractive foreign stocks.
Fund managers in New York, Boston, and across the US say that their
customers' interest in stocks has been overwhelmingly biased towards foreign
markets over the past few recent months. Yet, as long as interest rates
remain low and keep luring investors out of low-yielding money market funds
and bank certificates of deposit, the flows overseas are not overly
worrying.
Wall Street, however, will begin to sweat if interest rates (which rose
above 6 per cent at the long end of the bond market this week) start heading
upward, and investors continue to find foreign equities more attractive than
the home-grown variety.
At least the battle for control over Paramount Communications, the
entertainment group, is providing the domestic markets with something to get
excited about. The contest between Viacom and QVC heated up this week when
Blockbuster Entertainment announced it was investing Dollars 600m in Viacom
in a deal that should allow Viacom to increase its agreed offer to
Paramount, which is at present lower than QVC's rival bid. Viacom is also
rumoured to be close to securing additional funds from several other
companies.
Foreign markets may look more attractive to US investors at the moment but
they cannot possibly offer a bid war as exciting and intriguing as the fight
for Paramount, which is far from over. Watch this space.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Markets: What it means to be the best - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hold thou the good: define it well:
For fear divine Philosophy
Should push beyond her mark, and be
Procuress to the Lords of Hell
 - Tennyson, In Memoriam
DEFINING an absolute is not simple and financial services regulators have
not found it easy to say what they mean by the superlative 'best' in the
context of giving good financial advice.
The Financial Services Act, implemented in 1988, ushered in a system
designed to give investors increased protection. One of its requirements was
that financial advisers should give 'best' advice to their clients. The
reason why investors need such protection is because their advisers are not
advisers at all but salesmen paid by commission.
Independent financial advisers earn commission from sales of life office or
investment house products - unless they are fee-charging advisers - while
tied agents earn their commission from the single life company they
represent.
Best advice was meant to protect investors against being sold products which
simply brought in the largest amount of commission for the 'adviser' at the
expense of the needs of the client. The term does not appear in the
Financial Services Act or in the Core Conduct of Business Rules issued by
the Securities and Investments Board, the chief regulator. Instead they
refer to giving 'suitable' advice.
Although giving a client best advice would seem simple defining it has been
such a problem that the word 'best' was abandoned by Fimbra, the
self-regulatory body for IFAs in February. Its Guidelines on Best Advice
were replaced by guidelines called Giving Investment Advice.
IFAs complained that in the world of packaged products there is no
superlative, no 'best' product. The unit trust with the best performance
today might be at the bottom of the tables next month.
But equating best advice with best product has been at the heart of the
problem of abuse, particularly with tied agents. Many have conveniently
taken best advice to mean selling the most suitable product that the life
company to which they are tied, has. No matter that this product might not
have a good performance record. No matter that the life company might not
have a suitable product in its range at all - the agent may sell the closest
thing to it.
It is worrying to think that regulators could have allowed this concept of
best advice to go on for as long as it has. Examples of these abuses were
provided by the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation. This
week Lautro issued a guide for sales agents spelling out their duty to
recommend a product only if it is suitable to a client's circumstances.
Lautro has found it easier to define what is suitable in the negative. Its
list of examples of cases where suitable advice was not given makes
depressing reading.
In one case, a 21-year-old chef in the Royal Navy, who had life cover
through his work, expressed a desire to accumulate savings. Without asking
him when he wanted the savings, the agent sold him a whole-of-life policy.
Another young man in temporary employment was sold a long-term savings plan
even though he would be unlikely to maintain payments and had not indicated
a desire to save for a long period.
A couple with a young child wanted to save to pay for the child's education.
They were sold a whole-of-life plan on the grounds that this could be used
for education in the child's later life. The couple complained pointing out
they wanted to fund the child's primary education fees. 'It was noted that
there was a question of affordability even for the purpose of funding
secondary education but considered in any event that the whole of life
policy was not a reasonable solution for the intended needs,' said Lautro.
In another case, a couple who had taken out a five-year interest-free loan
wanted to be in a position to pay it off when it fell due. They were sold a
10-year savings policy as the most suitable product on the grounds that the
life company did not have a five-year plan.
In its guidelines, Lautro says that its Monitoring Committee 'does not
regard suitability as synonymous with the closest match.' If the life office
does not have a product suitable for the clients need, 'it should not, of
course, be recommended to the investor.'
By defining more narrowly the kind of products which can be recommended in
certain circumstances, the Lautro guidelines are welcome but they also
highlight worryingly widespread evidence of abuse. It will now be up to
Lautro to enforce with vigour what it has overlooked for so long.
Those most likely to sell the least suitable products are agents tied to
companies which do not have a wide variety of products. Most people who go
to a tied agent - eight out of the 10 largest building societies are tied
agents - are unlikely to know whether the life company the agent represents
has a wide or narrow product range. The assurance by Lautro that it will
look 'particularly closely at queries about best advice which arise in the
context of such members' provides scant comfort.
Consumers should be aware of the risks of going to a tied agent for
financial 'advice' and should continue to demand that regulators ensure the
availability of the seemingly impossible - best advice.

CAN British investors and pensioners sleep more soundly in the knowledge
that the regulators are protecting them ever more securely? Investors may
have read about Thursday's recommendations of the Goode Committee, the group
of experts set up to advise the government on how to avoid a repetition of
the Maxwell corporate pensions disaster. They may not have noticed, however,
the more obscure manoeuvrings at the Personal Investments Authority.
This is a new (indeed, still only half-formed) body, which by the middle of
next year is supposed to be taking over the protection role for non-deposit
retail investment - embracing various kinds of packaged investments ranging
from unit trusts to personal pensions and life assurance. The sudden
departure of its chairman, Sir Gordon Downey, last week and the installation
of Joe Palmer, a former Legal &amp; General boss, as his successor was an
indication of serious strains.
In political terms, investment regulation in the UK tends to be a game of
pass the parcel. On the one side the politicians are desperate to avoid
scandals, and bailouts financed out of the public exchequer, but are
reluctant to take responsibility for problems they do not understand. They
are also unwilling to pay the costs of regulation. So they shuffle the
problem over to investment practitioners who organise themselves into
self-regulatory bodies but often fail to deliver the hoped-for degree of
investor protection. Back goes the parcel.
The only factor that promises an end to this unsatisfactory stalemate is the
growth of an entirely new class of professional regulator. Once the job was
usually done by civil servants, who regarded it as a posting to the section
of living death. Now, enjoying several times the pay rates, new bureaucrats
have appeared who are not forever itching to be transferred to something
more exciting, like company registration.
Significantly, the Goode Committee has opted for a statutory regulator for
occupational pensions. There is no hint that a body of pensions
self-regulators should be established (though the regulator is to be advised
by a committee of experts). Moreover it is suggested that the regulator
should be paid for by the government (although what the government will have
to say about this remains to be seen). I wonder whether this recommendation
of a statutory regulator may reflect the general shift of opinion away from
self-regulation that has taken place over the past ten years or so, since
the Financial Services Act 1986 was being developed.
For investment generally, however, the argument is not an either / or one
about whether there should be statutory regulation or self-regulation, but a
judgmental one about where the dividing line should be drawn.
Self-regulation works where a fairly small and coherent group of
practitioners can see a trade-off between the public interest and its own
business interests. The old Stock Exchange worked like this, as a kind of
club, but it could not cope with the arrival of big international banks as
members along with the City gents and country brokers. Self-regulation can
also succeed where the customers are as professional and well-organised as
the practitioners and can therefore look out for themselves. Some pretty
dirty things go on in the Eurobond market but it is regarded as part of the
game.
Self-regulation cannot work where large and conflicting groups of
practitioners are dealing with an ignorant and vulnerable (and too often
greedy) public. Unfortunately this is a precise description of the PIA. It
is more than a year since the plan to replace several other regulators such
as Lautro and Fimbra with the PIA was announced (it was originally supposed
to have started operations in July this year). Sir Gordon Downey's departure
is widely presumed to reflect the dissatisfaction of the Treasury and its
senior investor protection agency, the Securities and Investments Board,
with the slow progress. Palmer, a director of the SIB until he joined the
PIA, is presumed to have taken the role of agent of Andrew Large, the SIB
chairman.
As recently as last May, Andrew Large spelled out, in a special report to
his bosses at the Treasury, why a two-tier system of regulation must be made
to work, with the SIB supervising the various regulators but not running
them in a hands-on way. The strong suspicion has persisted, however, that
the main reason for persevering with the two-tier approach lay in the
Treasury's unwillingness to update the underlying legislation in the
Financial Services Act. Now we see the practical difficulties persisting at
the PIA, which has emerged as the SIB's chosen instrument for the next stage
of regulatory development. If the SIB is being forced to manipulate the
board of the PIA (and the chairmanship switch comes after a still unresolved
row over the size and constitution of the board) then self-regulation must
largely be a sham.
Now the financial intermediaries, banks and insurance companies that make up
the potential membership of the PIA are being told by the Treasury to get on
with the formation process (over which they have at least some degree of
control) or face some kind of alternative regulatory body which might be
rather nasty to them. Quite a few practitioners, though, are wondering
whether the official bluff should be called. The parcel has not yet stopped
moving to and fro.
In opting for investor protection through self-regulators in the 1980s the
government chose a soft option. If it worked, well and good. If it did not,
the failure could be made to look like the fault of the practitioners. But
investors have not been well served by this approach. False starts have
delayed the process of forming the right institutions and building the
necessary expertise within them. Perhaps it was unrealistic to think it
could be done within much less than 10 years, anyway.
So if you wake in the middle of the night, you should worry just a little.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Massacre by Rio's police terrorists: Violence, corruption
and economic decay are destroying the hopes of Brazil, a country blessed
with natural wealth and a tradition of happy civic order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE last Sunday of August should have been a great night for Brazil. Faced
with the threat of not qualifying for the World Cup for the first time in
its history, the team had finally produced the old magic in thrashing
Bolivia by a glorious six goals to nil. Television commentators ridiculed a
front page story in the previous day's New York Times, which prematurely
declared Bolivia the new footballing champs of Latin America, and all over
the country firecrackers exploded to mark the start of what promised to be
nightlong victory celebrations.
The makeshift bar at number 12, Rua Antonio Mendes, in Vigario Geral, one of
the most violent favelas or slums in the northern suburbs of Rio de Janeiro,
was no exception. Inside, seven men were toasting the team, their own hard
lives as labourers, metal workers and stall holders temporarily forgotten
amid the pride of being Brazilian and the warming, hunger-killing taste of
pinga, the harsh local rum.
Just after midnight the door burst open. Masked men, apparently police,
filled the room, demanding to see the identity cards that all Brazilian
residents must carry. As the revellers fumbled through their pockets one of
the hooded intruders lobbed a grenade into the small room. In the ensuing
dust-and-smoke-filled Pandemonium they opened fire, killing all seven and
spraying the room with so many bullets that the walls looked like firing
ranges and the red metal chairs were left mangled.
The killers then crossed the street to a simple two-room house where a
family of seven evangelicals were sleeping under a sampler, embroidered with
the message 'The Lord Blesses and Awaits You'. With another burst of fire
they slaughtered all seven, from the elderly grandmother clutching her bible
to the young girl whose 16th birthday was the next day.
By 1am they had claimed 21 victims: the largest massacre in a city where
violence is so common that there is a tabloid, O Povo, dedicated to gruesome
reportage about the previous night's butchering.
Next morning in Vigario Geral stump-like chords protruded from public
phones, cut before the carnage began. Stunned locals were frightened to talk
openly but all insisted on one thing - the men were military police, or PMs
as they are known, apparently on a revenge attack for the murder of four of
their rank while collecting their pay-off on a drug deal. As all 21
bullet-riddled corpses were laid out in metal drawers in the blistering
midday sun, a woman began screaming 'Killer PMs'. Confirming police
involvement, Kilo Batista, deputy governor of Rio state, said: 'I've never
seen anything so Dante-esque. It's as if the inner workings of the police
were pervaded by a culture of extermination which comes out at night like a
beast an the kill.'
The Vigario Geral massacre was a rude shock to a country that has the motto
'Order and Progress' stamped across its flag . Brazil has always taken pride
in the fact that in spite of its diversity of creeds and colours, its
continental size and unfair income distribution, it has remained a peaceful
place, remarkably free of ethnic, religious, or regional tension. Unlike its
more volatile neighbours, Brazil has never had a revolution or a serious
guerrilla movement. Even its independence from Portugal was secured without
bloodshed.
But a series of chilling incidents, often perpetrated by military police, is
prompting many to ask whether the world's third most-populous democracy is
beginning to tear itself apart. In the month before the Vigario Geral
massacre, military police in Rio slaughtered eight homeless children
sleeping at the door of a church, carried out an armed bank robbery and were
exposed as running a stolen car racket in cahoots with the city's breakers
yards. In the remote Amazonian north, 19 Yanomami Indians were murdered by
machete-wielding gold miners and even in the sterile capital, Brasilia, a
teenage boy was clubbed to death by a gang of youths. Antoninho Ventim,
spokesman for the National Bishops Conference, says: 'This series of
cold-blooded assassinations shows that the avalanche of violence in this
country has reached uncontrollable levels.'
In some ways it is remarkable that this has not happened before. Sitting at
an open bar in the Sunday market in Sao Cristovao in northern Rio is like
watching a procession of every colour and creed on earth from Nordic blonde
ice maidens through curvaceous Carmen Miranda-type mulattas to ebony African
warriors.
Brazil offered great promise to immigrants, with its riches in natural
resources and vast unexplored territory. Today it hosts the largest Japanese
population outside Japan, large groups of Germans, Italians, Poles,
Lithuanians, Dutch and Swedes. The vast rainforest is home to the world's
largest Indian population. Brazil, the last country to abolish slavery, has
a large number of descendants of African slaves.
Aside from its ethnic diversity Brazil also boasts one of the world's
largest gaps between rich and poor - the World Bank puts it second only to
Sierra Leone. The difference is most visible in Rio, where, in luxury
apartments, the rich sip cocktails served by white-jacketed butlers and pick
at food from groaning tables decorated with ice sculptures, overlooked by
sprawling slums of shacks where black beans are the staple fare and there is
often no clean water. Few countries in the world have so consistently
governed for the rich at the expense of the poor, building cycle paths for
the middle classes while the poor do not have sewage; pumping money into
universities while primary schools are starved of resources; and allowing a
third of its population to suffer malnutrition while consistently figuring
in the world's top three agricultural exporters.
To an outside eye the place seems ripe for revolution. Yet, instead of
protest, the visitor sees underfed faces smiling and laughing on the
seafront, a crimson-lipped girl swaying her hips provocatively while a
toothless old man strums a banjo, lilting music that is mellow rather than
angry. Journalists who venture into the favelas find people rarely complain
about their lot. Instead, writers must resort to superficial explanations
about the beneficial effects of the weather, the beach and the pinga; or
Portuguese passivity; or the informal economy that provides half of the
city's employment.
But many of those living in Rio believe the situation is untenable.
The persistent failure of the government to provide for the poor has allowed
drug dealers and bicheiros (who run illegal gambling) to move in as the main
purveyors of social policy in the favelas, which have become no-go areas for
the authorities. Crime is so high that law-abiding people live behind bars,
public parks are locked behind iron railings, and no one stops at red
traffic lights at night for fear of being attacked. Carlos Roxo, an
executive with Aracruz, a large pulp and paper company, complains: 'It's
like living in a nightmare. The government doesn't control the police, the
police don't control the bandits. We can't descend much further.'
For the first time, many Brazilians are giving up on the self-styled land of
the future and plotting escape. Those who have lost hope can be seen in the
enormous queue for visas outside the US consulate in Rio. Consular officials
estimate that between 2m and 3m Brazilians live in the US, most illegally.
One says: 'The frightening thing is that we are seeing the cream of society
abandoning ship. We're signing visa forms for people we know are a real
loss. Brazilians used to go the States to study and come back. Now they
stay.' The favourite destination is Miami where recent arrivals include
Zozimo, Rio's leading gossip columnist and Pedro Collor, brother of the
ousted president.
In the Museum of Japanese Immigration in Sao Paulo is displayed a letter
written by the first arrivals at the turn of the century, raving about the
riches and peaceful living that Brazil offered. Today the Japanese consulate
in Sao Paulo is packed with nissei or Japanesedescendants, returning to
their homeland, citing the same reasons.
Many of those without the resources or desire to leave Brazil are making a
religious migration. Brazil is the world's largest Catholic country but the
past few years have seen a mass exodus from the church as faith in
traditional institutions erodes. Catholic priests watch in dismay the
explosion in Afro-Brazilian religions such as candomble, a kind of white
magic whose practitioners include the last-but-one finance minister, who
always wore white on Fridays.
Sprucely painted buildings housing protestant sects such as the Universal
Church of the Kingdom of God have sprung up everywhere. In Rio, evangelicals
control 25 of the 33 radio stations, forcing the bishops to take to the
airwaves themselves in self-defence.
The failure of Brazil's institutions to meet the needs of its people makes
all the more remarkable last year's street movement to impeach President
Fernando Collor - the world's first impeachment of an elected president. So
peaceful were the mass rallies that not a single injury was sustained nor
window broken. Benito Gama, the congressman who wrote the report accusing
Collar of corruption, says: 'We really stretched democracy to the limits.'
It may have been their last chance, however. The main reason for the
outbreak of violence is frustration with the worsening economic situation.
After years as one of the world's fastest growing economies - between the
1940s and 1980s Brazil grew at an average 7 per cent per annum - in the last
decade it has seen one country after another overtake it. While Argentina
recently sold off its oil company and Chile was described in Washington as a
tiger, the Brazilian state still spends its time running manufacturing
companies. Four finance ministers and three central bank governors have been
defeated in the last year by inflation, which is running at 2,000 per cent
per annum, and Brazil has slipped from being the world's eighth largest
economy to be the 10th. Last month's relaunch of the Volkswagen Beetle,
first produced in Brazil in 1959 as a triumph of its industrial prowess, was
confirmation to many of how far Brazil has slipped.
Brazil has had a lot of bad luck with its presidents, who have shown an
unfortunate tendency to resign, die, shoot themselves or be ousted before
completing their mandates. With the end of military rule in 1985, the hope
of better days was quickly thwarted when Tancredo Neves died before even
taking office. The government of his intended vice-president, Jose Sarney,
was a disaster, its uncontrolled spending pushing inflation to 84 per cent a
month. The young Fernando Collor, with his fighting talk and dashing good
looks seemed to provide new hope but while modernising the state was filling
his pockets. 'We can't keep on disappointing the people,' warns Carlos
Langoni, an economics professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation.
Today Collor is living out his own form of escapism. Holed up inside his
lakeside mansion in Brasilia he tortures himself with geographic proximity
to power while his small staff place signed photos in envelopes as if he
were a reclusive pop star. Adamantly denying his playboy past, Collor styles
himself as an intellectual, seated at a large desk piled with books by the
likes of Paul Kennedy, densely annotated with tiny handwriting. But the
elder statesman act does not come off, perhaps because of Mont Blanc pens,
the fat Cuban cigars and the bestselling book by his brother, detailing
black magic sessions during the presidency at which Collor and his wife
would dance round dead chickens chanting against their political enemies.
Describing himself as a 'victim of the elites', Collor says he believes the
tide will turn and he will return to 'complete my project'.
Few Brazilians share his opinion. So angry are they at what is seen as his
betrayal that few are prepared to give him credit for the positive changes
he inspired. Most Brazilians prefer to forget the fact that 3 1/2 years ago,
when Collor assumed office, Brazil was the most regulated and protected
economy in the noncommunist world. Prices of everything from bread rolls to
cigarettes were fixed by bureaucrats in Brasilia, filling stations were not
allowed to offer discounts, or even services such as car-washing, and more
than 1,500 items could not be imported including cars, fax machines and
computers.
Collor may have changed all that but he and his lieutenant PC Farias were
apparently looting the country at the same time. Corruption is nothing new
in Brazil, but the audacity of Collor's scheme was unequalled. It raked in
more than Dollars 1bn, according to police investigations, through 30 per
cent commissions on government contracts.
Collor's ousting was an was unprecedented event: a Latin American leader
stripped of power for corruption. However, there is little expectation that
the notoriously slow justice system will follow up with a jail sentence.
Collor is even hoping to regain his political rights, which were stripped
for eight years. Farias has changed his name to Born Pablo and fled the
country, leaving the police trailing hopelessly in his wake like Keystone
cops.
When people see their leaders rape the country it is little surprise that
they lose respect for institutions. That this has happened in Brazil is
illustrated by the average Brazilian motorists' behaviour - traffic streams
through red lights, cars park at random - and by the small proportion that
pays taxes - only 7m of a working population of 55m. A survey found that the
only institutions to command any respect were firemen and lifeguards.
Is Brazil on the verge of civil unrest - or even a military coup? Francisco
Gros, a highly respected banker and former central bank governor, is not so
sure that events will be so dramatic. He says Argentina went through 60
years of economic deterioration before implementing serious reform. 'My fear
is not that we will have hyperinflation or a social explosion but that the
situation will just keep on getting worse and worse and more and more
anarchic like a horror film that never ends.'

FT  02 OCT 93 / Lufthansa to form link with United Airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA of Germany and United Airlines of the US are to form a partnership
that will link two of the world's biggest airline networks.
The far-reaching co-operation agreement the two companies will announce in
Frankfurt on Monday is expected to increase the growing consolidation of the
international airline industry.
The Lufthansa-United deal will follow a series of other transatlantic
partnerships, including British Airways' acquisition of a 24 per cent stake
in USAir; a recent co-operation agreement between Air France and
Continental; cross-shareholdings between Swissair and Delta Air Lines; and
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines' partnership with Northwest Airlines.
Although the Lufthansa-United partnership is not expected to involve an
equity swap, it will include ticket code-sharing, allowing the two carriers
access to each other's extensive route networks.
The deal is expected to include collaboration on frequent-flyer programmes
and the sharing of airport facilities.
Lufthansa and United had been scouting for a big transatlantic partnership
to strengthen the global reach of their respective airlines. United and BA
unsuccessfully attempted an alliance four years ago, while Lufthansa had
negotiated with USAir before the American carrier decided to link up with
BA.
Lufthansa had during the past six months been negotiating an alliance with
either United or American Airlines. The US and German governments signed a
bilateral aviation agreement last week after lengthy negotiations, clearing
the way for a partnership between Lufthansa and a US carrier.
Lufthansa, with a total fleet of 226 aircraft, will now have access to the
200 US domestic cities served by United, the second-largest US carrier after
American Airlines.
With a fleet of 550 aircraft, United is also the biggest international US
carrier, with a network serving 33 countries in five continents.
It has recently negotiated co-operation agreements with Emirates, the Dubai
airline, and British Midland, the UK carrier, and has been actively
expanding in Europe. It is the biggest US carrier serving London Heathrow
airport after taking over the former Pan Am routes.
The Lufthansa-United deal is expected further to step up competition on
North Atlantic services, as well as to accelerate efforts by Swissair,
Scandinavian Airlines System, KLM and Austrian Airlines to merge their
operations to form a 'fourth force' in the European airline industry to
compete against the big three - Lufthansa, BA and Air France.
Swissair said in a statement yesterday that the four airlines might sign an
agreement in the next few weeks, although there were still difficulties on
some issues, including a partnership with one or more US airlines.
Austrian also confirmed that it had not decided whether to opt for the
four-airline partnership or to co-operate with Lufthansa, which has been
actively courting the Austrian carrier.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Diners Club loses US account: American Express to pay
Dollars 18m in federal travel deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WASHINGTON will echo to the sound of hundreds of thousands of plastic cards
being cut in half on November 30.
On that day, 900,000 federal government employees in the US and around the
world will rip up their blue and silver Diners Club cards and slip the green
of American Express into their card wallets instead.
The US government's travel card account is reckoned to be the biggest
commercial charge card account in the world. After 10 years, Diners Club,
which is owned by Citicorp, has been outbid for the business by an American
Express deal which is expected to save US taxpayers Dollars 120m (Pounds
77.9m) over the next five years.
To grab the US government's charge card business, American Express hit on a
novel idea. Rather than charge the usual annual fee for its cards, it will
pay the US government a one-off fee of Dollars 20 for each card issued.
American Express calls this sum, expected to total Dollars 18m, a
'conversion fee', a payment to cover the US General Services
Administration's costs of switching card issuers. The GSA, on the other
hand, says the money will pay its overheads for the next five years and save
it going to Congress to ask for cash.
Sweeteners from American Express, based on a percentage of the Dollars 2.5bn
annual travel spending of US government employees, could amount to a further
Dollars 100m over the next five years, according to the GSA.
While it is a prestige account, the US government business is unlikely to
boost American Express's bottom line.
Diners Club says the business, which represents about 10 per cent of the
Dollars 22bn volume on its charge cards last year, was only marginally
profitable.
Mr Roger Ballou, president of American Express's US travel services group,
said the company would make money out of its relationship with the
government, but refused to say how much.
The people who could end up footing the bill for the shift from Diners Club
to American Express are the travel companies, hotels and restaurants used by
US government employees.
American Express charges the retailers which accept its cards an average of
2.9 per cent. Diners Club says its own merchant discounts, as they are
known, are pitched between this and the 2 per cent typically charged by bank
card issuers. 'The merchants get value from American Express,' said Mr
Ballou. 'They wouldn't use us otherwise.'

FT  02 OCT 93 / UDM's bid plan for British Coal hit as electricity group
pulls out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Union of Democratic Mineworkers' efforts to form a consortium to bid for
British Coal in next year's privatisation suffered an unexpected blow
yesterday when one of its partners said it was no longer interested.
East Midlands Electricity said in a brief statement that 'it is not a
partner in any consortium intending to bid for any part of British Coal'. It
gave no reasons, but wished other members of the consortium success in their
bid.
Later Mr John Harris, East Midlands' chairman, said his company had decided
as long ago as the beginning of this year that it did not wish to be an
investor in any bid for British Coal. 'Perhaps we did not make our position
clear enough at the time so we thought we should do so now,' he added.
East Midlands chose to make its announcement only 24 hours after the UDM
revealed that Jim Walter Resources, a US coal mining company, had joined the
consortium, completing what was seen as a strong bidding trio.
Mr Harris said this was not the reason for East Midlands leaving. 'Our
decision was made long ago. In fact, we helped the UDM find an international
partner.'
Mr Neil Greatrex, president of the UDM, said he was not unduly worried by
the East Midlands announcement. It was his understanding that the company
would continue to advise and assist the group in preparing a bid. Mr Bill
Carr, the president of Jim Walter Resources, said he found East Midlands'
announcement 'a bit strange' but he intended to stay with the UDM.
Mr Greatrex would be visiting him in Alabama later this month to discuss the
partnership in more detail.
Some observers speculated that the confusion had been caused by a boardroom
split within East Midlands, with opponents of the consortium succeeding in
overturning the original decision to join.
However Mr Harris denied this. 'There is no split. This has been our
consistent position,' he said.
Like the UDM, East Midlands Electricity is based in Nottingham.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Regulator backs funding of new London radio station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S Radio Authority has approved the finances of London News Radio,
the consortium that has won both the broadcasting frequencies in the capital
of LBC, even though the new venture has yet to put together a group of
shareholders.
Question marks have arisen over the involvement in the venture by Hachette,
the French media group, which was understood to have been a main backer when
the franchise victory was announced last month.
At present the only significant shareholder is Mr Bruce Fireman, the
Guinness Mahon merchant banker responsible for putting LNR's application
together and who plans to become its managing director.
Mr Fireman is backed by a letter from Guinness Mahon guaranteeing the Pounds
4m needed to finance the new radio station.
LNR is due to displace LBC as London's main news and speech commercial radio
station in 12 months. LBC had held the franchise for more than 20 years, but
lost it mainly because it planned to continue simulcasting - broadcasting
the same programme on both its frequencies at night. LNR won with plans for
a complementary service of news on one frequency and a more conversational
approach on the other.
The doubts over Hachette's involvement emerged yesterday with Mr Martin
Brisac, managing director in charge of the international interests of Europe
1, the Hachette-controlled French station, saying his intention to invest
had been subject to contract. He is understood to be unhappy with the
business plan and is seeking more data.
It is believed that Guinness Mahon is no longer enthusiastic about Hachette
as a shareholder and plans to place shares among institutional shareholders.
Dame Shirley Porter, chairman of LBC, said yesterday of the news that LNR
does not yet have its shareholders in place: 'I think that all LBC listeners
will begin to question why there was ever a need to change.'
Dame Shirley plans to continue to run LBC, which is in effect controlled by
the Bank of Scotland, and use it as a launch pad to bid for the national
commercial speech station in 1995.
It is clear that Dame Shirley, backed by extensive family interests based on
holdings in the supermarket group Tesco, aims to make an aggressive bid for
the franchise. The national franchise will go to the highest bidder.
In approving LNR's finances, the Radio Authority had to be satisfied that
one month after awarding the franchise the promised funding was in place.
The authority, which regulates UK commercial radio, has a written assurance
from Guinness Mahon that the Pounds 4m is available.
The fact that no other shareholders have yet signed up is not seen as a
factor.

FT  02 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Lufthansa/UAL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The winds of change are whistling through the airline industry so fast that
it is becoming ever more difficult for carriers to chart a steady course.
The proposed link-up between Lufthansa and United Airlines opens up a new
competitive front and provides further evidence of rapid global
consolidation. Moreover, Europe may soon see the creation of another
international force if the Alcazar alliance becomes a reality. That merged
carrier will doubtless be keen to forge effective transatlantic links.
The Lufthansa-UAL alliance will increase the pressure on Delta, which has a
big presence at Frankfurt. But British Airways, too, which has been winning
traffic by siphoning off transatlantic passengers from Germany, will face a
trickier task. As the biggest US international carrier, United was once BA's
preferred US partner. United's big presence at Heathrow and in the important
US-Pacific region may considerably discomfit the British carrier once a
working relationship with Lufthansa has been established.
A possible weakness in the Lufthansa-UAL link-up could be the lack of
financial commitments. With bitter experience, BA argues equity holdings are
necessary to cement trading relationships. Lufthansa, though, seems likely
to eschew this approach. In truth, it may have little option. The
state-owned German carrier is cutting costs with a vengeance to ready itself
for privatisation and can ill afford the cash. The tangled web enmeshing its
vast pension fund obligations has also to be resolved with the government.

FT  02 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The funds now being set up to invest in the Lloyd's insurance market are a
diverse bunch. The most obvious difference between them lies in investment
strategy, since shareholders' funds can be invested in liquid securities as
well as pledged to back insurance policies. CLM, launched by BZW and
Sedgwick, will buy UK equities. Warburg's proposed vehicle favours bonds,
while Noble's plans an international spread of assets. But while investment
strategy will have some impact on performance, the choice of underwriting
syndicates will make or break each fund.
Backing a bad syndicate carries a far higher penalty than buying shares in a
company which fails, since insurance claims can turn out to be far higher
than the syndicate's paid-up capital. Investing in Lloyd's through a
limited-liability fund should protect investors from the ruinous losses
suffered by Names. But funds which back loss-making syndicates will see
their assets quickly eroded.
Spreading investment across a range of syndicates offers scant protection
against the size of individual losses which can occur in reinsurance. The
quality of research employed by the fund will thus be critical to success.
For an outsider that is extremely difficult to judge. The track record of
the insurance adviser to each fund - ranging from established Lloyd's agents
to US reinsurance companies - might offer some comfort. But the suspicion
remains that the Lloyd's funds on offer this autumn will be almost as opaque
as the insurance market itself.

FT  02 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Oil shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The agreement among the Opec producers certainly seems to have calmed the
oil market when fears of an outright collapse were growing. Saudi Arabia's
readiness to compromise and the involvement of several Gulf heads of state
underlined how seriously Opec takes the threat to its position. Yet the
agreement does little more than institutionalise the current over-production
and formally include Kuwait in the quota system. It will not do much to
tighten the oil market, and crude prices may not rise much above Dollars 18
a barrel.
That probably puts a cap on the recent rebound in oil company shares. But
since BP and Enterprise have lagged behind Shell lately, there is still some
room for them to fare somewhat better. Lasmo is permanently hidden in a
swirl of bid rumours, but the recent high turnover almost certainly owes
more to its efforts to attract new investors in the US than to the
likelihood of predatory stakebuilding.
One key is the way in which US investors have bought into UK oil shares over
the past year. In part that is because simple cash flow models, which are
not adjusted for debt servicing, show some UK oil shares to be cheap.
Persuasive tales of cost cutting and recovery stocks also play a part. If US
funds continue to buy BP and take an interest in Lasmo and Enterprise the
sector looks underpinned. How long they are prepared to hold the shares must
also be a worry for UK fund managers who are feeling uncomfortably
underweight.

FT  02 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Camelot's big bet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Camelot consortium created to bid for the UK's National Lottery will
remain little more than a shimmering castle in the sky until the government
details its intentions. But the serious preparations being made by a string
of blue-chip companies confirm the view that a betting bonanza is about to
break out.
Some members of the Camelot consortium could benefit directly from operating
the lottery. Racal, ICL and De La Rue will all be keen to sell their wares
to the operator. Cadbury Schweppes's involvement appears rather less
explicable, although its marketing muscle will clearly help. There may be a
defensive aspect to Cadbury's move; indecisive shoppers with shallow pockets
may waiver between indulging in lottery tickets or chocolate treats. But it
is certainly gratifying to know that Cadbury has the spare management
resources to become involved in Camelot while taking on the might of
Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in their home market.
The national lottery may yet become the biggest single consumer product in
the UK, as Camelot firmly believes. But it is unlikely ever to be the most
profitable. With the lottery's prizes, charitable contributions and tax
fixed by the government, profitability will depend on the operator's
efficiency. After the necessary heavy advertising, a meagre margin of just
2-3 per cent may be attainable, making volume critical.
Even if wildly popular, there will be a limit to investment returns. Oflot's
role will surely be to divert 'excessive' profits into the coffers of more
worthy causes.

FT  02 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Rally in bonds brings solid
rise in blue chips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
BUOYED by a rally in the bond market - even though it was inspired by
bearish news from the nation's purchasing managers - US share prices posted
solid gains in moderate trading yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.99 at 3,581.11. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 2.35 firmer at 461.28, while
the Amex composite finished up 1.20 at 461.59, a new record high, and the
Nasdaq composite up 0.45 at 763.23. Trading volume on the New York SE was
258m shares.
Prices opened modestly firmer, although the gains were not spread across the
board - secondary stocks, particularly those listed on the Nasdaq market,
were weak from the start. Blue-chips, however, began inching higher
mid-morning as soon as the bond market, which posted early losses, turned
around sharply, following the release of the September National Association
of Purchasing Management's report.
It showed that the NAPM's index of nationwide manufacturing activity rose
from 49.3 per cent in August to 49.7 per cent - a smaller increase than Wall
Street had expected. The news, while not positive for stocks, buoyed
fixed-income investors, and helped bond prices stage a big rally. By early
afternoon the 30-year bond, which had been down half a point at one stage,
was up  19/32 at 103, and the yield was down to 5.979 per cent.
Stock market investors chose to focus on falling bond yields, and not the
weak NAPM report, and share prices moved steadily higher for the rest of the
day. Equity market sentiment was probably also helped by the day's other
economic figures - on August factory orders and leading indicators - which
were both better than expected.
Among individual stocks, cyclicals were in demand. International Paper
climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 61 1/4 in early trading, before dropping back
to end up Dollars  1/4 , Caterpillar added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 80 1/4 ,
General Motors firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 42 1/2 , and General Electric
rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 95 7/8 . By early afternoon Morgan Stanley's
Cyclical Index was up 2.52 at 283.74.
Higher oil prices boosted oil company shares. Texaco rose Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 68 7/8 , Chevron put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 98 3/8 , Phillips
Petroleum added Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 35 1/8 and British Petroleum rose
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 60.
Declining interest rates lifted bank stocks. BankAmerica rose Dollars 1 to
Dollars 45, Chase Manhattan added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 37 3/8 , Chemical
firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 45 1/8 , and Citicorp rose Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 38 3/8 .
Profit-takers moved into Paramount Communications, down Dollars 1 to Dollars
77 7/8 before the next move in the bid battle.
Canada
TORONTO ended the week on a losing note, falling slightly in quiet trading.
The composite index fell 2.39 points, or 0.06%, to 3,988.22. The index was
up about 6 points on the week.

FT  02 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Individual stories move shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIVIDUAL stories moved share prices yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS featured interest in Rhone-Poulenc, down FFr5.00 at FFr159.50, after
the group announced that it was to buy out the outstanding minorities in its
51 per cent owned pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Institut Merieux.
Mr Michael Woodcock, French analyst at Nikko Europe, commented that while
this was a positive move for Rhone-Poulenc, reinforcing its position in the
health care sector, the increase of some 18 per cent of its equity in the
process was likely to be mildly dilutive.
He added that the group's position in the privatisation timetable, currently
second to BNP, could be jeopardised because of the new share issue.
The CAC-40 index rose 2.09 to 2,116.72, up 1.1 per cent on the week, in a
session interrupted by technical problems.
FRANKFURT closed the week with the gains it achieved on Monday, the DAX
index falling 3.62 to 1,912.09 on the session, a five-day rise of 1.4 per
cent. Turnover fell from DM5.1bn to DM4.4bn.
However, prices picked up in the post-bourse, the Ibis-indicated DAX index
closing the afternoon at 1,920.69.
Hopes of more encouraging money supply indications for September were one
reason, and Wall Street's early performance gave dealers another excuse for
a general mark-up.
Specific news in the afternoon included Lufthansa's confirmation that it had
reached a co-operation agreement with a US air carrier, thought last night
to be United Airlines, after a lengthy search. In the post-bourse, the
shares were quoted up to DM4 higher than their official, DM1612 close.
ZURICH edged ahead in cautious trading, the SMI index adding 8.5 to 2,481.6,
or 1.5 per cent higher on the week.
Institutional selling left SMH SFr18.50 or 8 per cent lower at SFr212, after
the watchmaker warned that poor Christmas sales would leave profits flat for
the year.
Swissair, a cumulative 13.8 per cent lower during September, picked up SFr20
or 3 per cent to SFr675 after the latest Alcazar announcement.
However, Mr Roland Leutenegger of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich noted that the
statement contained little that was new and he suggested that the rise was a
technical reaction to the recent fall.
Swiss Re rose SFr5 to SFr3,320 ahead of its 1992 results, announced after
the bourse closed.
In the event, a 5.6 per cent rise in group net profit for 1992 was in line
with expectations, said Mr Kishore Banger of James Capel, who expects
earnings growth averaging 24 per cent a year during the next three years.
Schindler added SFr90 to SFr6,190 as it forecast a rise of at least 10 per
cent in 1993 group net profit.
AMSTERDAM saw a strong rise in KLM, founded on news that progress had been
made in talks between European airlines over the Alcazar link-up, the shares
rising Fl 1.90 or 5 per cent to Fl 37.00.
The CBS Tendency index closed up 0.7 at 125.2, up 1.1 per cent on the week.
Nedlloyd retreated a further Fl 1.00 to Fl 39.20, after a 70 cents loss on
Thursday. The transport group has seen consistent selling in recent days and
has fallen some 19 per cent in value since reaching a year's high on
September 3.
MILAN gave ground, as profits were taken in the telecommunications sector
after the sharp rises over recent months. The Comit index slipped 1.72 to
594.31 for a 1.3 per cent rise over the week.
Stet, the holding company shed L54 to L4,320 while Sip, the domestic
telephone operator was L35 lower at L3,688.
Fiat continued to pick up some of Wednesday's losses, rising L90 to L5,790:
Rinascente remained suspended, with analysts becoming increasingly impatient
for more information about its disposal.
CSFB said it was maintaining its buy recommendation on Ifil, which also
continued suspended.
Montedison, L21 higher at L765, attracted speculative interest rose
following its announcement of improved operating profits; Ferruzzi rose L8
to L324.
On the opposite tack, Italcementi shed L230 to L9,260 after it revealed that
production fell 20.1 per cent in the first half.
VIENNA's ATX index gained 5.81 to 968.68, but Austrian Airlines fell Sch40
to Sch1,810 after saying that it would not make a decision on co-operation
until mid-October, in spite of comments from its potential Alcazar partner,
Swissair, that a deal was near.
OSLO's North Sea oil stocks pushed the bourse higher after an erratic week,
optimism here after Opec nations agreed to curb output making up for a mixed
performance elsewhere. The all-share index ended 2.81 firmer at 547.64, up
0.5 per cent on the week, in turnover of NKr453m.
ISTANBUL moved into positive territory once again after two days of declines
as investors took profits.
The composite index rose 872.7 or 5.8 per cent to 15,952.4, for a gain of 6
per cent on the week. Turnover was estimated at TL1,070bn.
Renewed interest in equities has emerged following a slight easing in
interest rates this week and expectations that further cuts are likely in
the near future. Eregli rose TL350 or 8.7 per cent to TL4,350.

JOHANNESBURG staged a partial, intraday recovery from early fears of
continued strength in the financial rand. Gold's brief flurry above Dollars
355 an ounce offered mild support to that sector, which confined its fall to

FT  02 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed concerns over the severity of the price war among Britain's
supermarkets once again undermined confidence in the food retail sector,
although there were also hints of a change in sentiment in some quarters.
But share prices reacted first and foremost to further worries over growing
pressure on margins, after Hoare Govett lopped Pounds 10m off its profit
forecast for Asda. Other brokers were believed to have followed suit among
talk of tough competitive pressures in several regions of the UK.
Asda shares slipped 2 3/4 to 55p in turnover of 19m. J Sainsbury slumped 13
1/2 to 416p, upset also by the imminent arrival of US warehouse clubs to the
UK. Tesco fell 4 1/2 to 193p and Argyll 6 1/2 to 288p.
However, there were also hints from certain brokers that recent falls in an
already battered sector have been overdone.
At least one broker yesterday was shifting to a more positive stance and
another is believed to be preparing to turn positive next week.
Intriguingly, there is talk that the unnamed broker may use a large warrant
issue as a means of encouraging clients back into the sector.
Shares in composite insurers traded strongly, after a clutch of brokers
turned more positive on the sector and whispers of impending corporate
activity did the rounds.
SG Warburg advised investors to move from 'underweight to neutral' in
anticipation of good third-quarter results.
Robert Fleming issued a bullish circular saying: 'Improving
fundamentals-real GDP growth and positive real bond yields also make the UK
composites look attractive, especially in comparison to some European
insurers.'
Credit Lyonnais was also reported to have issued a recommendation, with
added spice coming from talk of an imminent bid in the sector. Commercial
Union advanced 17 to 630p, while Guardian Royal Exchange put on 5 to 218p,
and Royal Insurance gained 15 to 320p. General Accident rose 18 to 719p.
Shares in Aberdeen Trust edged a penny forward to 60 1/2 p, after Panmure
Gordon crossed 2 1/2 m shares at 59 3/4 p.
Standard Chartered jumped 24 to 968p after news late in the session that it
had received Pounds 25.9m in settlement of its claim against National
Housing Bank of India.
This week's Opec output agreement continued to underpin the oil sector. BP,
a strong feature for most of the week, gained another 5 to 329 1/2 p, while
Shell Transport firmed 6 to 676p.
Enterprise Oil, which also benefited from broker's recommendations earlier
in the week gained 12 to 470p. Strong two-way business in Lasmo brought
turnover of 16m as the shares edged a half-penny forward to 145 1/2 p.
With consumer stocks largely friendless yesterday, utility stocks found some
support, although waters were undone by a dividend cut from NatWest
Securities. The broker slashed its dividend growth forecast for five stocks
 -Anglian, North West, South West, Severn Trent and Yorkshire - from 9 per
cent to 7.5 per cent. Thames suffered a similar fate last month. NatWest
said lower inflation and cautious comments from the companies had
contributed to the cuts.
Anglian slipped a penny to 526p, North West the same to 511p, South West 5
to 560p and Severn Trent 2 to 531p. Yorkshire was steady at 538p, as was
Thames at 536p.
Chemicals group Courtaulds fell 20 to 496p as Smith New Court reduced its
forecast for 1994 profits to Pounds 182m, from Pounds 195m. The forecast,
which has now fallen in line with that of other analysts, was attributed to
worsening competitive conditions. Mr Charles Lambert at Smith suggested that
Courtaulds's 'steady growth image was tarnished'.
Shares in motors group Avon Rubber fell 5p ahead of speculation that
analysts' reports were unfavourable.
The fallout from this week's hectic activity in the drinks sector impacted
on several stocks. Whitbread, seen as the chief casualty in the battle for
Chef and Brewer, lost 7 to 520p. Drinks analysts said that the failure to
land the pub and restaurant chain, together with scepticism over whether it
will now buy Forte's Harvester group, have put hopes of a share
restructuring on the back burner. Industry watchers had been optimistic that
the group would have changed its archaic share system if it were to make a
big acquisition. Meanwhile, Forte continued to suffer from Thursday's poor
results, closing 6 down at 221p.
Scottish and Newcastle, the eventual buyer of Chef and Brewer, gained 5 to
467p. NatWest Securities moved from a sell to a hold on the stock and now
believe it has the ability to take market share from its big rivals,
although teething problems remain.
Turnover in Hanson topped 24m and the shares bounced 3 3/4 to 253 1/2 p.
Hoare Govett was reported to be positive.

FT  02 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAT hit by broker revisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWIFT reaction by UK analysts currently visiting BAT's US insurance
operation sent the shares tumbling after analysts phoned home with gloomy
views on near-term prospects. By the close, the shares had lost 20 to 462p,
making them the day's biggest losers among FT-SE 100 stocks, as volume rose
to 5.1m.
Researchers at James Capel appeared to be the first off the mark. Early in
the day the broker was reported to have downgraded 1994 profit expectations
from Pounds 2.05bn to Pounds 2.01bn. Hoare Govett was advising investors to
'take profits'.
Dealers cited the poorer than expected performance at Farmers, the group's
California-based insurance group, possible increases in US taxes on tobacco,
and the continuing price war with arch-rival US group Philip Morris.
Further profit downgrades are expected next week when the analysts return
from the US trip.

FT  02 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Good trading volume as account ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONFIDENT start to the final quarter of the year was restrained somewhat
yesterday by the manoeuvres traditionally associated with the end of the
trading account in the UK equity market.
Although the stock market ended only slightly firmer on the day, stock index
futures returned to a good premium against cash and a rash of corporate
activity appeared to indicate underlying con-fidence. Traders identified a
good volume of overseas interest.
A strong opening on Wall Street, 16 Dow points up in UK hours, helped a late
rally in the London market. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at
3,039.3, a net 1.8 higher on the day. Earlier, the Footsie had struggled to
hold its overnight level after early, futures-inspired, weakness had taken
the Footsie down to the 3,026 area.
The Footsie was also hit by a fall in BAT Industries, as London brokers on a
US visit phoned their offices to downgrade the blue chip tobacco and
financial services group.
But oil shares continued to benefit from the Opec agreement and firmer crude
prices and there were buyers for the pharmaceuticals, capital goods and
financial sectors.
Investors have turned away from the consumer areas, disenchanted by recent
trading results from such leading names as Forte and Tesco.
However, a range of brokerage re-ratings and share placings appeared to
confirm that the institutions remain confident in the UK stock market
outlook.
At last night's close, the Footsie was just over 34 points higher on the
week and also on the trading account period. Investors have been encouraged
this week by the calmer news from Russia, but still seek signs that company
results are reflecting economic recovery.
Traders expressed confidence in market prospects for the fourth quarter.
Seaq volume of 636.9m shares yesterday, of which around 56 per cent was in
non-Footsie stocks, compared with 695.1m in the previous session.
Retail volume of Pounds 1.61bn on Thursday was affected by end-of-quarter
portfolio shuffling but also indicated a strong underlying interest from the
investment institutions.
Government bonds featured news of the issue of an Pounds 800m tranche of
stock dated 2011. Seasoned bonds showed little change in quiet trading
yesterday.

FT  02 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets yesterday recovered the good form shown earlier this
week, the December contract on the FT-SE 100 Index returning to a 32 point
premium against cash, as the market braced itself for the final trading
quarter of the year, writes Terry Byland. However, trading volume was less
impressive, with the December contract trading only 7,773 contracts. The day
opened with a sell-off which took December down to 3,045, depressing the
underlying blue chips also.
Most of the business came from the locals or independent traders. The big
institutions had completed their end-of-quarter operations and were content
to wait until Monday when the new equity market account opens; fair value on
the futures, still at 24 points yesterday, drops to around 21 on Monday,
when dividend flows will depress the FT-SE Index by about 2.5.
Business in the FT-SE traded option halved to 7,207 contracts in a market
also quieter, at a total of 20,776 against 28,864. Asda (1250) headed the
individual stocks list.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Late leap for pound
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POUND jumped almost a pfennig against the D-Mark and more than a cent
against the dollar in late London trading.
The surprise leap was prompted mainly by technical factors. Investors in
D-Marks and dollars sold both of these currencies for sterling as the
exchange rates hit stop-loss levels.
Analysts were reluctant to attribute the rise to a reappraisal of
fundamental sentiment towards sterling.
'I would love to say that this is a reappraisal of the pound, but it is
really a technical forward move,' said Mr Marc Hendrix of Swiss Bank.
As a result, many analysts expect the pound to open weaker on Monday. It
closed last night at DM2.4550, up  3/4 of pfennig on the day. Against the
dollar it was a cent stronger at Dollars 1.5055.
Many dealers remain perplexed over the recent weakness of the pound.
Concerns appear to revolve around rather hazy political concerns and
prospects for a rate cut before the end of the year. Yesterday there were
some jitters following a rumour that extracts from Lady Thatcher's memoirs
in the Sunday newspapers would severely criticise Mr John Major, the current
prime minister.
But as one analysts said: 'I don't find any of that particularly
conclusive.'
The dollar lost a pfennig off the day's gains after US data did not live up
to expectations.
Much of the data fell short of economists' forecasts and dashed hopes that
the market would finally receive signs of solid US economic activity.
The dollar closed at DM1.6310 compared with the previous day's close of
DM1.6365. During the day it tested DM1.6430 ahead of the release of the
figures.
The Belgian National Bank responded to market rumours that Belgium was
allowing the franc to slip against the D-Mark by saying that there was 'no
question' of changing central bank policy.
'There is no change at all in the policy of the bank. There is no question
of letting the Belgian franc float,' said the bank.
It cut its key central rate on Thursday by 10 basis points to 9.65 per cent
from 9.75 per cent, surprising financial markets because the franc had
weakened against the D-Mark.
The comments were widely interpreted as a response to rumours that
Luxembourg wants to break its link with the Belgian currency.
The Luxembourg authorities are worried that soft monetary policy in Belgium
will bring down the Luxembourg franc, something they cannot allow as much of
their income depends on foreign investments.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Tension eases
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK had to inject short-term funds into the cash-starved German
money markets yesterday, only a day after it had withdrawn a large tranche.
The move helped to ease the tight conditions hanging over the market from
the end-of-month liquidity shortage.
Early in the day call money had risen as high as 7.12 per cent, but after
the Bundesbank's move it dropped back to 6.95 per cent.
Dealers said the withdrawal on Thursday of some DM10bn of 'section-17' money
had raised tensions, coming after DM8.5bn was drained in the week's repo.
Wariness in the markets of early rate cuts were underpinned by comments from
Mr Hans Tietmeyer - who assumed the presidency of the Bundesbank yesterday -
that the authorities need to be cautious about inflation.
In the London money market the overnight lending rate moved as high as 9 per
cent in the early afternoon after only a small amount of cash was injected
into the system at lunch time.
But after the Bank of England relieved a Pounds 1.6bn shortage by Pounds
1.18bn in afternoon operations, the overnight rate drifted back to around 6
per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of Pounds 400m.
'It has been a long, volatile and quite confusing week,' said one discount
house trader. 'Liquidity has got a little polarised in the market and
activity has been quite hard to interpret.'
Generally, the market has been waiting for the Tory conference next week and
the Budget in November. Few in the market expect a rate cut to emerge from
the conference, but dealers are eager for hints as to what Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, intends to do on monetary policy.
It is also waiting to get a better measure of the new president of the
Bundesbank although few are expecting much to change.
'There are a lot of balls in the air, and I think most people are agnostic
at the moment,' said one trader. 'We are now in for a boring period with
wild days on the overnight.'
Short sterling came off the highs of the early part of the week. The
December contract traded for most of the day at around 94.35.
The three-month interbank rate finished the day at 5 31/32 -5 29/32 per
cent.

FT  02 OCT 93 / International Company News: Banesto unveils shake-up of
industrial portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANESTO, the big Spanish bank, yesterday announced a divestment in the steel
sector and plans to buy out minority shareholders in Corporacion Banesto,
the umbrella company for its industrial assets.
The bank said that it had reduced its stake in Acerinox, the profitable
stainless steel producer, from 35 per cent to 8 per cent, though a placement
with European and US producers lead-managed by JP Morgan Securities.
Banesto, which owns 85 per cent of Corporacion Banesto, plans a public share
offer for the outstanding 15 per cent of the industrial conglomerate. The
bid, worth Dollars 126m, is being made to gain full fiscal advantage. Under
Spanish tax laws, ownership in excess of 90 per cent allows the parent
institution to consolidate results.
The disposal of the Acerinox interests is the first Banesto divestment to be
managed by JP Morgan. It follows a wide-ranging agreement cemented with the
US investment bank earlier this year, and designed to raise Dollars 1.1bn in
capital. The steel disposal, for Dollars 213m, will give Banesto an
estimated capital gain of Dollars 28m.
Under central bank guidelines, domestic financial institutions have to
reduce industrial holdings in their accounts to 20 per cent of the capital
by 1998. Before the Acerinox disposal, Banesto had a capital-to-industrial
holding ratio of around 39 per cent.
Acerinox, which controls 65 per cent of the domestic stainless steel market
and is the fifth-largest producer in Europe, posted net profits of Dollars
23.6m in the first six months of this year.
Banesto is offering Pta2,500 for each outstanding share in its industrial
conglomerate - a price which represents a 25 per cent premium on the average
share value over the past six months, and is Pta425 up on the Thursday
closing price of Pta2,075. The shares were suspended before the market
opened yesterday.
The minority interests are widely distributed, save for a 3 per cent stake
owned by AGF, the French insurance group.
Analysts said Banesto could be 'tidying up' its control over the industrial
group as a preparation for further disposals. Over the past two years, the
bank has sold the refinery and petrol distributor Petromed, its combined
cement interests, and a stake in the insurance company Union y Fenix.
JP Morgan manages the Corsair Fund, an equity port-folio which owns 7.9 per
cent of Banesto.

FT  02 OCT 93 / International Company News: Swissair seeks to calm merger
fears
</HEADLINE>

SWISSAIR said yesterday that the proposed collaboration with KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Austrian Airlines could add
SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.1bn) to the combined profits of the four companies after
a three-year start-up period. The extra profits would come from higher
revenues and lower costs, it said.
The Swiss national airline said talks on the collaboration, called the
Alcazar project, had reached an 'intensive stage', with the partners close
to agreement on several fundamental points. It hoped that a memorandum of
understanding would be signed 'in the next few weeks', and that operations
could begin early next year.
It pointed out, however, that before operations began, an integration
agreement would need to be concluded and approved by the companies'
shareholders.
The airline appears to have issued the statement mainly to reassure
shareholders, who have been unnerved by a number of recent speculative
reports. In particular, concern has been expressed in Swiss financial
circles that Swissair might be undervalued relative to the other companies
in the proposed structure.
The plan is that Swissair, KLM and SAS would each have 30 per cent of a
centralised management company. Austrian Airlines would have 10 per cent.
However, Swissair noted that 'independent valuations of the four partners
have suggested different proportions of relative worth. Some forms of offset
will therefore be required. These are currently being developed.' It added
that it was 'committed to the interests of its shareholders in all such
activities'.
Swissair said the offsets could include removing some of its subsidiary
businesses - such as catering, hotels and aircraft maintenance - from the
combined group.
The airline also sought to allay fears of large numbers of compulsory
redundancies, saying that a 10 per cent overall reduction in jobs was
expected and would be borne 'in equal proportions by all four partners'.
Mr Jan Carlzon, the top SAS negotiator on the Alcazar project, said this
week the proposed four-way airline alliance could hit its target of being
ready for operation in April next year. However, he pointedly refused to
give any guarantees of a successful outcome.
'If we do not resolve the outstanding critical questions there will be no
deal,' he told a Swedish newspaper yesterday.
Meanwhile, SAS completed a reshuffle of its senior management following Mr
Carlzon's recent resignation as president and chief executive. He quit last
Monday to concentrate on the Alcazar project.
Mr Jan Reinas, Mr Carlzon's temporary successor, is also to take over as
chief operating officer from Mr Kjell Fredheim, a key Carlzon lieutenant who
will now head corporate development. Mr Steffen Harpoeth has already quit as
deputy president, effectively completing the removal of Mr Carlzon's team
from the top echelon of SAS, which has seen mounting losses this year.
Mr Carlzon himself has moved out of SAS headquarters in the Stockholm
suburbs, and into an office in the city.

FT  02 OCT 93 / International Company News: Usinor slides further into red

<TEXT>
THE CRISIS in the European steel industry prompted a sharp deterioration in
results at Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steel group. First-half
net losses rose to FFr2.59bn (Dollars 455m) from FFr200m in the first six
months of 1992.
The downturn reflected a continued deterioration in demand and prices for
most steel products in Europe. Sales fell 17.4 per cent to FFr39.74bn, the
group said.
The current six months were unlikely to show any significant improvement
over the first half, it warned. Steel industry analysts forecast that group
losses would continue to mount, and that the net deficit for the full year
would be in the order of FFr5bn.
The half-year results included an exceptional surplus of FFr2.4bn resulting
from a change in accounting methods.
The group said the change brought its accounting methods in line with other
European and US steel companies.
The exceptional gain, however, was offset by a FFr2.2bn exceptional charge
arising from provisions for the group's Saarstahl subsidiary.
Usinor Sacilor said that in spite of the weak results, there had been some
encouraging developments in the first half. The group reduced net debt to
FFr27bn from FFr29.5bn at the end of last year, and forecast a continued
reduction in borrowings.
This would be achieved through the proceeds of a planned sale of its
majority stake in LME, a rolled steel operation, and the sale of shares in
J&amp;L Specialty Products, its US stainless steel operation.

halve forecast

<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Materials, the metals and cement company, yesterday blamed the
yen's rapid rise and the domestic economic downturn as it halved its pre-tax
profit forecast, to Y4bn (Dollars 37.7m) for the year ending March.
Most Japanese companies have cut forecasts for the first half to September,
and for the full year, as hopes fade for an economic recovery. Some
companies fear the economy will remain weak until late next year.
Mitsubishi Materials also halved, to Y2bn, its pre-tax forecast for the
first half, compared with a result of Y6.04bn in the same period last year.
Sales in the half are expected to total Y340bn, down from Y377.1bn, while
sales for the full year are forecast at Y700bn, against Y743.3bn.
The fall in sales reflects the weak demand from leading Japanese
manufacturers, including the car and electronics industries. These have been
hit hardest by the yen's strength, and are continuing to reduce production
targets.
Mitsubishi Materials, formed through the merger of Mitsubishi Metal and
Mitsubishi Mining and Cement, had hoped that a revival of demand from the
construction industry would boost profits in the second half. However,
construction orders have fallen sharply in the past two months.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals group, yesterday confirmed plans to
raise its stake in Institut Merieux, a producer of human and animal
vaccines, from 51 per cent to 100 per cent, under an agreement with the
subsidiary's minority shareholders.
The agreement, which requires approval by the two companies' boards and
shareholders, will allow Rhone-Poulenc to integrate Institut Merieux more
fully into its healthcare division.
It could also help create a stable shareholder base for the chemicals group,
after the sale of the government's stake in the company.
The French government, which currently holds about 43 per cent of
Rhone-Poulenc, is due to sell its stake within the next few months as part
of its ambitious privatisation programme.
Under the terms of the deal announced yesterday, Rhone-Poulenc will exchange
77 group shares for every five shares in Institute Merieux.
As a result, the 16 per cent stake in Institut Merieux currently held by the
Merieux family, and the 14 per cent stake held by the Dassault family, will
be transformed into shares of about 5 per cent and 4 per cent respectively
in Rhone-Poulenc. The balance of the shares in Institut Merieux are
controlled by the public and the Pasteur Institute.
Rhone-Poulenc said the merger should not have a significant dilutative
effect on income per share. It said the capital increase would be
compensated by the improved income resulting from the elimination of
minority interests relating to Institut Merieux.
At the end of August, the market capitalisation of Institut Merieux stood at
FFr13.2bn (Dollars 2.3bn). In the first half of this year, the company
reported net profits of FFr254m, more than double the FFr113m recorded in
the first six months of 1992. Sales in the first half of 1993 were
FFr3.37bn.
Most of the company's sales come from human health products such as vaccines
for tuberculosis and influenza. Animal health products account for about 40
per cent of turnover.

FT  02 OCT 93 / International Company News: Armco to take Dollars 205m
charge

<TEXT>
ARMCO, the US steel group, said yesterday it would take a Dollars 205m
pre-tax charge against third-quarter earnings to cover the sale of several
businesses.
The company has completed the sale of part of its Worldwide Grinding Systems
unit to Leggett &amp; Platt, its partner in the joint venture, and announced an
agreement to sell the remainder.
The move is part of Armco's strategy of concentrating on specialty steels.
The group has been steadily selling non-strategic businesses after years of
being one of the most diversified US steel companies.
Armco now focuses on manufacturing specialty flat rolled steel, grinding
systems, carbon steel and fabricated products.
It has completed the sale of Worldwide Grinding Systems' 50 per cent stake
in several wire-drawing operations, for Dollars 33m in cash. The rest of the
business is expected to be sold to Bain Capital, a Boston-based investment
firm, in partnership with members of the unit's management, for Dollars 80m,
excluding post-closing adjustments. The sale agreement is expected to be
completed by the end of the year.
Worldwide Grinding Systems produces grinding balls, rods, castings and
process control systems for the mining industry. It also produces
high-carbon wire rods. The business had sales of Dollars 400.4m last year
and underlying operating income of Dollars 10.1m, stripping out special
charges of Dollars 19.1m and income from joint ventures of Dollars 13.8m.
Armco expects gross cash proceeds of nearly Dollars 170m from the Worldwide
Grinding divestment, and from the previously-announced sale of its Brazilian
strip operations. About Dollars 24m will be used to retire debt and other
obligations associated with Worldwide Grinding.
The company posted a loss of Dollars 25.2m, including extraordinary items,
in the 1992 third quarter. It said Dollars 150m of its 1993 third-quarter
special charge would cover the disposal of a number of other businesses in
its steel and fabricated products interests.

Australia goldminer
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier, yesterday emerged as a
surprise investor in Bendigo Mining, a small Australian goldminer which
controls one of the country's most historically productive fields.
Sir James gave the gold price a fillip earlier this year when he sold a
stake in Denver-based Newmont Mining to Mr George Soros, the international
investor.
Bendigo Mining, based in Victoria, announced that the bulk of a ADollars 10m
(USDollars 6.5m) share placement was being taken up by interests associated
with either Sir James, or with Consolidated Press, the private company
controlled by Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman.
Bendigo is issuing 20m new shares at 50 cents each to raise ADollars 10m.
Yesterday it said Sir James would take 7.5m shares, at a cost of ADollars
3.75m, while Consolidated Press would take a similar number. The remaining
5m shares would be sold to institutions. The purchase will give Sir James a
5.3 per cent stake in the company. Consolidated Press will hold a similar
interest.
Mr Packer had been a Bendigo shareholder previously. He sold his former
interest in June.
Sir James and Mr Packer are friends, and have had business associations in
the past. Mr Packer, for example, was an important figure in the
Goldsmith-led consortium which mounted a Pounds 13bn (Dollars 19.4bn) bid
for the UK's BAT Industries in 1989, while Mr Al Dunlap, managing director
of Consolidated Press until last February, previously worked at Sir James'
Crown Zellerbach timber group in the US.
Historically, Bendigo is Australia's second most productive goldfield,
eclipsed only by Kalgoorlie's famous 'Golden Mile'. However, mining halted
at the Victorian field in the 1950s.

CLARINS, the French skincare company, saw net profits fall 22.5 per cent to
FFr100.8m (Dollars 17.7m) in the first six months, from FFr130m in the
corresponding period last year. It blamed sluggishness in the cosmetics
market, adverse exchange rates and high launch costs.
The company, which has expanded rapidly in recent years, mainly through its
export markets, also anticipated an overall reduction in net profits for the
full year. However, it hoped the rate of decline would be lower than in the
first half.
Consolidated sales rose 3.6 per cent to FFr999.1m, from FFr964.4m in the
first half. However, the depressed economy held sales growth below the
group's expectations.
Profitability was further depressed by the cost incurred in the launch of
Angel, the new Thierry Mugler perfume, and by the impact of the fall in
short-term interest rates on Clarins' financial structure.
The company was also affected by the relative strength of the franc against
other currencies.
This trimmed its interim net profits growth by an estimated 6.7 per cent.
However, Clarins said that it was determined to continue with its long-term
investment strategy, in spite of the difficult economic environment.

METALL Mining has dropped a public share offer intended to finance the
CDollars 171m (USDollars 131.5m) acquisition of its German parent's European
copper smelting asset. Sharply declining copper prices are behind the
decision.
Metall is the main Canadian-based mining and exploration arm of
Metallgesellschaft, and has international mining interests.
Instead of the public offer, Metall has issued 15.9m shares at CDollars
10.75 each to the parent in exchange for the smelting interests. This raises
Metallgesellschaft's interest in Metall to 68 per cent from 60.5 per cent.

FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Shanks shares fall as director retires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company fell 8 per cent to
156p yesterday following the surprise news that Mr Alastair Fowler, finance
director, has taken early retirement with effect from the end of September.
The share price fall follows the downgrading of profits forecasts by a
number of brokers after visits to the company last week before it went into
its close period.
Mr Roger Hewitt, chief executive, said that Mr Fowler had been discussing
early retirement for a number of months and that there was nothing sinister
behind the announcement.
Shanks' share price has halved since a high of 319p in September 1991 when
the waste sector still attracted a residue of its late 1980s premium rating.
In January that year Shanks bought Rechem, the hazardous waste disposal
company, but was widely thought to have paid a full price.
Then in March 1991, Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, placed its 11
per cent stake in the company when the shares were trading at the equivalent
of 278p.
In late September that year, Rechem issued a warning that it would not be
able to meet its own ambitious earnings growth targets.
Mr Hewitt said yesterday that Mr Fowler, a Scot, was feeling the pressure of
commuting between his family in Glasgow and Aylesbury, where the group had
increasingly moved its corporate centre since the retirement of Mr Peter
Runciman as chairman last year.
In June Shanks reported a 62 per cent fall in full year profits, from Pounds
27.1m to Pounds 10.2m, after heavy losses in its construction division.
The group was forced to make a Pounds 19.3m provision to cover
reorganisation of the division.
'There is no other issue lurking behind this announcement', Mr Hewitt said.
The problems in the construction division, 'may have hastened the desire (of
Mr Fowler) to go early', he said.
Some analysts wondered why the company had given no warning of Mr Fowler's
departure and had not named a permanent successor.
Mr Michael Rundle, commercial manager, has been appointed acting finance
director.

FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Repaid loan notes boost Norex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOREX, the financial services group, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 31.6m in
the year to June 30, against restated losses of Pounds 991,000, thanks to a
Pounds 23.8m contribution from the redemption of secured loan notes.
Global Marine repaid the loan notes held by Norex America (NXA), in which
Norex has a 48 per cent stake, for a total of Dollars 99m gross, of which
Pounds 23.8m fell in the year.
Mr Kristian Siem, the Norwegian entrepreneur who is managing director of
Norex and chairman of NXA, said that Dollars 29m of the Dollars 99m was used
to repay bank loans.
New debt has been acquired in NXA and in April Dollars 111.4m was supplied
to Zapata Corporation of Houston, a provider of services to the oil and gas
industries, through a cash loan and share purchase.
Apart from the 48 per cent holding in NXA, which is involved in offshore rig
investments, Norex owns Horncastle Executive Travel, based in Newcastle, and
a 2 to 3 per cent stake in Lowndes Lambert, acquired when it sold Norex
Insurance Brokers and Norex Financial Planning to the insurance broker for
Pounds 8m gross.
Mr Siem said that over five years shareholders' equity had increased 15
times, from Dollars 5m to Dollars 80m. This was the aim of the company, he
said. 'It is asset appreciation-led, not specially concerned with income.'
In spite of the need to preserve capital, it is proposing to pay a
maintained 2p dividend.
Earnings per share were 166.6p (losses 18.5p).

FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Wescol Pounds 30,000 in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION to focus on steel fabrication and construction enabled Wescol
Group to report profits of Pounds 30,000 for the year to July 31 against
losses of Pounds 2.49m.
The USM-quoted Halifax-based company also announced the raising of Pounds
2.94m through a rights issue, the issue of shares to Lloyds Bank and the
proposed reduction of the share premium account.
Turnover fell from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 15.2m, which included Pounds
39,000 (Pounds 1.93m) from discontinued activities. Sales of continuing
activities rose 5.4 per cent achieved in very competitive trading but helped
by a reduction in the overall capacity of the steel construction industry,
said the company.
Earnings per share were 0.6p, against losses of 21.6p.
Mr Peter Price, the chairman, said that while the results benefited from
lower interest rates - finance charges fell to Pounds 400,000 (Pounds
476,000) - high borrowings, following the losses of the past two years,
imposed a heavy burden.
In the rights issue 14m shares are being offered on a 4-for-3 basis at 15p
each to raise a net Pounds 1.94m. The issue is underwritten by British Linen
Bank with Wise Speke as brokers.
Lloyds Bank is subscribing for 6.67m shares at 15p to raise Pounds 1m
providing the rights issue raises not less than Pounds 1.94m. The cash will
be used to reduce borrowings.
Following the cut in debt Lloyds has also agreed to provide overdraft
facilities of Pounds 1.2m and a medium term loan of Pounds 1m.
Shareholders are being asked to approve a reduction of Pounds 1.69m in the
share premium account to cover the deficit on the profit and loss account
and the resumption of dividends.

FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Scottish TV shares fall despite rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INCREASE in programme sale and services was behind a 42 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits at Scottish Television, the independent television
contractor.
On turnover up 12 per cent at Pounds 64m (Pounds 57.1m), including Pounds
22m (Pounds 9.5m) from programme sales and services, pre-tax profits for the
first half of 1993 were Pounds 3.13m (Pounds 2.2m).
However the shares lost 42p to close at 436p.
Competition from Channel Four for advertising had contributed to the
company's share of ITV advertising revenue falling from 5.5 per cent to 5.2
per cent.
Among its subsidiaries the programme production company had an excellent
year but Pauline Hyde and Associates saw profits all but eliminated while
maintaining turnover.
There were also losses at GMTV, the breakfast station. While the station was
trying to ensure there was no further significant loss in the second half,
STV said it was providing for its expected share of losses over the year.
It said the full year would be affected by losses at GMTV and Pauline Hyde
but the strength of the core television business should enable profits to
continue rising.
Earnings were 5.84p (2.88p). The interim dividend is being raised to 2.1563p
(1.725p).

FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: ICL UK chief to step down next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Gardner, chairman of ICL UK and one of the Japanese-owned computer
company's top four executives, is stepping down from his responsibilities
and moving to a part time role early next year.
The move, which had not been expected, will fuel speculation over a
successor to Mr Peter Bonfield, ICL's chairman and chief executive, who has
been in charge of the company since 1984.
Mr Bonfield, 49, has been given much of the credit for transforming a
crisis-ridden lame duck into Europe's most consistently profitable computer
manufacturer.
He began his career with Texas Instruments, however, and is known to want to
work again in the US. He has given assurances that he will not leave ICL
until it is floated on the UK stock market.
At the beginning of the year ICL appointed three group executive directors
to take charge of the main business sectors. Mr Gardner, 51, was given
services including manufacturing and outsourcing. Mr Ninian Eadie, 56, has
charge of volume products including personal computers and Mr Richard
Livesey-Haworth, 47, manages industry solutions including retail and
financial systems.
It had been anticipated that Mr Bonfield's successor would be chosen from
this group.
Mr Gardner said that he had planned for some years to move to a part time
role after the age of 50. His chief objective, which he had achieved, had
been to make a success of ICL UK and he had no ambition to run the whole of
ICL.
He would remain associated with the company and work with Mr Bonfield on
special projects. He would also work directly with Fujitsu.
Mr Gardner's role as head of services and as a member of the executive
director's group will be taken by Mr Paul Whitwam, 48, who has been
responsible for ICL's operations outside western Europe and the Americas.
No date has been set for the flotation though financial advisers have been
appointed. If market conditions improve, it could be within two years.

FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Advance to Pounds 2m at Horace Clarkson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Horace Clarkson, the shipping and insurance broking group, reported an
advance in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2m, for the six
months to June 30.
The increase was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 22.8m.
Earnings per share came out at 4.3p (3.5p) and the interim dividend is
raised to 0.75p (0.5p) per share.
The directors said the shipping business had produced a very satisfactory
performance, with profits up by Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.2m, while a decline in
the insurance division's brokerage had been partly offset by cost savings.
The company also announced the appointments of Mr Alan Brooks and Mr Robert
Ward as additional directors.
Mr Brooks, previously a director of BPB Industries, will serve in a
non-executive capacity while Mr Ward, who was finance director of the
shipbroking arm, would succeed Mr Brian Burns as the group's finance
director.

FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: NBC buys control of Super Channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NBC, the US national broadcaster, yesterday confirmed that it had bought a
majority stake in Super Channel, the UK-based satellite channel which beams
general programmes all over Europe.
The stake has been bought from the Marcucci family of Lucca in Italy, who
have controlled the channel, originally set up by the ITV companies, for
more than five years.
Mr Tom Rogers, NBC executive vice president and president of NBC cable, said
yesterday the move reflected the US broadcaster's determination to grow 'by
expanding its presence outside the US and by diversifying into cable and new
media domestically'.
Mr Rogers said the aim would be to keep the general entertainment and news
format of Super Channel but to add more news and business programming,
including the NBC Nightly News and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.
The executive said the NBC strategy was to turn Super Channel, which is
available in 30m homes in western Europe and a further 26m homes through
rebroadcasting in eastern Europe and Russia, 'into a truly premium channel'.
Under the deal, which cost NBC about Pounds 40m, the American broadcaster
will have a majority stake and managerial control. Together with Credit
Lyonnaise it will have a total of 75 per cent. NBC yesterday declined to
give the exact split. Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group and other minority
shareholders will hold the remaining 25 per cent.
NBC executives said yesterday that the satellite television market in Europe
was exploding, and that they saw signs of significant growth in the
pan-European advertising market.
Mr Patrick Cox, managing director of NBC Europe, will become chairman of
Super Channel, but Mrs Marialina Marcucci will remain on the board.
The Marcuccis, whose interests include broadcasting and manufacturing in
Italy, intend to set up a significant independent television production
operation in the UK.

Carlisle Group, the property services company, reported pre-tax losses less
then half the previous year's figure at Pounds 344,000 for the six months to

The outcome was struck on turnover up by Pounds 705,000 to Pounds 2.69m and

Mr Jonathan Harris, chairman, said that in spite of the useful fillip given

FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat warns against rejecting PosTel
rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREYCOAT yesterday reinforced its backing for the controversial Pounds 120m
rescue bid by PosTel, the UK's largest pension fund, when it underlined the
risks of the deal being rejected next Friday in a letter to shareholders and
bondholders.
The letter, which included an up-to-date assessment of the value of
Greycoat's property in a forced sale, reinforced the company's earlier
assertion that a winding-up would leave nothing for the preference and
ordinary shareholders. It also said that the company has not had any
definitive offers from another bidder.
The letter also told shareholders it had sold its 6 per cent interest in
Victoria Plaza, the office development over Victoria Station. Its share of
the proceedings, which was Pounds 6m, has been used to repay the debt on the
property.
Several large preference shareholders continue to believe that the PosTel
bid undervalues their shares. Their objections are that:
The company is not facing a genuine threat of liquidation. Although PosTel
is considered unlikely to improve its offer, they believe that the
likelihood of another bidder emerging is strong. Some analysts believe
Greycoat could salvage its position through a rights issue.
This point is disputed by Greycoat. It points out that another bidder has
had several months since the PosTel deal was announced to come forward.
Also, it believed 'a conventional capital raising would not be feasible in
the present circumstances.'
Moreover, it might not have the time to put together an alternative rescue
package. The complex structure of Greycoat's financing means that there are
conflicting interests between the ordinary and preference shareholders, the
zero coupon bondholders and the Brittanic bond holders.
The recovery in the property market means that the value of Greycoat's
portfolio has been understated.
'My view is that the company is in better shaper than it has been for
years,' says Mr John Katz, a research consultant.
However, Greycoat believes that in the event of a forced sale all but one of
its properties would not share in the improvement in the property market of
the last six months.
The preference shareholders have been treated unduly harshly, compared with
other interest groups.
Insufficient information has been provided about the valuations of some of
Greycoat's property. Greycoat, however, argues that to give too much detail
about its buildings' valuations would not be in its shareholders' interests
if the buildings have to be sold.
The chance that shareholders will vote down the proposals next Friday is
very real. Substantial blocks of shareholders including Gruss Partners, the
US arbitrage house which holds 14 per cent of the preference shares and
Goldman Sachs, which owns 8 per cent of the preference shares, are thought
to be unhappy with the proposed deal. Another concern for Greycoat is that
the vote will only go ahead if sufficient bondholders and shareholders have
responded.
But Greycoat and PosTel remain optimistic that the protests will be shown to
be just posturing. They hope that voters will opt for the certainty of the
PosTel deal rather than risk everything on the hope of getting a better
outcome.

Shares of Dalepak Foods, the frozen foods and ready meals manufacturer,
slumped 45p to 125p yesterday after the company warned it expected to
break-even in the six months to October 31.
In the same period last year pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.6m. It said it
expected to make a profit for the year, but would not maintain its dividend
at last year's 6p.
The group had already been under pressure, warning in March about profits
for the April year-end, which were down at Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 3.93m).
It said yesterday that sales volumes and margins had fallen further since
then. In an attempt to counter that it was pushing up prices and cutting
costs. It said its new freezing plant, which had suffered commissioning
problems, was now working satisfactorily.

FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Capital &amp; Regional plans to float US
property interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL &amp; Regional, a USM-quoted property company, yesterday announced plans
to float off its US property interests as a publicly-traded Real Estate
Investment Trust.
The company expects to benefit from the deal because it will remove US debt
from its balance sheet and so reduce its gearing. In addition, the dividend
income from the REIT should significantly exceed the current profit from the
US group attributable to shareholders.
Moreover, the deal will diversify its US interests and put them in a large
entity which is capable of getting access to the capital markets.
Capital &amp; Regional yesterday filed a registration statement with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission which set out the proposed structure of
the offering.
The company is combining its US interests with those controlled by a
Chicago-based property investment group and a portfolio of industrial
investments acquired from an insurance company in order to give the REIT
sufficient scale.
The REIT expects to control a portfolio of 39 properties in Chicago,
totalling 5.9m sq ft, of which four, totalling 2.2m sq ft will be injected
by Capital &amp; Regional.
The REIT will also have options to acquire another four properties.
Capital &amp; Regional said it would own a significant minority interest in the
REIT after its flotation, which it will retain for at least three years.

FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: FKI expands in US with Dollars 103m buy -
First big acquisition since demerging from Babcock in 1989
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FKI, the electrical engineering group, yesterday announced its first big
acquisition since it demerged from Babcock International in the summer of
1989.
It is paying Dollars 102.5m (Pounds 66.5m) cash for the Truth hardware
division of SPX Corporation of the US.
Mr Bob Beeston, chief executive, described Truth as 'a perfect fit' with
FKI's hardware business.
Truth makes the hinges, operating and locking mechanisms for windows, doors
and skylights. It supplies more than 1,400 manufacturers and has almost 50
per cent of the North American market, which Mr Beeston estimated at some
Dollars 200m a year.
'It has good modern manufacturing facilities, and it is a business we are
very familiar with,' he said.
Truth, which has a warranted net asset value of not less than Dollars 35.4m,
made net operating profits of Dollars 10.2m on sales of Dollars 83.8m in
1992. FKI said the trading performance for the first eight months of this
year was well ahead of last year - a trend it expected to continue.
FKI will pay Dollars 95m on completion, with up to Dollars 7.5m of deferred
consideration payable over a period of up to five years, dependent on sales.
Mr Beeston said the group had committed borrowing available in US dollars at
interest of less than 4 per cent. He estimated net borrowings at the end of
the year would be Pounds 96m, giving the group gearing of 50 per cent,
compared with 30 per cent at the end of last year. Without the acquisition,
FKI would have ended the year with gearing of about 15 per cent.
FKI now operates five divisions - hardware, materials handling, automotive,
engineering and process control. The first three operate primarily in the
US.
Mr Beeston said the group had been looking for acquisitions in the
automotive division, but had not found the right company yet. His strategy
was to look for businesses with real strength in the markets they served so
that the group could improve margins through reduced costs and higher
purchasing power.
Earlier this week FKI bought VSI Fortress Security Hardware from VSI Donner
for Dollars 2.6m. This will add annual sales of Dollars 4m to FKI's US
hardware distribution company Belwith.

FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BCE Pounds 56,000 in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BCE Holdings, the USM-quoted distributor of snooker, billiards and pool
products, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 56,000 for the year to March 31.
The outcome compared with a profit of Pounds 34,000 last year and was struck
on turnover down from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 4.27m. Losses per share were
0.2p (0.2p earnings).
Mr David Fisher, chairman, said the group had ceased its lossmaking
manufacturing activities, the benefits of which would accrue in future
years.
He added that the reported upturn in the economy had yet to have an effect
in the sale of snooker products, and low consumer spending made any material
increase in arcade takings difficult to achieve, Mr Fisher said.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Uncertainty uber alles: The German mood three years after
unification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the night they announced the results of the competition to host the
Olympic games in the year 2000, a casual viewer of German television might
have been forgiven for thinking momentarily that Berlin, not Sydney, had
won.
There were scenes of a German crowd cheering ecstatically as the votes were
counted. Then the truth slowly dawned: they were not celebrating the fact
that Berlin had won, but that it had lost. It got only nine votes.
Two days later, the German press was conducting an agonised post mortem. How
could the German capital, host city for the 1936 Olympics, have done so
badly? 'Why are we Germans so unloved?' the popular Bild Zeitung deman-ded
in a banner headline.
One reason, it concluded, was precisely because Germans were so confused as
well as so quarrelsome. Nowhere else were members of the Int-ernational
Olympic Committee pel-ted with eggs, for a start.
The truth is that three years on from German unification - on October 3,
1990 - the country is still suffering from a crisis of identity. National
celebrations are planned for tomorrow in Saarbrucken, capital of the state
of Saarland, just over the border from France. They are likely to be a
subdued, unenthusiastic affair.
Unification has called all the comfortable old certainties of post-war
Germany into question: not just the assumption of prosperity, but the
consensual basis of the political system, the safety of Germany's place
locked into western Europe, the EC and the Nato alliance, the suppression of
its national identity in a European identity. None is yet fundamentally in
doubt, but all are suddenly open to debate.
The brief economic boom, as monetary union between the two halves of the
country caused an explosion of eastern consumer spending, allowed a unified
Germany to buck the trends in the world economy in 1990 and 1991. Now the
country is in its steepest downturn since the war, and it hurts.
The famed social partnership between workers and employers, a cornerstone of
Germany's post-war performance, is under unprecedented strain. For the first
time, the engineering industry employers have formally served notice
terminating their pay and holiday contracts with IG Metall, the engineering
workers' union, as a prelude to a determined assault on costs in the coming
wage round. The stage is set for a bitter war of attrition.
Suddenly the generosity of the German welfare state is also under attack, as
the demands of the east are placed upon it. Millions of new potential
claimants expect full benefits, although they are only beginning to pay
contributions.
Both government and opposition are languishing in the polls, as voters turn
to protest parties, or stay at home, to express disenchantment with the
post-unification world.
In Hamburg, the latest elections showed mass defections from all main
national parties. The ruling Social Democrats (SPD) dropped from 48 per cent
to 40. More dramatically, Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
saw its vote fall from 35 to 25 per cent.
Overall, more than 50 per cent of the city's electorate failed to support
the main national parties, either by staying at home, or protest voting. The
big winners were the Greens, who almost doubled their vote to 13.5 per cent,
and the previously unheard-of Statt Partei  - literally, the Instead of a
Party - which won eight seats in the city parliament with almost 6 per cent.
Neither the extreme right Republicans, nor their bitter hard-right rivals,
the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), won enough to get into the city assembly, but
between them they won a worrying 7.6 per cent of the vote.
Hamburg was a portent of protest-voting in next year's marathon election
year, with 19 separate national, state and local elections. Domestic issues
predominate, with internal security, the threat to jobs, the lack of housing
and immigration main themes.
The political leadership, including Mr Kohl, is trying to launch a national
debate on external issues to identify where Germany's national interests lie
and, indeed, to underline the close identity of the national interest with
European integration. For Mr Kohl, German unity and European union are two
sides of a single coin. But, for the general public, foreign policy in
general, and Europe in particular, seem far removed from their immediate
concerns.
If west Germans are seeing old certainties wobble, the upheaval they face is
nothing against the trauma of their east German compatriots.
The early euphoria of unification has evaporated. In 1991, two-thirds of
east Germans believed they would have achieved western living standards by
1997. Today, only eight per cent believe that, according to a survey in Die
Zeit, the weekly newspaper.
In 1990, on the eve of unification, 78 per cent of the eastern population
over 18 were economically active. Today that proportion is down to 54 per
cent. Soaring unemployment, early retirement and the withdrawal of women
from the labour market has seen to that. One in 10 east German workers has
been forced to retrain for a different profession. One in five has changed
employer in the past three years.
And yet, in spite of the traumatic social, political and economic changes,
what is most extraordinary is that there has not been more social
disturbance or resentment. In 1990, the survey in Die Zeit showed no less
than 94 per cent happy to be unifying. Today the figure has only dropped to
84 per cent.
The disturbing spread of racist violence still only involves a tiny minority
of young skinhead gangs. It has actually undermined support for the
far-right political parties like the Republicans, who are tarred with the
racist brush.
No one is complacent any longer. The rise of the far right is regarded with
a deeper horror in Germany than probably in any other European country,
precisely because of its Nazi past.
Next year's European elections in June will be a critical moment. Voters who
fear to stray from the establishment parties in a national election are
likely to be less constrained in the poll for the European parliament. And
the far right parties are - so far - the only ones seeking to exploit
widespread fears over a single European currency.
Chancellor Kohl's steadfast commitment to European union, at a moment when
the country is overwhelmingly concerned with the internal upheaval caused by
unification, may yet prove to be his Achilles heel.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Something's gotta give: Labour's economic policy is
deficient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So, distressed FT reader, you are fed up with the government. Your house is
worth less than your mortgage and has been burgled twice in the last year,
probably by the young layabouts on the nearby council estate. You are
wondering how long you will keep your job. After 14 years, it looks like
time for a change. The question is whether Labour has become a fit and
proper steward of the UK's market economy.
Fortunately, this is not a question you have to answer just yet. Meanwhile,
the Labour party is struggling to transform itself from a union-dominated
dinosaur into a modern social democratic party. As the party conference has
made clear, this will be hard, since many activists still prefer the
people's flag of deepest red.
Yet John Smith, party leader, and Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, are
plausible figures, particularly where fiscal and monetary rectitude is
concerned. Mr Brown says in his pamphlet, 'how we can conquer unemployment',
that 'Labour believes in keeping inflation low and of course will stick to
strict low inflation'.
This is not an implausible claim. Labour has produced many austere
chancellors, from Philip Snowden through Stafford Cripps, James Callaghan
and Roy Jenkins. Few have ever slashed public spending as fiercely as did
Denis Healey, in 1976. Mr Brown, who writes sternly that 'what Britain
cannot afford is yet another round of the boom-bust economics so favoured by
Tory chancellors' could fit comfortably among this number.
What about the level of taxes and public spending? Here it is possible only
to guess. To be fair to Labour, neither today's fiscal deficit nor the large
tax increases proposed by Mr Norman Lamont in the budget of last March nor
those Mr Kenneth Clarke, his sucessor as chancellor, is almost certain to
add in November figured prominently in the Conservative party manifesto for
the 1992 general election.
On taxation and spending we know four things, two about the economy and two
about Labour's announced intentions:
Public finances are already in an unsustainable position.
The share of public spending in gross domestic product is also quite high by
British historical standards.
Mr Smith believes passionately in the need to increase public spending,
'work waiting to be done and crying out to be done now . . . which could be
made available to the millions who seek no more than the chance of
worthwhile and satisfying employment'.
Mr Brown intends to replace higher value added tax on fuel with no more than
an attack on tax exiles working in the UK, on offshore trusts, on the rich
who pay no tax, on executive share options, on the excess profits of
utilities and on foreign companies 'defrauding' the UK of corporation tax.
These points do not add up. The proposed revenue increases are probably too
small, especially once the VAT increase is abandoned, to finance the already
envisaged public sector borrowing requirement, let alone higher public
spending.
What matters most, however, is the party's economic 'vision'. Mr Brown's
pamphlet does present the outlines of a strategy. The heart of his diagnosis
is his statement that 'the vicious cycle of poor competitiveness leading to
balance of payments deficits leading to low growth leading to low investment
leading to poor competitiveness is a manifestation of the structural
imbalance which has been condemning Britain to higher and higher rates of
unemployment'.
Mr Brown also asserts that 'unemployment in the 1990s represents a very
specific failure of the British economy and of economic government. Fourteen
years of Tory policy have resulted in persistent under-investment in our
economy.'
British workers must be given not any old jobs, but 'fulfilling employment'.
And 'if', says Mr Brown, 'there are worries about a wage-price spiral taking
off, the approach that will work is to raise the productive potential of the
economy, so that higher wage aspirations can be met without inflation or
unemployment.' To achieve this the twin deficits of skill and investment
must, he asserts, be closed.
What we are to get, it appears, is 'an enhanced Keynesian approach, which
treats demand management as an integral part of a structural policy, and
which deals with the radical institutional reforms without which the British
economy will continue to stagnate'.
As to policy for the supply side, that is to have two main elements: more
education and training and a 'strategy for industry'. The latter will demand
'steady growth of aggregate demand, low inflation, low and stable real rates
of interest, and a stable competitive exchange rate'. So goodbye, it
appears, to that old exchange rate mechanism policy. But it will also demand
examination of 'every institution, whether apparently successful or not' to
assess its contribution to the overall success or failure of investment in
Britain.
It sounds wonderful. But does it also sound credible? Alas no.
First, it is untrue that unemployment in the 1990s represents a specific
failure of Tory Britain. The UK has not done worse than the continental
economies Labour so admires. The continental model Labour wants the UK to
adopt has been tried and, by the criteria of low unemployment, failed.
Second, even if you believe those layabouts down the road can be educated or
trained, it would take decades, rather than years, to transform the
country's labour force. Even then it is questionable how far skills create
growth, rather than the other way around.
Third, where are the incentives for the private sector to invest more or
offer more employment? Manufacturing companies in particularhave not seen it
in their interests to expand capacity or high wage employment for many
years. One reason for this is that profitability has been both too low and
uncertain. Will Labour really do anything to improve that?
Fourth and most fundamentally, how is UK growth to be made more labour
absorbing than it has been in the past? After all, between 1982 and 1992 UK
real GDP rose by 26 per cent, but employment rose by only 7 per cent. Yet if
Mr Smith believes in anything passionately it is in greater worker
protection, including his charter of worker rights and a national minimum
wage. 'You can't build an advanced competitive economy on the basis of low
pay, low skills and poor working conditions,' he insists. Oh yes you can.
That is precisely the route by which Japan, Hong Kong and Korea have
advanced towards higher pay and better skills.
Mr Smith says simply that 'where you find low pay, long hours and
exploitation of workers, you see poverty. Where you find high wages, shorter
hours, decent working conditions and good employment protection, you see
prosperity.' If you too believe the high wages and short hours caused the
prosperity, rather than the other way round, Labour is for you. If not, you
will just have to remain perplexed.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Registration does not give architects
a monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I nearly always enjoy Colin Amery's perceptive thoughts on
architecture, which makes the polemicism of his article against the
statutory registration of architects all the more puzzling ('Say yes to
freedom', September 27) .
The issue of statutory registration is simple. For more than 60 years it has
offered the protection to the client and to the public that, when they
commission an 'architect', they engage a man or woman trained and qualified
to practise. If registration ends, anyone from anywhere within the European
Community - plumber, plasterer, jobbing gardener or mini-cab driver - will
be free to use the title. In whose interest is that?
The profession is not a closed shop. Anyone can design a building, provided
they do not call themselves an architect. It follows that there is no unfair
monopoly. It is nonsense for Amery to say that the profession is being
offered 'freedom'. No chains are being removed which currently constrain the
architect from serving his clients.
I agree with Colin Amery about the need for the highest possible
architectural and environmental standards and that it is inevitable that
some architects will fall short. But this is nothing whatever to do with
statutory registration. I agree that the RIBA can do more to raise the
quality of the profession. But the 'freedom' that Colin Amery offers, yet
does not define, is irrelevant to such a role.
The winning schemes of the prestigious Financial Times Architecture At Work
award that Colin Amery organises suggest to me that he supports the wide
range of today's architecture. But I wish he would redirect his attack on to
the government and other commissioning agencies that have become so obsessed
with the least cost without a thought for quality.

<TEXT>
Sir, Re your article 'The men of violins fight for the loot: The future of
London's orchestras' (September 25), surely one of the main reasons for the
falling off of the Royal Festival Hall's audience is the extreme discomfort
of the seats for anyone 5ft 10in tall or above. There is far too little knee
room.
Go the new Birmingham hall and experience the difference.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Problem of housing policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TOM WINNIFRITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Osman Streater (Letters, September 27) alleges, from the sanctuary of
the Savile Club, that the driving force behind Liberal-run Tower Hamlets
council's housing policy is 'middle-class, post-colonial guilt'. Rubbish.
Tower Hamlets Liberals have as far as possible tried to put the housing
needs of local people ahead of recent arrivals in our borough. Three times
our councillors have been sent to court for trying to break the Homeless
Persons Act, which forces councils to put the homeless (ie, recent arrivals
in the area) ahead of locals. London's most densely populated borough needs
exempting from this act now.
That one, misguided, piece of legislation was undoubtedly the result of
middle-class guilt. Its effect has been to cause immense working-class anger
 -as we saw in Millwall two weeks ago. It continues to cause anger among
people of all ethnic groupings in the East End who suffer unjustifiable
overcrowding and misery as a result of it. Tower Hamlets Liberals have done
everything in our power to alleviate this problem, but we alone cannot solve
it. If the middle classes still feel guilty, then those of them sitting at
Westminster know what to do about it.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: An unfortunate denigration of
Franco-German friendship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GERALD LONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, James Morgan's Saturday column is original and his analysis of European
situations is penetrating. It was, therefore, the more disappointing to read
him denigrating Franco-German friendship as a complete farce ('As They Say
in Europe', September 25). The unworthy and unfunny gibe about the promenade
des Anglais reflected the insensitivity the writer brought to this important
subject. One should hesitate to describe as farce the good state of a
relationship whose deterioration contributed three times in a hundred years
to European tragedies. The fact that both sides think it important to
proclaim their friendship is in itself reassuring; there may occasionally be
elements of exaggeration or insincerity: from what human relationship are
they entirely absent? Likewise it would be surprising if motivation on both
sides were always entirely pure and free from self-interest. But with all
that the fact remains, the French and the Germans, or at least a large
majority of those in both countries who think about such matters, wish to
get on well with one another.
Coming from a Briton, the statement that 'both find the British more
interesting than they find each other' looks like distressingly smug
Schadenfreude. Perhaps if the British frequently proclaimed their belief in
Franco-British, or German-British friendship, preferably both, then those
relationships might begin to exist.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Southern cents and comfort: Alabama has overcome its image
problems to win the first Mercedes plant outside Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until two days ago, when those nice German folk from Mercedes-Benz showered
town with a Dollars 300m jackpot, the tiny Alabama community of Vance (pop:
250) had but one tenuous claim to fame: a colourful experiment in municipal
thrift.
Back in the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan was in the White House, running up
larger and larger federal budget deficits, the town council found that it,
too, was facing a fiscal crisis.
To avoid deficit financing, this scattering of bungalows, Baptist churches
and trailer homes, hidden in thick, rolling woodlands, laid off its handful
of municipal workers and got volunteers to do these jobs. The mayor and
council became garbage collectors. Word of its example spread far and wide -
even beyond the Alabama state line.
'People think we're a bunch of country hicks,' says Mr Larry Simmons, a
council member, as he stands in Vance's one-roomed town hall (or WN ALL, as
its thrifty, dilapidated sign proclaims). 'Well, maybe we haven't got much
book sense, but we sure have common sense.'
On Thursday it got a lot more besides when Mercedes-Benz, the German luxury
vehicle manufacturer, surprised America by announcing that Vance was to be
the site of its first car plant outside Germany, a Dollars 300m factory
which will employ 1,500 and start producing a 'sports utility' vehicle (akin
to a Range Rover) in early 1997.
It is a huge coup for Vance and for the small, slow-paced city of
Tuscaloosa, some 17 miles west, which is dominated by the University of
Alabama and takes its exotic name from a local Indian chief killed by
16th-century Spanish explorers.
Those with too much beer inside them, and a penchant for a good argument,
might make so bold as to call the event more momentous than last year's
victory in the national college football championship by the university
team, the Alabama Crimson Tide.
But the decision by Mercedes is, above all, an immense economic and
psychological boost for Alabama, a state which still suffers from a boorish
'Redneck' image and has lagged behind surrounding states (apart from
dirt-poor Mississippi), in attracting the high-profile investment which has
transformed the 'Old' American south - the states of the civil war
confederacy - over the past 20 years.
The so-called 'new south' - where gleaming, high-rise, industrial cities and
comfortable retirement communities for Yankee expatriates sit alongside
large swathes of rural poverty - can best be observed by a drive up the
south-east's main artery, Interstate 85, from Atlanta, Georgia, to Durham,
North Carolina. 'The boom belt' is how BusinessWeek magazine recently
described the high-way.
Foreign companies, particularly German ones, have been pouring investment
into Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, attracted by low wages,
rabid anti-unionism, good communications, skilled workers, beautiful
surroundings and lavish financial incentives from state governments. Last
year BMW decided to site its first US factory in South Car-olina.
Until now, Alabama has largely missed out - even though its largest city,
Birmingham, which lies about 50 miles north-east of Tuscaloosa, jostled with
Atlanta for the title of the south's economic capital until the 1960s.
Atlanta won, partly because of its more entrepreneurial spirit. It is a city
of brash extrovert boosters compared with Birmingham, which is more
conservative and introverted, less cosmopolitan.
But investors were also scared off by Alabama's hardline attitude to the
most important political issue facing the south in the 1950s and 1960s: the
black civil rights movement. While Atlanta pursued a relatively liberal
approach to the colour bar, Birmingham and the town of Selma became
shorthand for brutal police suppression, and Mr George Wallace, the state's
governor, a symbol of right-wing racism.
Some 30 years on, this negative image still lingers. The recent hit movie,
My Cousin Vinnie, a comedy about a sharp New York lawyer who triumphs in an
Alabama murder trial, caricatures the state's citizens as dull-witted,
slow-moving, insular, racist and corrupt.
Like any caricature, it contains a smattering of truth. Alabama's reputation
for probity was hardly bolstered by the removal from office of its governor,
Mr Guy Hunt, last April after he was convicted of stealing money. And the
state's high school system has one of the highest drop-out rates in the
nation.
However, Birmingham, which has had a black mayor since 1979, has transformed
itself from a grimy steel town into a high-tech medical centre (the actress
Jane Fonda came there for treatment last year) and the way in which the
state chased the Mercedes deal - in competition with more than 30 others -
attests to a new entrepreneurial vigour.
A crucial element in its success was the fact that the search for a Mercedes
site, which began last April, coincided with the appointment of a new
governor, Mr Jim Folsom, who replaced the disgraced Mr Hunt.
Mr Folsom, the son of a celebrated Alabama governor in the 1940s and 1950s,
was anxious to make a splash and, with an eye on the Mercedes deal,
appointed as head of the Alabama Development Office Mr Billy Joe Camp, a
tough, energetic veteran of state government with a quintessentially
southern-sounding name. 'When Billy Joe does something, he goes out and does
it,' says an admiring aide.
Mr Camp spearheaded the lengthy negotiations with Mercedes, while Governor
Folsom provided the political muscle which allowed Alabama to offer Mercedes
an extremely generous set of incentives, worth more than Dollars 250m, to
settle in the state.
However, Mr Andreas Renschler, the young Mercedes executive who led the site
search (and who thought of Alabama as 'sleepy' before he first visited it),
says the state's incentives were no greater than those proffered by the two
others on his short-list, North and South Carolina.
Nor were incentives the decisive factor favouring Tuscaloosa/Vance: 'This is
not a short-term thing. We want to be building cars here for the next 20
years.'
What may have clinched it for Alabama is what the Mercedes team says is a
'gut feeling' this is the right location. That, in turn, seems due in no
small measure to the sheer zeal with which Messrs Folsom and Camp, desperate
for Alabama not to lose again, pursued the Germans.
Whatever the reason, stars are falling on Alabama this weekend - in the
three-pointed form of the Mercedes logo, that ultimate symbol of quality. It
really does beat football.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pension proposals no threat to
equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD WHITELAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your report of the Goode Committee's recommendations for pensions
reform, the suggestion is made that the stability of equity markets may be
threatened by the proposals for minimum solvency standards ('Goode report
strikes a fine balance', October 1). I feel that alarm bells are being rung
unnecessarily and it would be unfortunate if alarmist talk jeopardised the
introduction of such a standard.
The problems of underfunded pension schemes do not arise from the Goode
Committee's proposals. If a scheme has insufficient assets to meet members'
accrued benefits the trustees should, in conjunction with the employer and
advisers, address the problem and, among other things, adopt an appropriate
investment strategy.
If some schemes have not tackled this problem to date, the recommendations
in the Goode report should encourage them to do so and hence properly
protect members' benefits.
The development of derivative instruments means that, for schemes which need
to take action, an appropriate investment strategy can usually be devised
which avoids a substantial shift away from equities and thus the dangers of
'plummeting equity markets'.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Back to full employment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC POLICY is subject to sudden shifts in fashion. Such a change has
occurred in recent months, as unemployment has replaced inflation as the
number one policy concern for developed country governments. Of course,
finance ministers in Washington this week for the International Monetary
Fund's annual meeting have made their customary pledge to remain vigilant
against a new surge in inflationary pressures. But with 32m people currently
unable to find jobs in industrial countries, it is easy to see why
unemployment is the more immediate worry.
This change in approach is not simply a reflection of the depressed state of
the world economy. Instead, it results from a growing realisation that
unemployment is likely to stay worryingly high even after growth re-emerges.
That both the left-of-centre British opposition parties now feel confident
enough to revive full employment as a goal of policy, after a decade when
such a commitment was thought to imply inflationary irresponsibility, shows
that the unemployment debate has moved into a new era.
This renewed concern is a product of the growing impotence that Europe's
governments as well as the European Commission currently feel about economic
policy. They can no longer rely on a cut in interest rates or a fiscal boost
to restore something approaching full employment.
But they cannot ignore the protectionist pressures or social disruption that
high unemployment implies. Nor does the evidence suggest that the developed
world's favoured supply-side policy prescriptions - labour market
deregulation, more spending on active labour market measures and limited
unemployment benefits - have had much success in cutting unemployment.
Wage flexibility
Not so, says the British government, supported by the IMF in its latest
World Economic Outlook. High unemployment in Europe, UK chancellor Kenneth
Clarke stated again this week, is the product of over-regulated and
inflexible labour markets. The UK and the US, by embracing deregulation and
wage flexibility, have achieved a superior record of job creation than
continental Europe.
The chancellor is a little less than half right. Compared with the US,
Europe's record of job creation has been miserable. US employment has risen
by 30m in the past 20 years, three times as fast as in the European
Community. The Commission has already acknowledged that regulation has gone
too far, especially in southern Europe where restrictive hire and fire rules
have stifled job growth. Of course, Britain's claim to be part of this
Anglo-Saxon success story is rather weak. When the effects of the UK's two
recessions are included, British employment has barely grown over the past
14 years. But even over the period 1982-90, British unemployment was higher
on average than in France and Germany as well as the US, while UK real wage
growth has been slow to respond to rising unemployment.
Unprecedented levels
But the US administration has not rushed to preach the gospel of
deregulation as the answer to Europe's unemployment problem. As officials at
the US Labour Department well know, the country has a problem of joblessness
among young and prime-age men, which is at least as severe as in Europe.
Employment growth in the US and the UK in the 1980s occurred because female
employment, increasingly in part-time and service sector jobs, has grown to
unprecedented levels. But the number of US and British men with jobs has
continued to fall, especially among unskilled and poorly educated. European
governments have also experienced the latter shift. What they have not
permitted is the offsetting growth in less well-paid female employment.
This gender-based change in the pattern of employment is at the heart of the
economic changes that have hit the developed world over the past two
decades. Technological change, and to a lesser extent developing country
trade, mean that the demand for unskilled labour has fallen sharply since
the 1960s other than at increasingly low wages. In the UK and the US, where
manufacturing employment has slumped and relative wages for unskilled
workers have fallen dramatically, women have taken the service sector jobs
that have replaced them. Unemployed men have not - they are subsisting on
benefits or, especially among young US men, turning to crime instead.
This is the issue that governments must address at President Clinton's
unemployment summit next month: how they can revive the employment prospects
of unskilled men. Education and training are the obvious long-term solution,
while public sector jobs or subsidies for private sector employment seem a
better alternative than either subsistence on benefits or the kind of US
inner-city problems that withdrawing welfare benefits would encourage. But
one thing is clear. Developed countries cannot ignore the problem any
longer. Its social consequences are increasingly damaging. And it will not
go away.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Better safe than sorry: Will the Goode report prompt a long
hard look at pensions?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pension fund investment managers breathed a sigh of relief yesterday at the
moderate line taken by the Goode Committee on pension law reform. Upheavals
on a scale that could have a serious impact on the stock market are not
anticipated.
But exactly how the committee's recommendations will look when they have
been through the mangle of the parliamentary process remains to be seen. In
any event, certain technical consequences for pension scheme solvency after
the recent downward spiral in long-term interest rates have already been
causing concern.
And it is possible that other events will have important influences: last
week's results from Guinness, for instance, provided a reminder that many
companies are having to step up their pension scheme contributions once
again, after several years of reductions and holidays; and some in the
pensions industry are becoming nervous about next month's Budget, which
could carry on the attack on pension fund tax reliefs begun by Norman Lamont
last March.
Britain's pension funds are uniquely able to invest in risky assets, notably
equities, which make up nearly 80 per cent of the typical portfolio. In
other countries there is a much bigger exposure to fixed interest bonds,
which tend to give a significantly lower investment return in the long term.
This exceptional risk tolerance in the UK arises from the ability of
actuaries - the professionals who design and measure pension schemes - to
take a relaxed attitude to short-term fluctuations in asset prices.
Generally, they ignore share prices and value schemes on the basis of the
long-term growth of investment income.
But now there are several threats to this comfortable picture:
Many schemes are now approaching danger level on the so-called
'discontinuance' test, which requires them to have enough assets to finance
all past service liabilities should they be unexpectedly wound up; The rapid
dividend growth rates that generated the pension scheme surpluses of the
late 1980s have collapsed, both because of the recession and adverse tax
changes;
Schemes are becoming more mature, with fewer young members and more
pensioners, which reduces their investment flexibility;
Companies are increasingly considering a switch from final salary-linked to
money purchase schemes, which transfer the investment risk from the company
to the members.
The discontinuance problem is highly technical, but it is an important issue
for schemes where the company goes bust and members need to be sure that
their benefits already accrued are safe. In such circumstances the trustees
will normally seek to use the assets of the fund to buy guaranteed benefits
from life assurance companies.
Until the past year or two it was typical for schemes to be so far above the
discontinuance solvency level as to be out of any conceivable danger.
However, the terms quoted by life companies have deteriorated sharply. Many
schemes therefore face the risk that in circumstances such as the 1987 stock
market crash, when share prices suddenly tumbled by about 30 per cent, they
might be technically insolvent. They can no longer be indifferent to the
risks of holding a large proportion of equities in the portfolio.
The Goode Committee has heightened this dilemma by proposing that for the
first time there should be a statutory minimum solvency requirement, of 100
per cent of these legal commitments on discontinuance. Solvency may dip to a
90 per cent level before any urgent injection of new funds is required.
Between 90 and 100 per cent, the scheme will have a leisurely three years to
submit a plan for restoration to the minimum standard, so there will be
plenty of time for stock market prices to rally after a future crash. Below
90 per cent, however, new resources would have to be injected within three
months.
When schemes are anywhere near the borderline, trustees will be under
pressure to follow very prudent investment policies, and may even think it
wise to take out futures contracts to protect the fund against market
collapses. This will be to the detriment of long-term investment
performance.
One way in which the government could help pension schemes to handle these
risks would be to offer them specially-tailored government bonds (or
gilt-edged securities). Goode recommends that a new type of bond, a deferred
income index-linked gilt, should be issued.
Some in the pensions industry argue that two other kinds of indexed gilts
should be invented, to match more precisely the two main kinds of current
liability: for members in service the liabilities are likely to rise roughly
in line with the index of average earnings, and for ex-employees who have
left the company, statutory limited price indexation (inflation capped at 5
per cent) applies.
The underlying theme is that the government could take advantage of the
growing risk aversion in pension schemes to push sales of its own
securities. This might suit the government when it is running a fiscal
deficit at the rate of Pounds 50bn a year, but it would have the effect of
crowding out the equity market.
So far there is no evidence that pension funds are shunning equities,
however. Although their exposure to gilts has risen a little in recent
months it has been financed by running down their holdings of overseas
bonds.
As for the feared shift to money purchase schemes, this again remains
conjectural. So long as contribution holidays persist, there is absolutely
no incentive for companies to move to money purchase (where there can be no
surpluses and no holidays). Guinness, though, warned last week of a Pounds
30m jump in pension contributions. Once they are paying out again, companies
might reason that the changeover to money purchase will not involve them in
any extra outgoings but will control their future risks.
Money purchase funds are less risk-tolerant, because they are answerable to
nervous scheme members rather than dessicated actuaries, and because,
moreover, they have to provide cash sums in a rather inflexible way to
retirees so that they can purchase annuities. Again, this argues for more
gilts and fewer equities.
It is clear that the Goode Committee has been careful to avoid radical
change and none of its recommendations imply big portfolio shifts.
But time is catching up with the UK's occupational pensions industry. It is
up against a changing industrial culture and an unsympathetic government.
Membership has been in decline. The question is whether Goode, and the
legislation that may in due course follow, will prompt many British
companies to take a long, hard look at their whole approach to pensions.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
GOODE RECOMMENDATIONS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Compensation to cover fraud, misappropriation or theft, financed by a
  levy on occupational schemes.
 -Appointment of pensions regulator.
 -Employers may take contributions holidays, but schemes must meet
  statutory minimum solvency standard.
 -Employers must obtain permission from regulator before withdrawing
  cash from schemes.
 -Employers allowed to amend schemes to reduce future service benefits,
  but they must not restrict benefits for past service.
 -Scheme members should be entitled to appoint at least a third of all
  trustees, with a minimum of two per scheme.
 -New Occupational Pensions Schemes Act to codify reforms.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Woman in the News: Luck may not be a lady - Kim Campbell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The band of party workers crowded into a meeting room in a nondescript
Vancouver shopping centre is brimming with confidence about its local
candidate's chances in Canada's forthcoming general election.
The candidate is Ms Kim Campbell, the prime minister. Judging by the latest
opinion polls, she will have no trouble sweeping to victory in her Vancouver
Centre constituency on October 25.
One by one, the organisers enthusiastically spell out their plans to
solidify the prime minister's lead in a diverse inner-city constituency,
whose residents range from a vociferous gay and lesbian community, to
wealthy immigrants from Hong Kong and students at the University of British
Columbia. Events on the agenda include a vintage car rally featuring the
prime minister's 15-year-old red Honda Civic.
But the mood around the table darkens when Mr David Camp, Ms Campbell's
campaign manager, invites views on how the prime minister and her governing
Progressive Conservative party are faring in the country at large.
One young woman complains that Ms Campbell comes across as boring and
intellectual in the party's television advertisements. Another chips in that
the media has been far kinder to Mr Jean Chretien, leader of the opposition
Liberals, who has escaped much of the close probing on policy issues to
which Ms Campbell has been subjected. A third gripes that party managers
have left Ms Campbell carrying too much of the campaign burden, rather than
her cabinet colleagues.
The Vancouver workers are unanimous that the image of their leader being
projected is not the witty and down-to-earth Kim they know and who they
believe is being undersold as a political leader.
With three weeks to voting day, Ms Campbell needs to engineer either a big
improvement in her party's image or await a mistake by her opponents if the
Conservatives are to win a third successive term in office.
Opinion polls show that she has a personal lead of about 10 percentage
points over Mr Chretien. But her party has fallen several percentage points
behind the Liberals in the country as a whole, and is trailing far behind
the separatist Bloc Quebecois in Quebec, where the Conservatives currently
hold 54 out of the province's 75 seats in the House of Commons in Ottawa. In
Ms Campbell's native British Columbia, the Tories are even behind the
right-wing Reform party, which currently holds one seat in parliament.
The Conservatives chose 46-year-old Ms Campbell as their leader last June
when her unpopular predecessor, Mr Brian Mulroney, stepped down after nine
years in office. They hoped a bilingual westerner and Canada's first woman
prime minister would make voters forget the tough times: an unemployment
rate of 11 per cent, towering budget deficits and, as a result, the threat
of cuts to social-security and healthcare programmes.
Mr Mulroney's name is seldom heard these days. But Ms Campbell has been
unable to shake off his legacy entirely. The strength of the Bloc Quebecois
and the Reform party, which attract many defecting Conservative voters,
largely reflects Canadians' wish for a change.
Mr Mulroney gave his successor little time to prepare for an election
campaign. Ms Campbell, who qualified as a lawyer in her mid-30s, is a
relative newcomer to Ottawa. She cut her teeth in local politics in British
Columbia, and was first elected to the House of Commons in 1988.
Mr Chretien, by contrast, is one of Canada's most seasoned politicians. He
celebrated his 30th anniversary as an MP this year, and held almost every
leading cabinet portfolio when the Liberals were last in office under Mr
Pierre Trudeau until 1984.
Ms Campbell's strengths are her nimble and intelligent mind, which gives her
an impressive grasp of complex economic issues, and an impish  - sometimes
cutting - sense of humour. She often refers self-deprecatingly to the weight
problem encountered by women in their mid-40s.
But her assets have been over-shadowed by her political inexperience. She
made herself an easy target by remarking that a 47-day election campaign was
too short to debate the complex issue of social-security reform. Her answers
often seem more suited to a courtroom or a university lecture hall than to
the campaign stump. She had journalists rushing for their dictionaries by
using the word 'terpischorean' (pertaining to dancing) at a press
conference.
Ms Campbell has made fiscal discipline the main plank of her campaign
platform, with a pledge to eliminate the CDollars 35.5bn (Pounds 17.4bn)
federal budget deficit within five years by, among other measures, cutting
defence spending, grants to business and foreign aid.
But she has failed to convince voters of the connection between lower
deficits and job creation; opinion polls show unemployment remains a leading
concern of voters. Her emphasis on deficit reduction has given opponents an
opening to question her commitment to social services.
With their backs to the wall, Ms Campbell and her advisers are now
rethinking their strategy. Instead of making polite visits to schools and
rotary club lunches, the prime minister is expected to sharpen her rhetoric
as she takes her campaign across the country over the next three weeks.
The Conservatives are still hoping for a turnround. The youthful,
quick-thinking Ms Campbell could perform strongly in the party leaders'
televised debates tomorrow and Monday.
Conservative strategists also hope that support for the the Bloc Quebecois
and Reform parties will subside as election day approaches. Their best
chance would be a well-timed word from Mr Robert Bourassa, the francophone
province's hugely popular premier, that Quebeckers should beware of the
false hopes being preached by the separatists.
The novice prime minster needs all the luck and skill she can muster over
the next three weeks if she is to gain the support in the country at large
which her enthusiastic volunteers back home in Vancouver Centre think she
deserves.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Piggy in the middle: The law professor steering the reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Roy Goode, chairman of pension reform committee that bears his
name, will join the vast majority of Britons who retire with something less
than a full pension.
The precise amount, he says, will be thirty-five-and-a-half-eightieths of a
full pension under his occupational University Superannuation Scheme, he
said, when he retires five years from now at 65. This fact did not tempt him
to urge more generous treatment of people who change jobs in the committee's
final recommendations on pension reform this week.
Of all the issues covered in the weighty (about 7lb) blueprint for a new
occupational pensions framework, the treatment of those who quit schemes
early proved one of the most divisive within the committee, he said. The
group finally decided against requiring employers to increase their former
employees' deferred pensions in line with earnings, which would have helped
those who switch jobs freqently to retire on something more like a full
pension.
'Most of us felt that such a move would put the early leaver in the same
position as those who stayed,' Prof Goode said, adding that the committee
felt that employers simply do not feel committed to providing the same level
of benefits to ex-employees as to those who stay to receive their full
pension entitlement. Also, all members agreed that the costs of such a
requirement would be enormous.
Many of the committee members and their views are well known inside the
pensions industry. On the consumer activist end of the spectrum, industry
sources say, was Ms Sue Ward, a freelance writer and researcher, former
member of the Occupational Pensions Board and a campaigner for greater
pension democracy. At the other end, observers place Mr Stuart James,
partner at solicitors Rowe and Maw and, those who know him say, a holder of
equally firm views.
The gentlemanly Prof Goode, now Norton Rose Professor of English Law at St
John's College, Oxford, said debate over the planned reforms was heated.
'The important thing was that everyone was willing to listen to arguments,'
he said.
A professor of commercial law, Prof Goode's particular expertise is in the
area of consumer credit. He has written several books on the subject,
including a three-volume set of case law. But before entering academia, he
specialised in civil litigation, becoming a partner in what was then the
firm of Victor Mishcon and Co.
Among his cases was one involving the former Livestock Marketing Company.
'It was called armchair pigfarming. Instead of shares, you had rights to a
pig, and instead of dividends, you had rights to its litter,' Prof Goode
said.
The company eventually went into receivership and Prof Goode's client wanted
to collect her four pigs. However, they could not be identified without
being washed first. 'The official receiver said it was not in his job
description to be required to wash a pig,' he said. So the client collected
a dividend cheque for one and sixpence (about 7p) and Prof Goode departed
shortly thereafter for academia.

FT  02 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Storm over union block vote
causes few ripples in Bridgwater - Roland Adburgham returns to Somerset to
gauge the reaction of voters to the Labour conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISSUE that electrified the Labour conference in Brighton this week
caused only the mildest of shocks in Bridgwater, Somerset, a
Conservative-held constituency which is more concerned with such matters as
a local unemployment rate of 10.9 per cent.
If the Conservatives are to retain power at the next election, Bridgwater -
where Mr Tom King has a majority of 9,716 - is the kind of seat they must
hold against the Liberal Democrat challenge in the south and south-west.
Labour came a strong third at Bridgwater in last year's general election
and, next time, tactical voting could make the Tories vulnerable.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, greeted the conference backing for
one-member-one-vote in the selection of parliamentary candidates as 'a great
day for the Labour party'. But the FT's small panel of Bridgwater voters was
less convinced that the reduction in union power would mark a turning point
in the party's election fortunes.
'One decision is not a watershed,' said Mr Allan Challenger, a former Labour
member who is a psychiatric social worker. 'It might lead to John Smith
getting a few more points in the opinion polls for a few weeks . . . But I
don't think it has any long-term relevance.
'The issue has never stopped people electing Labour governments in the past
 -what stops people electing Labour governments is when they don't have any
confidence in the policies.'
Ms Glen Burrows, a shop steward with Unison, the public-services union,
agreed. 'For most voters, the question of whether the individual or union
block vote selects candidates is completely irrelevant,' she said. 'People
aren't going to say 'Oh goody, now we can vote Labour'.'
She thought the debate distracted attention from the substance of policy.
'The Tories are setting the agenda all the time for John Smith,' she said.
'In his 40-minute speech, he spent 20 minutes making jokes about the Tories.
We've heard it all before. Labour leaders should stop dining out on how
awful the Tories are and put some beef into their policies.'
Mr Ian Weston, who owns a Bridgwater travel agency, thought the vote was
more significant - and would make the party more attractive to the undecided
voter.
Mr Hugh Barran, a solicitor and Liberal Democrat supporter, was sceptical.
'John Smith says on the one hand that the vote is important, and on the
other that he wants to maintain and strengthen links with the unions,' he
said.
Mrs Beatrice Forber, a committed Conservative supporter, was dismissive. 'I
think it is a wonderful colour scheme: paint the room in pale pink and
everyone will look nicer,' she said. 'But Labour still looks totally
unconvincing as a government and still ominous, with its hidden left waiting
to pounce if they come to power.'
Roland Adburgham will visit the voters again after the Conservative party
conference next week. The first article in this series, gauging reaction to
the Liberal Democrat conference, appeared last Saturday.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Spy services reveal more secrets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER veil was torn away from the intelligence services yesterday with the
publication of a guide to Whitehall's intelligence machinery and the terms
of reference of the intelligence-gathering agencies.
Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, launched a booklet
describing the work of the Joint Intelligence Committee which supervises the
work of the intelligence services.
He said that the booklet was a further example of the government's
commitment to eliminate unnecessary secrecy and make Whitehall more open.
Mr Waldegrave also announced that from January the chair of the committee
will be Miss Pauline Neville-Jones. She is the second woman to be given a
top intelligence post, following the appointment in 1991 of Mrs Stella
Rimington as director-general of the security service.
Miss Neville-Jones, 53, is an Oxford-educated career diplomat. She is head
of the Defence and Overseas Secretariat in the Cabinet Office and has the
rank of deputy secretary.
Miss Neville-Jones said she thought her appointment would be a boost for
other women civil servants, although it was 'something of an accident' that
two women had ended up in senior intelligence service positions.
She will be working closely with Mr Gerald Warner, the intelligence
co-ordinator who plays a key role in drawing up budgets for the intelligence
agencies. Mr Warner is also a deputy secretary.
The present chairman of the joint committee is Sir Rodric Braithwaite,
foreign policy adviser to the prime minister and a former ambassador to the
former Soviet Union.
According to the booklet, the committee advises the government on
intelligence priorities and assesses the results. It publishes a weekly
survey on intelligence known as the Red Book, which is circulated to
ministers and officials.
It monitors direct and indirect threats to UK economic interests, as well as
threats to British political and military interests. It collates information
from the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), which gathers intelligence
overseas, and from GCHQ, the electronic eavesdropping agency.
The committee also assesses 'events and situations relating to external
affairs, defence, terrorism, major international criminal activity,
scientific, technical and international economic matters'.
In a foreword to the booklet, Mr John Major, the prime minister, says it is
government policy to be as open as possible about security and intelligence
matters 'without prejudicing national security, the effectiveness of the
security and intelligence services or the safety of their staff'.
Mr Major adds: 'It is a strength of the British system that ministers do not

FT  02 OCT 93 / Rail fares latest in VAT spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has asked British Rail to assess the effect of imposing value
added tax on train fares in a move that will fuel speculation that Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is planning to extend further the VAT base
in his November Budget.
In particular, the move will add to expectations at Westminster that Mr
Clarke is planning to levy a lower than expected rate of VAT on domestic
fuel, while extending the base of the tax to public transport, newspapers
and other goods which are currently zero-rated.
BR warned that levying the tax at the full rate of 17.5 per cent could
depress fare income by about Pounds 200m, or 10 per cent.
The imposition of VAT would lead to more pressure to reduce services, and
could result in fares being further increased to make up for lost revenue,
it said.
BR said yesterday that it had provided information about VAT to the
Department of Transport in response to a request during the summer.
BR is already suffering from a fall in revenue caused by the recession.
There have been reports that this could result in fare increases of up to 8
per cent even before the imposition of VAT.
A move to impose VAT on fares in November would be highly controversial
after the angry reaction when the then chancellor Mr Norman Lamont announced
plans to extend the tax to domestic fuel in the March Budget.
But Mr Clarke hinted in Washington earlier this week that any new tax
increases will be on spending rather than income.
Ministers had a foretaste in August of the likely reaction to steep BR fare
increases. They were forced to play down the significance of leaked plans to
raise some London rail ticket prices by 16 per cent.
A complicating factor is the government's rail privatisation proposals,
which have been criticised by some Tory backbenchers and have yet to clear
the Commons.
Most other EC countries already levy indirect taxation on public transport
at between 4 per cent and 7 per cent. In light of this, BR had already
studied the impact of VAT on fares before the government's request.
VAT surcharges will now only be levied on late payers and not on those who
submit their returns late, Customs and Excise said yesterday.
There will also no longer be any surcharges for less than Pounds 200. The
changes follow moves to make the VAT system more fair to business.

FT  02 OCT 93 / New channel for TV shoppers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRIGHT yellow car-shaped alarm clock selling for Pounds 16.50 ushered the
age of television shopping into the UK yesterday as QVC, Britain's first
home shopping channel, went on air.
What is being touted as the UK's first glimpse of the future of television -
and retailing - is a joint venture between BSkyB and QVC Inc, the US
shopping channel. It will enable viewers to buy a range of goods 'from
jewellery to household items, sporting goods to designer dresses, power
tools to toys' with-out ever leaving their armchairs.
Products are presented in themed hour-long programmes, such as Jewellery
Showcase, DIY, Gifts for Children and Sporting World. About eight items each
hour are demonstrated by one of the seven US-trained presenters, whose
selection process involved having to talk about a yellow pencil for 10
minutes.
Viewers dial a free telephone number to order, pay by credit card, cheque or
postal order, and should receive their goods within five days.
The channel is available on satellite and cable television as part of a
package of 14 paid-for channels offered by BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster
in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake.
QVC, which stands for Quality, Value, Convenience, was launched in the US
less than 10 years ago, and made profits of Dollars 34.9m (Pounds 23.3m) on
sales of Dollars 535.7m in the first six months of this year. Mr Barry
Diller, the former Hollywood executive who is now chairman and chief
executive of QVC, yesterday said that the opening of QVC's first overseas
service was a 'milestone'.
'Of the many things I wanted to investigate, offering this service outside
the US was very much at the top of the list,' he said.
QVC, is also trying to take over its biggest US rival Home Shopping Network
to form a Dollars 2bn-a-year network and is launching a venture in Mexico.
In addition to the Volkswagen Beetle-shaped clock, other items advertised in
QVC's first hour included a 58-piece cutlery set for Pounds 160 (recommended
retail price Pounds 199, according to QVC), a silver locket for Pounds 19.50
(RRP Pounds 31.45) a three-quarter length suede jacket for Pounds 160
(Pounds 179), and a Philips HR2898 food processor for Pounds 89.50. Prices
do not include postage.
As it buys direct from manufacturers and has lower overheads than
conventional retailers, QVC aims to be 20 per cent cheaper than high street
shops. Most of the first goods on sale yesterday were not branded and
therefore difficult to compare. But Selfridges, the London department store,
was selling the Philips food processor at Pounds 91.99 - cheaper than QVC
once Pounds 3.50 post and packing was added. Eastern Electricity was
undercutting them both at Pounds 89.75 for the same product.

FT  02 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Straw pledge on council
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, confirmed yesterday that Labour
would remove the cap on spending which the government now imposes on local
councils, and would no longer force local authorities to tender for the
provision of services in the private sector.
In a wide-ranging attack on the Conservatives' local government policies, he
renewed Labour's commitment to hand control of the business rate back to
local councils. He also said there should be local elections each year to
improve democracy at a regional level.
Mr Straw highlighted a series of recent Labour successes in metropolitan and
shire elections, suggesting that the public believed the party was more
committed to the provision of local services.
He said: 'It is Labour councils which provide the services which people want
and need: nursery places, home helps, discretionary grants for students, job
creation and economic development, improved public transport.'
The Conservatives have previously criticised Labour for advocating too
little restraint on local government policies. There is a strong expectation
that local authority spending will be targeted by the Treasury in
discussions about next year's public expenditure.
However, Labour believes that the public does not want to see a
deterioration in the quality of these services. Mr Straw said that next
May's local council elections would be a critical test of the government's
record.
Conference also called for policies to revitalise Britain's rural
communities, including the introduction of comprehensive public transport
services.
Mr Straw was strongly critical of the Liberal Democrats, especially
following allegations that they had issued racist leaflets during the recent
council by-election in the Tower Hamlets borough of London, which was won by
the far-right British National party.
'The Liberal democrats are the party who will do anything, say anything,
pledge anything, print anything to get a vote,' Mr Straw said.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Homes Assured directors jailed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO FORMER directors of Homes Assured, the mortgage broker which collapsed
in 1989 owing creditors Pounds 10.7m, were imprisoned yesterday following
their convictions at Southwark Crown Court in August for fraudulent trading.
Mr Anthony Dobson, the founder of the company set up to provide mortgages
for council tenants buying their homes under the right-to-buy legislation,
was jailed for a total of 5 1/2 years, and Mr Keith Woodward, its former
finance director, for 4 1/2 years.
Mr Dobson was sentenced to four years on the fraudulent trading charge and
an additional 18 months on two charges of procuring the execution of a
security by deception. Mr Woodward received three years for fraudulent
trading and 18 months for furnishing false information.
Both men were also disqualified from acting as company directors for 10
years.
However, the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the prosecutions, decided
against a re-trial of Mr Michael Robinson, the former Homes Assured managing
director also charged with fraudulent trading. The jury was unable to agree
a verdict against him and he was formally acquitted.
Judge John Rogers QC said Homes Assured had started out as an honest
business, but both men had ignored warnings that it was losing money, and
had continued trading.

FT  02 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Support for referendum on
electoral reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFERENCE yesterday gave hesitant backing to the proposal by Mr John Smith
that the next Labour government should hold a referendum on changing the
first-past-the-post system for elections to the House of Commons.
Initially delegates refused to accept the verdict of Mr Tony Clarke, the
conference chairman, that a resolution supporting the referendum had been
carried on a show of hands.
To the relief of the party leadership, a card vote resulted in the motion
being approved by just over 3 percentage points - 45.491 to 42.021.
The extent of the divisions in the party on the issue was underlined in a
further vote when a motion calling for the continuance of the
first-past-the-post system was approved by 44.606 per cent to 35.225 per
cent.
That motion had been sponsored by the GMB union, which earlier in the week
had led the fight against one-member-one-vote.
A fiercely argued debate, which spilled over from Thursday, was dominated by
warnings by constituency party delegates that the Liberal Democrats and
other minority parties would be the main beneficiaries of a switch to
proportional representation.
Strongly disputing this view Mr John McAllion, MP for Dundee East, argued
that for 14 years the first-past-the-post system had resulted in 'a Tory
minority imposing its will on a permanent anti-Tory majority in Britain'.
He failed to convince Ms Marie Harris from the Cathcart division of Glasgow,
who maintained that talk of changing the electoral system was 'at best
premature and at worst a waste of time'.
Proportional representation would not be the issue at the next general
election, she said, but jobs, housing, education, health and social
services.
Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, said it would be unwise to
introduce substantial changes to the electoral system without the widespread
consultation which a referendum would make possible.
The resolution backing the referendum also endorsed recommendations made by
the Plant commission advocating the use of the regional list system of
proportional representation for an elected second chamber to replace the
House of Lords, and for elections to the European parliament.
A statement by the party's National Executive which also committed a future
Labour government to a referendum was approved on a show of hands.

FT  02 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Smith suffers Trident setback
over defence policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour leadership suffered a setback in its attempts to distance the
party from some of its unpopular policies when delegates voted to scrap the
Trident missile programme and support widespread nationalisation.
The vote to decommission Trident prompted an immediate government response,
underlining the sensitivity of the issue. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary, said it showed that Labour was still 'wedded to the misty ideals'
of the Campaign For Nuclear Disarmament.
Officials close to Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said the votes would
have no impact on the development of party policy for the next general
election.
However, the defeats removed some of the gloss from Mr Smith's success
earlier in the week in forcing through a partial democratisation of the
process for selecting parliamentary candidates.
The resolution calling for the scrapping of Trident was approved by a
relatively narrow majority of 52.4 per cent to 40.6 per cent, suggesting
that just over half of the party remains committed to uni-lateral nuclear
disarmament.
There was stronger support for a resolution calling for defence spending to
be reduced to the average for European countries, which was passed by 79.9
per cent to 15.3 per cent.
After the votes, the leadership said the resolutions would have no effect
because its commitment to a defence review and multilateral disarmament was
endorsed on Thursday by a resolution passed on a show of hands.
Privately, Labour leaders also stressed their acceptance of Britain's need
to retain the capability to fulfil its commitments to the United Nations and
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
The leadership also shrugged off a resolution affirming clause four of the
party's constitution, which calls for the common ownership of the means of
production, distribution and exchange.
Mr Eric Messner, a veteran activist who said he learnt his socialism in the
1920s, said there was no public support for privatisation. He warned
delegates: 'You won't get public support by watering down your policy. Let's
keep the faith.'
The resolution conflicts with the leadership view that accountability and
control of industry can be achieved through a 'modern' interpretation of
clause four relying on regulation rather than nationalisation.
However, officials close to Mr John Smith, the party leader, said the
resolution required no specific action from the leadership.

FT  02 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Something for everyone at the
party's stall - Kevin Brown watches as the conference papers over its
disagreements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS the admission everyone had been waiting for, and it came from the
most unexpected source. 'Today,' said Mrs Margaret Beckett, 'no-one feels
secure; there is no such thing as a safe job.'
Mrs Beckett was not, of course, talking specifically about her chances of
keeping her job as Labour's deputy leader. But she might as well have been.
Everyone else was.
The last morning of Labour's annual conference is always a rather
unsatisfying affair: a ragbag of debates which failed to make the agenda
earlier; a few points of order; the ritual singing of the Red Flag and Auld
Lang Syne.
This year the departing delegates had something more substantial on their
minds. How serious is the threat to Mrs Beckett's job after her apparent
disloyalty to Mr John Smith, the party leader, in the run up to Wednesday's
debate on one-member-one-vote.
In itself, Mrs Beckett's offence was trivial. She made some equivocal
comments about her support for Mr Smith's plans, and she was one of the last
to join a standing ovation for the leader after he opened the debate.
The whole thing would have been a storm in a teacup but for the intervention
of Mr John Prescott, Labour's rough-diamond transport spokesman, whose
rabble-rousing speech may well have won the debate for Mr Smith.
The speech transformed Mr Prescott into the darling of conference, and
established him as a potential threat to Mrs Beckett only 15 months after
she defeated him in the last deputy leadership election.
Plenty of senior Labour figures were saying privately that the game was up
for Mrs Beckett. Mr Smith was said to be furious, and Mr Prescott determined
to cash in on the debt owed him by the leadership.
But time is on Mrs Beckett's side. She has a full year to consolidate her
position before any challenge can be mounted. Even then, any challenger
would risk being blamed for the damage which would be caused by a divisive
election campaign.
She also has the support of key union leaders. One, a leading player in the
one-member-one-vote drama, said yesterday a deputy leadership election was
the last thing Labour needed.
Mrs Beckett knows all this. And she took her chance in the traditional
deputy leader's speech yesterday to make it clear that she has no intention
of going quietly.
Flanked by a glum-looking Mr Smith, she recalled her record as a successful
campaign organiser, and blamed outsiders for the speculation over her job.
'We did not ask for (their) advice, nor did we need it,' she told delegates.
It was not a good speech, but it was a clever one. It gave delegates the
chance to blame the deputy leadership muddle on the media, and they took it.
Mrs Beckett got a standing ovation, and another Labour leadership split was
papered over, at least for the time being.
In the end, almost everyone went home reasonably happy. The party's leading
modernisers - Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown - suffered a fall in their
share of the vote in the National Executive Committee elections, but
performed fairly well in their set-piece debates.
The left lost the battle over one-member-one-vote, but won a consolation
victory on defence which allows it to claim that the socialist flame has not
yet been snuffed out by the modernist wind of change.
Mr Smith got the victory he needed over the trade unions, Mr Prescott put
himself in line for promotion, and Mrs Beckett kept her job. For them all,
it could have been much worse.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Probe on council expenses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUDIT Commission, the government spending watchdog, yesterday announced
a review of all expense claims filed at Derbyshire County Council after a
former deputy council leader was jailed for fraud this week.
The commission said the district auditor would be examining claims by every
councillor over the past financial year.
Officials said the review would take some time, although they fully expected
most councillors to be cleared of any wrongdoing.
The inquiry follows the conviction of Mr Sean Stafford at Birmingham Crown
Court, who was jailed for 18 months after being found guilty of fraudulently
claiming council expenses.
Mr Stafford was jailed along with Mr Gerald Sexton, a solicitor, who
allegedly helped him draw up a false contract of employment. Mr Stafford was
said to have used the contract to claim Pounds 13,000 expenses for wages
lost while on council duty.
Mr Sexton was also jailed for 18 months. Solicitors for both men, who denied
the charges, said they were considering an appeal. Mr David Bookbinder, the
former council leader, said he was sure of their innocence.
Derbyshire County Council said yesterday it had always scrutinised members'
expenses carefully, adding that it would co-operate fully with the district
auditor's examination.

Mr Dobson had been guilty of blatant dishonesty in not revealing that he had

Mr Woodward had been guilty of dishonesty in submitting accounts to the High
Court which he must have known were false.
Both men were also disqualified from acting as company directors for 10

FT  02 OCT 93 / Rapid response pays off for textiles sector: How changing
work patterns mean there is more to pay figures than meets the eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY IN the textiles industry is rising faster than any other segment of UK
manufacturing. The finding, published this week by Income Data Services, an
independent research agency, surprised many industry executives.
The agency analysed Department of Employment figures and found that textile
industry wages rose 6.5 per cent in the year to June 1993 compared with 4.7
per cent for manufacturing as a whole.
However, industry executives said that special factors in the textiles and
clothing industries could be swelling the pay packets of their employees.
Managers were quick to point out there was more to the figure than meets the
eye. 'It's certainly not straightforward pay increases,' said Mr Martin
Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, the UK's second-biggest
textiles and clothing company.
'On basic pay we are looking to hold rates at or below the rate of
inflation,' said Mr Andrew Mills Baker, finance director of William Baird,
another large group.
Clothing and textile industries - in an effort to fight off cheap imports
from countries with low labour costs - have turned to 'rapid response',
whereby manufacturers compensate for higher prices by offering quick
delivery of small volumes, offering retailers the chance to cut their stocks
and thus reduce their working capital. They can also respond more quickly to
fashion changes.
Under this system, manufacturers cut staff to a level to cope with slack
periods and use overtime to meet orders. Mr David Parker, chairman of
Nottingham-based Sherwood Group, one of Britain's biggest sock and
lacemakers, said: 'Retailers' just-in-time policies mean that manufacturers
are running more tightly. There is more often a demand for overtime and this
seems likely to continue.'
Overtime is often used by companies involved in the earliest part of the
process of turning wool and cotton into garments.
Mr John Embrey, group finance director at Dawson International, said that
wages have increased most at its Joseph Dawson operation, which operates one
of the earliest stages in the process, dehairing and combing cashmere and
lambswool. Employees are working longer hours with more piecework and
productivity bonuses, he said.
Companies are also taking advantage of low interest rates to install new
automated machinery and training staff to become multi-skilled. Employees
with the lowest skill levels and earnings are losing their jobs in favour of
quick learners with some qualifications.
Spinning company John Haggas has seen its wage bill per employee rise 6.5
per cent over the past year. 'The new machines are easier to operate but you
have to retrain,' it said.
The rise in overtime and increasing skills of workers seem unlikely to
signal a return to recruitment in the short term, said Mr Colin Purvis of
the British Apparel and Textiles Confederation. 'Regrettably there is a
reluctance on the part of companies to take on new employees,' he said.
'There have been 20,000-25,000 job losses a year during the recession.'

<TEXT>
BRITAIN and Malaysia conducted secret negotiations on potential defence
contracts during Mr John Major's recent visit to the Far East.
While the visit laid emphasis on political ties and civilian contracts, it
has emerged that the potentially more sensitive issue of defence was
discussed behind the scenes.
John Laing, the building group, confirmed yesterday that British and
Malaysian officials had made progress in negotiations on a contract, worth
more than Pounds 200m, for the construction of a high security special
forces complex at Mersing, near the east coast of the Malaysian peninsula.
Sources close to the company said that as a result of the discussions, the
Malaysian government had agreed in principle to the first phase of the
project, although the contract has yet to be signed.
'This is very much a hush-hush contract but we did get some very optimistic
noises and we are very hopeful of our position now,' a company source said.
It also emerged yesterday that Britain's GEC-Marconi is overseeing
construction of an electronic command centre for Malaysia's armed forces at
an undisclosed location, under a contract worth almost Pounds 100m.
The project, agreed about two years ago, includes command and control
facilities and communications for the planning of joint operations between
the army, navy and air force.
British defence officials are understood to believe the Malaysian bases may
be useful for British operations after Hong Kong has been handed back to the
Chinese in 1997.
GEC-Marconi also has contracts with Malaysia to upgrade the country's air
defence system and to build two missile-carrying frigates, while British
Aerospace has sold Hawk trainer and fighter aircraft to the country.
The deals come under a framework defence supply agreement signed five years
ago. Malaysia has since diversified moved to diversify its sources of
weapons by ordering MiG-29 fighters from Russia as well as F/A-18 jets from
the US. Its purchases reflect a rapid arms build-up throughout south-east
Asia.
A potential flashpoint is the Spratly group of islands in the South China
Sea.

FT  02 OCT 93 / MoD to bring job cuts forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence is to bring forward planned job cuts at its nuclear
missile facilities on the Clyde, with reductions due to start next year,
David White writes.
It has announced plans to shed 340 jobs over the 12 months from April next
year, with a further 300 due to go by the end of the decade, when the new
Trident missile submarines will be fully operational.
This is almost half the 1,400 workforce at Coulport's missile-handling
facilities.
The cuts come as a bitter blow to Scotland following the government's
decision, confirmed this week, to stop refitting nuclear submarines at
Rosyth on the Forth.
Unions at the Clyde base had been expecting job losses but not at this stage
of the programme. The cuts - which will save Pounds 16m - reflect the new
arrangements for the US-supplied Trident missiles. Unlike Polaris missiles,
which are serviced at Coulport, the Tridents will be returned to US
facilities at King's Bay, Georgia, under a 1982 agreement between the two
governments.
Mr Ian Fraser, local secretary of the National Union of Civil and Public
Servants, said: 'We were led to believe there would be gradual reductions,
phased over a number of years.' The first Trident submarine is expected to
become operational in early 1995.
Some 3,000 people working for contractors at the nearby submarine base at
Faslane also face progressive reductions as facilities there are completed.

FORD is recalling 57,000 Mondeo family saloon cars in the UK because of a
minor defect to the handbrake lever. The recalled cars were made between
March and June this year at Ford's Belgian factory in Genk. The defect is
only in right-hand-drive vehicles.
The handbrake design has been adjusted and Ford said that dealers would fit
a new handgrip to the brake lever of affected cars.

The plant will be run by a jointly owned company, Fellside Heat and Power,
using gas supplied by British Gas. It will supply steam and heat to
Sellafield and about 100MW of electricity to Hydro-Electric.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Midlands export growth falters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURERS in the west Midlands do not expect a significant rise in
export orders before the end of next year, the regional council of the
Confederation of British Industry said yesterday, Tim Burt writes.
The council blamed the downturn in export growth on the recession in
Germany. It said motor component manufacturers had been particularly hard
hit by falling demand from mainland Europe.
Local business leaders fear that the weak demand could undermine signs of
recovery among manufacturers in the Midlands, where 260 German companies
have subsidiary plants.
Mr Bryan Townsend, regional council chairman, said that more businesses were
trying to exploit markets in the Far East and North America to offset
problems in Europe and flat demand at home.
His comments followed the publication of a quarterly economic survey of
business trends in the west Midlands, carried out by Birmingham Chamber of
Commerce, which found that only 1 per cent of companies reported any
increase in their export deliveries in the last quarter.
The CBI said that the full effects of last year's devaluation in terms of
new orders and completed export deliveries would not be apparent for 12
months.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Confident Major dismisses leadership threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major has dismissed the possibility of a challenge to his leadership
in November amid indications that his opponents on the right of the
Conservative party cannot muster enough support for a contest.
His confidence follows assurances from Lady Thatcher that she will use her
influence on the right of the Tory party to defuse an immediate threat to
the prime minister.
In spite of her well-known criticism of a range of government policies,
ministers have been told Lady Thatcher will use a newspaper interview
tomorrow to voice public support for Mr Major.
They will attempt to cement the truce at next week's Blackpool conference by
highlighting the achievements of her administration during the 1980s.
But with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, determined to keep open the
option of tax increases in his November Budget, ministers are still bracing
themselves for a wave of unrest at the Blackpool conference.
Members of the rightwing '92 group' of Tory MPs warned yesterday that the
group's decision to discourage public attacks on the prime minister did not
mean they were ready to halt their campaign against tax increases.
They hope a threatened conference backlash against the imposition of VAT on
domestic fuel will strengthen their position and increase the pressure for
additional cuts in public spending. Mr Clarke, however, is still thought to
regard higher taxes as essential to speed up the reduction in the
government's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement.
The prime minister has privately ridiculed suggestions that Mr Clarke has
been deliberately positioning himself as the front-runner in any leadership
contest. The two are working closely together on the shape of the Budget.
After careful soundings by Tory party managers, Mr Major has told colleagues
he is certain that his critics will not secure the support of the 34 Tory
MPs needed to trigger a leadership challenge next month.
That view is shared by his opponents, although some were warning yesterday
that if Mr Major does not restore his grip on the government, the position
would quickly change.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, hopes to exploit the fact that many
grassroots activists are annoyed by the sniping at Mr Major by some MPs. In
spite of anger in the constituencies over VAT and over rising crime rates,
there is little support for a leadership contest.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, will seek to answer the concern over
law and order with a speech to the conference signalling a reversal of the
'liberal' approach adopted by successive home secretaries during the 1980s.
In particular, he will announce changes in the law relating to a defendant's
automatic right to silence.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Offer near for BBC service

<TEXT>
A MANAGEMENT buy-out team is about to make an offer for the Executive
Business Club, the specialist television subscription service in
receivership. It was the founding programme on BBC Select, which broadcasts
subscription programmes to specially adapted video recorders in night hours.
Lancashire Enterprises, the Preston-based venture-capital group, is believed
to be interested in backing the company.
The club broadcasts management training programmes covering everything from
sales to the importance of cash flow.
In June Management TV International, the company behind Executive Business
Club, ran into cash problems of its own, coinciding with a decision by the
BBC not to expand BBC Select.
According to receivers Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the company has an estimated total
deficit of more than Pounds 2.5m, although this does not include
intellectual property rights in films which were written off when made.
Coopers has called a meeting of unsecured creditors at its Manchester office
on October 14.
Management TV International has Pounds 300,000 share capital, Pounds 200,000
of which was provided by the BBC.

FT  02 OCT 93 / PIA sets capital base requirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulatory
body for retail financial services, has adopted a controversial rule on
capital adequacy that is opposed by many independent financial advisers.
All advisers who join the PIA will be required to maintain a minimum capital
base of Pounds 10,000. Advisers will be able to certify themselves and
include personal assets.
The rule will apply to members transferring from Fimbra, the existing
self-regulatory body for independent financial advisers, as well as to new
entrants to the industry.
The board is considering higher capital requirements for larger
organisations.
Minimum capital requirements were laid out by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of
the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog,
as a prerequisite for the authority's establishment.
The authority's staff recommended approval of the measure, but the board has
been reluctant. Last week Sir Gordon Downey, PIA chairman, resigned abruptly
and was replaced by Mr Joe Palmer, formerly an SIB board member.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Firefighters' strike ballot suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of a firefighters' dispute this autumn faded yesterday when the
Fire Brigade Union's general secretary Mr Ken Cameron (above) announced the
suspension of the strike ballot due to start on Monday, Robert Taylor
writes.
He expected the employers to honour the pay formula in full at their meeting
on October 12.
He said that it was 'part of the union's responsible approach' to postpone
the strike ballot until the pay figure was known.
The two sides yesterday said they had agreed they were 'committed to the
fire service pay formula'. This links firefighters' salaries to the upper
quartile of male manual workers' earnings.
'The strike ballot is on hold,' warned Mr Cameron. 'If the employers are
stupid enough not to honour their commitment to the formula, then we will go
ahead.'

FT  02 OCT 93 / Companies may have to review internal controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES WOULD be required to provide a statement in their annual accounts
describing any significant weaknesses in their internal financial control
systems, under strongly-worded proposals issued yesterday.
They would be required to attempt to quantify the weaknesses and describe
corrective action, according to draft guidelines developed following
recommendations of last December's Cadbury report on the financial aspects
of corporate governance.
The 66-page document, drafted by a working party under the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, is likely to prove highly
controversial and provoke substantial opposition from companies which feel
the guidelines are too detailed and impractical.
Many smaller companies are concerned because they do not have strong
formalised internal control systems and the requirements could impose
considerable extra costs. The guidelines do provide some concessions for
smaller businesses.
The proposals are open for consultation until February 28 next year, and are
likely to be subject to considerable delays before becoming mandatory.
KPMG Peat Marwick and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, two of the UK's largest accounting
companies,yesterday welcomed the statement, as did the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Scotland which has called for greater emphasis on
internal controls.
But the Institute of Internal Auditors criticised the guidelines for not
requiring directors to provide more detailed information on other aspects of
their companies' operations.

FT  02 OCT 93 / US prison chief joins private jail group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF Britain's new private-sector prison companies has appointed Mr
Michael Quinlan, until recently director of the US Federal Bureau of
Prisons, to its board.
Mr Quinlan, who occupied the most senior executive position in the US prison
system, is joining UK Detention Services. The company runs Blakenhurst in
Hereford and Worcester - one of only two private prisons operating in the UK
 -and is a consortium of John Mowlem, Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons and
Corrections Corporation of America.
The appointment of Mr Quinlan, who has 21 years' experience of public-sector
prison management in the US, illustrates the way emerging private prison
operators are preparing for a substantial growth in business opportunities.
With no previous expertise in the private sector, the companies are having
to seek it elsewhere. UK Detention Services and Group 4, which runs the
Wolds remand centre, Humberside, have attracted directors and managers
formerly with the UK public sector.
Last month Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, announced that a further 10
prisons would join Wolds and Blakenhurst under private management. Mr Derek
Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, yesterday said that his
agency was negotiating to buy a site for one of these - the former Parc
hospital at Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan.
The Bridgend prison, and another new one planned for Liverpool, are the
first establishments for which the private sector will be invited to bid to
finance, design, build and manage. In addition, eight existing prisons will
be transferred to private management under the government's proposals.
Ministers believe that the plan for 12 privately managed prisons - nearly 10
per cent of the total prison estate - will be enough to create and sustain a
viable private sector.
The next private contract to be awarded will be for the management of the
new Doncaster prison. Bids went to the Prison Service last week.
There are about eight companies interested in prison management in Britain.
It is likely the market will sustain about half of these.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Lib Dems win Tory council seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVES lost seats in five local-authority by-elections on Thursday in
a set of results which will intensify pressure on the party's leadership at
next week's annual conference.
Liberal Democrats gained from the Conservatives in five seats spread across
southern England: Debenham, Mid Suffolk; Belfairs, Southend; Heatherside,
Surrey Heath; Witham, West Lindsey; and St Peter's, Worcester. They also
gained one seat from an independent in Market Drayton, Shropshire.
Even in the one seat successfully defended by the Conservatives, in
Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, there was a swing of more than 30 per cent to the
Liberal Democrats.
Dr Michael Thrasher, local election analyst for the Local Government
Chronicle, said the latest figures add to an alarming trend for the
Conservatives. In August the party endured its worst local election results
since surveys began in the early 1980s, and the results suggest the party's
showing is even poorer than when the Community Charge - or poll tax - was
introduced.
He said: 'The seats the Tories are now defending should be their bedrock
because they have not been lost in the May elections of the last few years,
when they have usually been hammered except in 1992. They did so badly,
particularly in 1990, that the Conservatives should actually be making net
gains in by-elections.'
During September, Municipal Journal reported a net loss of 11 local seats
for the Conservatives, while Labour gained a net two, and the Liberal
Democrats eight.
Municipal Journal found that Liberal Democrat votes were up an average of
16.3 per cent since 1992, and 8.8 per cent since 1991. There were also
swings to Labour, of 10.6 per cent since 1992, and 4.8 per cent since 1991.
Conservative Central Office admitted that the results were 'extremely
disappointing,' but added: 'They reflect a protest vote, yet offer little
comfort for Labour, even with all their publicity over the last week.'

FT  02 OCT 93 / Conservative donations fall 61%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE party's bank overdraft more than doubled to Pounds 15.3m in
the year to March 31, according to its first comprehensive set of accounts
published yesterday.
Donations fell by 61 per cent to Pounds 7.8m and voluntary contributions
from constituency parties fell 18 per cent to Pounds 1.1m.
The decline reflected unusually high level of contributions in the previous
year during the general election, but the party also said it might reflect
grass-roots dissatisfaction.
The operating deficit for the year however fell from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds
2.2m, and would have been Pounds 1.9m before changes in the accounting
policies.
Net current liabilities in the balance sheet rose from Pounds 17.3m last
year to Pounds 19.2m. The party pays no corporation tax, although other
taxes amounted to Pounds 13m during the year.
The accounts include a balance sheet for the first time, which includes five
subsidiaries not directly owned by the party: Arun Association, Bourne
Association, Colne Association, The 1949 Conservative &amp; Unionist Trust and
The Conservative Party Association.
The figures show that there were interest-free loans and cash deposits -
described as 'primarily from constituency associations' - which increased
from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 2.7m.
They also show that a valuation of properties at the end of March reduced
the value of Conservative Central Office in London by Pounds 2m to Pounds
5.25m. Other freehold properties were valued at Pounds 660,000.
Redundancy and reorganisation costs during the year were Pounds 507,000.
Total expenditure fell from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 12.5m.
The party said the greater disclosure came in response to management changes
and the commitment of Mr John Major, the prime minister, to more open
government.
It said it had only ever had one offshore bank account, based in Jersey,
which had been closed in May last year.
There was no mention of the controversy over donations from foreign
businessmen or from Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive Polly Peck chairman.
Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, said the Conservatives aimed to break
even this year, but were determined to step up assistance to constituency
associations, 'especially in marginal seats facing difficulties retaining an
agent'.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Indian quake toll may top 28,000

THE death toll from Thursday morning's earthquake in Maharashtra state rose
yesterday, as Indian rescue teams extricated more bodies from the debris.
Rescue had been disrupted when power and telecommunications collapsed on
Thursday. These were restored early yesterday.
State television reported the death toll as 21,000 but officials said it
could total 28,000 once the rescue operations had reached the entire area.
Survivors - especially in the Killari and Latur regions, where entire
villages were flattened - performed mass burials of the dead with whatever
firewood they could find. Thousands of villagers, many of them suddenly left
without family or belongings, joined in the relief operations, disposing of
bodies of men, women and children, some of them huddled together. A downpour
in the region hampered the work.
Mr S B Chavan, home minister, who surveyed the area yesterday, said
immediate problems faced by the administration included the need to bury the
dead, and the lack of clean drinking water. He said a special team would
tackle these issues.
The cabinet, which held an emergency meeting in New Delhi yesterday, told
the agriculture ministry to make available tractors, agricultural implements
and seeds to enable farmers to salvage crops in the sugar-cane and cotton
Marathwada region of Maharashtra, which has been affected by the quake, but
not devastated as the Osmanabad and Latur regions have been.
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, who said on Thursday that he did
not want VIP movements to disrupt relief operations, will visit Killari and
Latur today to review relief operations.
The government was criticised by the opposition Bharatiya Janata party,
whose leader, Mr Lal Krishna Advani, abandoned campaign preparations for the
state assembly elections in November to rush to the area on Thursday.
Mr Advani said the government had failed to take action in villages in the
Killari area, despite representations from village heads pointing out that
the region had experienced 1,500 tremors in the past year.

MR Khieu Samphan, president of the radical Khmer Rouge in Cambodia,
yesterday arrived in the capital, Phnom Penh, for talks with King Norodom
Sihanouk, writes Iain Simpson in Phnom Penh.
The Khmer Rouge is at its lowest ebb for almost three decades, having
suffered several military setbacks in the past six weeks.
On his arrival, Mr Khieu said he had come to 'pay our respectful homage' to
King Sihanouk, and to show Khmer Rouge support for the monarchy and for the
new Cambodian constitution. However, he avoided mentioning the new
government, which the group has repeatedly attacked via its clandestine
radio station.
The day before his arrival in the city, the two Cambodian prime ministers
wrote to Mr Khieu, laying out the conditions for their holding peace talks
with the Khmer Rouge. These included its recognition of what they called the
'royal and legitimate government', and its acceptance that the talks would
be between a legal government and a group, not between two equal entities.
The Khmer Rouge responded with its own proposal of a ceasefire monitored by
an independent commission.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Dollars 2bn pledged for Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday hailed as 'a
striking success' a donor conference of 47 governments and organisations in
Washington. It attracted pledges of about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) over
the five-year interim period of limited Palestinian self-rule, and evoked
promises of more to come.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, predicted that donations would
eventually exceed the Dollars 2.4bn which the World Bank has estimated will
be required in external aid for the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
However, Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, said yesterday that the Dollars 2bn was not enough and the
Palestinians needed at least Dollars 5bn.
The US committed Dollars 500m, although Dollars 100m will have strings in
that it comes from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation as loans,
loan guarantees and political risk insurance to support US private
investment.
Continuing the stress on economics, Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan and Mr
Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, met at the White House and agreed to
work on economic and environmental matters, even before any agreement on the
more divisive security and border issues.
The two sides agreed to establish a joint economic committee, which could
also become a receptor for donor funds.
'We are moving this process very quickly,' said President Bill Clinton, who
met the prince and the minister. He claimed to be undeterred by the Arab
rejection of his call for an end to the economic boycott of Israel.
Israel itself pledged Dollars 75m to the donors' fund, Saudi Arabia, Dollars
100m and Japan Dollars 200m. The EC - the largest donor - will give Dollars
600m.
The World Bank and a Palestinian committee will take part in managing the
fund, while the UN takes charge of immediate relief needs.
At the state department, officials from the donor countries talked of the
urgent need to get aid quickly into action on the ground, so as to spread
hope in Gaza and the West Bank.
Mr Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank, said on Thursday that the
bank was planning to provide some Dollars 450m of its own money over the
next two years, including a Dollars 50m loan likely to be approved by its
board in the next two weeks.
At first, the aid will pay for road maintenance, irrigation and housing.
Later, projects will include provision of a clean water supply, improved
transportation infrastructure, a reliable source of energy, and
environmental preservation.
Reuter adds: Syrian President Hafez al-Assad yesterday poured cold water on
Mideast peace advances saying an Israeli-Syrian agreement was less likely
than before the Israeli deal with the PLO.

ISRAEL'S deputy foreign minister Yossi Beilin yesterday denied that Israel
had promised to halt the hunt for wanted Palestinians, in the wake of the
Israel-PLO autonomy accord, writes David Horovitz in Jerusalem.
He was reacting to PLO protests about the recent arrest of six Palestinian
intifada (uprising) activists in the occupied West Bank.
PLO chairman Yassir Arafat has lodged a protest, via an intermediary, with
Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres, over the army's capture on Wednesday
morning, in the Jenin area of the West Bank, of six leading members of the
Black Panthers, an armed Palestinian group believed to have killed dozens of
Palestinian 'collaborators' and several Israelis.
Mr Arafat said he had instructed the Black Panthers and other such groups to
lay down their weapons after the signing of the peace accord almost three
weeks ago.
They had complied, on the understanding that the security forces would stop
hunting them. But Mr Beilin said no such under- standing had been agreed by
Israel, and senior army sources confirmed yesterday that the search for
wanted Palestinians would continue.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Japanese warn of further downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government warned yesterday that the economy might be entering
a new phase of downturn, as a fall in job openings reflected the pressure on
many companies to cut costs by dismissing workers.
Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, the international trade and industry minister, asked
that companies attempt to solve their surplus labour problem 'internally,'
meaning that they should transfer staff within the company rather than cut
the workforce.
His comments reflect widespread concern that dismissals could further
undermine consumer confidence and cause deeper social damage by ending the
promise of lifetime employment in Japan.
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, also said he was very worried by
signs that the job market was deteriorating, as highlighted by a fall in the
job offers to applicants ratio from 72:100 in July to 70:100 in August.
New job offers in manufacturing fell by 26 per cent year-on-year, while new
offers in the service sector fell by 13.8 per cent, surprising government
officials who hoped that this sector would absorb surplus labour.
The Management and Co-ordination Agency said the seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate in August was 2.5 per cent, unchanged from a month
earlier, though the government tends to regard the job offers ratio as a
more accurate reflection of labour market trends.
Most large companies have reduced their annual intake of graduates and plan
to trim the workforce through natural attrition, but the government fears
that the yen's rapid appreciation and weak domestic demand will force
further job cuts.
Japanese manufacturers, responding to the yen's rise, have recently rushed
to invest in lower-cost east Asian sites, and Mr Kumagai warned that the
investment flow could lead to a hollowing-out of the technology industry.
The pressure on manufacturers was indicated by a 5 per cent year-on-year
fall in new vehicle sales in September, the sixth consecutive month of
decline.
The Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said passenger car sales dipped
2.5 per cent, while truck sales slipped 9.9 per cent.
Meanwhile, the Labour Ministry said overtime hours worked in the
manufacturing sector contracted 10.9 per cent from a year earlier,
continuing a fall that began in December 1990.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and China failed to narrow their differences over proposed
democratic reforms for Hong Kong, in talks at the United Nations yesterday,
but they managed to make some progress on the question of financing a new
airport.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, had a three-hour meeting
with Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, taking advantage of their
presence in New York for the UN General Assembly.
Mr Hurd told reporters afterwards that 'a considerable gap' remained between
the two sides. 'I cannot say we have narrowed it today,' he said, adding
that he had voiced his disappointment to Mr Qian.
Confirming that a 13th round of talks at a lower level would take place this
month, he emphasised that there was not an 'infinite' amount of time to
resolve their dispute.
No deadline had been set but Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, would have
to move unilaterally to propose the enactment of necessary laws if there
were no agreement.
Mr Hurd said it was not the pace of democracy that was in dispute; the
argument was over whether elections to be held in 1995 - two years before
the colony is due to revert to China - would be 'fair, open and acceptable'.
On the airport question, on which there had been 'some progress but not
enough', he said this was a practical matter that should not have a
political dimension. The government, concerned about Hong Kong's future
prosperity, was anxious to 'avoid a vacuum' affecting air service agreements
in 1997.
The government had put forward its ideas, which he did not spell out. He and
Mr Qian had discussed them at the meeting. 'I hope it will be possible to
reach agreement,' Mr Hurd said.

THE US, Britain and France yesterday introduced a Security Council
resolution tightening sanctions against Libya to press Tripoli to handing
over for trial two men accused of blowing up a Pan Am airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, Reuter reports from New York.
No vote has been scheduled in the 15-member council on the draft. The
document suggests a freezing of Libya's financial assets abroad, but
excludes funds derived from oil, natural gas or agricultural products.
It proposes a ban on the sale of oil-related equipment for refineries and
for transporting oil and gives a detailed list of this equipment. It also
closes loopholes on the air embargo against Libya, in force since April
1992, such as immediate closure of Libyan airline offices abroad.

MR Abimael Guzman, the jailed leader of the Maoist guerrilla group Shining
Path (Sendero Luminoso), is offering to negotiate a peace accord with the
Peruvian government, President Alberto Fujimori told the UN general assembly
in New York yesterday.
At a news conference after his address, Mr Fujimori showed reporters a
hand-written letter which seemed to bear the signatures of Mr Guzman and his
chief lieutenant, Ms Elena Iparraguirre, verified by their fingerprints.
Seeming to abandon a long-maintained rejection of any political line but his
own, Mr Guzman recognises Mr Fujimori as president and requests
'conversations which would lead to the conclusion of the war'. Thirteen
years of conflict have cost 26,000 Peruvian lives and the equivalent of some
Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14bn) in damage.
The letter was written from the prison at the naval base at Callao, the port
of Lima, where Mr Guzman and three other senior Shining Path people are
serving life sentences.
Mr Fujimori rejected any prospect of negotiating reductions in the leaders'
sentences.

AT LEAST 300 people were killed and more than 500 wounded in what the Sri
Lankan army calls the biggest battle for more than two years in its war
against Tamil guerrillas fighting for independence in the north of the
island.
The heavy casualties come soon after President D. B. Wijetunga had promised
a new offensive against the guerrillas, after the assassination in May by a
Tamil suicide bomber of President Premadasa.
The Sri Lankan defence ministry said last night that 114 soldiers had been
killed and nearly 250 injured in the battle for Elephant Pass, which joins
the Tamil Tiger stronghold on the Jaffna peninsula to the Sri Lankan
mainland.
It said the army, backed by jet fighters, had killed over 200 guerrillas and
wounded more than 250 at the end of the third day of the new offensive.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Nigerian reform promised
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHIEF Ernest Shonekan, leader of the military-backed interim government of
Nigeria, yesterday pledged rapid implementation of the country's stalled
economic reform programme and the repeal of recent decrees to curb press
freedom.
Speaking on the country's 33rd independence anniversary, he acknowledged
that reform had been 'hamstrung by the political crisis of the past several
months.'
The government was determined to reduce the budget deficit, the chief said,
'by curtailing extra-budgetary expenditure'.
This was an implicit reference to the diversion of the proceeds of an
estimated 200,000 barrels of oil per day to so-called designated accounts
not subject to independent auditing.
'Fiscal co-ordination and transparency in public financial management' would
be a priority, said Chief Shonekan.
A campaign against the annulment of the June presidential poll and the
extension on military rule until a fresh poll, due next February, fizzled
out yesterday.
The main city, Lagos, was mostly back to normal as support fell away for a
three-day stayaway organised by the Campaign for Democracy (CD), which began
on Wednesday.
Support was poor from the start of a campaign which began with a march to
deliver a petition to the Lagos state governor.
Police fired teargas to break it up and CD leaders said 58 people were
arrested.
Chief Moshood Abiola, who returned on Friday after eight weeks abroad
seeking support for his claim to the presidency, has not been prominent. He
did not take part in the protests on Wednesday. These were mostly limited to
cities in Chief Abiola's south-western home region.

The United Nations is sending emergency relief supplies to Georgia for at
least 70,000 people known to have fled the breakaway region of Abkhazia, and
says it expects the numbers of refugees to swell in coming days, writes
Frances Williams from Geneva.
Mr Robert Souria, head of relief co-ordination in the UN's humanitarian
affairs department, said yesterday that many had escaped to the town of
Mestia in the mountains of north Abkhazia, which was virtually inaccessible
by road. Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, is packed with refugees and
thousands have arrived by boat in the Black Sea ports of Poti and Sotchi.
The UN plans to airfreight 40 tonnes of supplies, mostly clothes and
blankets, to the region next Tuesday but needs Dollars 200,000 to finance a
second air and helicopter shipment, Mr Souria said.

<TEXT>
Mr Padraig Flynn, the EC Commissioner for Social Affairs, yesterday said
important changes were needed in research, training, industrial relations
and the mobility of pension funds, in order to tackle unemployment, which
could rise to 20m in the EC next year, writes Tim Coone from Dublin.
He told Irish pension fund managers in Dublin that the traditional maxim
that employment growth could be achieved through economic growth had failed
in Europe.
To help combat this, he said, the community must dedicate more resources to
research and training. 'We cannot compete with the low-cost countries of
east Asia. . . we have lost the world edge in research, and so we must
re-establish that and apply it coherently to stay ahead in our levels of
training and use this to maintain our competitiveness and job creation
possibilities'.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Japan moves up foreign investors' league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN overtook the UK in 1992 as the world's second largest national source
of foreign investment, despite a steep slowdown in the growth of
international direct investment since 1990, according to a study by the US
Department of Commerce. The US remains the leading source of investment.
The study says a surge in foreign investment like that seen in the 1980s -
with annual increases averaging 19.4 per cent - is unlikely to occur
'without a further liberalisation of investment barriers'. Foreign direct
investment grew last year by just 5.5 per cent to Dollars 1,900bn (Pounds
1,270bn).
Stimulus could come from liberalisation of investment rules due to
successful completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks; from
removal of investment restraints at the sub-national level and in such
regulated industries as telecommunications, airlines, utilities, and natural
resources; from a surge in privatisation of state-owned companies; and from
agreement on harmonising national competition policies.
At the end of 1992, the stock of US outward investment amounted to Dollars
489bn. The UK, with a stock of Dollars 243bn after two years of negligible
growth, was overtaken by Japan, with Dollars 248bn. This follows a five-year
surge to 1990, during which Japan's foreign direct investment grew at an
annual rate of almost 37 per cent. Growth has since slowed, amounting to
just 7 per cent last year.
Investment into the US has plummeted, the report shows, with the US falling
behind the UK, France and the Netherlands in 1992 as the single largest host
to foreign deirect investment. After inflows had grown by an annual average
of 19 per cent in the second half of the 1980s, growth slowed to a mere 1.2
per cent last year.
'A chief factor was. . . a stagnant US economy, which lowered the perceived
need for new investment, as well as potential future earnings for foreign
investors,' said Mr John Rutter, the report's author.
Other factors included high start-up costs, large interest payments for new
operations, and severe liquidity and excess capacity problems in sectors
such as banking, finance, property and retailing.
By last year, Japan had become the largest single source of foreign
investment in the US, with a stock of Dollars 96.7bn. This amounted to 23
per cent of all foreign investment in the US, compared with just 6 per cent
in 1980, the study says. Japan has become the largest investor in the Asia
region, with the stock of planned investment up from Dollars 19bn in 1985 to
Dollars 60bn last year.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Italians begin to learn the economic facts of life: After
decades of cushioned existence, the harsh truth of unemployment is now
striking home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOB LOSSES across Italian industry are bringing home the harsh truth that
the long-hallowed concept of job security has ended.
On present trends, 400,000 workers are likely to lose their jobs this year,
bringing the unemployment rate to 11 per cent of the active population.
The jobs squeeze, which began in 1991, cannot simply be blamed on the
domestic recession and slack growth among Italy's trading partners. A
significant part of unemployment is occurring in mature or loss-making
industries such as chemicals/fertilisers, construction, defence steel and
shipbuilding.
The restructuring problems of state-run companies have tended to be felt
most acutely among their sub-contractors. The latter have been the first to
shed labour and protests have broken out across the country.
In the south, where unemployment is running at 23 per cent or more,
frustrated workers have staged violent and angry protests. Only spectacular
gestures, such as the violent occupation of the chemicals plant at Crotone
earlier this month, draw the attention of Rome and move public opinion.
Occupying the railway lines is one of many desperate tactics used by workers
to highlight factory closures. Demonstrators have blocked the Italian
railways 11 times this month, occupying the lines for 200 hours.
In the north, where the unemployment rate averages 7 per cent, the protests
over job losses have been more disciplined. This is because trades unions
exercise greater control and believe in demonstrating their strength through
formal strikes and street marches.
Unemployment is being exacerbated by two factors. Successive Italian
governments having ignored EC demands to cut subsidies to state industries,
the Ciampi administration is now obliged to adhere to Community norms in a
hurry.
In the case of steel this is going to mean unspecified but substantial job
cuts.
At the same time the need to reduce the public sector deficit is forcing
through large-scale privatisation and this inevitably means job losses. Much
of the state sector has previously padded payrolls and personnel recommended
by politicians.
The shock is all the greater since Italy has no formal unemployment benefit.
Instead,a system has evolved of funding redundancy through state and
employer contributions.
A person laid off can obtain up to 80 per cent of salary for two years.
Unless a special case can be made, the pay-packet is thereafter cut to a
minimum wage for a further year, (which in special cases can also be
extended). Only after this process is complete will a person be taken off
the company's books and placed on a transfer list that in theory ensures
priority in the new jobs queue.
The system was designed to absorb short downturns in the economic cycle, so
trained workers could easily be laid off and rehired. The Italian motor
industry has benefited enormously from this system.
However, this procedure was based on the premise that the employee would be
re-absorbed by the employer. As such it is wholly inadequate to accommodate
long-term structural unemployment or to deal with the effects of a long,
deep, recession.
The employment picture will not improve in the short term, the Bank of Italy
has warned, even if the recession bottoms out early next year.
But the government has only a limited mandate and is unlikely to have time
to address a fundamental issue like drafting a new system of unemployment
benefit. Nor can it easily provide measures to give a quick boost to jobs,
as both this year's budget and that of 1994 are conditioned by the need to
cut public spending.
Some L10,000bn (Pounds 4.1bn) has been found from unused public works funds,
while a further L1,275bn has been earmarked for youth employment schemes and
developing alternatives to replace the cuts to come in the steel industry. A
start will be also made on introducing job training schemes and temporary
work contracts. But the government will have to rely on fire-fighting
techniques, and hope that any one protest does not get out of hand.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Russia's rebel parliament turns down deal to surrender arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DEAL to end the siege of the Russian parliament was rejected yesterday by
the rebel deputies.
The deal agreed by presidential and parliamentary negotiators would have
restored services to the White House in exchange for deputies and their
supporters handing in most of their weapons.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, gave a curt television interview in
which he insisted that the handing over of weapons was an indispensable
precondition to talks. 'It is difficult even to deal with them (the
deputies),' he said.
Although the White House defenders stayed put, the government has won a
propaganda battle in making the parliamentary side appear to be fighting
less to defend the constitution than for the right to remain armed.
In the White House, where electricity was restored for a few hours this
morning before being cut off again, General Alexander Rutskoi, the former
vice president named as acting president by the deputies, said that arms
would only be 'stored' once the thousands of troops ringing the parliament
were removed.
Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff and head of his
negotiating team, said last night that 'experts' from both sides would meet
overnight to discuss measures on disarming the White House. The negotiators
would meet again this morning under the aegis of the Russian Orthodox Church
Patriarch Alexei II in his headquarters in the Donskoi Monastery in Moscow.
Mr Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's mayor, said the president's side would insist that
all weapons other than those legally held by the parliamentary guard must be
stored under seal by officials of the Interior and Security Ministry. He
estimated there were more than 2,000 weapons in the White House, including
machine guns, grenade launchers and 'so-called missiles'. These weapons were
in the hands of 600 paramilitaries who were organised in at least five
independent groups.
It was not clear, he said, that the parliamentary side would or could
negotiate. The original negotiators, Mr Ramazan Abdulatipov and Mr Veniamin
Sokolov, chairmen of parliament's two chambers, had agreed the original
protocol to disarm - and had been repudiated.
A second team, led by Mr Yuri Voronin, a hardline deputy chairman of
parliament, had refused to sign any protocol: Mr Filatov said: 'I have the
impression that they don't want these talks.'
Pro-Yeltsin deputies last night attacked aspects of Mr Yeltsin's proposals
to replace the old parliament with a new body. They complained that Mr
Yeltsin had not fulfilled the terms of an agreement with them to increase
the numbers of deputies to be elected on a party list system to the State
Duma - the lower house of the proposed new federal assembly.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Germans and Spanish jostle to keep VW jobs
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS of tension between the Volkswagen management and its largest
shareholder, the Lower Saxony government, emerged yesterday as confusion
grew over the future of VW's Spanish subsidiary, Seat.
Mr Gerhard Schroder, the Social Democrat prime minister of Lower Saxony,
where most VW production is based, made plain that his main preoccupation
was the protection of jobs and factories in his constituency.
He issued a statement yesterday after Spanish union leaders proclaimed on
German television that the threat of closure hanging over Seat's Zona Franca
factory in Barcelona, which employs 10,500, had been lifted.
Jubilant Spanish broadcasters quoted the officials as saying they were
'enormously satisfied' by talks with senior Volkswagen group executives in
Wolfsburg.
Volkswagen officials were markedly more circumspect, cautioning that the
crisis at Seat, heading for a DM1.25bn (Pounds 500m) loss this year, was to
be 'investigated'.
A formal statement issued after the talks said only that the Seat management
and worker representatives would examine ways of securing the future of
Seat, 'especially in the light of the critical situation' at Zona Franca.
Efforts would be made to reach a joint solution for the future of the works,
it added.
Mr Schroder, a member of the VW supervisory board which hires and fires
executives, is considered likely to resist any significant back-tracking on
rationalisation plans for Spain.
If VW, which is heading for a loss this year, cannot make considerable
savings elsewhere, then the board may have to step up its hitherto modest
programme of job cuts in Germany.
Volkswagen employs more than 110,000 in Germany, almost half in its home
base in Wolfsburg.
'The security of jobs and production sites in Lower Saxony and the
well-being of the whole group are the primary concerns of state government
policy,' Mr Schroder said.
He added that he did not want to be involved in negotiations on
restructuring Seat. Decisions affecting the subsidiary were exclusively a
matter for management, he said.
And he responded coolly to proposals from Spain that he should meet
political leaders from Seat's home region, Catalonia.
He did not exclude talks, he said, but any discussion would have to be held
in the presence of Volkswagen executives, he said.
Yesterday's events were prompted by a mid-week clash after which Mr Juan
Antonio Daz Alvarez, Seat chairman, resigned when his proposals for
restructuring Seat were rejected as 'insufficient' and 'too soft' by the VW
group board.
Negotiations will continue next week, when Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman,
and his controversial production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, will meet national and regional officials in Spain.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CUMMINS, the US diesel engine maker, and Kamaz, the Russian truck producer,
are to build a Dollars 300m (Pounds 195m) engine plant after a fire in April
wiped out half Kamaz's uninsured engine-producing capacity.
Mr Henry Schacht, Cummins' chairman, said the new plant, to produce 50,000
diesel engines a year, could come on stream in 1996-7, and marked a 'larger
project on a much shorter time scale' than earlier plans for a joint venture
to produce just 20,000 engines.
He said the 'world class plant' would be financed by a mixture of equity
investment by both companies, and loans from international financial
institutions. These are likely to include multilateral organisations such as
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The bank has been
hard-pressed to find Russian investment projects, as western commercial
banks have stopped financing Russian projects without official western
guarantees.
Mr Nikolai Bekh, chairman of Kamaz, said he hoped the new engines would
enable Kamaz to increase truck exports to the west from 12 to 30 per cent of
output.

<TEXT>
A FORMER senior civil servant in the Italian Health Ministry is having
difficulty explaining how he came to possess gold bars, coins and jewellery
worth some L200bn (Pounds 83.8m). This is only part of the wealth
magistrates have uncovered in the past week which Mr Duilio Poggiolini
claims to have earned from 'consultancy'.
Four Italian bank accounts with funds totalling L17bn, plus another one in
Geneva holding SFr11m (Pounds 5m), have been traced to Mr Poggiolini and his
wife.
Milan and Naples magistrates investigating large-scale bribery and
corruption in the Health Ministry allege that Mr Poggiolini abused his role
as the official in charge of approval and distribution of pharmaceuticals to
enrich himself on an unprecedented scale. This is the biggest collection of
wealth unearthed by magistrates in the 18-month investigations into
corruption.
In one of Mr Poggiolini's flat a stockpile of 100 gold bars was found that
included eight ingots of one kilo.
There was also a hoard of gold sterling coins, krugerrands, and special gold
mintings from countries ranging from the Soviet Union to Haiti and the
Central African Republic.
Mr Francesco de Lorenzo, the Liberal health minister under whom Mr
Poggiolini last served, was last week protected from arrest by a
parliamentary vote. But he faces charges of corruption relating to money
allegedly extorted from pharmaceutical companies.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Duchy ponders end to Belgian franc link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUXEMBOURG is examining what impact a devaluation of the Belgian franc would
have on the 71-year-old currency link between the two countries.
But it is already clear to highly-placed observers of the Luxembourg economy
that it would be politically difficult, if not impossible, to break the
currency link.
Market rumour about a possible rupture between the Belgian and Luxembourg
francs was fuelled on Thursday by Luxembourg's announcement of the terms for
its first public bond auction. Bond traders were surprised that the coupon
on the Luxembourg 10-year bond was substantially lower than the yield on
Belgian 10-year bonds, in spite of the fact that the currencies are
interchangeable.
Luxembourg believes breaking the link would have drastic consequences for
the future of European monetary union, because it would break up the central
core of EC currencies around the D-Mark. It would also leave the Luxembourg
franc exposed to heavy speculation on international currency markets.
The most realistic alternative to currency association with Belgium would be
direct links with Germany. That would be an unpalatable solution for many
older Luxembourgers, who still remember wartime occupation by their
neighbour. Furthermore, Luxembourg would have little or no say in the
Bundesbank's decisions on monetary policy, whereas Belgian bank decisions
are taken in collaboration with the Grand Duchy's authorities.
Belgium and Luxembourg have been part of a currency association and economic
union since 1922, and the agreement to link currencies was renewed for a
further 10 years last year.
The Belgian national bank, which refuses to comment on the future of the
link, has consistently and strongly denied that it is considering floating
the franc.
But Belgium's firm strategy of shadowing the D-Mark has come under
increasing pressure since August's currency crisis, when the fluctuation
bands of the European exchange rate mechanism were relaxed.
Having raised interest rates to counter speculation against the franc last
month, the Belgian central bank has since announced four cuts in the central
rate.
On Thursday the central rate was reduced from 9.75 per cent to 9.65 per
cent, and the Belgian franc weakened still further.
Mr Jean-Claude Koeune, chief economist at Banque Bruxelles Lambert in
Brussels, said: yesterday: 'The Luxembourg economy doesn't need a
depreciation of its currency against the D-Mark, considering about 40 per
cent of its imports come from Germany. That's why Luxembourg wants the
Belgian authorities to keep the link with the D-Mark.'
Luxembourg has examined cutting the link with the Belgian franc once before,
in 1982, after the currency was devalued. Then it was warned that breaking
the link would have negative consequences for the Grand Duchy.
Relinquishing the Belgian franc peg would prove very damaging for
Luxembourg's 200 or so banks, which have substantial assets in the Belgian
currency, especially bonds.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Nato allies to reassure Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE main Nato allies will try to reassure Russia about the prospects for an
early enlargement of the alliance without ruling out the possibility that
some eastern European countries may eventually join. Britain, France,
Germany and the US will co-ordinate their responses to a letter from
President Boris Yeltsin warning against an expansion of Nato and proposing
joint arrangements for guaranteeing the security of eastern Europe.
The letter was sent to the countries which were party to the 1990 'Two plus
Four' treaty on German unification.
Although Russian officials said the contents of the letter were
confidential, they made clear that Moscow considered an extension of Nato
would be in conflict with the spirit of the treaty.
The treaty, which allowed the whole of Germany to be part of Nato,
prohibited the stationing of foreign troops or nuclear weapons in former
eastern Germany. British officials said they rejected Moscow's
interpretation of this as precluding enlargement of the alliance. Article 10
of The North Atlantic Treaty stipulates that any other European state may be
invited to join.
Mr Yeltsin's initiative is seen as a bid to rectify what appears to have
been a rash statement during a recent visit to Warsaw, when he indicated
that Russia would have no objection to Poland's joining Nato. This was
poorly received by Russia's military establishment, which sees Russia
threatened with isolation next to an overwhelmingly dominant military bloc.
Nato's policy towards countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia
and Hungary, which all aspire to join, is set to be the focus of an alliance
summit in January. France and Britain, in particular, have been urging
caution.
In Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office said it saw Mr Yeltsin's letter
not as a rebuff 'but as an offer of co-operation'.

CROATIA yesterday played a game of brinkmanship at the United Nations,
holding firm to demands for a tougher peacekeeping mandate to enforce Serb
rebels to comply with a peace plan.
UN diplomats yesterday sought backing from Russia for a compromise proposal
for a new mandate for the 14,000-strong peacekeeping force in Croatia.
Russia on Thursday blocked the proposal which linked the lifting of severe
sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro to the resolution of the stand-off in
Croatia.
Croatian officials were disappointed that it stopped short of empowering
peacekeepers to give Zagreb control over Serb-held territory, which accounts
for one-third of Croatia and cuts the country in two.
In an effort to avert an all-out war between Serbia and Croatia, the
Security Council yesterday tried to renew the mandate, after gaining a
24-hour extension to persuade the Russians to back the plan.
In Geneva meanwhile, the international mediators in the Bosnian conflict,
Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, said they had no immediate plans to
reconvene the talks between the three warring factions, following the
rejection of the latest peace plan by the mainly Moslem Bosnian parliament
on Wednesday.
The mediators yesterday met Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, and General Jean Cot, the UN force commander in ex-Yugoslavia, to
discuss how to protect the humanitarian relief effort if the war continues.
Meanwhile, UNHCR officials said the agency had raised only half the Dollars
350m (Pounds 227m) estimated cost of its 'winterisation' programme for
Bosnia.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Moscow protagonists fear revolt by regions: The struggle
between Yeltsin and parliament is not the only conflict in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is one thing the two sides in the conflict between president and
parliament in Russia can agree on - the danger of the disintegration of
Russia.
They both fear the pulling away from a weakened centre by the 88 regions and
republics of the federation, and their establishment as autonomous or even
independent states.
There is much evidence that this is happening. A series of meetings of rebel
councils (regional parliaments) over the past week brought together leaders
of councils hostile to President Boris Yeltsin's banning of parliament last
week and produced demands to reverse the decision and to hold simultaneous
elections for the presidency and parliament on pain of strikes, withholding
of taxes and cutting the Trans-Siberian railway.
A meeting in Moscow brought together nearly 60 of the council leaders of
republics and regions - with some 14 chief executives, a significant number
given they were Yeltsin appointees. .
Militant leaders of the regional lobby have appeared. Mr Aman Tuleev, head
of the Kemerovo Regional Council, and President Nirsan Ilyumzhinov, newly
elected leader of the republic of Kalmykia, have taken the national stage to
denounce Mr Yeltsin and support the parliament, Mr Ilyumzhinov looking a
little improbable in that role since he abolished his own Supreme Soviet
earlier this year (he says with its agreement) and has espoused the most
extreme free market principles.
Plans to form both a Siberian and Urals Republic, which predate the present
political crisis, are said to be advanced.
Further, since on all available opinion polls Mr Yeltsin's stock has gone up
with the voters countrywide, it is legitimate to ask how far the regional
councils reflect the opinion of the people they govern.
The region of Nizhny Novgorod, well known for its espousal of market ideas,
illustrates the strains between the governor, Mr Boris Nemtosov, and the
leader of the council, Mr Valery Christianin. These two men are close
politically and personally - yet the former has broadly supported Mr Yeltsin
and the second presided over a session of his council on Tuesday which
passed a motion condemning the president's actions and said his writ did not
run in the region.
Closer examination, however, reveals that the division is more apparent than
real. The meeting of the council on Tuesday substantially toned down a much
fiercer resolution taken immediately after Mr Yeltsin's decree last week.
Tuesday's vote merely calls on the president and the parliament to obey the
law - though it repeats the call for simultaneous elections. Mr Evgenny
Zakablukovsky, an aide to Mr Christianin, said yesterday that Mr Nemtosov
and Mr Christianin were sitting together after the vote and were laughing
together: nothing seemed to have changed between them.
If Mr Yeltsin wins his struggle with the parliament, he may find that the
more extreme voices in the regions quickly drop their rhetoric of the past
few days. However, the basic problems will remain. The centre's weakening
grasp on the regional economies will strengthen only when it demonstrates
its ability to take and to give in the interests of all. Senior ministers
are out in the regions this weekend carrying the message that government can
and will govern: they have a sceptical audience, but not one that is wholly
lost to them yet.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Hype is hyped as Thatcher memoirs near publication
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is bracing itself for a blizzard of hype. The imminent publication
of the political memoirs of Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, is
becoming a publishing and political phenomenon unparalleled in the post-war
era.
Even the hype is being hyped. Television cameras will tonight film The
Sunday Times newspaper coming off the presses. It will carry an exclusive
interview with Lady Thatcher to tout the newspaper serialisation that
precedes the worldwide publication of The Downing Street Years on October
18.
'It will be of considerable significance for the Conservative party and the
constitution,' Mr Andrew Neil, The Sunday Times editor, said of the
interview.
The interview was a consolation prize. Mr Neil wanted to begin the five-week
serialisation tomorrow - before next week's Conservative Party conference at
Blackpool. Lady Thatcher said 'no' and informed Mr Neil it was 'a
deal-breaker'. The Sunday Times decided to delay by a week the
serialisation, which Mr Neil hopes will add between 50,000 and 100,000 to
his paper's 1.27m sales. 'To the political classes, this book is the
equivalent of Andrew Morton's Princess Diana,' said Mr Neil.
Mr Eddie Bell, chief executive of publisher HarperCollins - which like The
Sunday Times is part of Mr Rupert Murdoch's international media empire -
began to realise he might have a phenomenon on his hands in May at a dinner
for the world of bookselling and publishing at London's Berkeley Hotel.
Lady Thatcher told the gathering, including many people with socialist or
social democrat inclinations, that she was planning to market the book with
a two-week tour of the UK followed by a two-week tour of the US. But mostly
she told them about Britain and how she wanted to see it great again.
'It was incredible. She got a 10-minute standing ovation,' said Mr Bell, who
has read the book twice. He described it as 'an absolute page-turner'.
Mr Bell's head is on the block because he has paid, it is believed, a total
of Pounds 3.5m, including serialisation rights, for the book and a sequel
about Lady Thatcher's early years.
So far the orders are as impressive as the advance. By yesterday UK
booksellers had subscribed for - that is, ordered in advance on a
sale-or-return basis - 247,000 copies. Two reprints are already complete and
another is likely before publication.
Nearly 200,000 copies have been ordered in the US. The book will be
available all over the English-speaking world by October 18 and there will
be simultaneous editions in translation in 11 countries.
The book is not a chronological account of her 1979-90 premiership, but
covers themes such as the 1982 Falklands conflict and the 1984-85 miners'
strike. The Falklands chapter is said by those who have read the book to be
particularly strong, with details of decision-making, almost
minute-by-minute, at the highest levels.
Movers and shakers in the political world expected the memoirs to be a frank
and informative read. But they did not think Mr John Major, Lady Thatcher's
successor as prime minister, needed to lose much sleep over them.
Certainly, the mood at Conservative Central Office appears relaxed. One
senior official said yesterday that since Lady Thatcher had 'made it clear'
she was not in favour of a leadership election, 'anything else she wants to
say pales into insignificance'. The memoirs would be of 'enormous historic
significance', the official said. He was not sure if Mr Major would have
time to read them.
But there is more to come. Lady Thatcher has promised to begin the second
volume - on the day she gets back from her four-week promotional and signing
tour for this one.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Consortium sparks battle to run lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for the right to run Britain's proposed national lottery began in
earnest yesterday as a second contestant entered the field.
The new consortium, known as Camelot, links a group of corporate
heavyweights: the confectionery and drinks group Cadbury Schweppes, the
computer manufacturer ICL, security printer De La Rue, Racal Electronics and
GTech, a US company which claims to be the world's biggest lottery operator.
The cost of setting up the lottery is estimated at between Pounds 100m and
Pounds 150m. Analysts suggest that its gross turnover in the first year
could be Pounds 1.5bn, rising to Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn in the next three or
four years.
The other contender, the Great British Lottery Company, consists chiefly of
media companies such as Granada, Carlton Communications and Associated
Newspapers.
Camelot, headed by Sir Ron Dearing, the former Post Office chairman, is made
up of companies claiming expertise in running the lottery. The exception,
Cadbury, is presented as the expert in consumer marketing and distribution.
Camelot said ICL would manufacture terminals to be installed at outlets such
as corner shops, and would train retailers. De La Rue would supply tickets,
and Racal would provide the communications through its existing nationwide
electronic system, the Government Data Network.
The lottery system used would be that already developed by GTech, which
claims to operate 62 lotteries worldwide, including 15 in Europe.
Other contestants known to be contemplating bids include Rank Organisation,
the leisure group, and NM Rothschild, the merchant bank, which is teaming up
with the Australian lottery operator Tattersall's.
Ladbroke Group, the hotel and leisure company, said yesterday: 'We are in
discussion with various people on putting a consortium together, but until
we get a closer look at the government's proposals we are holding fire.'
Another rumoured contender, Thorn EMI, the music and rentals group,
confirmed it had been approached by 'another large company' about joining a
consortium. While no decision had yet been made, any involvement would be as
a passive investor, Thorn said.
The Post Office said it was 'very interested' in the lottery. It would not
be bidding to operate it but would seek an agreement with the winning
consortium to distribute tickets and winnings through its 20,000 outlets.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Bundesbank 'will not act as central bank for Europe':
Tietmeyer begins term with commitment to stable D-Mark and cutting inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HANS TIETMEYER launched his term as president of the Bundesbank yesterday
with a strong affirmation of the German central bank's commitment to
monetary stability.
Speaking in Frankfurt at a ceremony to mark the handover from Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, Mr Tietmeyer underscored the Bundesbank's commitment to cutting
German inflation. He said that would continue to take precedence over
broader international considerations.
The Bundesbank's 'central and most important task' remained the defence of
the D-Mark's stability, Mr Tietmeyer said. 'This is not only our task as
defined by law but also my personal conviction.'
Germany's central bankers were not 'stability fanatics', he said. The
Bundesbank would go on considering the international implications of its
interest rate policy - but there was no scope for it to act as a central
bank for the whole of Europe.
That was not selfish 'egotism', Mr Tietmeyer added, but 'just the opposite:
in the future Europe will need a stable German anchor currency and a
politically and economically stable Germany'.
Taking over from Mr Schlesinger after a period of turmoil in European
currency markets, with Germany in deep recession, Mr Tietmeyer pitched his
inaugural address at domestic and international observers of German monetary
policy.
For the domestic audience, he explained the limitations of the Bundesbank's
interest rate policy, repeating his predecessor's argument that the bank
could not be expected to bail out German industry by reducing the cost of
money. Government, industry and unions had to play their part.
'Even if a (German) recovery soon gets under way, many structural problems
have yet to be solved,' he said. 'Interest rate cuts which are not justified
in terms of our stability objectives cannot solve economic or structural
problems.'
Mr Tietmeyer dismissed arguments that widening the bands within the European
exchange rate mechanism had dealt a death blow to European monetary union.
'I could only go along with this judgment if the wider bands had been abused
by countries for competition-distorting devaluations. Happily, there are no
signs that this has been the case,' he said.
The widening had been necessary, given the ERM's loss of credibility, and
differing economic fundamentals among European Community members.
Speaking at the ceremony, Chancellor Helmut Kohl supported the Bundesbank's
policy, saying a currency's stability remained decisive in determining a
country's attractiveness as a place to do business.
In his farewell speech, Mr Schlesinger said that monetary stability was not
a 'German obsession' but rather provided a 'guarantee of political and
social stability, of personal freedom and justice, and a bond which links
the east and west of our Fatherland better than anything else.'
On one of the principal Bundesbank messages for foreign consumption, there
was no ambiguity. Speaker after speaker rammed home Germany's claim to house
the mooted European Central Bank in Frankfurt.

TWO NORWEGIAN groups plan to merge their helicopter activities to operate
what is claimed to be the world's most modern twin-engined transport
helicopter fleet, with estimated combined 1993 revenues of NKr1.5bn (Dollars
205.5m).
Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi, which operates domestic and European airline
services, and Helikopter Service, the Stavanger-based helicopter operator,
said that they intended to merge, but they did not say when the merger would
take effect.
The value of the new company, Braathens Helikopter, has been assessed at
NKr225m under the deal.
The two companies, with a combined workforce of 900, achieved estimated
pre-tax profit of NKr23m for the first seven months of this year.
Color Line, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, reported that eight-month
interim pre-tax profits had slipped to NKr104m from NKr132m, in spite of a
better-than-expected summer travel season.
Group operating income rose to NKr1.254bn from NKr1.154bn as operating
profit dipped to NKr245m from NKr260m last year.
However, during the second four-month interim period of the current
financial year, pre-tax profit rose to NKr249m from NKr233m on respective
operating income of NKr852m and NKr792m.

JORDAN has charged a newspaper editor with contempt of court over coverage
of an alleged coup plot against King Hussein days after arresting a reporter
for the same offence, Reuter reports from Amman.
Mr Mohammed Hijazi, state security court prosecutor, said Mr Jamil al-Nimri,
editor of the Arabic-language weekly al-Ahali, would appear in civil court
on charges of contempt of the judiciary, publishing court proceedings
influencing a trial and breaching publications laws.
He said a reporter for the newspaper held in jail for interrogation since
Sunday on the same charges was released on bail yesterday.
Mr Nimri had been charged because he was responsible for the newspaper's
coverage, he added. Ten people, including five military cadets, are standing
trial on charges of plotting to kill King Hussein in an alleged Moslem
fundamentalist-inspired coup.
A new press law restricts journalists from reporting full details of
testimony and other statements in the open court. The vaguely-worded law has
been open to interpretation by news organisations.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Better lending terms for small businesses urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM, which holds the EC presidency, yesterday proposed improving loan
terms from banks and lower taxes to help pull small and medium-sized
businesses in Europe out of recession, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The European Community had to do more to help these companies, which employ
75 per cent of the EC workforce, Mr Andre Bourgeois, Belgian minister for
small and medium-sized companies, said yesterday.
More than 99 per cent of the EC's 15.7m private-sector companies would be
affected - with more than 14.5m employing fewer than nine people apiece,
according to Commission statistics.
Belgian companies employing fewer than 50 people pay corporate tax at 28 per
cent, while larger companies pay 39 per cent. Most EC countries have only
one rate.
The minister's EC proposal does not specify what level of corporate tax
should be set EC-wide for smaller businesses.
The European Commission is working on a proposal which would leave such
businesses free to choose between corporate tax and a tax on revenue, a
Commission official told Reuter.
'Corporate tax is better for companies that invest a lot, but tax on revenue
could help a lot of small ones,' he said.
Mr Bourgeois welcomed Spain's decision last week to exempt from tax for a
year corporate profits kept back and reinvested.
The Belgian plan, which will be discussed by ministers in charge of the EC's
single market in November, also calls for better access to bank loans at
better rates but some fear it will only remain a set of good intentions. Mr
Bourgeois expressed concern about the lack of progress in setting up the
European Investment Fund agreed by the EC summit in Edinburgh last December.
The Ecu2bn (Dollars 2.3bn) fund to finance EC-wide infrastructure networks
and help small and medium-sized companies create jobs is still far from
being launched, thanks in particular to the lack of interest shown by
private banks in contributing to its capital.
A proposal to subsidise loans to small businesses by up to 3 percentage
points is also blocked. 'The 3 per cent proposal was questioned by Britain,'
Mr Robert Urbain, Belgian external trade and European affairs minister,
said.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Survey of Lanarkshire (2): Need to raise business birth rate
 -Regeneration of the economy, in an area still important in manufacturing,
depends on new, high-quality companies - but the start-up rate so far is low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Terry Currie, director of business development at the Lanarkshire
Development Agency (LDA), is candid. 'This has not been a great area for
enterprise,' he says. 'Scotland has a relatively low rate of new company
formation by UK standards. Here it's been even lower.'
The low company start-up rate is one of the main problems being addressed by
the LDA, by the county's five enterprise trusts and by other bodies such as
BS(I) - British Steel (Industry), the economic development arm of the steel
company.
But it should not detract from the fact that Lanarkshire, even with much of
the steel industry gone, is still an important manufacturing centre, with no
less than 28 per cent of its working population engaged in manufacturing
compared with the Scottish average of 20 per cent.
East Kilbride is the jewel in the crown of manufacturing, with high quality
inward investment companies such as Motorola, whose semi-conductor plant is
being expanded to employ more than 2,000 people; the printed circuit board
assembler Avex; JVC and Fuji Electric, and many others. It also has a
Rolls-Royce aero-engine plant.
Motherwell, Hamilton and the surrounding urban areas are significant
manufacturing centres. The engineering company Motherwell Bridge is based in
Motherwell, as is the mining equipment maker Anderson. Honeywell Control
Systems is based at Newhouse, while MSA has a plant at Coatbridge. Philips
Lighting makes light bulbs at Hamilton.
British Steel still employs 600 people at the Dalzell plate mill next to
Ravenscraig and 500 people making seamless tubes in Airdrie.
Because of its location at the centre of Scotland's communications network,
Lanarkshire is a base for distribution and warehousing. Safeway has an
enormous depot at Bellshill, employing about 900 people.
The Motherwell food park, set up by the Scottish Development Agency to try
to diversify the local economy, has attracted food manufacturers, and a
cluster of medical companies is growing up on the Strathclyde business park.
Most of the companies mentioned are sizeable, long established businesses,
often owned outside Scotland. But the LDA's strategy document states:
'Successful regeneration will depend on Lanarkshire's ability to create new
quality companies and the expansion of existing home-grown firms.'
To raise the business birth rate the LDA is operating its Entrepreneurship
programme. 'When we launched it we got 1,000 applications; when we said we'd
have to charge Pounds 100 per person we still got 200 people wanting to
join,' says Mr Archie Bethel, the LDA's chief executive. The programme
consists of part time courses running for six months, aimed at local
management and professional people with manufacturing, technical or
financial backgrounds. 'The idea is to get them to meet and exchange ideas,
while we teach them how to set up a business,' says Mr Currie of the LDA.
After two years the programme has already spawned about 10 new companies
which employ about 70 people between them. One example is Retronix, which
employs 20 people at Coatbridge repairing damaged computer circuit boards,
mainly for the multinational electronics companies in Silicon Glen.
BS(I), whose role is to help areas affected by steel plant closures, assists
the regeneration process by providing serviced accommodation units for
startup businesses. It has 29 units in a complex at Coatbridge, is building
eight more 'progression units' for growing businesses nearby and is close to
completing a set of offices and workshops on the Strathclyde Business Park.
The Coatbridge Workshops are serviced by a typist who has a fax machine.
'The units are very popular,' says Mr John Fairley, BS(I)'s Scottish
manager. 'The success rate in this sort of environment is better than in the
outside world.'
BS(I) also co-funds business start-ups, investing about Pounds 1m a year
locally and usually putting in between Pounds 40,000 and Pounds 100,000 per
project. 'This is the venture capital gap that bigger providers of funds
such as 3i cannot fill,' says Mr Fairley. BS(I) provides continuing advice
to its investments with a team of semi-retired professionals.
BS(I)'s investments include Aperta, a company set up by employees made
redundant by Unisys who have developed a system for transferring office
documents from paper to computer disk by means of optical scanning.
The Coatbridge Workshops are not wholly devoted to manufacturing. Some are
occupied by service companies, including Clyde Commissioning Services, which
provides checks for new buildings. BS(I) wants to help redress Lanarkshire's
bias towards manufacturing - which means that it lacks a broad spread of
services and has to buy them in from Glasgow.
Despite its origin, BS(I) in Lanarkshire rarely gives direct assistance to
former steelworkers. 'We bend over backwards to help steel people,' says Mr
Fairley, 'but very few of them see self-employment as the way forward.
That's a legacy of the employee culture of a big plant.'
One legacy of the closure of a big complex such as Ravenscraig is that a
number of companies which grew up supplying British Steel are having to make
painful adjustments. 'Many had a comfortable existence with British Steel
and became over-dependent on it,' says Mr Fairley.
'They developed a sort of tunnel vision that couldn't envisage the
possibility of not being a customer of British Steel.'
BS(I), the LDA and Medco, the enterprise trust in Motherwell, began tackling
this problem before Ravenscraig closed, introducing companies to new markets
such as the offshore supply industry in north east Scotland. But, says Mr
Fairley, 'Many companies have had to rein back and shed employees, and some
have to close altogether.'
Others, such as Scomagg of Motherwell, a maker of control systems and almost
totally dependent on British Steel four years ago, now makes systems for the
oil, gas, petrochemical and food industries.
Mr Currie of the LDA, which runs programmes for managing change, says the
closure of the steel complex 'did not cause the holocaust among its
suppliers that had been forecast. Fewer companies than my 10 fingers have
gone to the wall as a result. The shakeout of the early 1980s left us with
fitter, better managed companies.'
The small and medium sized engineering companies are the industrial backbone
of the area. But Mr John Burn, chairman of George Taylor, a foundry company,
says: 'We are seeing the gradual demise of engineering companies in the west
of Scotland, in the face of recession and imports from eastern European and
Chinese companies that use first world technology.
'Most engineering companies here are just hanging on, hoping for things to
improve. It's hard to persuade myself that I will get a return on any
investment I make.'
The LDA, whose business development budget this year is a remarkable Pounds
9.5m, assists companies with entering new markets and with developing new
products.
'The problem is finding companies with products to develop,' says Mr Bethel.
'It is a bit concerning but we are working on it.'
Mr Currie says companies attribute the lack of new product ideas to
recession, 'but I suspect there was little product development in good
times. It's a national problem and until there is a national commitment to
manufacturing I don't see it being satisfactorily addressed.'

FT  01 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tate &amp; Lyle hint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumours that Tate &amp; Lyle is eyeing the Spanish sugar refiner Ebro were
heard, and the UK group's shares slipped on fears of a rights issue to pay
for the purchase. However, Ebro is entangled in the Kuwait Investment
Office's affairs in Spain, which holds some 36 per cent of the company's
shares, and the practicalities of a full bid are unclear.
Ebro holds more than 50 per cent of the Spanish sugar market, and the Madrid
authorities have warned that a majority foreign ownership would be
discouraged.
The company is thought to have annual profits of around Dollars 50m; a full
bid would have to be in excess of Dollars 300m, according to London
analysts. They added that while such a move by T &amp; L would make a
geographical fit, the company has remained out of favour with the market
since last month's profits warning and worries over company strategy.
The fourth announcement in five days from Grand Metropolitan brought the
long-awaited purchase of North British Distillery (NBD), a private supplier
of grain for whisky production. GrandMet bought the group in a joint venture
involving Highland Distilleries.
Brewing analysts said that the move was a good one given the uncertainties
in the grain supply market.
In a related development, Remy Cointreau, the French drinks group, is
rumoured to have bought part of NBD's 4.8 per cent stake in Highland to take
it towards the 10 per cent holding agreed between the two producers.
Highland announced after the market had closed that NBD had disposed of its
entire stake, amounting to 6m shares. Highland closed 5 down at 333p and
GrandMet rose 3 to 419p.
Hints from Forte at its results meeting that it would not sell Harvester
sites where it had adjoining hotels discouraged speculation that Whitbread
may be about to bid for the public houses and restaurants chain given the
brewery group's own hotel interests and ambitions. Allied-Lyons was one name
being put forward as an alternative candidate for Harvester, particularly
taking into account the chain's concentration in the south-east. Allied
slipped 3 to 569p and Whitbread 'A' 2 to 527p.
Forte's dull results were also said to have undermined Vaux Group, off 2 at
240p, Greenalls, down 10 at 363p, and Ladbroke, 6 1/2 adrift at 185 1/2 p.
Shares in HSBC and Standard Chartered moved sharply forward ahead of a
bullish note from Strauss Turnbull due to land on investors' desks today.
The former gained 17 at 716p, while the latter advanced 8 to 944p. Mr John
Tyce at Strauss said: 'Whilst basically attractive, UK banks look dull for
the next few months until lending is revived. You get better operating
profit growth from these two, along with much faster dividend growth from
HSBC this year and from Standard in due course.'
However, the view from Strauss did little harm to the rest of the sector,
and Barclays added 9 at 524p, and National Westminster firmed 5 to 507p on
good volume of 9.5m.
Construction group Redland ended 9 up at 564p after revealing first-half
profits of Pounds 108m, against Pounds 88.5m. Analysts had expected between
Pounds 95m to Pounds 100m profits. UBS suggested the results reflected
'evidence of UK recovery and very strong evidence of US recovery.'
Optimism was furthered with Redland's international activity, where European
sales had either been resilient to economic difficulties, as in Germany, or
excellent overall, as in eastern Germany and the Netherlands. Mr Howard
Seymour of BZW increased his 1993 profits forecast from Pounds 255m to
Pounds 265m and felt that 'future strategy seemed very sound'.
Activity in chemicals again remained dull. ICI edged up 2 to 716p.
GKN was a weak feature, falling 8 to 460p. However, Mr Harry Phillips at
Panmure Gordon believes the shares are a strong buy because, being a motor
components manufacturer, the company was ideally placed in an attractive
sector to take advantage of the emerging economic recovery.
Turnover in British Steel rose to 15m after Strauss Turnbull joined the
bandwagon of securities houses that have recently upgraded profits
expectations for the group. The shares appreciated 4 to 128 1/2 p.
The broker left the current year profits forecast at Pounds 50m but doubled
expectations for the following year by Pounds 125m to Pounds 250m. Mr Zaffer
Khan at Strauss said: 'The recent pricing initiatives will take time to come
through, but are likely to be successful and the costs are under control.'
James Capel and Smith New Court were reported to have also made positive
noises on the stock.
Engineering group Fenner closed 14 ahead at 100p after the market was
cheered by news that it was in talks with a potential buyer for its Power
Transmission division. The company announced a one-for-two rights offer to
strengthen the balance sheet.
Shares in FKI were in demand and finished 5 up at 157 1/2 p, with analysts
expecting a positive vist in two weeks to see the group's US operations.
The dubious honour of having the day's biggest fall in the market went to
engineering group Atlas Converting, which registered a 21 per cent decline
by tumbling 147 to 533p after reporting a poor set of interim profits.
Reports that Cadbury Schweppes is lining up to bid to run the National
Lottery led to some head scratching among food analysts as to the direction
of company strategy.
One analyst said the market felt that the company, which last month raised
Pounds 324m through a rights issue to buy a US soft drinks group, would be
best concentrating its efforts on getting its American operations right. The
shares receded 4 to 451p.
Profit-taking caused Hillsdown to retreat 7 to 160p.
Nervous trading ahead of next week's interims at Bank of Scotland left the
shares 3 softer at 167p.
International trading group Inchcape continued to be a weak feature
following negative comment from Robert Fleming earlier in the week. The
shares lost 12 at 515p.
Trading in large lines of stock was reported in Smith New Court. The shares
finished 10 ahead at 334p after volume of 5.3m.

FT  01 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oil issues advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Improving crude oil prices following Opec's agreement to a six-month output
plan provided the spur for yesterday's advance in the oil sector as a whole,
with one stock given an additional boost by a clutch of recommendations.
US buyers were said to have been particularly keen buyers and the day's
advances included BP, up 8 1/2 at 324 1/2 p in active trade of 15m shares.
Shell Transport was another stock favoured by overseas buyers and the shares
added 5 at 670p in volume of 3.9m.
Enterprise Oil gained further support from recommendations from SG Warburg
and the new oils team at Nomura, which has placed the stock on its buy list.
The shares climbed 17 to 458p on volume of 3.8m.
Mr Steve Turner at Nomura said the Opec meeting was better than expected and
the improvement in oil prices was likely to benefit Enterprise, which has
underperformed the market by 18 per cent since April on the back of a poor
oil price.
Volume in Lasmo jumped to 18m after two cross-trades were done at 135.5p and
135.6p. The shares hardened 2 to 145p.

FT  01 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte down on figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIM results from Forte prompted a series of broker downgrades and sent
the stock tumbling 10 to 227p in reasonable turnover of 5.1m. Leisure
analysts said they believed the shares to be in for a fairly dull time for
the next few months as the hotel group revealed its recovery was proving
much slower than had been expected.
The shares have run up in recent months as the leisure sector's chief
recovery play, but talk of a slower revival saw some brokers yesterday
change their recommendations from 'buy' to 'hold'.
Profits came in at the low end of expectations and, together with Forte's
cautious outlook, led brokers' forecasts down by some 15 per cent to around
Pounds 90m. At this level the dividend would be uncovered, prompting further
speculation that the group will at some stage launch a long-rumoured rights
issue.

FT  01 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME SELLING was seen in London derivatives markets yesterday, but traders
believed this to be little more than the expected reaction to the close of
third quarter trading in equities, writes Terry Byland.
Some shares have benefited from window-dressing support this week and
yesterday afternoon saw such deals coming to a close.
'The stock index futures took the end of the quarter worse than the
underlying stocks,' commented one leading futures trader. The December
contract on the FT-SE 100 held on to a 30-point premium at first, although
volume was thin. When Wall Street opened lower, sellers appeared and drove
the December contract downwards, bringing equity prices back from their
highs in its wake.
By the close, the premium against cash had been cut to only 15 points,
putting the contract at a discount to its 24-point fair value premium.
However, volume was down to 8,152 contracts, the lowest daily figure this
week.
Traded options business stayed around recent levels, recording 28,864 lots
for the day. The FT-SE option, with 8,978 contracts, was a shade quieter
than on Wednesday. British Steel (2,309) headed the list of individual stock
options, with the Euro FT-SE option (2,256) close behind.
Active support for bank shares rubbed off in traded options, where Barclays
saw 1,760 contracts dealt.

FT  01 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lively trade as third quarter closes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST trading session of the third quarter of the year saw UK equities
return to the upward trend, although gains were trimmed towards the close by
a sell-off in stock index futures. The market was helped along by demand for
oil shares on the back of the Opec output agreement. Trading volume was
higher but this reflected a good deal of end-of-quarter traffic in
non-Footsie stocks.
The day started well, with firmness in the December stock index futures
contract helping a market already looking forward to the final quarter of
1993, for which further gains on the Footsie have been predicted by many
stock market analysts.
At best, the FT-SE 100 Index was 13 points up at 3,043.5, close to Tuesday's
high point of the latest rally. But this proved as far as the market was to
go yesterday, and a slow start to the new Wall Street session, which was 5
Dow points off in UK hours, cut into the premium on the futures contract.
In late afternoon the stock market was heading back towards overnight
levels, but a final rally took the FT-SE 100 to 3,037.5 for a net rise of
7.4. However, the FT-SE Mid 250, lacking the preponderance of blue chip oil
and bank stocks, closed 1.2 easier at 3,433.2.
Seaq volume of 694.8m shares compared with 511.7m in the previous session,
with non-Footsie business increasing its share of the total to around 62 per
cent. On Wednesday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.31bn, fully
maintaining the good business levels achieved in equities.
With many fund managers effectively out of the market as portfolios were
wrapped up for presentation to their trustees, there was a slight air of
unreality in the market. Traders took a cynical view of intermittent rumours
of impending takeover moves in the Footsie list and looked forward to a
return to more normal activity on Monday morning.
Today, the first day of the final three months of the year, also brings the
close of the current two week equity trading account which has been featured
by a generally unimpressive flow of company results. The stock market has
also been recovering this week from the shock administered by the dramatic
political developments in Russia.
However, the spurt of corporate developments this week, including the Pounds
703m deal between Grand Metropolitan and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, as well as
the Pounds 358m MGN placing, has re-kindled stock market interest on the
takeover/acquisition front. Equity strategists have also drawmn attention to
the evident readingness of the institutions and securities houses to take up
rights issues and large lines of stock when they have come on offer.
BP and Shell were responsible between them for about half of the final gain
in the Footsie, and the rest of the sector was also strong as crude oil
prices continued to firm up behind the Opec agreement to rein in production
for six months.
Among domestic stocks, retail and consumer shares showed little confidence
in prospects for the base rate cut predicted in some quarters. But bank
shares found buyers on hopes that lending business will improve rapidly as
recession pressure eases. Gains among building stocks reflected a good
interim report from Redland.

FT  01 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Easier tone ahead of
third-quarter reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Wall Street
US STOCKS ended on an easier note yesterday in the wake of lower bond prices
and growing concern about the approaching quarterly reporting season, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 11.18 at 3,555.12.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.19 at 458.93, but the
American SE composite gained 2.74 at 460.39. The Nasdaq composite was off
0.39 at 762.78. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 294m shares.
The market traded lower for most of the day, although the bulk of the losses
were incurred during the first half-hour of trading. The declines were
attributed to several factors: further weakness in bond prices (the yield on
the 30-year bond rose back above 6 per cent yesterday), higher crude oil and
gold prices, which always raise concern over inflation, and nervousness
ahead of the coming corporate reporting season.
US companies are due to begin releasing third-quarter earnings data in the
next few weeks, and the sluggish nature of economic growth over the summer
has raised fears that corporate profitability in this latest quarter may not
match the achievements of the first half.
Among individual sectors, most oil issues were strong for the second
consecutive day as crude prices rose in the wake of the oil production
agreement between members of Opec. Chevron moved forward Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 97 3/4 , Mobil Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 81 5/8 , Texaco Dollars  1/4
to Dollars 67 3/4 and British Petroleum Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 59 3/8 .
General Motors fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 41 3/4 amid apprehension about
the car group's board meeting on Monday, which will review GM's labour
relations strategy. The company is currently attempting to negotiate a new
wage agreement with the car workers' unions.
USAir fell in early trading but recovered to end unchanged at Dollars 12 5/8
, after the airline forecast losses for the third quarter and the full 1993
year, and said it would take a Dollars 75m charge in the latest quarter and
Dollars 44m for the year to help cover the cost of 2,500 job cuts.
The news from USAir troubled other airline stocks, with UAL falling Dollars
3 3/4 to Dollars 137 1/4 and AMR giving up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 65 1/8 .
USF&amp;G dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 14 1/8 in heavy trading after
brokerage house Kidder Peabody cut its 1993 and 1994 earnings forecasts for
the insurance group.
On the Nasdaq market, leading technology issues were depressed. Intel
retreated Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 70 3/4 and Apple Dollars  1/2 to Dollars
23 3/8 . Canada
TORONTO finished slightly higher after further moderate trading. The TSE 300
index gained 7.4 at 3,990.6 and advances outpaced declines by 485 to 305.
Volume was 55.4m shares valued at CDollars 580m. Energy stocks led the way
with an index rise of 1.36 per cent, followed by pipelines, transportation
and golds, up 1.33, 1.32 and 1 per cent respectively.

FT  01 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Opec output ceiling supports
oil stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CEILING on output resulting from the Opec talks helped oil stocks
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM was lifted by Royal Dutch, up Fl 3.30 to Fl 186.30 on agreement at
the Opec ministers meeting in Geneva. The CBS Tendency index finished up 0.6
to 124.5 in turnover reported as low.
KNP BT went against the trend with a fall of 20 cents to FL 33.70, having
priced its one for five rights issue below market expectations at Fl 30.50.
Philips and Polygram both put on 60 cents, to Fl 37.20 and Fl 63.40
respectively; investors responded with some enthusiasm from comments by Mr
Jan Timmer, the chairman, that the group's cost-cutting exercise was so far
surpassing set targets.
PARIS saw the expiry of options and futures contracts pull the CAC-40 index
lower; it closed 12.17 down at 2,114.63 after an earlier high of 2,131.52.
Because of technical trading turnover rose to FFr3.8bn.
Positive moves included Alcatel Alsthom's gain of FFr9 to FFr733 on flat
first half-profits, and Elf Aquitaine's advance of FFr8.50 to FFr422.60 on
the Opec news.
Generale des Eaux lost FFr20 to FFr2,578 on the announcement late on
Wednesday that the government may liberalise the cellphone sector and grant
a licence to a third operator.
The slide in LVMH continued as brokers issued sell notes, the stock coming
off FFr63 to FFr3,767. Since recording a year's high at the beginning of
September the shares have lost 13 per cent as the market braced itself for
disappointing interim results.
Bancaire shed FFr20.80 or 4 per cent to FFr494.20 on rumours that it might
drop out of the CAC-40 in due course to make way for BNP.
FRANKFURT took its gains on the September quarter to 12.8 per cent as the
DAX index rose 8.02 to 1,915.71 in
turnover dipped from DM5.3bn to DM5.1bn.
Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that descending interest
and inflation rate trends should continue to be good for the market in the
medium term, but that the weak dollar, the cancellation of pay agreements in
the metal-based industries and any escalation in Russia fears should limit
upward potential in the weeks immediately ahead.
The leading DAX stocks over the past three months were story-led, said Mr
Frahm: at the top, Lufthansa rose 37.1 per cent, on its privatisation
prospects and on effective domestic political support; next, Schering was up
23.6 per cent on prospects for its Betaseron drug; and thirdly, Viag's
potential merger with Bayernwerk gave it a gain of 22.6 per cent.
The same applied to the company at the bottom. Volkswagen, under pressure
from industrial espionage allegations, rose just 1.3 per cent, 10.2 per cent
down relative to the DAX; but this still left it up 51.6 per cent over the
first nine months of this year.
MILAN recovered some ground as Fiat rebounded after Wednesday's fall, but
the rise was restrained as the market awaited further details of the
Rinascente disposal. The Comit index added 2.05 to 596.03.
Mr Roberto Morelli at NatWest Securities commented: 'I think that after the
shock, the reality is dawning that the capital increase really was needed.
The market perception has certainly improved today.' Fiat rose L132 to
L5,689.
Sip rose L42 to L3,722 in a continued response to much better than expected
gross operating profits. Cir, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's holding company, moved
forward L47 to L1,620 in response to first-half results which showed a
return to pre-tax profit.
Sme, the state controlled supermarket and motorway restaurant chain, shed
L48 to L4,177 as it forecast that full year figures would be in line with
those of last year.
ZURICH slipped on profit-taking and the SMI index, headed towards the 2,500
level early in the day, finished 12.3 lower at 2,473.1.
An analyst at James Capel in London saw no reason for the market to pull
back before the 2,500 level was breached, although it was difficult to see
what, other than a cut in interest rates, might help prices convincingly
higher.
He believed that in the continued absence of a lead from the Bundesbank,
Switzerland would cut rates unilaterally, since unemployment was rising, the
money supply was under control, the Swiss franc was strong and headline
inflation was about to fall in November.
The profit-taking left Nestle SFr9 lower at SFr1,090 after its strong
performance during the week.

EQUITIES closed marginally higher as investor interest turned to trading on
the second section and the over-the-counter market, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 28.30 at 20,105.71 after moving between 20,032.20
and 20,158.32. Traders said public funds and financial institutions
supported shares, while individuals, tokkin, or specified money trusts, and
foreign investors sought small-capital issues. The second section index rose
3.50 to 2,256.50, while the OTC average advanced 37.61 to 1,706.29.
Volume on the first section came to 260m shares, against 290m. Advances led
declines by 507 to 485, with 176 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks put on 8.39 at 1,626.25 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei
50 index was 0.08 firmer at 1,255.35.
Traders said some investors were becoming increasingly pessimistic over
corporate earnings because of a spate of downward earnings revisions and
restructuring announcements by major companies. However, Mr Jason James,
strategist at James Capel, said that with interest rates at a record low,
cash, including speculative funds, should start entering the equity market.
Mazda Motor dropped Y31 to Y483 on heavy selling after announcing that its
pre-tax loss would rise to Y32bn from an earlier estimate of Y12bn.
There was a recovery in large-capital issues and banks which were previously
sold on profit-taking. Nippon Steel improved Y11 to Y318, Industrial Bank of
Japan Y90 to Y3,260 and Fuji Bank Y50 to Y2,300.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose for the first time in six trading days,
gaining Y4,000 at Y831,000.
Investors sought prospective beneficiaries of the temporary easing of the
country's imported rice ban due to the poor domestic harvest. The
Agriculture Ministry yesterday announced that the rice harvest index was 80
against an annual average of 100, and said it would import 200,000 tonnes of
rice as its first instalment.
Trading companies such as Mitsubishi, up Y20 at Y1,190, gained, while
warehouse issues also advanced, Mitsui Soko adding Y9 at Y940.
DDI, a long distance telecom company listed on the second section, firmed
Y140,000 to Y6.32m on reports of an easing of restrictions on portable
telephones.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 36.18 to 22,186.77 in volume of 16.4m
shares.
Roundup
THERE WERE a number of impressive performances among the region's markets
yesterday. Seoul and Taiwan were closed for holidays.
HONG KONG climbed 1.7 per cent to a record close, encouraged by the more
moderate tone of Chinese foreign minister Qian Qichen ahead of his meeting
today with Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary.
The Hang Seng index rose 125.12 to 7,676.22 in turnover that swelled to
HKDollars 4.95bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 2.86bn.
Strong US demand was noted as Morgan Stanley raised the Hong Kong weighting
in its global equity model portfolio from 0.2 per cent to an overweight 3
per cent. Mr James Lister-Cheese of Morgan Stanley commented that Hong Kong
was trading on a prospective price/earnings ratio of 13 times 1993 earnings,
compared with p/e ratios in the mid-20s for many other markets in the area,
largely as a result of perceived political risk.
Morgan Stanley saw political tensions easing, he said, and a positive
outlook for the Hong Kong economy as trade with China opened up.
KUALA LUMPUR remained firm, the composite index advancing 7.27 to a record
853.83 close. A 50-cent gain in Telekom Malaysia to MDollars 17.20 helped to
drive the index forward.
SINGAPORE picked up as investors sought property issues ahead of more
liberal use of workers' provident fund savings for investments. The Straits
Times Industrial index rose 19.74 to 2,009.02 in volume that jumped to
471.78m shares from 356.70m.
AUSTRALIA was pushed higher by gains in the futures market and the oil
sector, as well as further rises in BHP and News Corp. The All Ordinaries
index added 13.0 at 1,964.4 in turnover of ADollars 389.7m.
BHP put on 10 cents for a record close of ADollars 16.26, while News Corp
appreciated 8 cents to ADollars 11.00.
MANILA turned lower as the peso's appreciation against the dollar led to a
pullback in share prices of dollar-earning market leaders. The market index
shed 8.65 to 1,973.76.
BOMBAY rose on news that a resolution was in sight over the recent seizure
of proxy-held shares by the income tax authorities. The BSE 30 index ended
32.97 up at 2,719.28.

FT  01 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Copenhagen's climb runs into resistance
 -Danish equities have had a flat month after a boost in August
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Danish equities market received a short-lived boost from the
disintegration of the EMS in August, which weakened the krone against the
D-Mark. The all-share index put on 6 per cent, but the improvement did not
last.
In September the index has barely moved. The krone has slipped by about four
per cent against the D-Mark since the end of July, but the government's aim
is to prevent a significant depreciation and Denmark's domestic currency has
strengthened slightly against the Ecu since the end of July.
An encouraging factor is that two cuts since August in the official discount
rate, which moved down by 0.5 per cent to 8.25 per cent on Monday, left the
krone undamaged, generating expectations of further interest rate reductions
to come. On the assumption of lower short-term interest and easier money,
brokers in Copenhagen expect a moderate improvement in share prices over
coming months.
So far this year the share price index has increased by 29 per cent, which
is better than the European average, with confidence improved by the
referendum vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty in May.
Sector indices show a jump of 47 per cent for banks since the end of last
year, with shipping shares increasing by 45 per cent. Industrials, up by
only 14 per cent, have lagged badly, suffering from difficult conditions in
all of their main export markets, Britain, Sweden and Germany, and a
disappointing domestic market where first half GDP declined by about 1.3 per
cent from the same period last year.
The banks were returned to first-half profits by big gains in the value of
their bond and share portfolios, gains which under Danish accounting
practice go into the profit and loss account almost in their entirety.
Dankse Bank has moved from a low of DKr189 to DKr385 this year, and
Unidanmark from DKr99 to DKr209.
Shares in the big AP Moller shipping and oil group's quoted companies, D/S
1912 and D/S Svendborg, have increased in value by over 50 per cent this
year. Moller's Maersk Line became the world leader in container-carrying
capacity earlier this year when it acquired the liner operations of its
erstwhile Danish rival, the East Asiatic Company.
The group's oil and gas production in the Danish sector of the North Sea has
been adversely affected by lower oil and gas prices, but the volume of gas
sales will increase by about 50 per cent in 1997 as the result of a new
agreement with the state's oil and gas distribution company.
Other shares which have performed well are EAC, up from a low of DKr60 to
DKr144, and GN Great Northern, up from DKr253 to DKr537. EAC, once regarded
as the Rolls Royce of the Danish corporate world, came close to total
collapse last year, but a programme of divestments under a new management
has put the group, which has major and profitable trading interests in the
Far East, on a sounder footing.
GN made its name a century ago by laying telephone cables across Russia and
from there to Japan. Its fortunes have revived with the opening up of East
Europe, where it has participated in establishing optical fibre cable links
between Denmark and Poland, and south through Poland to the Czech border,
and between Denmark and St Petersburg. This year GN signed a contract for
cables to link Russia to Japan and South Korea.
Meanwhile, the domestic economic outlook may be about to improve. There will
be a big boost to demand through fiscal policy in 1994. The government
predicts a growth in real private consumption by four per cent and in GDP by
2.9 per cent. Non-official forecasters tend to think that the forecasts are
too high, but the minister of finance, Mr Mogens Lykketoft, told the FT this
week that real household disposable incomes in 1994 will rise by at least
4-5 per cent, so he considers the forecast fully realistic.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar jumps on figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR responded well to positive US data yesterday, jumping a pfennig
against the D-Mark in late London trading, writes Emma Tucker.
It was further boosted by a feeling that investors had underplayed the
significance of events in Russia. Reports from Moscow that armoured vehicles
had moved nearer the Russian parliament reminded dealers that the struggle
in the former Soviet Union is not yet resolved, and another bout of nerves
pushed the D-Mark lower.
Later, news that the Chicago purchasing managers' index rose to 54.5 per
cent in September from 50.2 per cent in August lifted the dollar even
higher.
The market was particularly heartened by a jump in the employment component
of the index from 47.3 per cent to 51.5 per cent, an early indication that
next week's crucial non-farm payroll figures will be better than expected.
There was also promising news from the US Department of Commerce, which
reported that August personal income rose 1.3 per cent from the previous
month's figure, the strongest gain since April. Economists had expected a 1
per cent increase, compared with July's 0.2 per cent fall.
'There are now signs that the market was too pessimistic about the US
economy,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins from Bank of America in London. 'There is a
case for being more optimistic about growth in the third quarter.'
The dollar closed in London at DM1.6365 for an advance of 2 1/4 pfennigs on
the day. Against the yen it was more static, although it ended only slightly
below the day's high of Y106.12. This compares with the previous day's close
of Y105.15. The US currency finished New York trading at DM1.6345 and
Y106.15.
Sterling had a better day, rising  3/4 pfennig to DM2.4475. 'The pound was
oversold on Wednesday,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham of UBS. 'Now people are
taking a more realistic view on the potential for rate cuts.'
UK economists are still debating the merits of another interest rate cut.
Yesterday, Mr Patrick Minford, one of the government's seven wise men, said:
'The chancellor should devise a more robust monetary policy and cut interest
rates while ruling out tax increases. He should not worry if the pound falls
against the D-Mark because this might help the recovery.'
But analysts, including Mr Minford himself, are not confident that Mr
Kenneth Clarke will follow this advice.
Elsewhere in Europe a number of currencies gained from the unwinding of the
D-Mark.
The Belgian franc, however, was marginally weaker at BFr21.55 to the D-Mark
after a 0.10-point cut in central and end-of-day rates. Rumours that
Luxembourg was considering severing its currency peg to Belgium, should the
Belgian franc depreciate further against the D-Mark, also weakened the
currency.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Surprise shortage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS IN the UK money market failed to materialise yesterday after the
Bank of England forecast a much smaller than expected liquidity shortage.
With dealers believing that end-of-quarter requirements would prompt a
shortage as high as Pounds 3.5bn, there was some surprise when the Bank came
up with only Pounds 1.1bn. This was revised marginally to Pounds 1.05bn.
Earlier this week, dealers had suggested that the Bank's decision to hold a
gilt auction just before the end of the quarter was unwise, since it would
add to demand for cash and thus increase pressure in the money markets.
A dealer said of yesterday's shortage: 'Its size would certainly suggest
that the cash management at the Bank of England was better organised than
people thought.'
None the less, it took a while to clear the shortage. In early operations
the Bank purchased bills totalling only Pounds 20m, followed by Pounds 160m
in later morning trading. This pushed the overnight rate up as high as 8 per
cent, but a purchase of Pounds 506m of bills in the afternoon, and late
assist-ance of Pounds 360m, brought it back down to around 6 per cent.
The three-month interbank rate was slightly lower at 5 15/16 -5 7/8 per
cent. The previous day it closed at 6 per cent on the offered side.
Short sterling moved in a very narrow range, with the market uncertain about
the timing of future cuts in interest rates. The December contract opened at
94.39 and finished slightly lower at 94.35. Trading was subdued, with just
over 10,000 contracts traded.
In Germany call money firmed to 6.9-7.0 per cent from 6.85-95 per cent,
after the Bundesbank withdrew section 17 funds which had been circulating in
the market for almost a week.
Some dealers expressed surprise when the funds were withdrawn, as they had
hoped the extra liquidity would be left in the market to compensate banks
for the draining of DM8.5bn of funds earlier this week.
The December and March Euromark contracts slipped, reflecting a belief in
the market that the German central bank will take its time over monetary
easing. Longer dated contracts held up relatively better, indicating that
even if the Bundesbank takes a while to ease monetary policy, rates will
eventually have to come down.

</HEADLINE>

   By REUTER

<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange COPPER market was attempting yesterday afternoon
to find a consolidation level after falling earlier to six-year lows. The
three months delivery price touched bottom at Dollars 1,665 a tonne before
being steadied by a short-covering rally and some expected technical buying.
But it was still showing a loss on the day of Dollars 36 when it ended after
hours trading at Dollars 1,683.50 a tonne, Dollars 89 down from the end of
last week. Analysts said the end of the technical squeeze recently meant
that the market could no longer ignore oversupply, which would take some
time to remedy, as few producers were prepared to cut output. The three
months ZINC price leapt to a high of Dollars 906 a tonne in the morning,
encouraged by talk of possible output cuts in North America. But by the
close no news had emerged and the price was back at Dollars 886 a tonne,
down 50 cents on the day. NICKEL sentiment remained poor and as latest
Russian forecasts suggested this year's production decline would not be as
large as originally thought prices slumped to fresh 6 3/4 -year lows. COFFEE
prices fell further before finding industry and trade support.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: North Sea's 'Piccadilly Circus'
opens new line - Norway's giant Zeepipe today carries its first consignment
of natural gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZEEPIPE HAS none of the romantic resonance of the trans-Alaska or
trans-Arabian pipelines. Yet the world's longest offshore gas pipeline,
which snakes along the bed of the North Sea for 810km from the Sleipner A
production platform, 148km off the Norwegian coast, to Zeebrugge in Belgium,
also bears witness to an epic struggle to link remote energy reserves with
industrial markets.
Today the pipeline carries the first shipment to be delivered to western
Europe under the 1986 Troll gas sales agreements, the largest commercial
contract in the history of the petroleum industry. By the time it is
fulfilled in 2021 at least 1,000bn cubic metres of gas worth about Dollars
100bn at current prices will have been sent to markets in Germany, France,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Spain.
Norwegian offshore workers call the maze of natural gas pipelines that
converge near the Sleipner platform the 'Piccadilly Circus' of the North
Sea. A clear sense of relief can be detected among officials of Statoil, the
Norwegian state oil company, which dominates the seven-company consortium,
that the gas is even flowing through the complex interchange.
After all, it was only two years ago when the concrete sub-structure upon
which the Sleipner platform was to be mounted sank during testing in a fjord
near Stavanger. When it hit bottom the shock waves registered at Norway's
seismic centre. They also reverberated around Statoil's boardroom, where a
decision was quickly made to try to adhere to the original schedule by
building a replacement.
'We paid for two but got one' is how Mr Peter Mellbye, head of Statoil's gas
division, sums up the accident, the cost of which is still being disputed
with the builders of the sunken substructure and with insurers.
Company officials concede that they had no choice but to try to meet the
original deadline to reassure customers. Norwegian gas exports, which
account for 10 per cent of the European Community market, face a growing
commercial threat from Russia, which is keen to expand its 22 per cent share
of the EC market by developing its massive reserves in Siberia and
elsewhere.
Statoil officials were also aware that the sheer size of the Troll project
had raised doubts about its viability. Critics pointed in particular to the
NKr120bn (Pounds 11bn) capital costs, Norway's reputation as a relatively
high-cost producer and the technical challenge of working in the 300m water
depths of the Troll field itself.
'I can't say it is one of the most profitable projects ever undertaken,'
says an executive from one of the consortium members, 'but it certainly is
one of the largest.'
Statoil has also been plagued with problems in overcoming environmental
resistance to landing another key pipeline - dubbed Europipe - in Emden,
Germany. An existing line, Norpipe, terminates in Emden, which the company
insists is the most convenient point to supply Ruhrgas, the biggest buyer
under the Troll contracts.
Company officials admit that they were surprised by the scale of local
protests over Europipe's potential impact on environmentally sensitive mud
flats in the area. They believe it will eventually be approved, although
alternatives to Emden are being studied.
Emden has already been eliminated as the terminus for a possible fourth
pipeline, which the company says may be needed by the end of the decade.
The focus today, however, is on Zeepipe and the successful development of
the Sleipner field, even though it represents only the first stage of the
Troll project, which is due to reach its plateau of annual deliveries of
44.7bn cu m in 2005. In addition to Sleipner, gas will be taken from the
Statfjord, Heimdal and Gullfaks fields.
Deliveries from Troll itself, western Europe's largest offshore field,
containing 50 per cent of Norway's proven gas reserves, are due to start in
1996. And it is the development work on this part of the project that
carries some of the biggest risks.
Norske Shell, which has an 8.2 per cent share in the overall Troll project,
is developing the field, which it discovered in 1979. A 430m-high platform,
capable of withstanding 30m waves and strong currents, is under construction
near Stavanger.
It will rank as one of the largest man-made objects ever moved when it is
towed out to sea next year.
Original plans to process the gas offshore were dropped, and the untreated
gas will be piped to a processing plant 65km away at Kollsnes, near Bergen
before being sent through the 'Piccadilly Circus' of pipelines at Sleipner
for onward transmission to customers.
Shell officials say test transmissions of untreated Troll gas have resulted
in higher-than-expected corrosion of the pipes. But they insist that the
problem can be controlled and that the project remains on course for the
1996 deadline.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec production accord 'best
since the Gulf war'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DON Etiebet, the Nigerian oil minister, had a simple explanation for the
serious mood that pervaded the meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, which ended on Wednesday with agreements on a new
production and individual country allocations.
'If we had started throwing punches the price would have collapsed to
Dollars 10 a barrel,' he said.
But even that ever-present spectre was not incentive enough to push the 12
delegations into an early deal, or, in the case of Kuwait, to prevent a
dramatic display of brinkmanship.
It took direct political intervention by the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Iran
and Kuwait, before the delegations agreed to put a cap on Opec production of
24.52m barrels a day for the six months from October to the end of next
march. The continuing political support from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia,
president Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran and the Emir of Kuwait might just keep
the agreement intact, according to Mr Mehdi Varzi, research director at
Kleinwort Benson Securities in London.
'The three heads of state are tied to the accord,' he said yesterday. And
that made the agreement 'the best from a psychological point of view since
the end of the Gulf war'.
One Gulf Arab delegate in Geneva noted, however, that 'you just need
self-interest to make this work, not political will', as higher oil prices,
and thus higher government revenues, is the key to preventing
overproduction.
The Opec ministers began their deliberations last Saturday with the
following goals:
To convince sceptical markets that they could stop the damaging
overproduction by members such as Iran and Nigeria that was further
undermining already weak oil prices;
To bring Kuwait back into the production quota mechanism so as to reinforce
their control over Opec output;
And to take the first steps towards the eventual re-inclusion of Iraq within
the production ceiling once Baghdad reaches an agreement with the United
Nations allowing it to resume oil exports.
The fact that average oil prices have risen by about Dollars 1 a barrel in
the past week suggests that the ministers have re-established some
credibility in the markets, according to Mr Varzi. 'The scope for cheating
is far less because the agreement addresses some of the concerns.'
The new ceiling, just under the estimated present Opec output level of 24.7m
barrels a day but above the 23.5m b/d agreed in June, was justified on the
grounds that demand traditionally increased in the fourth quarter with the
onset of the northern hemisphere winter.
The higher output figure enabled Opec negotiators to offer Iran, probably
the biggest recent over-producer, a quota of 3.6m b/d, compared with the
previous one of 3.3m b/d. Analysts said the new figure was probably just
under Iran's capacity.
Any sign of substantial cheating by an Opec producer could unravel the
agreement, according to Mr Vahan Zanoyan, senior director at Petroleum
Finance Company in Washington.
The credibility of the accord was enhanced, however, by Saudia Arabia's
decision to freeze its output at 8m b/d. That implied an erosion of its
market share, a sensitive issue among Opec states.
'This agreement is about dollars and cents, not percentages,' explained a
Gulf Arab delegate.
The meeting also succeeded in bringing Kuwait back into the quota system at
2m b/d, compared with its original demand for 2.16m b/d. But Kuwait's
insistence that the 2.16m b/d figure should be the base for calculating any
future increase in Opec's production ceiling could eventually prove a weak
spot in the agreement, according to Mr Mohammed Abdul Jabbar, an economist
with the Petroleum Finance Company.
Another doubt concerns future demand levels. Opec believes its ceiling is
close to fourth quarter demand for its oil and hopes that a commitment to
contain production will have a positive effect on oil stocks held in
consuming countries. Mr Varzi agrees that a tight market could develop in
January and February, and predicts that prices for Brent blend could go as
high as Dollars 18 by the end of the year.
The big question mark, however, hangs over Iraq. 'With (the return of) Iraq
everything changes,' Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Iran's oil minister, said
yesterday. He conceded that if Iraq stayed outside the agreement, it could
just 'sell and sell', although he predicted that the country's return was
unlikely to take place this year.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Troll deal set to reshape
Europe's gas industry - The record-breaking Dollars 100bn sales agreement
with European buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERLATIVES describing Norway's Dollars 100bn Troll gas sales agreement can
flow effortlessly beyond considered limits. Most agree, however that the
deal represents a quantum leap into the future for the seller and European
buyers and will alter forever and fundamentally the shape of Europe's gas
industry.
After seven years of innovatory, and sometimes frustrating, development
preparations, gas under the huge Troll contract coursed its way from 6am
today through the Zeepipe to supply Europe with 10 per cent of its gas
needs.
Under what is hailed as the largest commercial contract in the history of
the petroleum industry, the gas is making its way to a consortium of
European gas buyers, initially from the Norwegian North Sea Sleipner field.
But from 1996 gas from the giant Troll itself, Europe's biggest offshore gas
field, will flow over a period of more than 30 years to Austria, Belgium,
France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.
Troll sales will expand Norway's market share for gas in Germany to 23 per
cent by the year 2000 from 14 per cent now, while in France it will rise to
23 per cent from 17 per cent, in Belgium to 33 per cent from 24 per cent and
in the Netherlands to 13 per cent from 7 per cent.
Spain and Austria are new buyers of Norway's gas, taking annual deliveries
of 1.5bn and 1bn cubic metres a year respectively.
Deliveries under the Troll agreement are scheduled to reach a peak of 44.7bn
cu m a year from 2005, but the deal is forecast to boost Norway's annual gas
exports from 25bn cu m - making the country the sixth largest gas exporter -
to more than 60bn cu m in 2010. Negotiations already under way could
eventually increase supplies to 70bn cu m a year as new domestic offshore
gas fields come on stream.
'Towards the next century gas production will be of increasing importance,
and it can be said that Norway will turn into a gas nation from being an oil
nation,' says Mr Finn Kristensen, oil and industry minister.
Norway is Europe's biggest oil producer with average daily output of about
2.3m barrels.
Until 1986 it sold its gas under 'depletion' contracts covering the total
reserves of a specific field. Frigg field gas has been supplied to Britain
under this arrangement for the past 23 years and more than 110bn cu m will
have been provided by the time the field runs dry in 1997.
In sharp contrast, Troll gas buyers have signed supply contracts that
specify gas deliveries over a set period.
One major issue is the designation of new fields to make up a production
capacity shortfall of 10bn cu m of gas already sold under supply contracts -
above and beyond the Troll deal. No decision has yet been made on which
fields could close this gap as negotiations for further supply quantities
move towards agreement.
Statoil, Norway's state oil company, believes future gas sales are unlikely
to involve the huge volumes seen in the Troll agreements. 'No other
Norwegian (gas) field matches the size of the giant Troll reservoir, making
typical future contracts of 1bn-1.5bn cu m annually over a period of 15 to
20 years most likely,' it says.
Nevertheless, the success of the Troll agreement has served to confound
sceptics who for years said it would never come off because of the huge
amount of capital required.
Gas and oil prices are closely linked. 'When the Troll agreements were
signed oil prices were around Dollars 8 a barrel compared with a current
Dollars 15-Dollars 16' Statoil points out. 'In the interim, the Troll gas
price has been renegotiated with German buyers and similar adjustments are
under discussion with other customers.'
There is an old industry maxim which runs: 'In the gas industry you must be
very careful to do a good deal. But you must be even more careful not to do
too good a deal'. That is a situation Troll's gas sellers are clearly
seeking to avoid as they look for new business.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Raw sugar futures relaunched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Commodity Exchange launches its revamped raw sugar futures
contract today amid hopes that the new premium contract will succeed where
its previous product failed.
The exchange is taking advantage of widespread disaffection with the
contract traded at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York. Traders
were angered by a decision in July to allow Brazilian crystal sugar to be
delivered against the raw sugar contract.
The LCE has deliberately excluded Brazilian crystal - which many traders
doubt should be classed as raw sugar - and Cuban sugar from its new
contract. The contract will be denominated in cents a lb rather than dollars
a tonne in order to make it more similar to the New York futures contract
and thus to facilitate arbitraging between the two markets.
It has also changed the delivery months to fit in more closely with the
physical trade in raw sugar. Mr Robin Woodhead, chief executive of the LCE
said: 'We're very pleased with the levels of support we're seeing,
particularly from the trade in the US and the Far East.'
The new contract will be traded on-screen alongside the exchange's white
sugar futures and Mr Woodhead said the decision to trade it on screen had
resulted in two new requests from traders to join the system.
The previous contract had also been traded on screen, but, in an effort to
boost liquidity, the exchange moved it to open outcry trading. This failed
to increase volume. however, and the contract was de-listed earlier this
year.
'There are still a lot of pessimistic people out there because they've seen
some tough times in recent years trying to get London going,' said Mr John
Payne, sugar trader at Vitol. But he added that he had seen a lot of demand
for the new contract.
'There is a requirement for a safe and secure hedging vehicle which we
believe New York is not providing right now,' he said.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Survey of Lanarkshire (7): Illustrious industrial heritage -
Clydesdale Development Company focuses on rural areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is an irony of Lanarkshire that the town from which it takes its name is
far removed in character and some way in distance from the industrialised
north of the county on which so much attention is being lavished.
Lanark is a market town of 10,000 people set in rolling green countryside
where cattle and sheep farmers come to sell their produce and country ladies
do their shopping. Yet it has an illustrious industrial history, for it was
at New Lanark that the socialist entrepreneur Robert Owen created an
industrial community in which the workers' education and health were as
important as profit.
In the early 19th century New Lanark was a place of pilgrimage for social
reformers, statesmen and royal personages. It is now the leading historic
tourist attraction in Lanarkshire, where last year 190,000 people paid to
see the restored factory and visitor centre, and many more to stroll round
the old village, which is progressively being restored, or gaze at the falls
of Clyde. New Lanark is now classed as a World Heritage site.
Last year Clydesdale Development Company, the local enterprise trust, was
able to point to figures showing that between 1979 and 1990 it had the
fastest rate of growth for new businesses in Britain, based on VAT
registrations which increased by more than 245 per cent, making the largest
percentage increase in Britain, well ahead of Corby, Milton Keynes, and
Stevenage.
The registration of 631 new businesses is thought to be due partly to
Clydesdale residents who formerly commuted to Glasgow setting up businesses
nearer home. The number of of people working in Clydesdale has grown in the
past 10 years from 23,000 to 35,000.
The Clydesdale Development Company is chaired by Mr Arthur Bell, who runs
Scotland Direct, a successful direct marketing group, from a converted tweed
mill in Biggar, south of Lanark. The development company is an enterprise
trust which has a franchise from the LDA to offer business services and
advice. Its annual budget is about Pounds 500,000.
It differs from most other enterprise trusts in Scotland is that it focuses
strongly on the rural areas. 'Clydesdale district covers 500 square miles,
and 25 per cent of our businesses are in farming,' says Mr Chris Travis, the
executive director (check). 'We must stop the decline in farmers' incomes,
or the rural infrastructure will run down, and shops and schools will close
in a downward spiral.'
Together with other bodies it has established Farm Futures, a programme
targeted at young farmers who are likely to inherit the family business. The
aim is to provide a grounding in forward planning, business management, and
new market opportunities, including how to deal with the demands of the
supermarket chains.
Though much of Clydesdale is over 1,000 feet above sea level and very bleak
in winter, part of the Clyde valley near Lanark has for decades been a
centre for raising tomatoes in glass houses, thanks to a warm micro-climate.
But the industry has been in steep decline and was becoming unable to
compete against plentiful Dutch tomatoes.
With the Scottish Agricultural College and the Robert Owen Foundation, the
Clydesdale Development Company encouraged six of the surviving tomato
growers to club together, 'not to out-produce the Dutch but to out-market
them,' Mr Travis explains.
They now sell under the banner Scotland's Tomatoes and have agreed a price
with the supermarkets which has restored a premium to their tomatoes.
Revenues this year are 50 per cent above last year's.
The development company is now trying to find ways of assisting beef
producers. 'We are trying to find an effective marketing approach that will
raise returns,' Mr Travis says. It is likely to involve creating a brand,
developing a link with an abattoir to produce a quality mark and dealing
direct with butchers, cutting out the cattle market.
'Much of our beef is raised in conditions that are close to being organic,'
he says. 'That gives us something to work on.'
He says that as farm subsidies fall, farmers need a better understanding of
market forces, of buying and selling, of costing and pricing, and of the
public perception of quality.
Taking the work of an enterprise trust into the agricultural community is
breaking new ground.
'It is a bit of an uphill struggle,' Mr Travis says. 'The farmers will
listen and say they agree with you, but whether they do anything about it .
. .'

FT  01 OCT 93 / Survey of Lanarkshire (5): The enterprise clock is ticking -
Lanarkshire's infrastructure now includes an Enterprise Zone divided into
nine sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Condliffe, a top official at Scottish Enterprise, was a leading
advocate of setting up an enterprise zone in Lanarkshire to 'kick-start' its
regeneration. 'We think that with an enterprise zone we can achieve in five
years what would otherwise take ten,' he said.
Now little more than two years after that statement was made and nearly a
year after Mr Condliffe's untimely death in middle age, the Lanarkshire
enterprise zone is up and running. It formally came into existence on
February 1 this year and expires in 2003.
As Mr Archie Bethel, chief executive of the Lanarkshire Development Agency
says: 'The clock is ticking. We have got 10 years.'
Enterprise zones offer companies which set up on them exemption from
business rates, 100 per cent allowances on corporation tax for capital
expenditure on buildings, and greatly simplified planning procedures.
Yet when Mr Condliffe spoke, the tide seemed to be moving against EZs. Both
the government and the European Commission, which also has to approve them,
had expressed doubts about the concept. The government had frequently said
that each zone it set up would be the last, before eating its words and
setting up another.
Critics say that EZs merely transfer jobs and investment from other areas,
while the EC has been sceptical of an initiative which it believes can
distort competition. The zones have been seen, particularly by the Treasury,
as a comparatively expensive way of generating jobs. However, although the
original crop of EZs in Britain, created in the early 1980s, is now
expiring, there are likely to be six zones in existence by 1994, three of
them destined for areas hit by the latest coal closures.
The Lanarkshire EZ comprises 507 acres and is divided into nine sites,
ranging from 195 acres at Newhouse close to the Eurocentral freight terminal
to a two acre site intended as an office development in the town of
Hamilton.
Mr Douglas Smith, of the chartered surveyors Richard Ellis in Glasgow, says
the range and quality of sites on the Lanarkshire EZ are of 'by far the
highest quality yet seen in the Scottish market.' They will appeal, he says,
to manufacturers, office users and inward investors.
At least one of the sites - Airbles Road in Motherwell - is not yet ready.
But Monklands district council has already built 10,000 square feet of units
on the Shawhead zone, with a further 10,000 sq ft under construction.
At Tannochside the developer Meiklegate is in final negotiations with the
LDA to put up 55,000 sq ft of industrial space, and Morrison Developments
are close to agreement to build 78,000 sq ft of office space on the two acre
Brandon Street site near the centre of Hamilton.
Mr Bethel says the EZ aims to strike a balance between owner-occupier
companies putting up bespoke buildings for their own use, and EZ trusts
which are likely to build speculatively for later gains. The latter are
likely to become more prominent next year as the Business Expansion scheme,
which attracts about Pounds 1bn a year of funds, against the Pounds 250m
attracted by EZ trusts, comes to an end.
Mr Gerry Brough, inward investment manager at the LDA, says: 'We want to
keep a balance between the different types of occupier, and we do not want
to release too much land too quickly.'
The LDA believes the EZ will generate 8,000 net new jobs over the 10 years.
That same total has often been quoted for the number of jobs that should be
supported by the 800-acre greenfield site which includes both Mossend and
the Newhouse West zone.
The Eurocentral rail freight terminal for Scotland's Channel Tunnel freight
is being built on the western side.
The terminal was to have been by Amec, the construction and development
company. However, With uncertainty over the privatisation of British Rail,
delays to the Channel Tunnel opening and the weak property market, Amec
decided instead to concentrate on developing part of the adjoining land,
while theLDA took on the terminal project.
With the public sector taking responsibility, a Pounds 1.8m grant from the
EuropeanRegional Development Fund was obtained to help towards the Pounds
8.6m cost of the project. The grant would not have been available for a
private sector company.
A 115 acre freight village should gradually be developed next to the 16-acre
terminal. Alongside is the Mossend EZ site aimed at manufacturing, which is
part-owned by Amec Regeneration. The Newhouse West EZ site, fronting on to
the M8, is owned by ScottishEnterprise and is intended for large inward
investors.
The Eurocentral terminal will have modest beginnings when it opens, in time
for the Channel Tunnel, next March.
The LDA does not have the power to build advance factories, unlike the new
towns. But the Scottish new towns are following their English counterparts
and being wound up. East Kilbride will be wound up by the end of 1995 and is
involved in a final Pounds 37m capital programme to complete the town.
East Kilbride is the home of another important part of Lanarkshire's
development network, the National Engineering Laboratory (NEL), a government
industrial research organisation which briefly achieved prominence in
1988-89 when Lord Young, then the trade and industry secretary, made a
botched attempt to privatise it.
NEL is making itself more market-oriented and is developing a commercial
customer list. Its own staff has been slimmed from 600 to 400. It occupies
only five of the buildings on the site instead of 10. The site is now a
serviced, high prestige business park, much of it occupied by small
science-based businesses, some founded by ex-NEL staff.
But all that is in the future.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Survey of Lanarkshire (6): Move enabled expansion / Profile
of Dawnfresh Seafoods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE biggest new industrial employer to start operations in Lanarkshire since
the closure of the Ravenscraig steelworks is probably Dawnfresh Seafoods.
It produces breaded cold water prawns and other seafood products in a large
new plant at Bothwell Park near Motherwell and employs more than 200 people.
At first sight it might appear odd that a seafood maker would locate itself
on an inland site in an area where the main manufacturing tradition is
engineering.
On second glance it seems not only logical, but also that it could be a
harbinger of things to come.
Dawnfresh, a privately-owned company, relocated to Bothwell from two plants
in England.
Its main plant was at Whitehaven in Cumbria but it also had a facility at
Ipswich.
It decided it needed to move in order to expand and to anticipate the
requirements of current and future health and hygiene regulations.
'This is an ideal location,' says Mr Alastair Salvesen, the company's
chairman. 'Most of our scampi comes from Scottish fishing ports. We are
right on the motorway network which enables us to distribute to supermarkets
all over Britain within a day.
'From Whitehaven it took two days.
'When we want to fly to buy foreign shellfish from Scandinavia we have
Glasgow and Edinburgh airports both within less than an hour's drive. We're
at the centre of an excellent hub.'
Dawnfresh is among the top four UK producers of prawns and scampi, with an
annual turnover of Pounds 20m.
It decided to buy its own land and build its own factory after being unable
to find space large enough on the Motherwell Food Park, which is a dedicated
area developed by the Scottish Development Agency, and after being asked
'ridiculous rents' on another local site.
It owns an eight acre site on which it has built a 45,000 square foot state
of the art plant, which includes temperature controlled production
facilities, cold stores, laboratories, a product development kitchen and
offices.
From acquiring the site in March 1992 it produced its first output in
November and the plant was completed in February 1993.
The site gives it further room for expansion.
Dawnfresh also has a seafood processing plant at Campbeltown in the Mull of
Kintyre.
The company, which has been profitable since it was bought out by its
management in 1983, concentrates on breaded products and fresh or chilled
products such as langoustine, scallops and crevettes.
About 75 per cent of its output goes to the retail market, and the rest to
the food service and catering sector.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Survey of Lanarkshire (4): German linked / Profile of Atlas
Hydraulic Loaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE village of Blackwood, just off the M74 about 10 miles south of
Motherwell, is not a well-known manufacturing centre. Yet the former mining
village's main employer is the biggest manufacturer of lorry loading cranes
in the UK.
Blackwood is the UK headquarters of Atlas Hydraulic Loaders, a German-owned
company which has been in Lanarkshire for 30 years. It is the only full
overseas manufacturing unit of Atlas Weyhausen, a family-owned company with
turnover of about DM 800m based near Bremen.
At Blackwood, Atlas makes lorry loading cranes - the type of crane that is
permanently mounted on a lorry - and manufactures mini-excavators in a plant
at nearby Hamilton. Despite the recession, now hitting the German market, it
is implementing a Pounds 10m investment programme in its Scottish plants,
whose products are designed in Germany.
Atlas began manufacturing at Blackwood in 1963 at the suggestion of its
Scottish dealer. It has been there ever since. It employs about 250 in
Scotland and 70 in its English sales offices. Noemployees come fromGermany.
'The workforce is stable - several of them have worked here for 20 years -
and I don't find any difficulties operating here,' says Mr James Hanshaw,
the subsidiary's managing director who has worked for US and German
companies in Asia, Australia, the US and Europe. He does a daily
cross-country drive from his home near Peebles in the Borders. 'The
maintenance of the roads could be better,' he says.
Atlas's UK sales grew from Pounds 5m in 1980 to Pounds 27m last year and are
expected to reach Pounds 35m this year. It has 45 per cent of the UK market
for lorry loading cranes (80 per cent of these sales supplied from its
Scottish plant) but also exports about 60 per cent of turnover. Much of its
output goes to Germany.
Atlas Hydraulic Loaders also claims to be the biggest and fastest growing
maker of mini-excavators in the UK, with output rising from 400 units last
year to nearly 1,000 this year as it begins manufacturing new models.
'We are taking market share from our competitors in the UK thanks partly to
very aggressive pricing,' Mr Hanshaw says.
'Quality comes before short term profits. The parent company does not take
dividends from the UK subsidiary - all our profits are reinvested. We're
going to be here in five or 10 years' time.'
The Pounds 10m investment programme at Atlas Hydraulic Loaders which began
last year has involved expanding production space by 21 per cent to 150,000
square feet and refurbishing the plants with the latest machinery and
computer systems.
' We wanted to bring our manufacturing facilities up to German standards.
The world is demanding higher standards,' says Mr Hanshaw. 'Our German
customers are particularly conscious of quality, especially with products
made in Britain.'

FT  01 OCT 93 / Survey of Lanarkshire (3): No clear view - Ravenscraig could
be a development opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLE has happened on the site of the Ravenscraig steel complex since it
abruptly closed in June last year. The cooling towers and the blast furnaces
still stand, the main differences from a year ago being that they are now
silent and no vapour comes out of them.
British Steel shut the complex two years earlier than had been expected,
arguing that poor market conditions overrode the commitment it gave in 1987
to keep the complex open till 1994.
The early closure took by surprise development officials who had expected
more time to consider the future of the site, and to plan retraining
programmes for the redundant steel workers.
British Steel is negotiating to sell the equipment from the plant to the
Indonesian company Gunawan Dianjaya which plans to reassemble it in
North-east Malaysia. The plant will be the largest steel plant in South-east
Asia.
Pounds 525m has been mentioned as the cost of dismantling Ravenscraig and
re-erecting it in Malaysia, but the proceeds of selling the Scottish plant
will be only a fraction of this sum. For the Indonesian company the deal
should be a cheap way of getting a steel plant.
'Discussions with Gunawan Dianjaya are proceeding satisfactorily,' says
British Steel, 'but we don't expect a contract to be signed until later this
year.'
It is believed that if British Steel is unable to sell the plants overseas
it will dismantle it and sell it for scrap.
The Ravenscraig complex occupies a 1,000 acre site - twice the size of Hyde
park in London - sandwiched between Motherwell and Wishaw. That includes the
110 acre site of the Lanarkshire steelworks which closed in 1983. It is thus
potentially a very big urban redevelopment opportunity which will be crucial
to the future of Motherwell.
So far, there is no clear view on what it should be used for. But an early
decision was not to put it into the Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone.
Mr Archie Bethel, chief executive of the LDA, explains that this is partly
because of the very long time it would take to clear the site, partly
because he doubts whether new investors would be interested in going to a
site in the middle of Motherwell. But Mr Jeremy Bray, Labour MP for
Motherwell South, thinks the future of Ravenscraig is being given too little
priority.
'Nothing has been done since 1983 with the Lanarkshire steelworks site, and
the writing was on the wall for Ravenscraig after 1987, yet nothing was
done. Ravenscraig could be a superb site, right on the west coast main
railway line.'
He fears that the 500 acres of Enterprise Zone and 500 acres of other
industrial sites in Lanarkshire will mean there will be no demand for
industrial land on the Ravenscraig site. But Mr Andrew Russell, head of a
Price Waterhouse team appointed in July to look at the development options,
urges a longer view. 'Ravenscraig will have its day,' he says. 'It would be
a pity to prejudice longer term possibilities by short term developments on
part of the site.'
He says the time span for redevelopment 'will certainly exceed 10 years and
may be as much as 20.' By then, demand for industrial land may well have
been exhausted on the other sites. 'We're urging people to go for a long
term fix.'
British Steel last year commissioned the environmental consultants Aspinwall
to report on the environmental problems of the site. Its preliminary report
showed that hazardous waste had been stored for years in disused mine works
on the site, and that various waste substances such as steel slag, filter
cake, sulphur compounds and ammonia had been dumped there under license.
But the report said that 20 per cent of the site would need no action prior
to redevelopment, and that a further 25 per cent would need only minimal
regrading if the site was to be used for amenity purposes. Industrial
development could follow 'relatively straightforward decontamination
measures,' but 'much more extensive remedial works would be required on
about 70 per cent of the site if the proposed end use was housing.'
Aspinwall is now carrying out the second stage of its study. Various figures
have been put on the cost of reclamation, mostly ranging between Pounds 100m
and Pounds 200m.
Mr Russell says the Ravenscraig site includes a deep wooded ravine of the
river Calder, though the river itself is filled in over part of its length.
That could become a valuable amenity.
Whether the Ravenscraig site becomes a park, a housing development, an
industrial site or a combination of all three, an important planning
priority is to use the opportunity to improve Motherwell, which has a poor
town centre. Any plan is likely to include a new road to connect the M74
motorway to the A8/M8 east-west road.
The former steelworkers, former employees of Ravenscraig, the Clydesdale
tube works and some of their subcontractors are entitled to special benefits
under the EC assistances for former steel areas. They can claim a
supplementary employment benefit of Pounds 16 a week for up to 52 weeks, and
up to 52 weeks training.
By the of last June 1,006 of them were still in training. Another 90 had
found jobs.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Survey of Lanarkshire (1): Foundations for recovery are in
place - Lanarkshire, at the heart of Scotland's central region, is the focus
of government initiatives to revive its economy following the closure of the
Ravenscraig steel works last year. Its enterprise zone is already attracting
inquiries.

<TEXT>
LANARKSHIRE, for decades identified with coal, steel and heavy industry, is
seeking to acquire a new economic base and shed its grimy industrial image.
The process could take 15 years or more, and so far only the first expensive
building blocks have been laid. It is too early to speak of results.
This latest attempt in Britain to regenerate an area where the old
industries are dying or have disappeared started in 1991 when British Steel
began delivering heavy blows to the Scottish steel industry which had been
the lifeblood of the northern part of the county, around Motherwell.
In little more than a year, at an accelerating pace as the UK recession
deepened, British Steel closed the big Ravenscraig steel complex and shut
down the nearby Clydesdale tube mill, making about 4,400 people redundant.
It now employs only 1,100 people in Lanarkshire.
The speed with which the closures of the main plants came was a blessing in
disguise. It forced Scottish politicians and the local community to face
facts and embark on a recovery strategy, undistracted by the polemics which
had dogged Ravenscraig for more than a decade.
The continuing campaign to save Ravenscraig meant that until the middle of
1990, when the now privatised concern said it would shut the plant's hot
strip mill, it would have been politically suicidal for any Scottish
politician or development official to utter a word in public about reviving
the area after the steel industry had gone.
Only in 1990 was a working group set up by the Scottish Office to consider
Lanarkshire's future. The following year the Lanarkshire Development Agency
(LDA) began operating.
There is, of course, much more to Lanarkshire than steel towns. The steel
industry was concentrated in the heavily populated northern tip of the
county, where towns such as Motherwell, Coatbridge and Airdrie are part of
the Clydeside conurbation.
But Lanarkshire - the county was abolished in 1975 but still exists in
people's minds and is the area covered by the LDA - includes the town of
Lanark, one of the cradles of the industrial revolution, and extends much
futher south into the southern uplands of Scotland.
In the upper Clyde valley the big economic issue is not industrial
regeneration but improving the marketing of cattle and tomatoes. But nearly
90 per cent of Lanarkshire's 500,000 people live in the urban north of the
county. West of Motherwell and Hamilton, separated by green belt, lies the
prosperous, landscaped new town of East Kilbride with a cluster of big
foreign-owned electronics plants.
The former steel towns are far from being places of dereliction. The
Ravenscraig site, whose future is still to be decided, is a depressing
scene. But the rest of the area is not one of oppressive decay or poverty,
despite a number of derelict or vacant industrial sites.
Instead, the almost contiguous urban areas north of Motherwell look dreary,
ill-planned and in need of better roads, better industrial sites and more
open spaces.
'People expect to see a place down on its luck,' says Mr Terry Currie, the
director of business development at the LDA. 'They're surprised to find it
isn't. We're in a transitional phase, between a proud industrial past and a
dynamic future.'
The steel closures have aggravated existing problems of economic decline and
recession. Unemployment in Motherwell and Monklands districts has risen from
about 10.5 per cent at the beginning of 1990 to 12.5 per cent in mid-1993,
and male unemployment exceeds 17 per cent. But Lanarkshire is far from being
one of the worst areas of unemployment in Scotland, which the 1991 working
group warned that it would become.
In fact, Mr Donald Leigh, area manager for the Royal Bank of Scotland in
Motherwell, who has worked in Lanarkshire for 27 years, says: 'We've been
used to depressed conditions for years. The recession of the last two years
has not been so noticeable.'
Lanarkshire's problem is that along with the rundown of steel, the area's
traditional manufacturing base is under threat, with engineering companies
facing competition from eastern Europe and the Pacific rim. Too many
businesses were dependent on British Steel and the birthrate for new
companies is low. Apart from East Kilbride, the area has not attracted much
inward investment from abroad. In short, the Lanarkshire economy needs
modernising.
The regeneration effort can build on the large existing manufacturing base,
a skilled and committed workforce, and the fact that Lanarkshire is
strategically placed at the heart of Scotland's central belt, at the
crossroads of its motorway system and on the main west coast railway line.
The main aim of the LDA, whose expenditure has risen from Pounds 54m last
year to Pounds 64m this year, is to bring in new businesses and to improve
existing companies.
One of the first things the Scottish Development Agency did when the
Ravenscraig closure loomed was to buy 500 acres of land for industrial
development in north Lanarkshire. The Scottish Office then pressed the
government and the EC to create an Enterprise Zone.
The Enterprise Zone, spread over nine sites, some of which are still to be
completed, came into existence on February 1 this year. It is beginning to
attract inquiries and the first small developments have begun, although
full-scale marketing of the zone has not yet started. It is calculated that
the zone will create 8,000 new jobs over 10 years.
On the splendid Strathclyde Business Park at Bellshill, which is not in the
Enterprise Zone, the Scottish headquarters of Mercury, a bottling plant for
the distillers William Grant and a number of other plants and offices are
going up.
Work on Scotland's terminal for Channel tunnel railfreight began last month
at Mossend near Bellshill. The hope is that the terminal, to be ready in
time for the tunnel's opening next May, will lead to the setting up of
warehouses and factories on the 800 acre adjoining site.
The LDA is spending Pounds 9.5m this year to help existing Lanarkshire
companies and to stimulate start-ups. A scheme for encouraging managers to
formulate new business ideas has already led to the creation of several
little companies.
For a county that does not exist, Lanarkshire has a strong sense of local
identity and people show determination to revive their economy, with few
signs of apathy. A civic pride campaign based on the slogan Supercounty,
displayed on signs all over Lanarkshire, has been launched by local
authorities and companies.
But the challenge facing Lanarkshire is immense. Its past industrial
vocations are being whittled away and there are few obvious candidates to
take their place. Apart from the clever idea of exporting the local
expertise acquired, of necessity, in the reclamation and decontamination of
industrial land, the aim is to attract a broad mix of high technology
industries, like many other parts of Scotland.
Much of the regeneration strategy relies on outside businesses coming to
realise the advantages of a Lanarkshire location and deciding to move there.
Whether they do so depends partly on the UK and the Scottish economies
generating the necessary growth. It also depends on Lanarkshire beating
competition from other Scottish towns. Enterprise Zone status is not the
only factor influencing investors.
That is why it is so important that the regeneration campaign changes the
face and the image of Lanarkshire.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Property: Hunt for bargains in the malls - Richard Waters
explains the current popularity in the US of real estate investment trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Middle American shopping malls - symbols of the 1980s retail boom - are
discovering a new lease of life on Wall Street.
In the past fortnight, two of the country's biggest private developers from
the 1980s have disclosed plans to sell stakes in their retail property
empires, in deals that could raise Dollars 1.5bn between them. And although
the yields on these public investment vehicles will be well below those
available on similar private investments, there is no shortage of takers.
Real estate investment trusts (known as Reits) have been one of the big hits
on Wall Street this year. They bring together two groups of people:
debt-laden developers who need cash, and yield-starved investors who want a
higher return than that available in the bond market and a liquid investment
that is publicly quoted. Given the scale of the fees involved, Wall Street
has been happy to play host to this party.
The latest developers to reveal their intention to go public are two of the
most prominent names from the 1980s: Edward DeBartolo, an Ohio-based
developer who has spent more than 40 years building a retail property empire
in Middle America, and Melvin Simon who, with his family, has developed more
than 100 shopping centres across the US. The Simon family will retain 51.4
per cent of its property investment vehicle, while DeBartolo will yield
majority ownership.
Both have been driven by the need to pay off old bank debt. DeBartolo, who
has been looking for ways to appease his bankers for the past two years,
will use Dollars 398m of the Dollars 561m raised (after fees) to repay debt:
he also plans to repay another Dollars 396m of borrowings with a securitised
debt offering launched at the same time. The Simon deal is similar: a net
Dollars 993m will be raised, Dollars 240m of it through a debt issue, of
which Dollars 870m will be used to repay borrowings.
It is not hard to see why these and other developers have decided that now
is the moment to go public to raise cash. After a rise in prices early this
year, yields on Reits have fallen well below yields on comparable private
property investments. By distributing 95 per cent of its income in the form
of a dividend, for instance, the promoters of the Simon vehicle say it will
offer a yield of 7 1/4 per cent. Regional shopping malls and 'community
centres' (small shopping centres) of the type in the Simon portfolio might
be expected to change hands in private transactions of yields ranging from 8
1/2 to 11 per cent, depending on the location, size and competitive
strengths of each site, says Mr Christopher Budden, chief executive of
Yarmouth Group, the property adviser.
With such a wide gap between yields in the public and private markets, it is
possible for developers to pay Wall Street's not inconsiderable fees for
going public and still come out ahead. The Simon Property Group deal, which
is led by Merrill Lynch, will net the advisers and underwriters Dollars 67m,
or 8 per cent of the proceeds - and this for a what has become a fairly
standard transaction. The DeBartolo transaction, led by Morgan Stanley, will
raise around Dollars 40m in fees. (Neither of these figures includes the
fees associated with the debt securitisations which are also planned.) No
wonder most investment bankers are quick to sing the praises of Reits at the
moment.
What do investors in public deals get in return for the hefty premiums they
are paying? Liquidity, first and foremost: most Reit investments this year
have been snapped up by small investors and mutual funds. Both groups have
been prepared to pay for the opportunity to take a relatively liquid equity
investment in real estate. The investment trusts also bring diversification:
the DeBartolo portfolio contains 51 malls, the Simon one 110.
Beyond this, the main advantage claimed for Reits is that they are worth
more than the sum of the individual shopping centres they contain. They give
investors the chance to buy into established management companies, which
will use their experience to squeeze higher rental income out of the
properties in future. That, at least, is the theory.
In the meantime, a more immediate concern for investors is likely to be
whether rental income might fall in the near future, rather than rise. Two
factors are at work:
US retail sales continue to grow at only a sluggish pace, and a large part
of the income of the shopping centres is tied to the sales of their tenants.
Many smaller shopping centres are under pressure from the retail fad of the
1990s: the large dis-count store. Malls and other cen-tres which do not have
strong department stores to 'anchor' them, by providing a focal point for
customers, or which have big discount operations close at hand, are most at
risk.
Retail vacancy rates have already been creeping up since the mid-1980s (see
chart). What this overall picture does not show, though, is where vacancy
rates have been growing fastest, says Mr Budden - in the small, specialised
retailers who yield the highest return for mall owners. As vacancy rates
rise, rents inevitably fall (or, at least, stop rising) as mall owners
struggle to hold on to those tenants that remain.
The DeBartolo portfolio of malls - considered one of the strongest currently
on offer to investors - reflects these pressures. The overall vacancy rate
of the centres rose from less than 7 per cent in 1988 to 15 per cent at the
end of June this year.
With Wal-Mart stores and warehouse clubs sprouting across the US like
mushrooms, where will it all end for the malls?
For the weaker ones, no doubt, closure. Large Reits with well-spread
properties, while benefiting from portfolio diversification, will not be
immune to such pressures. But that is hardly something that will worry US
investment bankers as they pocket their latest fat fees.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ease across range after
economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON, CONNER MIDDELMANN and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON

<TEXT>
US TREASURY prices eased across the maturity range yesterday, sending long
yields back above 6 per cent, following an upbeat Chicago purchasing
managers' report.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  11/32 at
103 1/8 , yielding 6.018 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 100, to yield 3.859 per cent.
After a slow opening, prices eased across the board when the Chicago
purchasing managers' index, a reliable indicator for the national index
which is released today, showed a sharp increase for September. Traders were
unsettled by a big jump in the employment index. The data, combined with the
earlier report of an 11,000 decline in weekly jobless claims, depressed bond
market sentiment and pushed the 30-year yield above 6 per cent again.
The day's other economic figures - a 1.3 per cent increase in August
personal income and a 0.3 per cent increase in August personal spending, and
a 3.1 per cent decline in August new home sales - were broadly in line with
expectations and had little impact upon prices.
THE sell-off in US Treasuries, and the latest developments in Russia, hit
Europe's bond markets in late trading.
German government bonds fell about  1/4 point towards the close, led by a
sell-off in the futures pits. Bunds have risen in recent days on supportive
inflation numbers, and on signs that Germany's industrial employers will
take a tough stance in the coming wage round. 'After making some hefty
profits, people decided to take some profits,' said a Frankfurt trader.
The 6 per cent yield on the 10-year benchmark is also proving a hurdle few
traders were willing to tackle. 'There was no real news to help us through
that level,' said the trader. The 6 1/2 per cent bonds of 2003 yielded 6.10
per cent in late trade, up from 6.06 per cent earlier in the day. Traders
reported little retail selling though, and bunds are expected to remain
range-bound in the next few days.
FRENCH government bonds eased in line with Germany on late profit-taking in
largely futures-driven trading. As expected, the central bank left its 6.75
per cent intervention rate unchanged at its latest repo operation and
traders say bonds are likely to remain range-bound until the next repo
allocation Monday.
GILT futures ended fractionally lower after retracing earlier gains, while
cash market prices were mixed. Dealers said the market lacked any real
direction in the wake of Wednesday's auction.
Prices firmed in the morning on the back of rumours of a large switch from
US Treasuries into gilts after the auction, but the market ran out of steam
in the afternoon. The long gilt future on Liffe ended at 113 1/8 , down
3/32 from Wednesday's close.
THE ITALIAN bond market stood out against the rest of Europe, with the
December BTP future hitting another historic high at 116.20. While most of
the gains were eroded towards the close, the market is expected to continue
its recent strong performance.
'Italy still looks good - it's hard to be pessimistic about it,' said Mr Kit
Juckes, European economist with SG Warburg. 'Italy is not a high-inflation
country any more, and this will allow the authorities to cut rates further,'
he said.
Mr Juckes especially favours selling Belgian bonds against Italian bonds
while Belgium remains dogged by its fiscal and structural problems.
Belgian bonds weakened despite the central bank's 0.10-point cut in its
central and end-of-day rates. The 10-year yield spread over Germany ended at
133 basis points, against 130 on Wednesday.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Fed rules on commodity
derivatives

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Federal Reserve Board has granted the Bank of Montreal powers to deal in
commodity derivatives. The decision is expected to apply to other banks,
writes Laurie Morse in Chicago.
The Fed ruling will extend competition between banks and broker-dealers to
non-financial futures and options.
Prior to the Fed decision, banks were allowed to trade financial instruments
on US futures and options exchanges, but were barred from clearing or
servicing customer needs in exchange-traded energy or agricultural
derivatives.
The Fed said Chicago-based Harris Futures Corporation could execute trades
and clear non-financial transactions at the US's three largest futures
exchanges. However, Harris will not be allowed to trade commodity futures
and options for its own account, trade the physical commodities or offer
commodities advice.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Flow of Canadian dollar issues
continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT flow of Canadian dollar issues continued yesterday as the Kingdom
of Denmark raised CDollars 250m through an offering of six-year Eurobonds.
Mr Niels Sorensen, head of the foreign debt department at Denmark's National
Bank, said that the issue formed part of Denmark's policy to replace
commercial paper that was falling due with medium-term borrowings.
He added that there was a lot of commercial paper falling due this month.
The bonds were priced to yield 32 basis points over the 6 1/2 per cent
Canadian Treasury due 1998. Lead manager Daiwa said there was a differential
of 12 basis points between the five-year and the six-year area of the yield
curve.
Mr Sorensen said that the proceeds of the issue had been swapped into
floating-rate dollars at a 'comfortable' level below the London interbank
offered rate (Libor). He indicated that the margin below Libor was in double
digits.
Daiwa said the launch of the issue had been hampered by a half-point fall in
the underlying Canadian government bond market. When the bonds were freed to
trade, they eased to 98.15 from their re-offer price of 98.65, but the
spread remained intact.
There was a blend of retail and institutional interest in the bonds, which
offer a significant yield pick-up over the recent spate of five-year
Canadian dollar offerings. However, Daiwa said it would take some time to
place the entire issue.
Salomon Inc raised Dollars 294.5m through a three-year offering of
auction-rate notes linked to the yen. Salomon said the notes offered
investors exposure to the yen without having to hedge themselves in the
foreign exchange market.
In the Eurosterling sector, Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil company, raised
Pounds 75m through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds. Lead manager BZW said
this was the first time Pemex had achieved a 10-year maturity since the
international bond market re-opened to Latin American borrowers.
The bonds were priced to yield 200 basis points over the 8 per cent UK
government bond due 2003, but the spread tightened to 195 points after the
bonds were freed to trade. The proceeds were swapped into fixed-rate
dollars.
Banco de Colombia, the largest commercial bank in the country in terms of
deposits, raised Dollars 50m through an offering of five-year Eurobonds. The
issue completes the borrower's Dollars 100m Euro-MTN programme.
The bonds were priced to yield 300 basis points over the 4 3/4 per cent US
Treasury due 1998, which represents an improvement of 20 basis points since
June when the issuer made a Dollars 50m offering of three-year Eurobonds.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said it had placed Fiat's
A-1 commercial paper rating on creditwatch with negative implications.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Japan announces deregulation
for securities trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance yesterday announced a series of measures aimed
at deregulating the securities industry in the face of increasing pressure
by the new coalition government for a reduction in controls.
However, the 30 measures announced yesterday, which include an easing of
restrictions on brokers' door-to-door sales of gold coins and a reduction of
mandatory reporting procedures, failed to inspire the financial community in
Tokyo.
Japan's financial industry is still heavily regulated compared with leading
western countries.
Barriers between banking and securities industries have not yet fallen, and
the number of investment products available is far fewer than in places such
as New York and London.
The government has also called for greater disclosure of decision-making
procedures within ministries.
The Ministry of Finance has been accused by foreign brokers and some
Japanese institutions of inconsistency and a lack of transparency in its
decision making.
Of the 30 measures, only 10 were new and aimed at easing some procedural
rules on securities trading. The ministry said the reduction in reporting of
trading activities, including trading by foreign investors and brokers' own
accounts, would help cut the amount of paperwork at the brokers.
However, brokers said that the effects of the new measures would be minimal,
since detailed trading reports are handed to the Tokyo stock exchange every
week.
The ministry said that the approval of brokers' entry into new securities
related businesses stipulated in the report would not mean that new
securities products would be quickly accepted.

bond auction
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG plans to hold its first public bond auction
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
of 6 1/2 per cent 10-year bonds - on October 20.
The Treasury has decided to start auctioning paper for greater visibility
and liquidity, an official said. Luxembourg has traditionally issued its
government bonds via bank syndicates.
Although he declined to disclose the likely size of the forthcoming issue,
he said it may be announced closer to the auction date. The Treasury plans
to hold monthly auctions at which all banks licensed to do business in
Luxembourg can bid.
The method of issuing bonds will be similar to the Belgian system, where
linear bonds with standardised maturity dates and coupons but variable
amounts are auctioned every month. Unlike Belgium, however, Luxembourg will
not have a system of primary dealers.
Traders were surprised by the bond's coupon, which is some 90 basis points
below the yield on Belgian 10-year bonds. Given the two currencies are
tightly pegged, the yield gap mystified dealers and sparked speculation that
Luxembourg may consider breaking its currency's link with the Belgian franc.
While Luxembourg's ordinary budget is actually in surplus, the extraordinary
budget, which includes one-off items such as infrastructure spending, means
the country has to fund a small net deficit.
The country's net budget deficit this year will be LFr1.8bn and is forecast
at LFr1.9bn for 1994, the Treasury official said.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Japanese firm merges with Arthur
Andersen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR ANDERSEN, the worldwide accountancy firm, yesterday announced that it
had merged with Asahi &amp; Co to create the largest professional services
organisation in Japan.
Asahi has been granted 'corporate membership' of the Arthur Andersen
Worldwide Organisation, which will make it part of the firm's global
cost-sharing structure. The firm said there had been no payment as part of
the merger.
The merger follows an affiliation agreement signed in December last year
with Asahi to allow the firm to share fees and receive referrals from
Andersen's own Japanese audit firm, Inoue Saito Eiwa.
Asahi &amp; Co is formed from the merger of Asahi Shinwa and and Inoue Saito
Eiwa, which together had fee income last year of Dollars 197m, about 2,000
staff and just over 300 partners.
Andersen Consulting will continue as a 'sister' organisation alongside the
new firm in Japan with some sharing of resources. It has Dollars 100m in
revenues in the country.
The merger is unusual because Asahi becomes a corporate partner of Andersen
worldwide. The Asahi partners do not individually become partners in
Andersen, although some may be appointed in the future.
Mr Richard Measelle, Andersen's managing partner, said Asahi &amp; Co would
retain its existing name 'indefinitely' rather than being called Andersen.
He said a growing number of the firm's practices used other names for
marketing or regulatory reasons.
Mr Measelle called the merger 'a truly significant milestone for our firm'.
It is the most important such development since Andersen merged with SGV, a
large independent Asian practice based in the Philippines, in 1985.

<TEXT>
OKI Electric, the Japanese maker of communications equipment and
semiconductors, said yesterday that losses for the year ending March 1994
would be less than initially expected.
Oki said it now expects sales for the first half of the year to be 2 per
cent higher than previously forecast, at Y255bn (USDollars 2.4bn), and that
its pre-tax loss for the six months would be Y7bn, rather than the earlier
estimate of Y14bn.
Full-year sales are expected to be slightly lower at Y555bn instead of
Y560bn. Pre-tax losses for the year are, however, expected to be more than
halved at Y8bn, against the Y19bn incurred in 1992-93.
The company, however, is passing its dividend. It is aiming to return to
profit in 1994-95 and resume dividend payments the following year.
In the second half of this year, Oki expects demand to remain weak with its
main customers, banks and other corporations, keeping capital spending low.
One reason for the improvement in Oki's forecast is strong demand for memory
chips, particularly in the US.

Shares in Institut Merieux have been suspended pending a further
announcement on the planned deal.
Rhone Poulenc currently holds 51 per cent of the shares with the Merieux
family holding 16 per cent, the Dassault family holding 14 per cent, and the
balance being controlled by the public and the Pasteur Institute.
Chemicals industry analysts said that Rhone-Poulenc wants to increase its

<TEXT>
MR LEE Ming-tee, the controversial chairman of Hong Kong's Allied Group,
yesterday announced his resignation in the wake of a Hong Kong government
report alleging wide-ranging corporate misconduct by Mr Lee.
According to the Allied group, Mr Lee 'needed time to deal with the
allegations made against him in the Financial Secretary's report, which he
intends to contest. He recognises that to do so will take time and may
detract from his ability properly to perform his duties.'
The government report provides indications of false accounting, market
manipulation and a number of breaches of the stock exchange listing and
takeover rules.
The stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Exchange (SFC) are
considering taking further action. Allied has said it plans to contest the
report.
Mr Lee remains the largest single shareholder in the group, with a 30 per
cent holding in the flagship company, Allied Group.
He will retain a consultancy role for Allied's businesses in China.
Mr Lee remains on the board of UK financial services group Aitken Hume, but
is expected to resign from that post.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOUYGUES, the French construction and engineering group, said yesterday that
it had been selected to head a consortium to run a new network of electronic
paging services.
The consortium, called Omnicom, plans to be operational in the Paris region
by the end of 1994 and nationwide by the end of 1998. It will enter an
increasingly competitive market. In addition to three existing players, the
government has authorised the telecommunications groups Cofira and France
Telecom to establish paging systems.
The announcement followed comments by Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister,
that the government is also considering the creation of a third cellular
telephone operator. The two existing operators - France Telecom and SFR, a
unit of Compagnie Generale des Eaux - might be given access to a broader
range of wavelengths.
Bouygues, which is believed to be interested in entering the cellular
telephone market, will hold just under 50 per cent of Omnicom. Pacific
Telesis International, a subsidiary of PacTel, the US telecoms group, will
be the principal technical partner in the consortium and will hold 18 per
cent of the shares.
Other Omnicom partners include Societe Generale, the French bank; Preussen
Elektra Telekom, a subsidiary of Veba of Germany; and Neuflize,
Schlumberger, Mallet, a subsidiary of ABN-Amro, the Dutch bank.
A spokesman for Bouygues said that the group expected strong growth in the
market for electronic paging. He said that with 350,000 subscribers at
present, the market was much less developed than in countries such as the US
and Japan.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: US issuance records broken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US corporations issued record amounts of new debt and equity during the
third quarter as the lowest interest rates in 30 years continued to fuel
Wall Street's unprecedented surge in underwriting business.
According to Securities Data, the New Jersey-based financial information
group, US companies sold Dollars 285.5bn of stock and bonds between July and
September, up from Dollars 232.5bn in the same period a year earlier.
The biggest increase in volume by category was in common stock issuance,
which jumped to Dollars 24.4bn from Dollars 14.5bn a year ago, due primarily
to buoyant US share markets and heavy demand for equities from yield-starved
investors. Initial public offerings, or flotations of new companies,
accounted for Dollars 13. bn.
The volume of investment-grade debt issues rose 22 per cent to Dollars
94.9bn, while the volume of mortgage- and asset-backed securities issued
increased to Dollars 141.8bn from Dollars 120.9bn a year ago. The market for
new high-yield corporate debt, or junk bonds, remained active in the
quarter, with volume climbing 18 per cent to Dollars 12.6bn.
The capital markets were busy in the third quarter. Tensions within the
European Monetary System prompted a decline in interest rates across Europe,
and attracted record amounts of new debt and equity to the markets.
A total of Dollars 93.4bn in Eurobonds and international equities were
issued in the quarter, up from Dollars 56.6bn a year earlier.
Wall Street firms continued to cash in on increased capital raising ,
earning Dollars 2.2bn in fees during the quarter.
Merrill Lynch again dominated the rankings, earning Dollars 470.6m. Goldman
Sachs retained its runner-up position, while Kidder, Peabody leapfrogged
Lehman Brothers and CS First Boston to take the third spot.
In total, Dollars 1,100bn in new debt and equity has been raised on the
world's financial markets so far this year, surpassing 1992's total.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Martin Marietta unveils Dollars
1.5bn cost-cutting plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MARTIN Marietta, the US defence contractor, yesterday announced a
consolidation plan intended to reduce operating costs by Dollars 1.5bn over
the next five years.
The restructuring, which involves the closure of facilities in seven states
and a further 2,000 job losses, follows Marietta's Dollars 3.05bn
acquisition of General Electric's aerospace division earlier this year.
The merger created the world's largest aerospace electronics group, with
annual revenues of about Dollars 11bn. The group's main products include
space equipment, missiles, satellites, avionics and communications systems.
Before the deal was approved in April, Mr Norman Augustine, Marietta's
chairman, warned that significant cuts would be necessary to eliminate
overcapacity and duplication in administration, research and production.
Most of the facilities to be shut or relocated under the plan were formerly
operated by GE. The former GE aerospace headquarters in Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania, will consolidate with Martin Marietta's main office in
Bethesda, Maryland, with a 40 per cent cut in staff.
GE's former Automated Systems arm, which produces simulation and test
systems for the military at facilities in Florida and Massachusetts, will
merge with Marietta's Electronic Systems Center in Orlando, Florida.
In addition to cutting costs, Marietta said the consolidation was intended
to 'put together complementary technologies under one group'. The resulting
'synergies', the company said, would lead to greater market penetration and
higher shares.
The redundancies announced yesterday are in addition to 9,000 jobs the
company previously said it would eliminate this year. The figure brings the
total number of positions that Marietta and GE Aerospace have cut since 1987
to 46,000. The down-sizing reflects sharp reductions in defence spending, as
well as efforts to improve productivity.
The scope of the consolidation was in line with analysts' expectations. At
the close of trading on Wall Street, Marietta shares were up Dollars  3/8 at
Dollars 89.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: QUF joins bid battle for
Associated Dairies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN ADollars 72m (USDollars 48.9m) bid battle broke out yesterday over
Associated Dairies, the Victoria-based dairy products company. The
development underlines the rapid rate at which Australia's dairy industry is
consolidating in the face of deregulation.
QUF Industries, the Brisbane-based milk and dairy goods company, said it was
willing to pay ADollars 2.95 a share for Associated Dairies, on an
ex-dividend basis. This outstrips the ADollars 2.85-a-share offer from
Australian Co-operative Foods, the original predator, and values the target
company at about ADollars 72m - about ADollars 2.5m more than the ACF bid.
QUF maintained that its offer was friendly and said it expected it to carry
a recommendation from the Associated Dairies board. Associated's directors
said they had yet to receive the QUF's formal offer.
However, in the absence of any higher offer, they proposed to recommend
acceptance of the new bid. The bid is likely to be formally submitted within
two weeks.
ACF indicated that it might still be in the running. 'We're not going to lay
down and die,' its managing director, Mr Alan Tooth, commented.
The bid battle comes less than two weeks after National Foods, a food
processing and consumer products company, won control of United Dairies,
which has about 30 per cent of the Sydney milk market.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Shareholder reform reaches Japan
 -Reluctant companies face radical changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE companies are under mounting pressure to become more compatible
with western corporate culture and to increase the rights of shareholders.
Many companies are bracing themselves for a rush of lawsuits as radical
revisions to Japan's commercial code come into force today. These ease
filing requirements for shareholder litigants and should, in theory, lead to
greater financial disclosure. The commercial code revisions are:
The cost of lawsuits against company executives by shareholders on behalf of
the company will be limited to a flat Y8,200 (Dollars 80) rather than a
percentage of the damages sought.
Investors holding 3 per cent of a company's shares will be allowed access to
a company's accounts. The earlier limit was 10 per cent.
Large companies will need at least three auditors with at least one
independent auditor. Their term of office will be lengthened from two years
to three.
Keidanren, Japan's leading business grouping, is asking companies to become
more conscious of shareholders, urging greater disclosure of information and
acceptance of the philosophy that companies are not just for employees.
Mr Yoshio Nakamura, director of Keidanren's international economic affairs
division, says there is a need to answer claims that the Japanese system is
built on ideologies totally different to those of the west. 'Japanese
companies need to and can become more like US and European corporations,' he
says.
While corporate executives have responded to the possible rise in lawsuits
by rushing to buy insurance cover, only a few companies have so far publicly
acknowledged the calls for more disclosure and further shareholder rights.
To prevent disruption, companies try to hold their meetings on the same day,
keeping them as short as possible with the help of majority stable
shareholders. This year, more than 1,900 companies held their annual
shareholders' meetings on the same day in June.
Dividend policy is also part of the shareholders' rights debate. Dividends
have been kept low, using the argument that earnings should be retained for
future investments. The dividend yield of the Nikkei average is currently
around 0.8 per cent, against around 2.9 per cent for comparable US indices.
Companies tend to claim they are institutions run by employees for the
benefit of employees. Mr Kanemitsu Anraku, director of Nissan Motor, points
out that before the stock market boiled over in the late 1980s, company
investment decisions were under the tight grip of their main creditor banks.
Recent stock market trends have eroded the banks' power over companies, but
the gap has yet to be filled by shareholders.
Mr Masaru Yoshitomi, vice-chairman of LTCB Research Institute, feels
shareholders are in a vacuum. In spite of earlier predictions, the cross
shareholding system between companies - one of the leading factors in the
lack of shareholders' rights - has yet to change drastically, he says.
Meanwhile, some lawyers are sceptical about changes in corporate attitudes
due to the amendment of the commercial law. Mr Hideto Iida, a lawyer who is
preparing to take Nomura Securities to court over the way the securities
house compensated some clients for stock losses, says it is unlikely that
ordinary individual shareholders will take action, since damages are paid to
the company instead of the plaintiff.
The recent ruling by the Tokyo district court that directors of Nomura
Securities were not required to reimburse the securities house for client
stock losses has been an obvious blow to the shareholder litigants.
Businesses may try to resist the corporate governance debate and oppose an
elevated role for shareholders for as long as they can. Mr Nakamura at the
Keidanren points out that companies may claim that the economy has to
recover before they can start caring about investors.
'When profits are down, you only think about trying to boost them up again,'
he says.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse makes management
changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Jordan, the new chairman of Westinghouse Electric, has set in
motion the first of an expected series of management changes at the company.
The diversified group has been struggling to recover from an ill-advised
foray into financial services during the 1980s.
Mr Jordan, a former PepsiCo executive who was named Westinghouse chairman
and chief executive just three months ago, said in an internal memorandum Mr
Warren Hollinshead would leave his job as chief financial officer before
mid-1995, when he was scheduled to take early retirement.
Analysts expect Mr Jordan to select an outsider as the first member of a
team charged with reversing the fortunes of the group, which has taken
Dollars 5bn in charges in just three years.
In January, Mr Jordan replaced Mr Paul Lego, who is believed to have left
under pressure from institutional investors unhappy with his failure to stem
losses related to real estate, junk bonds and leveraged buy-out investments.
Over the past year, Westinghouse has attempted to reduce its massive debt
burden by gradually withdrawing from financial services.
As part of Mr Jordan's recovery plan, it agreed to sell its electronic
distribution and control business for Dollars 1.1bn.
However, Westinghouse's difficulties extend into its core operations as
well. Earlier this month, it warned of a substantial downturn in
third-quarter earnings due to a 'continued deterioration' of its
environmental clean-up businesses as well as declines in electronic systems,
power systems and broadcasting.
Net income from continuing operations is expected to drop 50 per cent,
against last year's comparable figure of Dollars 91m, or 22 a cents a share.

<TEXT>
BOUYGUES, the French construction and engineering group, said yesterday that
it had been selected to head a consortium to run a new network of electronic
paging services.
The consortium, called Omnicom, plans to be operational in the Paris region
by the end of 1994 and nationwide by the end of 1998. It will enter an
increasingly competitive market. In addition to three existing players, the
government has authorised the telecommunications groups Cofira and France

The announcement followed comments by Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister,
that the government is also considering the creation of a third cellular
telephone operator. The two existing operators - France Telecom and SFR, a
unit of Compagnie Generale des Eaux - might be given access to a broader
range of wavelengths.
Bouygues, which is believed to be interested in entering the cellular
telephone market, will hold just under 50 per cent of Omnicom. Pacific
Telesis International, a subsidiary of PacTel, the US telecoms group, will
be the principal technical partner in the consortium and will hold 18 per
cent of the shares.
Other Omnicom partners include Societe Generale, the French bank; Preussen
Elektra Telekom, a subsidiary of Veba of Germany; and Neuflize,
Schlumberger, Mallet, a subsidiary of ABN-Amro, the Dutch bank.
A spokesman for Bouygues said that the group expected strong growth in the
market for electronic paging. He said that with 350,000 subscribers at
present, the market was much less developed than in countries such as the US
and Japan.
The Omnicom network will operate on the European Radio Message System, a new
pan-European standard adopted by 18 countries which allows the transmission
of messages of up to 9,000 characters.
RVI, the bus and truck arm of the Renault group, will create two joint
companies with Franfinance, part of Societe Generale, Reuter reports from
Paris. One unit, Renault VI Financement, will finance loans and leasing
agreements for truck sales while the other, Renault VI Location, will rent
trucks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OKI Electric, the Japanese maker of communications equipment and
semiconductors, said yesterday that losses for the year ending March 1994
would be less than initially expected.
Oki said it now expects sales for the first half of the year to be 2 per
cent higher than previously forecast, at Y255bn (USDollars 2.4bn), and that
its pre-tax loss for the six months would be Y7bn, rather than the earlier
estimate of Y14bn.
Full-year sales are expected to be slightly lower at Y555bn instead of
Y560bn. Pre-tax losses for the year are, however, expected to be more than
halved at Y8bn, against the Y19bn incurred in 1992-93.
The company, however, is passing its dividend. It is aiming to return to
profit in 1994-95 and resume dividend payments the following year.
In the second half of this year, Oki expects demand to remain weak with its
main customers, banks and other corporations, keeping capital spending low.
The main reasons for the improvement in Oki's forecast are strong demand for
memory chips, particularly in the US, which has allowed Oki to maintain
prices while increasing sales volume and reducing costs, and an increase in
orders from NTT, the Japanese telecommunications company.
An improvement in its financial balance, due to lower interest rates, will
also help.
Oki is stepping up its restructuring efforts to deal with the adverse
business climate. It is to bring forward plans for a 2,000 reduction in its
payroll and proposes spinning off its printed circuit board business as a
separate company. Costs are also being cut in manufacturing and research and
development, the company said.
Asahi Breweries is to tie-up with Molson Breweries USA, part of the Canadian
brewing group, in a move aimed at expanding sales, Reuter reports from
Tokyo. Asahi, which exported 700,000 cases of beer to the US in 1992-1993,
plans to increase the number to 1.5m within five years.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Japanese firm merges with Arthur
Andersen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR ANDERSEN, the worldwide accountancy firm, yesterday announced that it
had merged with Asahi &amp; Co to create the largest professional services
organisation in Japan.
Asahi has been granted 'corporate membership' of the Arthur Andersen
Worldwide Organisation, which will make it part of the firm's global
cost-sharing structure. The firm said there had been no payment as part of
the merger.
The merger follows an affiliation agreement signed in December last year
with Asahi to allow the firm to share fees and receive referrals from
Andersen's own Japanese audit firm, Inoue Saito Eiwa.
Asahi &amp; Co is formed from the merger of Asahi Shinwa and and Inoue Saito
Eiwa, which together had fee income last year of Dollars 197m, about 2,000
staff and just over 300 partners.
Andersen Consulting will continue as a 'sister' organisation alongside the
new firm in Japan with some sharing of resources. It has Dollars 100m in
revenues in the country.
The merger is unusual because Asahi becomes a corporate partner of Andersen
worldwide.
The Asahi partners do not individually become partners in Andersen, although
some may be appointed in the future.
Mr Richard Measelle, Andersen's managing partner, said Asahi &amp; Co would
retain its existing name 'indefinitely' rather than being called Andersen.
He said a growing number of the firm's practices used other names for
marketing or regulatory reasons.
Mr Measelle called the merger 'a truly significant milestone for our firm'.
It is the most important such development since Andersen merged with SGV, a
large independent Asian practice based in the Philippines, in 1985.
Asahi had previously been affiliated with Ernst &amp; Young, but all links with
this firm have now been severed.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Marriott board agrees plan to
split company
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MARRIOTT Corporation, the hotels and food services company, reported flat
third-quarter earnings and said that its board had voted to go ahead with
its planned demerger on October 8.
After a year of battling with angry bondholder groups, the company is
splitting into two. Its main operating interests - lodging and food services
operations, accounting for about 80 per cent of the unified company's
revenues - will be known as Marriott International. Its property assets and
its Host/Travel Plazas business, as well as the bulk of the group's debts,
will be known as Host Marriott.
Marriott International, the company whose shares will be distributed to
Marriott Corporation shareholders in the form of a special dividend, will
report its third-quarter results in mid-October.
For the three months to September 10, Marriott had net income of Dollars
27m, or 21 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 2.03bn compared with net
income of Dollars 26m, or 21 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.95bn a year
earlier.
Operating profit before corporate expenses and interest rose to Dollars 134m
in the quarter from Dollars 124m a year earlier.
Stripping out income tax adjustments and lodging dispositions in both years,
Marriott said operating profits rose 7 per in the latest quarter on a
comparable basis, while net income was 20 per cent higher.
Lodging operations turned in an 11 per cent improvement in third-quarter
operating profits including profits from the disposition of an equity
interest in an international hotel. Sales were up 3 per cent.
The Host/Travel Plazas division, which will be part of the Host Marriott
company, reported higher sales in the quarter but operating profits
declined.

UNITED AIRLINES said it hoped to keep alive discussions with unions aimed at
radically shrinking its cost base, in spite of a statement yesterday from
the Association of Flight Attendants that it was pulling out of the talks,
writes Richard Waters.
The Association said its decision was prompted by United's move to open a
flight attendants' base in Taiwan and its plans to open other bases in east
Asia.
While indicating it would not change its decision, United said it remained
'fully receptive' to continuing its discussions with the unions about the
serious economic and competitive issues facing the airline.
Shares in UAL, United's parent, were Dollars 3 3/4 lower at Dollars 137 1/4
at the close in New York yesterday.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: USAir warns of return to red in
third quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USAIR yesterday warned of further cost-cutting and 2,500 more job losses.
The carrier said weak revenues over the summer had reversed its fragile
return to profitability of the second quarter.
The company said that, after a one-off charge of Dollars 75m, it would
report a pre-tax loss of Dollars 180m for the third quarter. This compares
with a pre-tax profit of Dollars 5.8m (and net loss of Dollars 12.6m) in the
second three months of the year.
It also repeated a warning that it would report a net loss for 1993 as a
whole, and an operating loss for the year.
The projected losses had prompted the airline, in which British Airways has
a minority stake, to take steps to cut Dollars 200m from its costs next
year, said Mr Seth Schofield, chairman and chief executive.
'Consumers are becoming increasingly price-sensitive, and we are witnessing
a resurgence of low-fare competition from airlines whose cost structures
enable them to offer the lower prices that consumers demand,' he said.
The airline said it planned to cut 2,500 full-time jobs by the middle of
next year, and that the costs of this would be reflected in its
third-quarter results.
A retroactive accounting change for post-retirement benefits would result in
a charge of Dollars 44m for the year, the company added.
The renewed cost-cutting efforts failed to lift USAir's share price
yesterday. After falling by Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 12 3/8 in early trade,
they closed unchanged at Dollars 12 5/8.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Injecting life into an old
jalopy - Martin Dickson charts racing hero Roger Penske's successes at
engine-maker Detroit Diesel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROGER Penske, 56, is best-known to Americans for his youthful exploits as a
racing driver and his more recent success as owner of the prize-winning
racing car team which bears his name.
However, the flotation, expected next week, of a company he has nursed back
to health, testifies to his other impressive track record - as an
entrepreneur.
It also provides an object lesson in how a business smothered by a large,
slow-moving corporate parent can gain a new lease of life under more nimble
management.
The company is Detroit Diesel, which makes diesel engines primarily for the
heavy-duty truck market, but also for buses, power generation and the
mining, construction and boat industries.
It is selling 4.75m shares - 3.8m in the US and 950,000 internationally - in
an initial public offering at up to Dollars 18 a share. This will raise
around Dollars 80m and value the group at some Dollars 400m. The proceeds
will be used to reduce debt and expenses, and buy a business.
Formerly known as Detroit Diesel Allison, the company was a subsidiary of
General Motors, the largest US car manufacturer, until 1988, when Mr
Penske's private business empire acquired an 80 per cent controlling stake.
GM, which retained the remaining 20 per cent, was anxious to get out of the
business partly because of Allison's poor financial performance and partly
because it wanted to focus its energies on turning round its troubled North
American car operations.
Mr Penske, whose business acumen has won him seats on the boards of American
Express and Philip Morris, and whose interests include large car dealerships
and one of America's biggest truck leasing businesses, gambled correctly
that Allison's woes masked great potential.
Its share of the North American on-highway heavy-duty truck engine market
has jumped from just 4 per cent in 1988 to 26 per cent last year, with
revenues up 63 per cent, to Dollars 1.37bn from Dollars 842m
The net income figures are much less impressive, rising from Dollars 8.5m to
Dollars 10.5m over the same period, and 1992 was flattered by a first-half
Dollars 4.3m one-time gain. Still, the company has bounced back from losses
of Dollars 2.9m and Dollars 5.2m in the recessionary years of 1990 and 1991,
and the first half of this year saw net income up from an underlying Dollars
1.2m to Dollars 8.9m.
This turnround is largely a tale of two engines. In the 1980s, under GM's
ownership, the company floundered because of the poor reputation of its 92
Series heavy-duty engine, which was introduced in the late 1970s and
initially captured a large share of the truck market. However, the
hastily-designed 92s turned out to have poor fuel consumption. Sales
nose-dived and so did Allison's reputation.
The recent revival is due largely to the company's Series 60 engine, which
was the first in the industry to incorporate the sophisticated electronic
systems used in cars to improve fuel economy and cut pollution. GM deserves
much of the credit for this, since the engine was developed under its
ownership.
However, Mr Penske has continued to invest heavily in R&amp;D, which absorbs 4
per cent of net revenues and employs 11 per cent of the workforce.
Detroit is putting a great deal of effort into developing engines using
alternative fuel sources, such as natural gas, to comply with increasingly
strict US emission control standards.
It also has a partnership with Mercedes-Benz, the German vehicle and engine
manufacturer, to develop diesel engines and components.
Daimler-Benz, Mercedes' parent, is demonstrating its faith in Detroit by
using the flotation to take a 13 per cent stake in the business, through
debenture conversions and stock purchases. It also has the right to take its
stake up to 20 per cent through additional share-buying over the next 12
months. The offering will cut Mr Penske's stake to around 52 per cent and
GM's to 13 per cent.
Mr Penske's greatest contributions to the business have almost certainly
been his motivation of the management and workforce - which remains
essentially the same as in the GM days - and his flair for marketing the
company's new products to an initially-sceptical truck industry.
He keeps in close contact with the workforce and has good relations with
union leaders. At the same time, however, he has managed to cut costs and
crack down on absenteeism.
He makes rapid decisions - using lessons picked up in the racing pits during
quick-fire vehicle repairs - in stark contrast to GM's cumbersome
bureaucracy. And while GM has failed to keep in close touch with car buyers,
Mr Penske is an apostle of customer satisfaction and a relentless salesman,
drawing unashamedly on the glamorous image of his racing team.
Yet despite the turnround, Detroit Diesel cannot afford complacency. For one
thing, it has to improve its profitability to get a better return on sales.
The slowly improving US economy, boosting demand for engines, could help
here.
And it still faces extremely strong competition from its two chief North
American rivals, Caterpillar and Cummins Engine. Both have been introducing
technologically-advanced new engine models. Mr Penske may have rescued
Detroit from a permanent pit stop, but his race is far from over.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Murdoch agrees to resume role at
NY Post
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rupert Murdoch has agreed to resume publishing the New York Post
following a decision by leaders of the newspaper's production unions to
break a four-day strike by journalists. However, it was not clear last night
if the paper would be on news-stands this morning.
Earlier this week, Mr Murdoch said he was walking away from his agreement to
manage the bankrupt tabloid after members of the Newspaper Guild,
representing journalists and advertising staff, walked out, and drivers and
printers refused to cross the guild's picket line.
The guild is fighting Mr Murdoch's demands to slash severance pay and to
have the right to dismiss any employee, regardless of seniority, within a
four-month period.
However after leaders of the paper's eight craft unions, including printers
and drivers, said on Wednesday their members would return to work, Mr
Murdoch extended his management contract by one week. He is expected to
complete his Dollars 25m purchase of the paper within a week, assuming no
further stoppages.
The support of the journalists by other union members was a surprise. Mr
Murdoch had struck agreements with all of The Post's other unions in July.
At the time, guild members agreed to return to work while negotiations
continued.
Mr Colin Miner, a reporter at The Post said: 'It was a miracle that the
drivers didn't cross on Monday. It's unlikely to happen again.'

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mercedes boon for Alabama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   TUSCALOOSA, ALABAMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ yesterday confirmed Alabama as the winner of a fierce contest
between more than 30 US states to be the site of the company's first
passenger vehicle plant outside Germany.
The Dollars 300m facility, which will produce a range of four-wheel drive
sports/utility vehicles, is to be in the town of Vance (population 250), 12
miles east of Tuscaloosa, home of the University of Alabama, and 32 miles
south of Birmingham, the state's largest city.
The decision is a great economic and psychological fillip for Alabama, which
has trailed other south-eastern states in attracting new investment,
particularly from abroad.
Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, the car and commercial
vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial
corporation, said the company had decided on Tuscaloosa after investigating
170 US sites.
'Tuscaloosa provides the best combination of those factors we are seeking: a
quality workforce, a strong transportation network, a university
environment, business vitality and a favourable quality of life,' he said.
Alabama is paying a high price to attract Mercedes-Benz. It is providing
economic incentives worth Dollars 112m and is committed to spending a
further Dollars 140m on infrastructure and education.
Mercedes-Benz stressed that other states on its short list - North Carolina
and South Carolina - had offered similar packages and that incentives had
not been the decisive factor in selection.
Mr Billy Joe Camp, the Alabama official who headed the drive to attract
Mercedes-Benz, said a cost/benefit analysis suggested that the plant would
help create 15,000 jobs in the state over the next 20 years, and bring
Dollars 7bn in economic benefits.
Mercedes-Benz announced last April its decision in principle to build a
volume sports/utility vehicle - a new market segment for the company - in
the US.
The Tuscaloosa plant, to employ 1,500 people, will begin manufacturing at
the start of 1997, and will make 60,000 vehicles a year, as much as half of
these for export markets.
Mercedes-Benz said more than 60 per cent of the components would be
purchased in the US, including the transmission from Borg-Warner. Engines
would be supplied from Germany.
Mercedes-Benz revealed yesterday the sports/utility business, including
worldwide sales, would be managed from Tuscaloosa.

CANADIAN Tire, a 425-store hardware, sports and leisure goods and car parks
chain, is improving margins and planning further expansion, says president
Mr Stephen Bachand, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The icon of Canadian retailing for 25 years, Canadian Tire took some heavy
blows from internal fighting for control and the recent long recession.
Mr Bachand, an American who has turned around a similar operation in the US,
told Toronto analysts sales were up nearly 9 per cent in the first eight
months of this year. He said the company was reaping benefits from gains in
distribution efficiency and improved accounting systems at the store level.
He is developing larger stores to compete with warehouse chains, after two
pilot operations exceeded forecast results. However, the US subsidiary will
not be expanded until it reaches profitability.
He expects 1994 group earnings to be slightly better than 1992's CDollars
72.3m (USDollars 54.8m), or 80 cents a share.

CHEMICAL Waste Manage-ment, the Illinois-based handler of hazardous waste,
is to reduce its workforce by more than one-fifth. It also plans to take
substantial asset write-downs, and restructure operations to slash costs,
after a disappointing year.
The measures will result in a Dollars 363m charge to earnings in the third
quarter, the equivalent of Dollars 1.74 per share. WMX Technologies, the
international rubbish hauler which owns 79 per cent of Chemical Waste, said
the charge would reduce its third-quarter net income by Dollars 285.3m, or
59 cents a share.
Analysts said the write-downs and cost-savings were larger than expected,
and should provide short-term benefits to financial performance. However,
with serious overcapacity in the waste-handling business in the US, 'their
biggest challenge remains the need to generate revenue growth', said Mr Jim
McDonald, analyst for Chicago Corporation.
Chemical Waste said it intended to reduce its 5,000-strong payroll by 1,200
before the end of 1994. It hoped some of these job losses would come through
the sale of some units.
Most of the asset write-downs involve hazardous waste incinerators. The
company has completely written off its troubled waste-burning plant in
southern Chicago, and is to seek joint venture partners for an incinerator
unit at Port Arthur, Texas.
It said its would also consolidate its treatment and disposal operations
throughout North America, and sell selected operations. Further savings are
planned by switching the transport of some waste from its own trucking
operations to road contractors and rail.
Mr Pat Payne, president, said the group was depending on its international
engineering, construction and consulting arm, Rust International, for
growth. Rust is expected to contribute Dollars 1.6bn in revenues this year.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Price reductions help Benetton
gain 6.3%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BENETTON, Italy's biggest producer of casual clothing, saw a 6.3 per cent
rise in net first-half profits to L98.6bn (Dollars 62.4m), in spite of the
slowdown in many leading clothing markets.
Sales climbed by 10.4 per cent to L1,362bn. Benetton's turnover was lifted
partly by the lower value of the lira, which inflated non-Italian sales. But
the company has also benefited from cutting its prices in many markets.
Sales growth was particularly strong outside Europe, with a 35 per cent leap
in turnover. Sales in North and South America and Japan rose by 20 per cent,
compared with an 8 per cent rise in Europe.
The company has appointed Mr Carl Hahn, the former managing director of
Volkswagen, to the board. Benetton said the choice 'expressed the company's
desire to find ever greater synergies with leading representatives of the
culture of international industry'.
Benetton attributed its profits rise to its policy of price cuts and
improved quality control. The group said the effects of the pricing policy,
started earlier this year, would show through fully in 1994.
The impact on its 012 line of children's clothing had been particularly
marked, with a 20 per cent improvement in the volume of orders for the
spring-summer 1994 collection, due in the shops early next year. Gross
operating profits rose by 20.2 per cent to L553.2bn from L460.3bn, helped by
lower operating costs.
The decision to buy control of some local suppliers contained operating
costs but helped to push up net indebtedness to L536bn from L326bn last
December.
Debt charges rose by L6.5bn to L23.3bn, compared with L16.7bn in June 1992.

L214bn

ALITALIA, Italy's state airline, which has some of its shares listed on the
stock exchange, followed the trend in the European aviation industry with a
L214bn (Dollars 135m) loss for the first six months of the year.
The results put paid to hopes of breaking even in 1993 and reverse a trend
of progressively lower losses in the past two years. In the first half of
last year, the group lost L39bn.
The airline blamed the recession, which had reduced demand and triggered
pressure on ticket prices. To counter the downturn, it planned capacity cuts
(especially on domestic routes), efficiency improvements and would compete
'aggressively' to counteract the effects of fare wars.
Sales rose by 7.3 per cent to L2,735bn, while the number of passengers
carried climbed by 2.9 per cent, in spite of a 9 per cent fall in domestic
traffic. Load factors were 62.3 per cent for passenger traffic and 67.6 per
cent for freight.
Alitalia's loss, which some analysts expect to total about L300bn by the end
of the year, came in spite of extraordinary earnings of L112bn from asset
sales. The company raised L92bn from similar sales in the same period last
year.
The results were partly affected by Alitalia's ambitious investment
programme, which included L104bn for last December's purchase of 30 per cent
of Malev, the Hungarian state airline. Spending on new aircraft amounted to
L439bn in the first half.
Fincantieri, the Italian state-owned shipbuilding group, reversed a
long-running string of losses to report a net L3.7bn profit for the first
half.
The company said it expected to stay in profit in the second half thanks to
a strong order book, lower costs and improved productivity.

CREDIT Commercial de France (CCF), one of France's leading retail banking
groups, increased net profits by 10.7 per cent to FFr541m (Dollars 95.4m) in
the first half of this year, in spite of the sluggish state of the French
banking sector.
Mr Charles de Croisset, who took over as chairman of CCF earlier this year
following the appointment of Mr Michel Pebereau as head of the Banque
Nationale de Paris banking group, said that one of the main reasons for the
growth in CCF's profits had been its efforts to 'strengthen cost control' to
offset the effects of the difficult trading climate.
Although other French banks, notably the loss-making Credit Lyonnais, have
come under intense pressure in the past year, CCF has remained robust
because of its niche position as a value-added retail bank and its
relatively low exposure to the weaker areas of the economy, such as small
businesses.
Net banking income rose by 17.6 per cent to FFr4.62bn.
Operating profits rose by 54.9 per cent to FFr1.81bn.
However, CCF was forced to raise its provisions by 49.5 per cent to FFr945m.
Mr de Croisset attributed the increase to 'the difficult economic
environment and the impact of a deterioration in the property market.'
CCF, like other French banks, has also had to take account of the extra
costs it may incur as a result of the general reforms of pensions for
employees in the banking industry.
The group set aside FFr800m in the first half of the year to cover this.

PARIBAS, the French banking group, yesterday announced that net profits
stabilised at FFr1.12bn (Dollars 193m) in the first half of this year
because of the recession in France.
The news of static profits comes at a time when the group - the leading
force in French investment banking - is recovering from 1991, when it made a
loss for the first time.
Paribas, which includes the Credit du Nord retail banking network, came back
into the black last year, but its recovery was checked in the first half of
this year.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, said yesterday that the group's market trading
activities had fared well during the first half, but its banking interests
had been affected by the depressed state of the European market, which had
triggered a steep increase in provisions.
Net banking income rose by 32.9 per cent to FFr16.5bn in the first six
months this year from FFr12.42bn in the corresponding period last year.
This was helped by a strong performance from the Banque Paribas investment
bank in its trading activities, and from the Compagnie Bancaire specialist
finance business.
However, the group suffered a sharp decline of 78.8 per cent in additional
income to FFr745m from FFr3.52bn.
This was mainly due to a reduction in proceeds from share sales and a poor
performance from some of its associate companies, including Ciments
Francais, the loss-making cement group.
Gross operating profits increased by 11.3 per cent to FFr7.8bn, from
FFr7.01bn.
The group was forced to raise provisions by 34 per cent to FFr3.55bn from
FFr4.75bn because of its difficulties in the banking market and the French
property sector.
Paribas wrote down part of Banque Paribas' exposure on loans to developing
countries, an issue that has recently affected other French banks, including
Banque Nationale de Paris.

STENA Line, the world's biggest ferry operator, yesterday announced higher
profits for the first eight months as a stronger performance from its UK
operations helped to offset the impact of weaker results in Scandinavia.
Profits after financial items were SKr271m (Dollars 34.3m), SKr16m higher
than in the same period in 1992.
The group predicts full-year profits of SKr250m, up from SKr212m in 1992.
Results in the final four months are weak because of seasonal factors.
Turnover was up 16 per cent to SKr6.23bn, due to currency factors and volume
growth. Passenger numbers rose 2 per cent to 10.3m, while freight volumes
increased 5 per cent to 542,000 units.
A combination of UK economic recovery, rationalisation and lower financing
costs has brought a turnround within Stena Sealink, the company's UK unit.
The group's international operations, which are based round Stena Sealink,
saw passenger numbers rise 11 per cent to 6.5m and freight traffic increase
10 per cent.
The group's Scandinavian activities are profitable, but their performance
has worsened. Passenger numbers fell 11 per cent to 3.8m in the first eight
months, with freight volumes down 5 per cent.
The group has introduced a rationalisation programme to shed 700 jobs and
save SKr200m a year. It took an eight-month charge of SKr55m for redundancy
costs, and it has allowed for a further SKr25m charge in the final four
months when making its full-year forecast.

SAGA Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, yesterday
announced a 10 per cent increase in 1993 eight-month interim net profits to
NKr296m (Dollars 40.5m) from NKr269m in the same period last year. It was
helped by increased petroleum production, higher oil prices and lower
exploration costs.
The result was marred by an unrealised currency loss of NKr282m on long-term
dollar denominated debt.
Revenue in the period rose to NKr4.02bn from NKr3.350bn as operating costs
increased to NKr2.79bn from NKr2.51bn. Operating profit rose to NKr1.23bn
from NKr843.
Production of oil, gas and condensate rose to 3.5m tonnes of oil equivalent,
of which oil accounted for 90.1 per cent.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Carlzon ally steps down from SAS
executive post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SECOND senior executive at Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) is to step
down from his post following the surprise resignation on Monday of Mr Jan
Carlzon as president and chief executive, it emerged yesterday.
The departure of Mr Steffen Harpoeth, the deputy president and close ally of
Mr Carlzon, is one of the management changes that were expected in the wake
of the announcement that Mr Carlzon was quitting day-to-day leadership of
the airline to concentrate on negotiations over Alcazar, a four-way alliance
with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines.
Mr Harpoeth's responsibilities were corporate control and finance. He has
not been involved directly in the Alcazar negotiations and it is understood
he will not be involved.
His departure is likely to strengthen allegations, widely aired in the
Scandinavian media, that Mr Carlzon was pushed out as head of SAS, which is
jointly owned by Sweden, Denmark and Norway, because of concerns over its
recent dismal financial performance and scepticism over the viability of
Alcazar.
These allegations have been denied by SAS and blamed on longstanding
tensions between the three national camps within SAS, particularly Danish
trade union hostility towards Mr Carlzon, who is Swedish. SAS insists Mr
Carlzon's desire to devote himself full-time to the complex Alcazar project
should be taken at face value.
Mr Carlzon has acknowledged that the long-drawn out Alcazar negotiations
have diverted attention at SAS away from the task of reversing a three-year
record of losses. Officials say a far-reaching rationalisation programme
aimed at raising efficiency by 50 per cent in the five years to 1996 has
come close to a standstill after initial savings of SKr3bn (Dollars 380m)
were achieved in 1991 and 1992.
Losses in the first half of the year reached SKr609m, compared with a
full-year loss in 1992 of SKr743m.
Mr Jan Rainas, Mr Carlzon's Norwegian successor as chief executive, has said
his priority is to get the rationalisation effort back on track. This is
likely to entail a further retrenchment from the Global Travel Service
System strategy espoused by Mr Carlzon in the late 1980s.
However, Mr Rainas is due to leave SAS next April to head Norske Skog, the
Norwegian forestry group, leaving the airline without clear management
leadership should the Alcazar project collapse. SAS is therefore dangerously
exposed if Alcazar does not work, but Mr Tage Andersen, the Danish chairman
of SAS, has stressed his commitment to it.
For all the denials of divisions within SAS, there have been conflicts of
interest between the Danish and Swedish camps. Denmark wants the
headquarters of the Alcazar project to be based at Copenhagen's Kastrup
airport, while many in Sweden would like to see Mr Carlzon as the project's
leader.

FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sumitomo to write off losses at
finance unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUMITOMO Corporation, the Japanese trading house, is to write off
unspecified securities losses incurred by a financial subsidiary which had
invested Y80bn (Dollars 741m) through special trading accounts to supplement
core profits.
Many Japanese companies, including trading houses, had come to regard stock
investment as a 'new profit centre' during the late 1980s, but have since
suffered bruising losses, most often on tokkin, or specified money trusts.
Tokkin became popular during the 1980s, as capital gains could be converted
to income, prompting some companies to use the trusts for investment in
risky stocks.
However, the fall of Tokyo stock prices in 1990 meant that investors
suffered large losses.
Sumitomo said the subsidiary, SC Finance, had appraisal losses of about
Y20bn at the end of March, when the Nikkei index closed at 18,591, far below
the market peak of 38,915.87 of late December 1989.
The index closed at 20,105.71 yesterday.
The move by Sumitomo follows Mitsubishi Corporation's rescue earlier this
year of a subsidiary, MC Finance, which had accumulated losses of Y28bn on
securities investments of about Y70bn.
Mitsubishi established MC Finance to act as a banker for subsidiaries,
borrowing large sums from banks at discount rates and passing on the savings
to smaller members of the group. The company was later encouraged to
generate income through stock investment.
Sumitomo did not say what impact the write-off would have on pre-tax profit
for the first half, which ended yesterday, but the company is expected to
sell other stocks to cover the losses incurred.
In the year ended in March, Sumitomo reported an appraisal loss on
securities holdings of Y18.7bn and had a special profit of Y12.9bn on a
property sale.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBLE &amp; CO, the Edinburgh-based issuing house, yesterday released details of
its fund designed to invest in Lloyd's of London, the insurance market.
In a memorandum, it says it plans to raise Pounds 30m which will be invested
through two separate but linked (or split capital) companies from the 1994
underwriting year.
The vehicle takes advantage of proposed plans by Lloyd's to introduce
corporate capital into the market without the unlimited liability
requirement currently imposed.
Premium Underwriting will be allocated Pounds 12m and Premium Trust, a
separate company, will receive Pounds 18m. The underwriting company will
provide an interest-free loan of Pounds 11m to the trust. In exchange, the
trust will pledge Pounds 28m to Lloyd's.
This will allow Premium Underwriting to maintain an initial underwriting
capacity of Pounds 56m, which will be allocated between up to 40 syndicates.
This will be co-ordinated by Wellington Members' Agency.
Premium Trust will be managed as an investment trust by Martin Currie
Investment Management. Minimum investment will be Pounds 3,000. The fund
aims to attract about 30 per cent of the total from individuals.
S G Warburg yesterday announced proposals for New London Capital, a listed
investment company designed to provide corporate capital for Lloyd's of
London. It will be advised by a London subsidiary of Chartwell Re and its
investments managed by Mercury Asset Management.

POWER Corporation, the Irish property group whose Trocadero Centre
development in Central London went into administrative receivership in
January, has reported a pre-tax loss of IPounds 102.8m (Pounds 98m) for the
year ending March 31st 1993, after an exceptional charge of IPounds 97m.
The charge consisted of a write-off of IPounds 54.8m on the company's
Trocadero and Island Site developments in London, and a further IPounds
42.4m of write-downs in other property values.
Excluding the charge, the loss was IPounds 4.5m compared with a profit of
IPounds 9.5m in the 1991-92 financial year. Net assets have fallen from
IPounds 223m to IPPounds 24.5m.
Mr Robin Power, chairman and chief executive, said that disposals of IPounds
14.5m have been made during the year to reduce borrowings. He said: 'As the
recession lifts so will rental incomes and property values'. The company has
98 per cent of its properties leased.
The company's portfolio of properties held for resale has increased by
IPounds 43m to IPounds 85m, primarily due to reclassification of properties
from its long-term investment portfolio. The principal asset that is up for
sale is the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.
Losses per share were IPounds 88.43p, against earnings per share last year
of IPounds 9.15.

WENTWORTH International Group reported pre-tax losses increased from Pounds
4.05m to Pounds 5.4m in the year to March 31 and has proposed a refinancing
package as, in the words of Mr Robert Gill, its chief executive, the only
alternative to receivership or liquidation.
The USM-quoted plastic packaging products group is to raise Pounds 9.5m in a
7-for-2 rescue rights issue of up to 380.5m shares at 2.5p. Monceau
Investments - an arm of Banque Indosuez, which holds 61.3 per cent of
Wentworth - has irrevocably undertaken to apply for its rights in full, and
Indosuez is underwriting the balance.
If no other shareholders were to take up their rights, Monceau and Indosuez
would together hold 91.4 per cent of the enlarged share capital - above the
90 per cent ceiling allowed by the Stock Exchange regarding the suitability
of shares to be traded on the USM. Mr Gill said he wanted Wentworth to
retain its dealing facility, and he felt that Indosuez would want this too.
The Pounds 9.5m raised will be used to pay down borrowings which at March 31
stood at Pounds 19.7m, giving gearing of 200 per cent. Pro forma gearing
after the rights and on the year-end figure would be 55 per cent.
Further, the group is to convert most of its outstanding loans and
overdrafts which currently fall due within one year, to terms of between
three and 10 years. Indosuez is also making available a new working capital
facility of Pounds 2.2m.
For the rights to proceed - the 2.5p price is below the current 10p nominal
value of the existing shares - each existing ordinary share is to be
sub-divided into one new ordinary of 1p and one deferred share of 9p.
The rescue rights has been made necessary by the high level of Belgian
interest costs - Pounds 2.3m this time, against Pounds 1.85m last - and
'extremely difficult trading conditions' in the UK and especially in
Belgium, which, Mr Gill said, is where the UK was two years ago. In sterling
terms, turnover grew to Pounds 28.3m (Pounds 25.6m), but in real terms it
was flat.
Paraphane, the Belgian company which was acquired in 1990 and accounts for
about half group turnover, had 'an appalling year', said Mr Gill. Edwards,
also in Belgium, remained unsold. McGregor Rutland in the UK, with turnover
of about Pounds 5m, did well, he said.
Losses per share were 2.64p (3.89p) after a tax credit of Pounds 2.53m
(charge Pounds 181,000).

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Eleco deficit amounts to Pounds 4.8m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECO Holdings, the building products and specialist contracting group,
incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 4.82m for the 12 months to June 30.
The outcome, struck on turnover which was down from Pounds 50.3m to Pounds
47.9m, in-cluding Pounds 453,000 from acquisitions and Pounds 1.63m from
dis-continued operations, compared with losses of Pounds 6.08m last time,
restated under FRS 3.
Mr Field Walton, the chairman, pointed out that the result for the period
was adversely affected by rationalisation and reorganisation costs both in
the UK and overseas.
There was an exceptional charge for the 12 months of Pounds 1.1m for the
write-back of goodwill on the disposal of its Ecometal operation and, as
announced at the interim stage, a provision of Pounds 1.37m against costs of
discontinuing the property development activities.
Group bank borrowings fell from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 11.9m over the year
and have since dipped further to about Pounds 8.8m.
Losses per share were 15.7p (20p).

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BSM sees operating profits of Pounds 4.55m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSM GROUP, which is coming to the market later this month, yesterday
forecast operating profits for 1993 of Pounds 4.55m in its pathfinder
prospectus.
Last year operating profits were Pounds 4.11m on turnover of Pounds 21m.
The group owns the British School of Motoring, one of the largest
franchisers in the UK, with 15 per cent of the driving school market. It
operates through 134 branches spread from Aberdeen to Plymouth, and has
2,000 self-employed instructors.
Pre-tax profits are forecast at Pounds 880,000 after payment of interest on
debt arising from the Pounds 40m management buy-out of the company in 1990.
Mr Paul Massey, chief executive, said yesterday that without the interest
payments pre-tax profits would be Pounds 4.35m.
Money raised in the flotation, which is expected to give the group a market
capitalisation of between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m, will be used to repay
the debt and help to fund expansion. 'I want to leave the group ungeared on
flotation,' Mr Massey said.
The prospectus also shows that the group expects a 75 per cent tax charge
for 1993. This is a one-off cost, arising mainly from planning measures
being taken in relation to capital allowances on the tuition vehicle fleet.
From 1994 the charge should drop to about 25 per cent.
The new shares will be placed with institutions and offered through
intermediaries. Impact day is on Thursday October 14. The offer closes at
noon on October 21. Morgan Grenfell is sponsoring the flotation and James
Capel are brokers.
At the time of flotation Morgan Grenfell Development Capital Partners will
own 70 per cent of the shares and the family of Sir Anthony Jacobs, the
former owner, 20 per cent. The balance will be held by the 21-strong
management team. No directors are selling any shares.

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sherwood Group shows 5% fall to Pounds
7.76m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHERWOOD GROUP, the socks and lace manufacturer, yesterday reported its
first decline in interim profits since its flotation in 1986.
Pre-tax profits fell 5 per cent to Pounds 7.76m (Pounds 8.18m) for the first
six months of 1993.
Mr David Parker, chairman, blamed recession in continental Europe for
depressing profit margins on lace sales. Operating profit in lace fell from
Pounds 5.59m to Pounds 4.64m, while turnover rose from Pounds 37m to Pounds
39.9m.
The company is increasingly dependent on overseas sales: 48 per cent of
total turnover of Pounds 69.7m (Pounds 66m) now takes place outside the UK.
Nevertheless the interim dividend goes up to 1p (0.9p), a measure of 'the
board's confidence in the future', said Mr Parker.
Earnings per share fell from 5.3p to 4.8p, partly reflecting the issue of
shares for the Pounds 19.6m acquisition in May of Lepel, the Italian
lingerie maker.
Mr Parker said that the acquisition would be earnings enhancing over the
full year. Garment sales tend to be substantially higher in the second half
and the acquisition would further add to the skewing of sales and profits
towards the second half.
Analysts said that pre-tax profits for the full year should be about Pounds
21m, beating 1992's Pounds 16.9m.
'Wherever we can cut costs, we will,' said Mr Parker. 'But margins will
remain under pressure in the second half too.'
Some 300 jobs had been cut this year, although another 210 people were taken
on with Lepel.
The company is also concentrating on higher margin products. It is reducing
production of curtain lace to concentrate on clothing lace using Textronic
machines which create a three dimensional fabric.
Investment is falling from an 'exceptionally high figure last year' of
Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 9.5m for the full year.

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Redland cuts brick stocks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT NAPIER, chairman of Redland, one of Britain's largest producers of
building materials, said that the group reduced its UK brick stocks by 60m
in the first half. The group now had stocks equivalent to two months supply,
compared with an industry average of four months.
Overall, UK brick stocks stand at about the 1bn level, but Redland expects
demand to increase by about 6 per cent or 7 per cent next year fuelled by
the expected recovery in housebuilding.
Brick prices have fallen by between 20 per cent and 25 per cent from their
peak. However, Redland said engineering bricks were now showing slight price
increase and prices for facing bricks were strong.
Redland, like most other large brick producers, has cut its capacity
dramatically during the recession. The Redland and Steetley brick businesses
have been fully integrated and capacity has been cut by some 200m bricks.

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Fenner launches Pounds 17.4m rights -
Proposals include possible disposal of power transmission business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FENNER, the Hull-based industrial products group, yesterday announced plans
to raise about Pounds 17.4m through a 1-for-2 rights issue at 80p, and
revealed it was discussing the possible sale of its principle power
transmission components business.
The announcement marks the first significant move by the new management team
at Fenner, following the retirement of Mr Peter Barker earlier this year
after 11 years as chairman.
Mr Colin Cooke, chairman of Triplex Lloyd, was appointed non-executive
chairman in June, and Mr Julian Bigden became group managing director in
February.
Now Fenner is joining the long list of UK engineering companies to consider
severing links with its past by withdrawing from a relatively low-margin
business so that it can invest in its higher-margin products and become,
like TI Group, an international 'specialist engineering' concern.
Shares in Fenner jumped 14p to 100p as the market responded warmly to a
lengthy statement from the company detailing the proposed changes and recent
financial performance. The main points are:
Following an approach, Fenner is holding discussions with a potential
purchaser for the power transmission business. These are at a preliminary
stage, and the outcome is unlikely to be known until the end of this
calendar year. The division will report an operating loss of about Pounds
1.8m for the year ended August 31, but was trading profitably in the second
half.
A rights issue is proposed of up to 23.2m new shares at a price of 80p each.
This is underwritten by Morgan Grenfell and European Strategic Investors
Holding.
ESIH, which is advised by Arlington Capital Management, will assist in the
formulation of group strategy and subscribe for 2.18m ordinary shares at a 5
per cent premium to the average of the middle market closing prices from
yesterday until October 18. The subscription price will not be less than
86.3p and will raise a further Pounds 1.88m at least.
Operating profit (before exceptional items) was about Pounds 9.6m in the
year ended August 31, down from Pounds 11.3m. Turnover edged up from Pounds
197m to Pounds 202m and pre-tax profit dropped from Pounds 5.5m to about
Pounds 300,000.
The board has concluded that the payment of dividends is 'inappropriate at
this stage.' In the absence of unforeseen circumstances, a resumed pay-out
is expected for the current year to August 31 1994.
Mr Cooke said the power transmission business - which had sales of Pounds
71m in the year ended August and 1,200 employees - was too dependent on the
UK's shrinking engineering and manufacturing base. Attempts to increase
continental European sales had been hampered by the recession.
The Pounds 19.3m raised from the proposed rights issue and share
subscription would give Fenner the opportunity to extend its fluid power and
polymers product ranges; develop export markets and new products in the
conveyor belting division; reduce debt; take further management action in
the power transmission business, and 'assess any offer received against a
background of financial strength.'

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Atlas Conv Equip falls to Pounds 1.38m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Atlas Converting Equipment fell 147p to 533p yesterday after the
engineering equipment group reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds
2.27m to Pounds 1.38m in the first half of 1993.
Mr Christopher Rogers, chairman, said difficult trading had continued
throughout the first half. The increase in orders experienced at the time of
announcement of the 1992 results in April was not sustained.
The Far East sales office was experiencing a good level of enquiries and
there were signs that North American customers were considering further
investment although it was the beginning of the cycle. Demand in Europe for
capital equipment was low with no signs of improvement.
He added that margins remained under pressure.
Turnover was Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 20.6m). Earnings per share fell to 10.01p
(17.6p), taking account of the Pounds 11m rights issue in May. The interim
dividend is maintained at 7p.

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Increased sales behind sharp recovery at
French Connection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH CONNECTION, the clothing wholesaler and retailer 76 per cent owned by
Mr Stephen Marks, its chief executive, returned strongly to the black in the
six months to July 31.
However, the USM-traded group will not be paying an interim dividend - nor
will it pay a final at the year-end.
Mr George Wardale, chairman, said that increased turnover, especially in the
US operation, had been the key to the improved performance - pre-tax profits
were Pounds 2m, against losses of Pounds 768,000. Group turnover rose to
Pounds 30.6m (Pounds 22.5m).
'All the rubbish is now out of the way,' he said, stressing that the group
was now refocused on its French Connection and Nicole Farhi brands. Profits
this time were unaffected by exceptional charges: last time Pounds 1.01m was
subtracted from the pre-tax line.
While sales at French Connection Wholesale slipped to Pounds 5.1m (Pounds
5.3m) and sales at Nicole Farhi Wholesale rose to Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 3.1m),
margins in the UK retail side improved and sales increased by Pounds 1m to
Pounds 8m. There are now six Nicole Farhi and 21 French Connection outlets
in the UK - two more of the latter are planned before December.
Sales in the US operations, 50 per cent owned by Mr Michael Axelrod, a
director, expanded to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 5m). Mr Wardale said this rise,
as in the UK, derived from 'genuine sales - more product sold at full
price'. There are now eight French Connection outlets in the US.
Cashflow from retail sales helped cut borrowings from Pounds 5.6m at January
to Pounds 4.4m at the end of July, though Mr Wardale said that requirements
fluctuated throughout the year. Net interest payable fell to Pounds 307,000
(Pounds 661,000).
Earnings per share emerged at 4.4p (losses 6.3p) after minorities took
Pounds 431,000 (Pounds 76,000).

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Rutland Trust ahead at Pounds 3.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Rutland Trust, the financial services and property
surveying group, edged ahead from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 3.6m in the six
months to end-June.
However, earnings per share rose by 11 per cent to 0.93p (0.84p).
Mr Michael Langdon, chief executive, described the results as
'satisfactory'.
The first half in the head office/corporate finance division was
'particularly active'. Its pre-tax profits rose by 10 per cent to Pounds
704,000 (Pounds 639,000).
In addition to its normal corporate finance work, the division was closely
involved in the acquisition in August of Ben Shaws, a Yorkshire-based soft
drinks maker, for Pounds 5.7m.
Rutland believes it has the financial skills to develop the acquisition as a
separate business within the group.
Mr Langdon said that Capital Industries, in which Rutland has a 42.6 per
cent interest, had been transformed by the acquisition in September last
year of Samuel Jones, a specialist manufacturer of sticky labels.
This had led to a near-threefold rise in Capital Industries' shares, leaving
Rutland with an investment worth Pounds 20m but on the books at Pounds 7m.
He would not be drawn on when the group would take its profits.
Pre-tax profits in the asset financing division, which is involved in
vehicle contract hire, fell 40 per cent, from Pounds 892,000 to Pounds
536,000. Mr Langdon said he expected a similar result in the second half.
The division's pre-tax outcome for 1992 was Pounds 858,000.
Profits from professional services were ahead nearly 20 per cent, from
Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.4m. Ellis &amp; Buckle, the loss adjusting business which
forms the bulk of the division, maintained its profitability in a more
difficult market, Mr Langdon said. Hunter &amp; Partners, the architectural and
building surveying practice, had moved into the black, reflecting an
improved economic environment.
Group turnover rose from Pounds 46.4m to Pounds 50.5m. The interim dividend
is maintained at 0.27p.

months to June 30. Helped by an exceptional gain of Pounds 227,000 on the
realisation of an investment, pre-tax profits were Pounds 162,000, against
losses of Pounds 162,000.
Turnover advanced 13 per cent to Pounds 7.17m (Pounds 6.33m) for operating
profits of Pounds 15,000, compared with losses of Pounds 78,000.
Earnings per share for the six months jcame out at 20.2p (losses 19.2p).
The company said profit margins were under intense pressure resulting from
higher cost of raw materials because of sterling's devaluation.

After a significant reduction in the interest charge, Helical Bar, the
property group, reported a 75 per cent advance in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 1.27m to Pounds 2.22m for the half year to July 31.
Turnover fell from Pounds 15m to Pounds 10.9m. At the operating level
profits were down 35 per cent to Pounds 4.58m.
Over the past 18 months the group has made substantial sales, thereby
reducing borrowings, directors said. As a result gross rentals were lower at
Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 7m). Net interest payable fell by Pounds 3.93m to Pounds
2.62m.
Earnings per share worked through at 10.89p (5.01p) and the interim dividend
is raised from 2.4p to 2.5p. Directors are forecasting a 20 per cent
increase in the total.

<TEXT>
Storm Group, the animation, licensing and merchandising company, returned to
the black with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 102,000 for the first six months
of 1993.
That compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.13m, incurred after a Pounds 1.54m
write-off in respect of film costs.
Because of the absence of any sales of completed animation productions to
the ITV network, turnover for the first half was down from Pounds 4.05m to
Pounds 1.78m. The pre-tax figure was after interest charged of Pounds 73,000
(Pounds 6,000 received).
Earnings per share were 0.14p (1.49p losses).

Lendu Holdings, the Kent-based group which is involved in irrigated cotton
and dryland farming activities in the eastern states of Australia, achieved
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.15m for the 18 months ended June 30. Profits for
the 1991 year were Pounds 51,000.
The change in the year end was to coincide with the cropping cycle of
cotton, the company said, and the results include two crops.
In addition, there were a number of exceptional items totalling Pounds
1.07m, including a gain of Pounds 31,000 on the sale of the wool and cereal
farms in western Australia and Pounds 860,000 from the sale of Lendu Rubber
Estates.
In March, Oonavale, a 9,029-hectare property in eastern Australia, adjacent
to the Gubbagunyah property, was acquired and a total of 850 hectares were
ready to be planted for the 1993-94 season.
Turnover for the 18 months amounted to Pounds 1.95m, with Pounds 1.4m from
continuing operations, against Pounds 525,000 for 1991 with Pounds 27,000
from continuing operations. Operating profits from continuing operations
were Pounds 266,000 (Pounds 112,000 losses).
Earnings per share worked through at 8.68p (0.51p) and a dividend of 0.5p
(0.3p) is proposed.

Courtyard Leisure, the wine bar and restaurant operator, reported increased
losses of Pounds 578,000 for the year to March 31, against Pounds 288,000.
The result was struck after a provision of Pounds 195,000 against the loss
on the sale of a wine bar.
Turnover was Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 1.9m). Losses per share were 5.4p (3.1p).
Mr Ali Safa, chairman, said that trading was difficult. Turnover increased
because of the acquisition of a wine bar in the City but its performance was
hit by the bombing of the nearby Baltic Exchange.

Following its brief success in winning new orders earlier in the year, a
significant downturn in the second half left Symonds Engineering with a
pre-tax deficit of Pounds 611,000 for the year to end-March.
The outcome at this Hertfordshire-based engineer compared with a profit of
Pounds 156,000 last time and came from turnover down by Pounds 890,000 to
Pounds 4.38m. The pre-tax figure was further depressed by reorganisation
costs of Pounds 115,000.
During the past few months a strategic review of the business had been
completed. As a result of this a number of redundancies had been made and
operational changes instigated, the directors said.
Losses per share were 4.593p (1.102p earnings). There is no final dividend
proposed, leaving the total for the year at 0.15p against 1p.

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Bayer to license Celltech antibody
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAYER, the German pharmaceuticals group, has exercised an option to license
a new genetically engineered human antibody being development by Celltech
Group, the Berkshire-based biotechnology company planning to seek a UK
listing.
The move means Celltech has received Pounds 4m of milestone payments to add
to the Pounds 4m it already has from Bayer.
The Celltech antibody, CDP571, is in phase two of clinical trials in seven
European centres. It is designed to block the action of Tumour Necrosis
Factor which is produced by the body's immune system and appears to be a key
factor in the development of life threatening septic shock. This condition
leads to rapidly falling blood pressure and failure of a number of the
body's organs.
Celltech has also begun a phase two study in rheumatoid arthritis patients
whose joints can display abnormally high concentrations of TNF.
Celltech said Bayer had been encouraged by findings from studies of septic
shock patients using its own mouse antibody, now in phase three of clinical
trials.
Celltech's development of a human antibody will be one to two years behind
the mouse antibody. But if successful it should be more effective and less
prone to attack by the body's immune system.
Celltech also believes success for Bayer's septic shock antibody will
increase the chances of success for its CDP571 antibody. 'If Bayer makes it
to registration it is likely our product will do at least as well,' said Mr
Peter Fellner, chief executive. The exercising of the option confirmed the
two companies' confidence in Celltech's new antibody, he said.
Bayer's option allows it to license Celltech's anti-TNF antibody for all
clinical indications and to pursue later phase development in collaboration
with Celltech. Mr Horst Meyer, head of Bayer Pharma, was optimistic that
joint products would be successfully developed with Celltech 'in the
foreseeable future'.

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Markheath losses at Pounds 69m after
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKHEATH, the property group controlled in effect by Adelaide Steamship,
the Australian company, and its associates, incurred an increased pre-tax
loss of Pounds 68.8m for the year ended March 31, against Pounds 22.7m.
During March Markheath entered a standstill agreement with its banks, which
are continuing to provide credit facilities. Mr Michael Rendle, chairman,
said yesterday that the group was still talking with the banks about a
financial restructuring, which he hoped would take place 'as soon as
possible'.
The loss was after charging Pounds 57.9m (Pounds 15.5m) for provisions
against the carrying value of properties and a provision of Pounds 5m (nil)
against the amount owed by an associate.
Turnover was Pounds 4.17m (Pounds 4.25m). Losses per share came out at
55.29p, compared with 18.66p. There is no dividend.
Markheath, which cut its staff from 40 to 10 over the year, said its
priorities were the reduction of borrowings and overheads and the securing
of pre-lets at its main development sites in Stevenage and Brentford. These
accounted for Pounds 43.3m of the total property provisions.
Net liabilities at the end of the period totalled Pounds 12.5m or 10.2p a
share, compared with net assets of Pounds 55m or 45.1p a share at the
beginning of the year.
Net borrowings were Pounds 67m (Pounds 72.9m). Interest payable advanced to
Pounds 5.77m (Pounds 2.37m).
The shares closed unchanged at 6p.

made up of a loss in the first quarter offset by a profit in the second.
The interim dividend, which is cut to 1.33p (2.25p), is uncovered by

retirement housing schemes, is disposing of Peverel, its management company,
in a Pounds 30.7m management buy-out.
The company, which incurred a pre-tax loss of nearly Pounds 20m in the year
to August 31 1992, will be using the proceeds to reduce its Pounds 50m bank
borrowings by Pounds 20m and to fund new development.
Peverel manages about 17,000 retirement flats and houses in more than 400
private developments, mostly built by McCarthy. It will retain the McCarthy
man-agement contracts and its freehold and leasehold interests.
The buy-out, led by Mr Nigel Bannister, Peverel's managing director, is
mostly equity-financed by Electra, the in-vestment institution, with some
debt financing from Bank of Scotland and 5 per cent from the management
team.
Peverel made a Pounds 3.7m pre-tax profit in the year to August 1992 and had
a net asset value of Pounds 5.1m.
McCarthy's sales have dropped from 2,600 units a year before the recession
to about 1,000, although Mr John McCarthy, chairman, said yesterday it was
now seeing an improvement.
'It is the right time to reinvest in land and in our core business and to
realise a non-performing asset - the freeholds and leaseholds,' he said. The
disposal of Peverel would also end, he said, what some saw as a conflict
between the roles of developer and manager.
Peverel was originally an estate agency acquired by McCarthy in 1982, the
year that the parent company was floated on the stock market. It is
retaining its existing management team and staff and will be seeking to
expand by winning other management contracts.

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Betacom back in black with Pounds 0.5m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BETACOM, the telephone equipment supplier which is now 66 per cent owned by
Amstrad, the consumer electronics group, reported a return to profit in the
year to June 30.
The company, which has reorganised its operations and capital structure in
the past year, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 500,000 in the 12 months
to June 30 compared with a Pounds 3.9m loss in the six months to June 30
1992. Last year the company changed its year end from December 31 to June
30.
Turnover from continuing operations was Pounds 12.1m for the year, compared
with Pounds 4.25m in the preceding six months, and the group reported a
small Pounds 57,000 operating profit compared with a Pounds 3.52m loss.
Profits were further boosted in the full year by a Pounds 213,000 profit on
the sale of joint venture investments in Germany and the Netherlands, and
Pounds 246,000 in net interest receivable.
Earnings per share of 0.83p compared with losses of 12.38p in the 1992 six
month period. There is no dividend.
Mr Ken Ashcroft, Amstrad's former corporate finance director who was
appointed Betacom's chairman in July last year, said the year had been 'one
of consolidation' during which the group eliminated its peripheral business
to concentrate all its resources 'on improving our core business in consumer
telephones and communications products in the UK.'
In the UK Mr Ashcroft said Betacom 'disposed of significant quantities of
slow moving products resulting in a much better mix of inventory at the year
end,' and will be releasing a number of new products this autumn.
The group, which has also restructured its banking facilities, ended the
year with net cash of Pounds 3.2m compared with an overdraft of Pounds 2.6m
a year earlier.

director of Tilney. It has more than 35,000 clients, 250 staff in nine
offices and Pounds 3.8bn under management.
A 90.1 per cent stake in Charterhouse Tilney is being sold to Credit

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Manchester City leaps 68%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Swales, who is currently embroiled in an increasingly acrimonious
battle for control of Manchester City, said yesterday that no formal
proposals had been received regarding an offer for the Premier league club.
Mr Swales, chairman of the club, had earlier claimed that other unnamed
buyers were keen to acquire the club in opposition to the consortium set up
by Mr Francis Lee, a former player.
The statement accompanied the club's results for the 12 months to May 31
which showed pre-tax profits ahead 68 per cent from Pounds 632,000 to Pounds
1.06m. Turnover increased from Pounds 8.97m to Pounds 10.1m.
The outcome was struck after net expenditure on players of Pounds 1.2m
(Pounds 200,000). Net assets amounted to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 2.8m) although
the figure takes no account of any valuation of the players or the full
value of the stadium.
The shares are dealt under Rule 535.2.

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: FT-SE decision on enhanced scrips
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following notice was issued by the FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee
yesterday
The committee met to consider the treatment of enhanced scrip dividends in
the FT-SE Indices.
The Committee has decided to consult more widely on the preferred method of
treating enhanced scrip dividends and the timing of any change prior to
taking a decision. No retrospective changes to the treatment of enhanced
scrip dividends are planned.
A working party of practitioners, set up in June, has recommended that
enhanced scrip dividends should be treated in the indices as a capital gain
rather than as income. The UK Indices Committee recognises that such a
change may have accounting implications for institutional investors and fund
managers as well as affecting the pricing of futures and options contracts.
Notes
An enhanced scrip dividend (ESD) is an issue of shares instead of the cash
dividend at the option of the shareholder. The share alternatives being
offered have been worth significantly more than the cash dividend which has
resulted in the vast majority of shareholders opting to take the share
alternatives.
The existing practice largely ignores ESDs treating them as normal cash
dividends and making subsequent capitalisation adjustments for the scrip
issue after the take up and listing of the new stock which normally occurs
on the pay date.
The working party has proposed that in all cases where the share alternative
is worth more than the dividend, the enhanced scrip dividend should be
treated as a capitalisation change and implemented on the xd date assuming a
100 per cent take up of the scrip. The terms of the capitalisation change
should be calculated using the published amount of the enhanced scrip
dividend and shares-in-issue immediately prior to the xd date. An adjustment
for any stock not taken up will be made on the pay date. The xd adjustment
should be zero as it assumes a 100 per cent take up of the scrip.

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Trinity Holdings shows 38% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAPIDLY expanding exports helped Trinity Holdings, the maker of Dennis and
other specialist vehicles which came to the market a year ago, lift interim
pre-tax profits by 38 per cent from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 4.7m.
The figure, achieved on sales 27 per cent higher at Pounds 62.7m, maintains
an improving trend first set in train by a management buy-out led by current
chairman and chief executive Mr Geoff Hollyhead in 1989. Earnings per share
were 12.4p, against 10.8p last time.
Mr Hollyhead, reporting first-half export sales 71 per cent higher at Pounds
26.3m, yes-terday held out the prospect of further increased sales in the
second half as a Pounds 38m contract for its Duple (Metsec) subsidiary to
supply 2,500 bus bodies to Sri Lanka gains momentum.
Yesterday's declaration of a first post-flotation interim dividend of 2p,
against nil last year, also comes just a few days after the return of senior
Trinity executives from Malaysia, where they signed agreements for a
bus-making joint venture during Mr John Major's trade-boosting visit to the
Asian state.
The venture is with UMW, a Malaysian industrial group which has an annual
turnover of some Pounds 500m and produces a variety of road, rail and heavy
equipment vehicles.
Mr Hollyhead said yesterday it would result in exports of about 100
UK-supplied bus kits next year, with a poten-tial of about 1,000 units a
year towards the end of the decade.
Initially the buses will be assembled from kits produced by Trinity's UK
operating companies - chassis manufacturer Dennis Specialist Vehicles, and
Duple (Metsec), which makes bus bodies.
However, local component content will be increased over the next few years
as Malaysia's emerging motor components industry establishes itself more
firmly.
In this year's first half Trinity's operating companies produced 1,533
bodies and chassis, compared with 1,229 in the same period last year. This
was in spite of continuing depressed conditions in the UK bus and specialist
vehicle market.
The number of employees rose by 14 per cent in the first half, to about
1,300. By the end of this year another 10 per cent rise is expected to cope
with lengthening order books. Mr Hollyhead said the current Pounds 75m is
double that of the year-ago period.
A Pounds 1.57m tax bill (Pounds 1.19m) left net profit at Pounds 3.18m,
compared with Pounds 2.23m last year.
Trinity envisages using the Malaysian operation as a manufacturing base to
seek wider markets in the Asia Pacific region.
It is taking a maximum-allowed 35 per cent equity stake in the venture,
which is being capitalised initially at Pounds 20m, half in equity with the
remainder in loans.
Trinity is based at Warwick and has plants at Worcester, Halifax, Tipton and
Guildford.

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Tomorrows Leisure in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROWS LEISURE, the USM-quoted hotels and leisure company based in
Newcastle upon Tyne, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.8m for the year to
March 31 compared with restated profits of Pounds 775,000.
Turnover rose to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 7.5m).
The group also announced that a revaluation of many of its main assets had
resulted in the value of Pleasure Island, its indoor leisure park in
Liverpool, dropping from Pounds 24.5m to Pounds 7m. Overall, group net
assets have fallen from Pounds 30.4m to Pounds 4.8m.
The pre-tax loss includes Pounds 3.1m in asset value write-downs, as well as
Pleasure Island's start up and initial trading losses.
The group said a policy of writing-off all revenue expenditure on the
opening of new developments in the year it was incurred had added to losses.
Last year's results have been similarly restated.
Losses per share were 45.5p (6.9p earnings) and no final dividend (1.375p)
is proposed.
The company is negotiating with Barclays, its bankers, to secure their
continuing support. Mr John Sanderson, chairman and founder, said the Pounds
375,000 loan he made to Tomorrows Leisure this summer, to secure Barclays'
continuing support, indicated his confidence in the company. Debt stands at
about Pounds 15m.
The current year, he said, would be one of consolidation and
rationalisation, with disposal of non-core businesses.

<TEXT>
HUNTLEIGH Technology, the maker of medical control systems, increased first
half profits by 29 per cent on a 25 per cent rise in sales.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 2.35m to
Pounds 3.03m on turnover higher at Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 13m).
Earnings per share rose 31 per cent to 7.45p (5.67p). The directors are
recommending a 50 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 2p (1.33p).
The UK side expanded to account for about 23 per cent of group sales, up
from 18 per cent for the same period last year, following an expansion of
the range of equipment now available through its 12 rental centres.
Three years ago the UK accounted for only 10 per cent of sales.
Mr Rolf Schild, chairman, said the recently announced healthcare reforms in
the US were likely to lead to wider coverage of the population and should
benefit the US subsidiaries.
The group had net cash of Pounds 2.2m before the Pounds 2m cost of
purchasing a new warehouse and office building in Luton.

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: GrandMet in Pounds 84m bid for Scottish
distillery - Move with Robertson &amp; Baxter ends active week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND Metropolitan ended a week of hyperactivity yesterday by combining with
Robertson &amp; Baxter, one of Scotland's largest private companies, in a
recommended offer for North British Distillery which values the
Edinburgh-based grain whisky distiller at Pounds 84m.
GrandMet's move follows the appointment of Mr George Bull as chief
executive, the restructuring of its North American food and eyecare
businesses, the sale of its Chef &amp; Brewer pubs, and the acquisition of Glen
Ellen wines in the US, all within the last seven days.
The offer is being made through Lothian Distillers, a new company jointly
owned by IDV, GrandMet's drinks division, and R&amp;B.
The partners already hold 38 per cent of North British and together buy 60
per cent of its output. Its grain whisky is used in blending IDV's J&amp;B
brand, and for Famous Grouse and Cutty Sark, which R&amp;B blends respectively
for Highland Distilleries, one of its shareholders, and Berry Bros &amp; Rudd.
Mr James Bruxner, chairman of J&amp;B, said yesterday: 'This joint venture is
the best means of safeguarding the long term viability of North British in a
highly competitive market.'
The move would ensure continuity of supply for the partners' brands and
enable North British to develop as a supplier to the rest of the Scotch
whisky industry, he said.
North British, established last century by a consortium of wholesale whisky
merchants, has 600 shareholders. They are being offered Pounds 9 cash for
each share, including a special dividend of Pounds 3, or Pounds 6 in 7 per
cent loan notes plus the dividend.
The company, which accounts for about 12.5 per cent of the industry's
capacity, last year made profits of Pounds 9.8m on sales of Pounds 31.3m.
Grain whisky prices have been under pressure because of surplus stocks in
the industry and production generally has been cut back. Guinness closed the
smallest of its three grain distilleries, at Cambus, earlier this year.

FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Bass says tax change would cost it Pounds
6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN PROSSER, chairman and chief executive of Bass, said yesterday that
the change to end-product taxation of beer would reduce profits by Pounds 6m
this year and Pounds 18m in 1994.
The impact of the tax changes, already the subject of bitter dispute between
brewers and Customs &amp; Excise, was disclosed to City analysts in
Burton-on-Trent yesterday.
Mr Prosser reported that trading during the past four months had confirmed a
slow recovery in sales that would bring only limited benefits in the second
half of the year.
'In the near term, I see price-driven revenue growth in UK brewing hard to
come by in a low inflationary environment, particularly while excess
capacity persists.'
Bass Brewers had increased volumes by 0.5 per cent in a market estimated to
have fallen 2 per cent. Strong growth was achieved in the free trade, with
volumes ahead 5.3 per cent while deliveries to the take-home trade increased
3.5 per cent. An extra Pounds 83m net had been invested in free trade loans.
A slight improvement in bad debts would result in a second half charge lower
than the first half provision of Pounds 19m.
Bass pubs' revenue was 1.1 per cent lower but the introduction of catering
into 1,000 managed houses had raised food sales by 12.3 per cent.
Britvic's profits, hit by bad summer weather and strong competition, would
be about 20 per cent lower.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Forte disappoints with Pounds 37m halfway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the hotels and restaurants group, yesterday announced interim pre-tax
profits at the bottom end of expectations and said conditions remained
depressed in both the UK and continental Europe.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 37m for the six months to July 31 compared with a
restated Pounds 19m. But most analysts had been looking for recovery in its
hotels business to show through more strongly.
Forte also disappointed some in the City who had been hoping for an
announcement on the sale of the Harvester restaurant chain.
The share price fell 10p to 227p.
Sales were down to Pounds 1.1bn from Pounds 1.36bn. The previous figure,
however, included Pounds 416m from the Gardner Merchant contract catering
business, sold at the end of 1992.
London hotels provided one bright spot, with sales up 9 per cent and profits
up 28 per cent. Visitor numbers from mainland Europe fell, but Mr Rocco
Forte, chairman, said there had been a 20 per cent increase in US visitors.
Provincial UK hotels raised profits on static sales as a result of cost
savings. Continental European hotels deteriorated, however, as recession
took hold.
In the US, the Travelodge chain saw occupancy rise by 2 per cent and room
rates by 3 per cent. This was offset by a poor performance from luxury
hotels in New York.
Worldwide hotel profits were up 8 per cent to Pounds 43m on sales up 7 per
cent to Pounds 456m.
The Relais autoroute restaurant chain in France, acquired last December, was
another strong performer. Forte said sales had increased 6 per cent, despite
the impact of recession. Mr Forte said the group had improved Relais'
performance by adding sales points during peak summer periods.
In the UK, higher profits from the Welcome Break, Happy Eater and Little
Chef roadside chains came despite a 4 per cent fall in total UK motor
traffic in the first quarter of 1993 and a 3 per cent fall in the second
quarter. This was offset by the poor performance of city centre restaurants.
With net debt at Pounds 1.3bn, Forte's gearing rose to 50 per cent compared
with 44 per cent a year ago. Borrowings have been restructured, however, so
that 48 per cent is now repayable within five years, compared with 83 per
cent last January.
The interim dividend was maintained at 2.75p, just covered by earnings per
share of 2.8p, compared with 1p.

FT  01 OCT 93 / The West rings the changes in eastern Europe: Growing
investment to upgrade telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS, NICHOLAS DENTON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western Europe has an average of 43 telephone lines per 100 people. In
eastern Europe, only the Baltic states and Bulgaria have more than 20, while
most of the region has between 10 and 15.
Therein lies the opportunity for western telecoms companies. But it also
explains their caution about investing, for the region's poor
telecommunications are a reflection as much as a cause of its fragile
economies.
'Companies don't want to get left out, but are unprepared to take large
risks,' says Mr Ross Parsons, east European telecoms analyst with the
consultancy CIT Publications. 'However, in eastern Europe significant
investments come cheap by western standards.'
The contrast is stark. Siemens is estimated to have invested Dollars 110m
(Pounds 73m) in Hungary. Last month it made its biggest east European
investment this year: 80 per cent stakes in two Polish telecoms companies,
ZWUT in Warsaw and Elwrow in Wroclaw, for Dollars 38.5m, with a promise to
invest Dollars 57m over the next six years. Earlier this year Siemens was
rumoured to have offered GEC, the UK supplier, Dollars 1.2bn for 60 per cent
of GPT, its telecommunications division.
It is the same story with privatisation. Hungary is set to be the first east
European country to privatise its main network operator (Matav). Based on
its line coverage, one valuation puts a price of Dollars 3.3bn on Matav - of
which a third will be offered to a strategic partner later this year. By
1997 Deutsche Telekom will have spent about DM70bn (Pounds 28bn) in eastern
Germany.
Privatisation is likely to be the most effective way of attracting
large-scale foreign investment. It can be done in discrete segments. Last
year the Ukrainian government established a consortium of its national
operator (with 51 per cent), AT&amp;T, Deutsche Telekom and the Netherlands PTT
(with 49 per cent between them) to install an international gateway in Kiev
and construct an inter-regional long distance network.
The company, Utel, was originally responsible for a long distance service
covering 13 regions; this has since been extended to cover the country's 12
other regions. Utel has an exclusive 15-year licence for international and
trunk traffic.
In terms of investment, Hungary has taken the lead in telecoms
modernisation, and foreign involvement has been commensurately extensive.
Since 1989 Matav has installed digital exchanges and in 1990 chose LM
Ericsson and Siemens as exclusive suppliers over five years. Equipment
orders have not been as closely tied to investment commitments as in Poland,
and Ericsson's main local interest remains a 55 per cent stake in a small
joint venture with Muszertechnika, a Hungarian private company.
The other important arena for western players has been mobile
communications. This summer Hungary raised nearly Dollars 100m in concession
fees for two new digital networks. One will be built by US West and Matav;
the other by a consortium of telecoms companies from the Netherlands,
Denmark, Sweden and Finland. The two groups are expected to invest up to
Dollars 200m each in network development over 10 years.
Hungary has already attracted about Dollars 5.6bn in foreign investment
since 1988. Mr Gyorgy Schamschula, Hungary's telecoms minister, believes the
privatisation of Matav offers the chance to attract 'as much foreign capital
again as has come to Hungary so far'.
Deutsche Telekom has formed a powerful consortium with Cable &amp; Wireless of
the UK and Ameritech of the US to bid for Matav. Industry speculation on
rival groups centres on France Telecom, US West and NTT. Southwestern Bell
and Stet, the Italian state operator, are also thought to have bought
information memoranda.
By contrast, in Poland ideas for selling a 20 per cent stake in the state
operator will probably be shelved by the incoming centre-left government.
The state also has strict conditions on foreign investment - for instance,
companies are obliged to produce in Poland half of the equipment they
install.
In Poland, the future belongs to Alcatel, which is installing systems in
Krakow and Piotrkow; Siemens, which is installing DM72m worth of local and
international switches in Silesia; and AT&amp;T which is building networks in
Gdansk, Szczeczin, Wloclawek, Siedlce and Plock and laying 1,500km of fibre
optic cable worth Dollars 30m.
Funding has come from credits arranged by suppliers, the World Bank, the
European Investment Bank and most recently the EBRD for the Dollars 150m
Gdansk project. Telekomunikacja Polska (TP SA), the state telecoms operator,
is highly profitable and plans to cover one-third of investment outlays from
its own funds.
Although privatisation of TP SA seems to be off the agenda, local networks
can be operated by anyone, local or foreign, without restriction. About 50
local operating licences have been issued, though only two local companies
have started to install lines. The main problems are lack of finance and
obstructions from TP SA, which is jealous of its monopoly. However, one
local project - in Pila to install 100,000 lines at a cost of Dollars 80m -
appears to be going ahead with backing from the International Finance
Corporation. Sprint, the US long-distance operator, will be the managing
company.
There is also overseas involvement in Poland's cellular sector. Centertel, a
network owned by Ameritech, France Telekom and TP SA has invested Dollars
135m and has 10,000 subscribers.
The rest of eastern Europe is a similar patchwork of discrete, small-scale
operations and joint ventures by western companies. But if the Hungarian
privatisation is seen to be a success, the region could move sharply up the
telecoms investment league.

FT  01 OCT 93 / NBC makes push into Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NBC, the US network broad-caster, is making its biggest push into the
European market with the purchase of a majority stake in Super Channel, the
satellite company available in nearly 60m homes across Europe, mainly
through cable networks.
NBC was last night believed to be signing a Pounds 40m deal to buy 75 per
cent of the channel. The target is controlled by the Marcucci family, which
has broadcasting and industrial interests in Italy.
The US company is likely to continue the general entertainment thrust of the
channel in the immediate future while increasing the amount of business and
financial news.
Earlier this year CNBC, the NBC cable channel in the US that specialises in
business news, said it planned to expand in Europe and eastern Asia.
Mrs Marialina Marcucci, the Super Channel managing director, bought the
channel in 1988 for Pounds 9 and paid Pounds 2.5m to creditors. The channel,
set up in 1987 by a consortium of UK independent television companies plus
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group was at one stage losing Pounds 1.5m a
month. The Marcuccis have invested Pounds 25m in building the channel's
network across west and eastern Europe.
Credit Lyonnais will hold a 25 per cent stake in the channel, although the
Marcucci family is likely to retain an interest in that stake and Mrs
Marcucci is expected to remain on the Super Channel board.
It is believed the Marcucci family decided a leading company such as NBC was
needed to take the channel to its next stage of development. Mrs Marcucci
intends to set up a television programme production business in London and
is already in talks to acquire a medium-sized independent production company
specialising in factual programming.
Super Channel found it difficult to compete with large broadcasters for
recent films and exclusive sporting events but instead developed niche
magazine programmes such as Film Europe. It also carries programmes from FT
TV, the television programme-making arm of the Financial Times.
In countries such as Austria, Switzerland and Holland, executives say, Super
Channel has 3 per cent of the television audience.

FT  01 OCT 93 / German housing lifts Redland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRONG house-building market in Germany helped Redland, the
international construction materials group, to report a 22 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits to Pounds 108m in the first six months of the year.
The profit performance was better than expected and compared with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 88.5m in the first half of 1992.
Redland's share price gained 9p to close at 564p.
Mr Robert Napier, chief executive, said conditions were improving in all
Redland's main markets.
Overseas operating profits rose 41 per cent to Pounds 106.8m, benefiting
from 'another excellent performance' in Germany, where the group has a 51
per cent stake in Braas, the country's biggest roof tilemaker. Overall the
German contribution rose from Pounds 41.1m to Pounds 56.2m.
Profits were also supported by improved results in the Netherlands, Italy
and Australasia, a strong recovery in profits in the US and sterling's
devaluation.
France was the exception. Mr Napier said further interest rate cuts and
implementation of the Balladur package were needed to revitalise the
economy.
Group operating profit increased 39 per cent to Pounds 120.9m, but interest
payments nearly trebled to Pounds 19.3m largely reflecting the acquisition
of Steetley in March last year. Turnover rose 30 per cent to Pounds 1.14bn.
The UK contributed Pounds 14.1m in profits, the Pounds 2.8m increase
reflecting cost savings from the rationalisation of the Redland and Steetley
brick and aggregates businesses.
Redland's roofing operations raised operating profits to Pounds 85.2m, up
from Pounds 58.9m. Braas's roof tile volumes in Germany rose 7 per cent, an
increase of 2 per cent in the west and 33 per cent in the east.
Redland's aggregates business posted operating profits of Pounds 23.6m
(Pounds 18.1m). In the UK, volumes in sand, gravel and ready-mixed concrete
fell but profits were slightly ahead.
Brick operations also reported higher operating profits of Pounds 12.1m
(Pounds 10m). Brick volumes in the UK were similar to last year but prices
were down.
Net debt fell from Pounds 664m at the end of December to Pounds 641m at the
end of June, gearing of 39 per cent.
The interim dividend is maintained at 8.25p and the group is offering an
enhanced scrip dividend alternative worth 12.375p.
Earnings per share slipped to 11.6p (11p), reflecting increased minorities,
mainly in Germany, a higher tax charge of 29 per cent and an increase in the
number of shares.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Turmoil at Ferruzzi group prevents release of results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FERRUZZI-Montedison, the troubled industrial group which owes its bankers
more than L28,000bn (Pounds 11.6bn), yesterday said that uncertainty about
the group's future made it impossible to issue first half-figures.
The boards of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) and of its Montedison industrial
subsidiary said the restructuring plan being prepared by the group's bankers
could significantly affect first-half earnings.
Among the most contentious points of the plan, which was originally due to
be released at the end of August, is a moratorium on interest payments and a
rescheduling of the group's massive debts.
The Ferfin board, which met just before a gathering of Montedison's
directors, said it would reconvene on October 14 to approve the six-month
figures. The decision to set such a tight deadline may represent an attempt
to put pressure on the group's bankers to come up with a restructuring
package in time.
Those figures which were released confirmed an improvement in Ferfin's
performance at the operating level. Group sales rose by 19 per cent to
L11,489bn, while net operating profits went up by 69 per cent to L722bn.
The improvement was also reflected in figures adjusted for the effect of
last year's devaluation of the lira. On that basis, Ferfin's turnover
increased by 3 per cent, while net operating profits climbed 45 per cent.
A similar trend was evident at Montedison, where revenues jumped 26 per cent
to L10,287bn, while net operating profits almost doubled to L784bn. Adjusted
for currency factors and acquisitions or disposals, net operating profits
rose 45 per cent and sales were 7 per cent higher.
The amelioration had been seen across the range of Montedison's activities.
Agro-industrial operations, concentrated in the Eridania Beghin-Say sugar
and foods concern, had seen a rise in sales to L6,855bn from L5,367bn, while
the gross operating profit had increased to L704bn from L481bn.
Chemicals, energy and engineering, Montedison's three other main businesses,
had also raised sales and gross margins significantly. Turnover rose to
L3,381bn from L2858bn.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Du Pont cuts 860 UK jobs as global rethink on nylon starts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DU PONT, the world's biggest nylon supplier, is to shut a factory in
Pontypool, South Wales, and cut production at three other sites with the
loss of 860 jobs.
The job cuts, more than 17 per cent of the company's UK workforce in nylon,
are at plants Du Pont bought from Imperial Chemical Industries in July.
Further losses could follow early next year after an in-house analysis of Du
Pont's world nylon activities.
Mr Alan Titus, managing director of Du Pont Nylon Europe, blamed
overcapacity in world markets, duplication of production with US and German
plants, and a drift from nylon to other synthetic fibres for clothing and
carpet textiles.
Pontypool will lose 400 jobs when a nylon textile filament plant and
associated site services shut at the end of the year. Another plant in
Pontypool, which makes the Dacron nylon brand, will stay open.
A further 250 jobs will be lost in Brockworth, Gloucestershire, which has a
technical centre that is 'too big for the size and quality of the European
nylon business', said Mr Titus.
Some 150 jobs will be lost at Doncaster, South Yorkshire, as Du Pont ends
production of carpet staple fibre - the short sections of nylon filament
that are later spun into yarn. The final 60 jobs are to go at Wilton,
Cleveland, as part of a general cost-cutting programme.
Du Pont said it would be looking for voluntary redundancies and redeployment
but that 'involuntary separations will probably be required at some sites'.
Mr Titus warned of possible further job cuts. 'This first phase is doing
things that appear obvious to us,' said Mr Titus. 'It does not represent a
position of sustained financial health.'
Last week, Du Pont's global nylon business began 'a fundamental analysis of
our entire operations to develop further plans to get us back on the path to
sustained profitability.'
The UK nylon plants have already borne a series of job reduction programmes.
When talks on the deal with ICI began in April 1992, there were 6,100 on the
payroll in Europe, the number falling to 5,200 when ICI handed over control.
Another 220 job losses in Oestringen, south of Frankfurt, Germany, were also
announced yesterday, as well as a further 80 spread throughout European
plants.
The cuts follow 1,600 job cuts two weeks ago in Du Pont north American nylon
production sites. At the time, Du Pont's US management warned that there
would be job cuts in Europe.

FT  01 OCT 93 / US group to join UDM in British Coal bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JIM WALTER Resources, a US coalmining company, is to join a consortium of
the Union of Democratic Mineworkers and East Midlands Electricity to bid for
British Coal in next year's privatisation.
JWR, based in Alabama, is a subsidiary of Walter Industries, a building
materials company which has taken refuge in Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy
code, after the launch of a Dollars 3bn asbestos lawsuit against it.
The company argues that the suit is without merit, and expects to win the
case when it reaches the Florida State courts in December.
Walter Industries was the subject of a Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.55bn) Wall
Street buy-out in 1988. However, the asbestos lawsuit in 1989 prevented the
company from making the asset sales necessary to service the large debt from
the deal. The company then went into Chapter 11, which protects it from its
creditors while it reorganises its affairs.
Mr Neil Greatrex, president of the UDM, said yesterday: 'We've been aware of
this case from day one, and we don't think it's been any embarrassment to us
whatsoever.'
The three-party consortium, which is being advised by Kleinwort Benson,
investment bankers, aims to put together an employee-led buy-out of British
Coal. It will study the details of the offer for sale before deciding how
many of the five parcels into which British Coal is to be divided it wants
to bid for. But Mr Greatrex, whose union is based in Nottinghamshire, said
the parcel containing the Midlands pits would obviously be of greatest
interest.
Finance for the bid would be provided by British Coal employees, who would
put up a maximum Pounds 2,000 each; JWR; and East Midlands Electricity.
Mr Greatrex said he had chosen JWR because they were the only potential
partner of the 40 companies contacted who talked about the long-term future
of British Coal. 'We are not looking for people wanting to make a massive
profit and get out.'
JWR's president, Mr Bill Carr, was born in Durham and spent his early life
working for British Coal. He said UK mines were similar in geology, depth
and gas to those worked by his company in Alabama - yet JWR's productivity
was twice that of British Coal. He believed that JWR could bring greatly
improved methods to its pits. He praised 'the good work ethic' of the UDM.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Yeltsin accepts church mediation over crisis: Peace talks to
begin today at monastery
</HEADLINE>

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday agreed to church-mediated talks to try to
end Moscow's political crisis, while Russia's regions stepped up pressure on
him in his confrontation with parliament.
The talks, to begin today at a Moscow monastery, were agreed when Mr Yeltsin
met Patriarch Alexy II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church. Although other
talks have been under way between supporters of Mr Yeltsin and defiant
deputies, the patriarch's mediation is widely seen as offering a way out of
the crisis provoked by Mr Yeltsin's decree dissolving parliament last week.
In a joint statement, Mr Yeltsin and the patriarch emphasised the need to
calm political passions and avoid violence.
The government will be represented at the talks by Mr Sergei Filatov, the
president's chief of staff, and Mr Oleg Soskovets, a first deputy prime
minister. Defiant deputies, of whom about 100 are still barricaded in the
White House, the parliament building, will be represented by high-ranking
officials.
The move came after representatives of 62 of Russia's 88 regions demanded
that police and troops end their barbed-wire blockade of parliament and that
Mr Yeltsin withdraw his decree dismissing parliament ahead of new elections
in December.
Deputy prime minister Sergei Shakhrai, who met the regional spokesmen, said
they were unrepresentative of their people. But as a sign of its concern,
the government is sending seven ministers to various parts of the country,
including southern Russia, the far east and Siberia to whip up support for
Mr Yeltsin.
In their Moscow talks, the regional spokesmen threatened 'all necessary
measures of economic and political pressure' to restore 'constitutional
legality'.
Potentially more significant was the regional officials' announcement that
they planned to form a federation council, which would supplant a similar
body foreseen by Mr Yeltsin as the unelected upper chamber of a new
parliament.
Barricaded inside the White House, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, parliament's
speaker, who has cultivated the regional councils, said that 'everything
would now be decided by the regions'.
Mr Yeltsin reiterated that he would not repeal his decree dissolving
parliament. But a close aide, Mr Gennady Burbulis, said all means had to be
found to secure a dignified exit from the White House for Mr Khasbulatov and
vice president Alexander Rutskoi.
Pressure is also growing for Mr Yeltsin to hold early presidential elections
simultaneously with an election to the new-style parliament, rather than six
months later.

FT  01 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK retailing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sears' observation that its margins will start to come under pressure from
the delayed effects of sterling's devaluation raises the issue of how much
inflationary pressure is still in the pipeline. Price rises yet to come as a
result of sterling's exit from the ERM may not be enough to shift the
overall level of inflation much, but it may have an impact on retailers like
Sears which operate longer-term forward foreign exchange cover for imported
products.
Other buyers of imported finished goods may well be in a similar position,
since the lead times in such businesses are long. Clothing and footwear
retailers which source overseas may thus come under pressure to raise prices
this autumn. In contrast, buyers of raw materials like yarn, which have
shorter cycles, will already have seen some of the pressure.
Several factors will, however, mitigate any inflationary impact. Devaluation
in countries like Spain and Italy, and weak economies worldwide, have made
it difficult for hard-currency manufacturers to increase prices. With the
yen very strong, this effect has hit Japanese companies particularly hard.
Since consumers are reluctant to spend, retailers have had to absorb some of
the costs in margins. In areas such as textiles and cars, where quotas
apply, margins will have been built up in good times, and can be run down
without excessive pain now. Still, as soon as world markets show any degree
of strength, the pressure to raise prices and rebuild margins will return.
