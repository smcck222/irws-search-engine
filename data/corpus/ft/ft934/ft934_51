FT  01 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte's strategy is clear from the way it presented yesterday's interim
results. Recovery is slow to come through, but, thanks partly to two
enhanced scrip dividends in a row, cash flow is strong enough to service its
Pounds 1.3bn debt. There is no need for a rights issue, or for hasty sales
of assets at knock-down prices. That is a legitimate approach, but
yesterday's 4 per cent fall showed the market was expecting better. After
all, the near doubling of the shares over the past year was predicated on
the benefits of operational gearing in its hotels showing through more
strongly by now.
There is still a chance of this happening in the second half, but it will
depend on the company's ability to push up room rates as well as occupancy.
Equally important it must keep down costs, which are showing more underlying
resilience than might be expected at this stage in the cycle. The more
reasonable bet is that considerable patience will be required before Forte
fulfils its promise.
Though the company can manage on relatively modest capital expenditure,
gearing thus limits its ability to exploit growth opportunities - like the
expansion of its Travelodge chain in the UK. Arguably Forte's freedom of
manoeuvre would be enhanced by the rights issue that seemed likely after the
dividend was cut six months ago. But Forte regards equity as too expensive
at present yields. Besides, a rights issue would be difficult to sell when
even its reduced dividend may now be barely covered in the current year.

FT  01 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Redland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For a company which has been straining to sustain a hefty dividend to add to
its long-term burden by issuing two scrip dividends may seem rather like
trying to extinguish a fire by dousing it with petrol. Although Redland will
save Pounds 36m of ACT and preserve cash in the short term, it will now have
to service 7 1/2 per cent more shares over the longer run. This will prove
costly given their yield of 5 1/2 per cent. It is not even as if the market
has much of an appetite for Redland shares. Following a rights issue and the
Steetley acquisition in 1991, Redland has issued paper in profusion. The 5
per cent fall in interim earnings despite a 22 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits illustrates the dilutive effects.
Nevertheless, such concerns will evaporate if the paper dividends buy
Redland enough time to enable rebounding UK earnings to resolve its tax
dilemma. So far, the news from the home front is encouraging if not
conclusive. Volumes and prices are firming but remain well below historic
peaks. Redland will have to drive its earnings forward fast to justify its
calculated gamble.
The worry would be if German demand deteriorated too sharply before UK
earnings did their trick. The German housing market has remained
astonishingly resilient thanks to the flood of immigrants in the west and
the leaking roofs in the east. But the probable expiry of housing tax
subsidies at the end of 1994 may well damp demand. Redland will be praying
that the UK upturn will be speedy enough for it to squeak through.

FT  01 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Goode intentions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the Goode committee's weighty proposals, the minimum solvency
standard for pension funds could be the most momentous. As in banking or
insurance, a solvency requirement was always a prerequisite for a worthwhile
system of prudential regulation. The question is whether its introduction
will make the pension industry as risk averse as banks became when capital
adequacy ratios were imposed. Since UK funds control Pounds 400bn in assets,
even a subtle shift in investment will have far-reaching implications for
financial markets.
The solvency standard proposed yesterday does not look excessively harsh.
But pension fund solvency is a slippery concept which turns on actuarial
assumptions on investment return and mortality rates. The committee is right
to recommend that actuaries should be appointed by trustees rather than
companies. That should help prevent them inclining towards generous
valuations to please their paymasters. But Goode has stopped short of
prescribing standard assumptions which actuaries should use; this hot potato
is instead passed back to the profession.
How they respond will determine whether pension funds feel obliged to shift
assets out of equities and into gilts. The assumptions would not have to be
particularly tough to leave many pension funds in danger of falling close to
the new solvency limit if equities suffer a bad spell. Heavier investment in
gilts would surely result. Prudential regulation carries risks of its own in
terms of lower investment returns, and ultimately poorer pensions.

WITH peacekeeping operations in Somalia and the former Yugoslavia dogged by
political controversy or worse, Cambodia represents a welcome success story
for the United Nations. In a country devastated by years of civil war and by
the depredations of the Khmer Rouge, it organised free and fair elections
which have led to the establishment of a new constitution and democratic
government. The Dollars 2bn operation - now winding down - has achieved more
than the UN dared hope when the Paris peace accord was signed two years ago.
Cambodia's peace remains fragile. Norodom Sihanouk has become king and must
resist the temptation to interfere in government. His son, Ranariddh, has
entered what could be an awkward coalition with Hun Sen, premier in the
former Vietnamese-installed government. However, the real losers in the
electoral process have been the Khmer Rouge, whose tactics in seeking to
sabotage the elections have backfired with defections of guerrillas
disillusioned and tired of war. The weakening of the Khmer Rouge, if it
continues, justifies the UN's determination to hold elections.
It is up to Cambodians to make their new political system work. But the
international community must still provide assistance. Aid to finance the
building of physical infrastructure is essential. Help is also needed to
create the elements of a new society: a financial system, a judiciary,
education. Aid commitments total around Dollars 1bn but so far little money
has reached Cambodia. Efforts to restore the country to the international
financial community by clearing its arrears to the International Monetary
Fund are a vital way to start the flow of funds. It would be a tragedy if
the extraordinary, and costly, efforts of UN personnel in Cambodia were
wasted through failure by the international community to follow the task
through to the end.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Bringing home the shopping: Nikki Tait examines the
potential for television retailing as interest quickens among media and
store groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The woman on the television screen poses beside a vacuum cleaner. She tilts
it this way and that, demonstrates its internal workings, and then whirls
the machine in action. 'It's light, it's adorable,' she exclaims.
Alongside her is the cleaner's price, Dollars 109.95, and a freephone number
to ring for orders. A clock counts down the remaining display time in one
corner. Then the vacuum cleaner and the woman vanish, and are replaced by a
middle-aged man, who talks enthusiastically about a sterling silver ring.
Welcome to TV shopping, US-style. The items appear on a programme
transmitted by QVC Network, one of the two leading televised shopping
retailers. About three-quarters, or 45m, of the nation's homes with cable TV
have access to QVC; in 75 per cent of them, QVC runs 24 hours a day. Local
cable operators receive monthly cash payments from QVC equal to 5 per cent
of the net sales generated from their respective areas.
From today, British viewers will also have a chance to shop non-stop, when
QVC becomes available on cable and satellite television as part of a package
of 14 paid-for channels offered by BSkyB.
Television home shopping, after failing to produce exciting growth in the
1980s, is suddenly attracting media and retailing groups. Investor interest
quickened last January when Mr Barry Diller - a Hollywood executive who
helped Rupert Murdoch turn Fox into America's fourth national television
network - became chairman and chief executive of QVC, which this month
launched a hostile Dollars 9.5bn takeover bid for entertainment group
Paramount Communications.
Mr Diller quickly persuaded several prestigious names, such as the retailer
Saks Fifth Avenue, to offer merchandise via QVC. Now, QVC wants to take over
its main rival, Home Shopping Network, which is beset by management
troubles, but HSN says talks are on the back burner until the battle for
Paramount is decided.
But QVC is by no means the only dynamic player in the market. Time Warner,
the largest US entertainment group, and Spiegel, a leading specialty fashion
retailer and catalogue company, have joined forces to create two cable
television channels in the fast-growing field. And this summer, R H Macy,
the well-known but bankrupt department store group, announced plans to sell
its wares on Cablevision, the fifth-largest cable TV operator in the US, by
autumn 1994.
Another enthusiast is Seattle-based Nordstrom. In late spring, the upmarket
fashion retailer announced plans to start a catalogue operation, with a view
to using this as a springboard into 'interactive' TV shopping by the end of
1994, where fast-evolving digital technology would allow viewers to call up
information on products, and place orders, via their TV sets.
Yet, in spite of this swirl of activity, US retailers are divided over home
shopping's potential. The believers note that the industry has made sizable
strides in a relatively short time. Ten years ago, neither QVC nor HSN
existed, yet their combined sales last year topped the Dollars 2bn mark.
QVC's sales in the first six months of 1993 rose 18 per cent, to Dollars
535.7m; net profits of Dollars 34.9m compared with Dollars 19.9m for the
corresponding period of 1992.
QVC ships merchandise to customers from distribution centres at West Chester
and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Suffolk, Virginia. Delivery is usually made
by UPS or, for lightweight packages, by the US postal service. Products with
a purchase price of more than Dollars 200 go Federal Express.
Critics argue that home shopping must be seen in perspective. In aggregate,
Americans spent about one and a half trillion dollars last year on consumer
products, not counting car sales. The vast bulk of this expenditure went
through conventional shopping channels.
They point out that, after a century of development, the mail order
catalogue sector - the other principal 'non-store' shopping alternative -
notches up only Dollars 70bn in annual sales.
Experience provides a second reason for wariness. In the 1980s, several big
US retailers toyed with the home shopping concept, but concluded that
significant commitment would be premature.
J C Penney, the department store group, for example, tested an 'interactive'
home shopping service in 1987 among consumers in a Chicago suburb. After
investing Dollars 100m in the venture, Penney abandoned it three years
later, claiming that the technology to support the idea was not sufficiently
developed. Another tilt at home shopping about a year afterwards was
abandoned. 'We were not pleased with the sales generated,' Penney explains.
Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson, another big department store operator, also
had an early brush with TV shopping that led nowhere. Like Penney, Dayton
has not abandoned the concept, and is more enthusiastic than its Texan
counterpart. But it is testing the market carefully before making
large-scale financial commitments.
At present, Dayton's plans centre on 'infomercials' - advertisements with an
editorial spin. Dayton tried to sell bedding material in this way recently,
and describes the project as 'a qualified success'. But the retailer is
careful to stress that it 'is still learning whether this is a format we
want to pursue'.
Not surprisingly, QVC is more positive. 'We're very optimistic - there's a
huge segment of the population which has never even tried home shopping,'
says the Pennsylvania-based company, although it declines to make detailed
forecasts of participating audiences.
Before they can broaden their appeal, however, TV shopping companies - as
QVC acknowledges - may need to change consumers' perception that shopping
via television is a slightly unsavoury occupation, indulged in by bored
housewives and insomniacs. The 'typical' home shopper at the moment is drawn
from the lower-income categories, although a survey by Deloitte &amp; Touche and
Impact Resources, market researchers, suggested that this image had been
exaggerated.
The survey, which covered 6,000 regular TV shoppers, discovered that almost
half were between 25 and 44; 43 per cent were married; more than a third had
graduated from high school; 52 per cent were women. The average household
income was just less than Dollars 35,000, compared with an average income of
Dollars 38,000 for all US households - lower, but not significantly so.
Even if the involvement of high-quality names, such as the designer Diane
von Furstenberg, and Saks, helps home shopping to upgrade its reputation, a
significant challenge lies in the area of presentation. The reasons are
simple: in a store, shoppers see and feel items, and decide within seconds
whether to take a closer look or pass on. With TV shopping, more verbal
detail has to be provided, along with a long-distance demonstration of how
appliances work, how clothes 'wear' and so on.
'Customers need tons of explanation - you can't cut the information,' says
QVC. On average, its programmes devote about five minutes to each item. From
the viewer's perspective, such thoroughness might become wearing.
QVC tackles this problem by grouping products together. For example, the
first six hours one recent Sunday morning were devoted to 60-minute segments
on jewellery, fun and leisure, 'superbargains', cooking equipment, more
jewellery, and housewares. Nevertheless, the type of goods sold through TV
in significant volumes remains limited. Jewellery accounted for about 43 per
cent of QVC's sales last year, clothing and accessories, 17 per cent. At
HSN, jewellery sales made up 49 per cent of total turnover in the 1991-92
financial year.
For dedicated consumers, home shopping is a boon. One Manhattan-based
shopper says convenience is the biggest draw. QVC offers a 30-day,
money-back guarantee, and pays the shipping costs.
That, she argues, beats trudging around a high-street store or mall, and
making a second trip if the goods are unsatisfactory. Moreover, pricing is
often competitive, and some of the items are either exclusive to the TV
shopping channel or not readily available elsewhere. 'I wouldn't use it all
the time,' she says, 'but it's definitely a part of my life.'

An eagle-eyed company secretary has stumbled on one reason for the alarming
weight gain in the Stock Exchange Yellow book. The new set of rules
governing listings tips the scales at 2.075kg, over twice the weight of its
predecessor.
Chapter 16, which details directors' obligations, sets out, a trifle
superfluously, how 'A company is not required to notify to the Company
Announcements Office information which, notwithstanding compliance by it
with this paragraph, it does not have.'

It makes a refreshing change these days to learn that Treasury ministers are
not above poking fun at their own department, especially in the pre-Budget
period when they have traditionally been duty-bound by an official edict to
keep silent.
Thus Stephen Dorrell, Treasury financial secretary, took full advantage this
week of the change in rules which has eliminated 'purdah' ahead of the
November 30 Budget.
Dorrell, who joined the Treasury only 17 months ago after a two year stint
at the Department of Health with responsibilities including mental health,
told a London conference that he had been deemed well-suited to take the job
on the grounds that the Treasury contained the world's largest collection of
clever people doing stupid things.

Chinese accountants finding life too exciting should apply to Eagle Star,
which has decided to put money into turning the first 20 of China's 1.2bn
people into actuaries.
Steve Melcher, chairman of Eagle Star Life, says that a group of
English-speaking mathematical whizzes are preparing for a three-year course
for a master's degree in actuarial science.
Asked if they will be producing carbon copies of their British brethren,
Melcher explains that the course will be adapted to reflect the
characteristics of the Chinese economy - such as that 'interest rates are
manipulated differently'.

Now we know; resisting Boris Yeltsin is sheer madness. So says a group of
Russian psychiatrists, specialists at the Psychiatric Research Institute
under the leadership of Viktor Khanykov.
The shrinks publish their diagnosis of Yeltsin's parliamentary opponents on
the front page of one of Moscow's best-selling dailies, Komsomolskaya
Pravda.
They say that each of the leaders of the besieged Russian parliament
provides 'a clear illustration of psychopathic behaviour, with the
predominance of hysterical and paranoid tendencies'.
'Long before the 'Yeltsin putsch' ', they charge, the opposition was out to
stir up an atmosphere of suspicion, alarm and panic in the Supreme Soviet
and throughout the land.
The doctors go on to prescribe a course of therapy, although they admit that
'it is unlikely they will voluntarily submit themselves to treatment'.
With people in such a state, both force and negotiation are utterly useless,
they say. Instead, the authorities must 'sympathise with them' and gradually
influence them by using calm persuasion and psychotherapy.
The psychiatrists exhort that the new election laws have written into them
the requirement that candidates take a psychological test and submit to a
psychological examination - since 'for our country, sensible authorities are
of the utmost importance'.

Bill Carr looks every inch the US businessman; tall, silver-haired,
grey-suited - until he opens his mouth. The Geordie accent is unmistakeable.
His appearance yesterday as president of Jim Walter Resources, the Alabama
company which is teaming up with the Union of Democratic Mineworkers to bid
for British Coal, cast him as the stalwart US partner in the bidding
consortium.
But Carr was born in County Durham in north-east England in 1930. He started
his working life as a pit hand at the age of 14, and stayed with British
Coal until 1975, by which time he had risen to mine general manager.
That year he crossed the Atlantic to become senior mining engineer for Paul
Weir Company, a consulting firm in Chicago. One of its clients was Jim
Walter Resources; a year later he had joined the payroll. He became
president and chief operating officer of the company in 1991.
'I have a soft spot for British Coal,' he confessed yesterday. 'But also a
hard head. I think the signs are there that we can do something with this
kettle of fish.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by the US central bank on when to begin tightening monetary
policy will probably have a greater impact on the progress of the domestic
economy than any single pronouncement from the White House.
So it will be with some care that President Clinton goes about the search
for a replacement for Federal Reserve governor Wayne Angell, whose term
expires at the end of January.
His departure opens up the way for the first Democratic nominee since the
Carter years and the administration will be after a heavyweight economist
capable of challenging articulate Republican appointees such as David
Mullins and Lawrence Lindsey, not to mention chairman Alan Greenspan.
One possibility is Alan Blinder, the Princeton economist currently serving
as Laura Tyson's deputy at the Council of Economic Advisers. Ben Friedman, a
Harvard professor and critic of Fed policies in the 1980s, is another
academic reputedly in the running.
But with white males filling the 12 regional presidencies and six of the
seven governorships, the Fed is under fire from Congress for failing to
promote women and minorities, so it is perhaps time for the president to
exercise greater imagination.
Alicia Munnell, assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury, is
thought to be keen on the job, even if it carries less executive
responsibility. A former research director of the Boston Fed, she knows the
system well.
Or Clinton could try Alice Rivlin, who is understood to be less than happy
as Leon Panetta's deputy at the Office of Management and Budget. Rivlin's
speciality is fiscal policy, but it is not hard to imagine her laying down
the law on interest rates.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Unpresidential prose: Germany's livelier tone of political
debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is wrong with the following statements, made recently by Mr Steffen
Heitmann, the minister in the east German state of Saxony proposed by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to become Germany's next president?
'Maastricht has been imposed from above . . . Europe cannot be forced on
people . . . the Holocaust does not mean that Germany should have a special
role until the end of time . . . when there are only a few homes available,
you can say quite soberly that other people can move in to them, rather than
asylum-seekers.'
The answer is: not much. However, amid a political struggle in Germany about
who should succeed President Richard von Weizsacker next summer, Mr
Heitmann's utterances have caused a stir.
Left-leaning magazines such as Der Spiegel or Stern claim they place him on
the far right of the political spectrum, while a conservative
Kohl-supporting newspaper such as the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung asks
what all the fuss is about.
The controversy is important for what it tells us about political discourse
in Germany, and about the changes there. Whether or not the
less-than-awe-inspiring figure of Mr Heitmann actually wins the presidential
race is secondary.
Germany is a country where politicians cloud statements with high-sounding
phrases designed to obscure and even mislead. We may now have to become used
to more direct language.
In view of the economic and political problems of reunification, Germany has
become a less well-balanced, less stable country than the old Federal
Republic.
By commenting on the country's preoccupations with less than the
sanctimonious decorum expected from a contestant for highest office, Mr
Heitmann has injected a note of realism into public debate.
All this is not to suggest that Mr Heitmann would be an ideal president. He
has been chosen by Mr Kohl on the somewhat spurious grounds that he embodies
the rough-hewn views of many east Germans.
Since the junior party in the coalition, the Free Democrats, has voiced
misgivings about Mr Heitmann, his chances of taking over the presidency are
not assured.
Mr Heitmann admits that, under the former Communist regime, he was 'no
hero'. One point about him, though, is incontestable. His views on the three
subjects outlined above - Europe, Germany's history and asylum-seekers - are
neither startling nor original.
EC governments accept that Maastricht did not sufficiently take into account
sensitivities of Community electorates. The desire to make Maastricht
'closer to the people' accounts for the EC's new emphasis on subsidiarity.
No foreign government wants Germany to forget the Nazi past. But most of
Germany's partners would like it to throw off some historically-imposed
shackles. Nato backs Mr Kohl's efforts to relax the 1949 constitution to
allow Bundeswehr (army) troops to take part in peace-keeping abroad.
On asylum-seekers, Mr Heitmann could have been more tactful in view of
recent attacks on foreigners in Germany. But no one can ignore that high
immigration has increased pressure on German housing and social security.
Both Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats
jointly decided during the summer to tone down Germany's previously generous
asylum law.
A German president, a figure without real power, is supposed to provide a
form of moral or ethical leadership. But he also has to ensure his views are
not too far removed from public opinion. During the past decade, Mr von
Weizsacker achieved this balancing act with aplomb and authority. His
best-regarded speech, in 1985, on the 40th anniversary of the end of the
second world war, was a masterpiece; its message calling on Germans to come
to terms with their history was popular and thought-provoking.
In two years, when the 50th anniversary of Germany's capitulation is
commemorated, a different speech will be required. The new German head of
state will have to talk about Hitler and the Holocaust. But he (or,
possibly, she) will also have to explain how Germany can achieve its
priorities: to resurrect east Germany without bankrupting west Germany; to
forge a new sense of nationhood and at the same time integrate its 6m
foreigners; to rebuild the nation without disrupting the course of European
unity.
All this requires hard choices, in the past, often befogged by the soft
opacity of German political parlance. By reminding onlookers that united
Germany has a new set of priorities, Mr Heitmann deserves a modest medal,
struck in east German bronze: not for nobility or vision, but for plain
speaking.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Mr Tietmeyer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY, MR Hans Tietmeyer replaces Mr Helmut Schlesinger at the head of the
Bundesbank. It would be wrong to expect this to make much difference.
Personalities may change, but the institution will not. Even if Mr Tietmeyer
wanted to soften its disinflationary line, he would not be allowed to by
other members of his council. Like any great institution, the Bundesbank is
far more than any individual.
Mr Schlesinger has important achievements to his credit. He took over from
Mr Karl Otto Pohl after the latter's bruising fight with the German
chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, over the terms of German monetary unification.
With German fiscal policy falling into disarray and inflation rising to
unacceptable levels, Mr Schlesinger's Bundesbank was determined to restore
monetary stability. It is on its way to doing so, even though the
consequences of its determination have included deep German and European
recessions, disruption of the exchange rate mechanism and, in all
probability, postponement of economic and monetary union to the next
millennium.
Abroad, these policies have been controversial. But the Bundesbank has not
acted whimsically. It has been doing precisely what an influential part of
the German people continues to want it to do. By preserving the value of the
D-Mark and keeping long-term rates of interest low, the Bundesbank is viewed
as the chief institutional guarantor of stability in a country still beset
by the demons of past catastrophes.
This will not change. Mr Tietmeyer argued for a quarter point cut in the
discount rate last July, immediately before the crisis that broke the ERM.
Yet this was a grace note, rather than a different tune, and might well have
made no difference to the outcome. Mr Tietmeyer knows that the Bundesbank's
power rests on its reputation. He too will fight whatever might compromise
it, be it the threat from Bonn, Paris, Brussels or anywhere else.
The aims of the Bundesbank may not change, but its policies will. Interest
rates will fall, for example, as inflation comes under control. The D-Mark
is also likely to weaken, which should prove helpful to its partners. But
the institution's role will remain for some years to come. Given the
determination of the Germans to ensure that any replacement will be at least
as good, it is possible that there will never be one.
The Bundesbank is not above criticism. Its monetary policy has probably been
too tight this year. Its emphasis on monetary targets may prove a mistake.
Its council discussions are too secretive and should be revealed to the
public, as are those of the Federal Reserve's open market committee. Yet
whatever its mistakes and failings, the Bundesbank remains a powerful force
for good as Germany's and Europe's chief bulwark against the inflationary
propensities of politicians. May it remain so.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Leading Article: The verdict on Goode
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS NO fault of Professor Roy Goode and his pension law review committee
that their report comes 20 years too late. But the extent of the delay, and
the needless misery inflicted on pensioners by the Maxwell affair and other
scandals, does mean that any failure to implement the specific
recommendations to deal with abuse rapidly would be inexcusable. The
document is far from radical; yet there is a suitably hard edge to some of
its regulatory proposals. Nobody will be wholly satisfied with this weighty
blueprint for a new legislative framework. But the complexity of the subject
and the conflicting interests at stake together imply that some
disappointment is probably inescapable.
The first test of the report is whether it offers adequate protection for
present and future pensioners against crooks like Robert Maxwell. No system
of protection can ever be foolproof, but the basic building blocks are here,
including fitness tests for trustees, minimum solvency requirements, a
compensation scheme, whistleblowing powers for trustees and professional
advisers, and a new regulator with substantial powers of investigation and
enforcement.
Building blocks, however, is the appropriate description, for the solvency
rules, though accompanied by a tight timetable, are pitched at a very modest
level in relation to current practice in most funds. As for compensation, it
may be realistic to exclude losses arising from mismanagement, as opposed to
fraud, theft and misappropriation. But the problem with many recent scandals
has been the difficulty of proving fraud or mounting legal action to obtain
redress for possible breaches of trust. Much will hinge on intelligent
parliamentary draughtsmanship.
The more difficult test relates to concern about a perceived lack of balance
in pension schemes between the differing and sometimes conflicting interests
of employers, employees, pensioners and so-called early leavers. On the
issue of ownership and control Professor Goode predictably gives the whip
hand in final salary schemes to the employers; and it is not clear that his
recommendations for minority employee representation on trustee boards are
proof against the whistleblowing employee representative being intimidated
or sacked. What is clear is that the committee is prepared to pay only lip
service to the interests of pensioner trustees and no service at all to
early leaver trustees. Yet it is these two groups that have tended to lose
out in contentious cases over the use of pension fund surpluses; and the
report's excuses for leaving them in the cold are flabby.
Perhaps the greatest source of discontent on the part of pension scheme
members has been to do with the loss of pension rights through inflation, a
worry that has been exacerbated where employers have clawed back surpluses
from the pension fund without making good much of the erosion, in real
terms, of the rights of the various categories of member. While seeking to
tighten the rules on clawbacks, the committee is not prepared to insist that
past inflationary losses should be substantially mitigated before the
company can take surpluses into profit; and its members were unable to agree
on indexation of pensions in payment.
The final test of the report will lie in whether the ensuing legislation
constitutes a deterrent to the maintenance of final salary pension schemes.
There are a number of sound housekeeping measures which may be
administratively burdensome, but in the central areas of compensation and
minimum solvency requirements Goode has erred on the side of the employer.
In the longer run any decision to abandon traditional occupational pension
provision will be dictated by larger factors, such as the government's
assault on the funds' tax privileges. The government must not allow its
ideological distaste for a paternalistic form of pension provision to stand
in the way of protection for 11m present and future pensioners.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Obscure view of milk issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL WILLIAMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Dare recognises that milk supply in the UK is constrained by EC
quotas to less than total demand but goes on to suggest that, despite this,
prices should be determined by the market place.
This can only mean that UK prices will rise and users of dairy products will
be encouraged to direct future investment towards countries which can
guarantee reliable supplies at more competitive prices.
However efficient our dairy processors prove to be, how are they going to
compete successfully with comparably efficient companies in Ireland or the
Netherlands or France, where there are adequate supplies and real
competition?

<BYLINE>
   From Mr JIM MCMICHAEL-PHILLIPS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The letter from Andrew Dare, chief executive of the Milk Marketing
Board (September 29), serves only to obscure the issues set out so clearly
in your leading article, 'Milking the Milk Monopoly' (September 27).
According to Mr Dare: 'It may be that supply is limited by EC-imposed milk
quotas. But far better that the limited supply is priced by the market
place.'
The UK is only about 85 per cent self-sufficient in raw milk, and no
increase in the price paid to farmers can increase that supply. The stated
ambition of Milk Marques - the organisation that will replace the MMB - is
to control 80 per cent of this restricted supply and thereafter, free from
the present statutory price controls, significantly to increase the prices
payable by dairies and consumers. As your leader says, such increases are
monopoly rents. Any comparison with the free market in the Netherlands,
which is over 200 per cent self-sufficient in raw milk, is wholly
misleading.
It is perhaps the mark of a monopoly that it can write to the press
criticising its customers and dismissing their concerns.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Fight over a hill o' beans: Coffee farmers' attempts to
raise prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The glamorous advertisements of the world's big coffee processors contrast
sharply with the blunt tactics of the less wealthy farmers who grow the
coffee beans.
Today 40 coffee-producing countries, representing 90 per cent of world
exports, will start withholding some supplies from the market in an attempt
to force up prices. The fact that they are almost certain to lose revenue by
their action underlines their frustration at the collapse of coffee prices
in recent years.
World bean prices have halved in the four years since the International
Coffee Organisation's price support scheme collapsed in 1989, when buyers
and suppliers failed to reach agreement on renewing the pact. The cost to
farmers of the fall in prices, in terms of revenue foregone, has been
Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) a year.
But because the fall in coffee bean prices has not been reflected in the
supermarkets, the international food companies such as Nestle, Sara Lee and
Kraft General Foods have seen their earnings rise in the world retail coffee
market, which is worth Dollars 30bn a year.
Consumer prices have fallen by only 5 to 10 per cent since 1989. Twin
Trading, the commodities trading company, estimates that the cost of coffee
beans in a 100g jar of instant is 20p, compared with 40p in 1988, but the
supermarket price has remained at about Pounds 1.60.
In their defence, the big processors say they want to keep prices stable.
But the effectiveness of brand loyalty has made demand for many of their
products insensitive to price changes. They have spent heavily on marketing
to promote brand names and defend market share; expensive adverts such as
that for Nestle Gold Blend cost as much or more a jar than the coffee beans.
A UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission report two years ago, though clearing
Nestle of abusing its dominant market position in Britain, showed that its
return, before interest, on sales of instant coffee was as high as 36 per
cent.
Such figures have convinced the bean producers that they have a case for
taking action to boost their share of the profits in the coffee market. 'It
annoys us that coffee consumption has not been increased because of the drop
in price, but the roasters are just getting richer,' said Mr Nestor Osorio,
who represents Colombia's coffee growers at the International Coffee
Organisation in London.
Mr Osorio admits the action planned by producing countries is a last resort,
following the failure of an attempt in March, under the auspices of the
coffee organisation, to revive the agreement between producers and buyers.
Though they have since rebounded, average world prices fell to 44 cents per
pound in August last year - the lowest level since 1974 - from levels of 120
to 140 cents per pound during most of the 1980s.
'Some of the countries in the scheme are heavily dependent on coffee for
their revenues and they have been damaged by these low prices,' he says.
Under the terms of the retention agreement, which Brazil has offered to
administer, producers will reduce their exports by 20 per cent until the
world price hits 75 cents a pound. If prices rise above that level, they
will withhold 10 per cent of exports until the price reaches 85 cents per
pound, when retention will stop.
The plan has already had an impact on world markets. Prices have risen to
about 70 cents a pound in anticipation of today's launch. But coffee brokers
suspect that the producing countries will find it hard to hold the pact
together if prices rise just a little above the current level, particularly
as the short-term costs to producers of the agreement could be considerable.
Past attempts to fix coffee prices have relied on the co-operation of
governments of consuming countries monitoring imports to ensure that
producers are sticking to their quotas. 'Without the support of the
consumers, which have always monitored the pacts in the past, it makes it
much more difficult to check the flow of coffee,' said Mr Peter Kettle, head
of research at ED&amp;F Mann, the London trading house.
Though some producing countries are still hopeful that agreement might be
reached with the consuming countries, the latest pact has been drawn up
without them. Indeed the US, the largest market for coffee, cancelled its
membership of the International Coffee Organisation last week in protest at
the producers' action.
At the same time, coffee market observers are sceptical whether any kind of
price fixing deal is possible in an increasingly sophisticated commodities
market. The souring of relations between producers and consumers, stemming
from the failure to reach agreement in March, has made the task still more
difficult.
Mr Osorio complains of the 'greed' of the marketing companies which wanted
to boost their profit margins.
But one US trade official and commodity negotiator, said it was the
producers who expected too much. 'I used to think that these commodity pacts
could work, but there's too much greed. As soon as producers get together
with consumers, they expect prices to rise.'
The difficulty in fixing prices at a level which suits buyers and suppliers
is common to all commodities. Though often seen in the 1970s by developed
countries as a means of channelling aid to the third world, such policies
fell from favour in the 1980s when huge increases in output by producing
countries made schemes costly to run. In 1985, for instance, the
International Tin Council's support for prices collapsed, causing
difficulties for many producers. Attempts to fix cocoa prices have also
broken down.
'You need to set prices at a level that ensures demand carries on growing,
but also that production is not excessive,' says Mr Lawrence Eagles,
commodity analyst at GNI, the London securities house. Even the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the world's most successful producers'
club, has not achieved its price targets in recent years.
The success of the coffee producers' latest attempt to raise coffee bean
prices will be evident on the world's commodity futures exchanges in the
next few weeks. Producers say that if the processors absorb the extra cost
by cutting margins, any rise in world coffee prices should have little
effect on consumers. But they may be wrong in assuming that the consequences
of their attempt to force up prices will make processors face that dilemma.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, The picture painted by Martin Pollard ('Incompetent trainees 'being let
loose in the workplace'', September 24) is wrong. The overwhelming majority
of Training and Enterprise Councils only fund electrical industry training
that leads to National Vocational Qualification Level 3. This is the
appropriate standard for that industry and Tecs work closely with the
industry to ensure it happens. Mr Pollard is wildly out of date.
Tecs are not in the business of funding sub-standard training. They exist to
increase the quality of training in all sectors of business and industry so
that organisations can improve their skills and competitiveness. To suggest
otherwise is thoroughly misleading.

FT  01 OCT 93 / One more heave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In June he was the most un-popular prime minister since opinion sampling
began. The Labour opposition had led in the polls since he took office in
1990. Yet he has now called a fresh ballot, for November 6. No sooner had he
announced it than Labour fell eight points behind. Perhaps it had something
to do with the central bank's forecast of a couple of years of steady,
sustainable, non-inflationary growth.
The hero of the above little history, which has not yet been fully played
out, is Mr Jim Bolger, prime minister of New Zealand. That is about as far
as you can get from Britain, yet the story has not been lost on Mr John
Major. Aware of his own poll rating, which is also at a record low, the
British prime minister might be expected to recite the list of contemporary
heads of government who are out of favour, and to name some who have
recovered popularity after a bout of mid-term disaffection. I fancy he likes
the Bolger story best.
The forecast for New Zealand is 2 1/2 per cent plus annual growth. The
British rate has reached about 2 per cent. It looks sustainable and
non-inflationary, but stuck on a plateau. Contemplating the economic outlook
while sitting at his table in the cabinet room, Mr Major muses that this is
due to pre-Budget blight. Warnings of tax increases have made consumers
cautious. Once the November statement is out of the way, the rate of growth
will accelerate.
This prospect of prosperity will be played upon at the Conservative
conference next week. It may be combined with some softening-up for the
combined Budget and spending announcement to come. One more heave, the
Tories will be told, and the country's finances will be sound. The long
journey through the wastelands entered when Mr Major became chancellor and
saw the need to conquer inflation will be over. It has to hurt for just a
while longer to work.
Contemporary opinion is harsher than that. It says that Mr Major is a weak
prime minister, not up to the job, lacking in grip. He might reasonably
reply that this is the picture put in people's heads by the media, many
leading elements of which turned against him over Maastricht. As to grip, no
prime minister for the past 35 years, not even ones resting on large,
comfortable, parliamentary majorities, has held firm to counter inflation as
he has done, even through the build-up to last year's election. Now, partly
thanks to an unplanned devaluation last September, a strongly competitive
British economy may be in for a period of high growth and low inflation.
I have no more idea than anyone else what Mr Major's strategy of
gratification postponed will do for the Conservatives, or even whether the
prime minister will keep his job until the next election. If pressed, I
would hazard that the odds are slightly against him. Yet the current
epidemic of forecasts of his political demise may work itself out. The case
that he will not go, the argument that the prime minister rests on, should
be rehearsed.
If anyone were to look him in the eye and, after reminding him of the
vilification he has endured over the past year, ask whether he thought it
worth carrying on, he would say he was elected to do a job and will not
simply pick up his bat and walk from the crease. There is no expectation in
Downing Street of a leadership challenge, partly on the ground that no
conceivable challenger would get the 30 signatures necessary under
Conservative party rules.
Mr Major is in a blunt, combative mood. He has acquired a carapace of
hardness I have not seen in him before. He is looking well, and talking as
if fate has more in store for him than the role of an interim successor to
Lady Thatcher. Aw-are that he plays best in one-on-one conversations he has
met some 200 local party bigwigs. He will continue his tours of the
constituencies. The soapbox that featured in the April 1992 election will be
deployed where appropriate. He intends to pursue a personal campaign to
restore Conservative morale - and, I presume, faith in his leadership.
The core of history's justification of his position might run as follows: he
has taken everything that could be thrown at him for two years. Why? To
maintain the unity of the party. Had he come down hard on one side or the
other on Europe the Tories would have smashed themselves to smithereens.
Maastricht was the best deal for Britain and party unity. Once negotiated,
no prime minister could renege on it; had Parliament rejected the
ratification bill, Mr Major would have resigned.
He has no evident fear of being asked to make way for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor and present darling of the media. To adapt the language Mr Major
himself might use, he would go into the jungle with his chancellor and not
be afraid to turn his back. The two are cricketing and football buddies.
When Mr Clarke was minister of health and under siege by nurses and doctors,
Mr Major, chief secretary to the Treasury, offered support. In any case, a
change of leader so soon after the last would be damaging for the party and
not necessarily worth it.
History may demand more. It may ask for a sense of where the Conservative
party plans to take the country. Mr Major can only reiterate known policies:
pursuit of the health reforms (going well); the education reforms (not); the
Citizen's Charter, which will make life better for ordinary people; a fresh
look at the structure of Europe; and, above all, the restoration of economic
health after a long struggle starting with his chancellorship.
Perhaps his friend Sir Norman Fowler can put the above thoughts across to
the party at next week's conference. Possibly a fighting speech, peppered
with attacks on the tightly knit group of politically motivated men and
women who are creating disunity in the party, will do the trick. References
to a tougher stance on crime may help, although Mr Major is neither a hanger
nor a flogger - nor, in reality, one for excessively punitive terms of
imprisonment. No dramatic denouement is in sight. That is not his way. How
he must envy Mr John Smith, who has enhanced his stature by a single battle
with the trade union half of his Labour party. Mr Major can only look across
the seas to New Zealand, and keep his fingers crossed.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Opportunity to redesign Design
Council must not be wasted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEREMY REWSE-DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The decision to restructure the Design Council is broadly right
('Design Council break-up decided by government', September 24). The
Chartered Society of Designers particularly welcomes the appointment as the
council's new chairman of John Sorrell, a designer and businessman with an
impressive record of promoting design.
This society, representing UK design professionals, has repeatedly called
both for the council's role to be redefined and for a new programme to
convince industrialists of the value of investing in design.
Designers will welcome the government's apparent commitment to what
Christopher Lorenz ('The Design Council on a crash diet', September 24)
describes as a 'high-powered research, evangelism and lobbying body'. But
certain questions still have to be answered if the newly reorganised Design
Council is to achieve its core objectives.
The introduction of design advice into a total of 200 Business Links will
require substantial investment. The new plans proposed by trade and industry
minister, Tim Sainsbury, with their clear potential to help a greater number
of businesses to integrate design into the mainstream of their activity, may
require an increase in government funding.
Mr Lorenz is right to highlight concerns over the transfer of essential
services from the existing council to new homes. Funding is a part of the
solution to this, but so is an ongoing process of close consultation. A
close two-way relationship between the design profession and agencies,
including Business Links, will be essential.
In particular, the work presently undertaken by the Design Council in the
field of education must not suffer during the transition. Similarly the new
structure must ensure a continuity of the much valued regional expertise
built by the council.
Until the designers this country trains are employed to design our exports,
rather than the goods we import from abroad, British competitiveness will
continue to suffer. The restructuring of the Design Council is an
opportunity that must not he wasted. Jeremy Rewse-Davies,

FT  01 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Sabena adapting to deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From E DE NIL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Contrary to your report, 'Belgium to seek air passenger quotas'
(September 27), and your leader, 'Clouds in EC open skies' (September 28),
Sabena is not seeking additional cash injection, nor fresh state aid.
Sabena has dramatically improved productivity in the past two years thanks
to a reduction in the workforce of 25 per cent, increased efficiency and
flexibility - resulting in a gain of 10 per cent in overall production - and
salary reductions for staff in Belgium of up to 17 per cent. A number of
other measures have also been taken, which, when fully implemented, will
result in savings of more than Pounds 100m.
Sabena was one of the few airlines in the world to make a profit in fiscal
year 1992-93.
Like any other airline, Sabena is having to adapt to deregulation of the
European airline industry and the price wars resulting from over capacity.
Our chairman, Mr Pierre Godfroid, has proposed to the EC's committee of
'wise men' that EC funds should be made available to the whole of the
European airline industry to enable it progressively to adapt capacity to
demand as it did for the European steel and textile industries two years
ago.
In the meantime, Sabena will continue to seek to improve its financial
position by aggressive commercial policies.

<TEXT>
Sir, I am prompted to write by Diane Summers' article, 'TV revenue shows
first sign of upturn' (September 27).
It gives the impression that newspapers lack the flexibility to respond at
short notice to advertisers' demands.
It is rare for would-be advertisers to be turned away, and indeed the
newspapers' ability to accept copy at very short notice allows advertisers
to ensure that their copy is compatible with today's news. It may even
reflect it.
This flexibility and short response time are important contributors to the
unique strength of newspapers as an advertising medium.

<TEXT>
Sir, The west's support for Boris Yeltsin's dissolution of parliament
('West's best bet' September 29) is based on the idea that this body and the
constitution were inherited from the Soviet Union.
When the disbanded parliament is replaced by a democratically elected
legislative body and a new constitution adopted, Russia can assert it has
domestically renounced the old Soviet system. Such a declaration implies a
similar repudiation externally. Russia can no longer claim a special sphere
of influence in the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. The
west should only support a consistency in Russian domestic and foreign
policy.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Arts: A little light train music - The Lille Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the government blusters and British Rail agonises over the UK link to
the Eurotunnel, the French are celebrating the arrival of the TGV, the
superfast express, to their northern shores. On Sunday the first train
reached Lille from Paris in an hour and former French prime minister Pierre
Mauroy joined Jacques Delors and any number of dignitaries at the grand
concert for the premier of a commissioned paean to the achievement, 'MGV,
Musique Grande Vitesse'.
But if the British are pathetic at rail investment, they still lead in the
arts and the gala was dominated by British creativity. MGV was composed by
Michael Nyman and the entire evening was given over to his music. The new
work shows his strengths as a writer of the classical pastiche. It should
feature regularly on Friday Night is Music Night and be none the worse for
that. A child could follow, through the music, the journey of the TGV as it
quickly moved into a regular chug. It proceeded with few stops, overcame a
nasty incline near the end, and suddenly hit the buffers at the finale.
Last week Harrison Birtwistle called for more light music, and it is an area
where Nyman, with many film scores behind him, excels. He is fond of
hammering a note, and a phrase, to minimalist depth, and this works well for
the monotony of a train journey. MGV could easily become the Eurotunnel
anthem, offending, exciting few, a reassuringly safe evocation of
bi-national co-operation
Earlier Kathryn Stott played The Piano Concerto, Nyman's music for the film
Piano Lesson. By its nature this is background music, brooding, descriptive,
but inevitably transitory in its grip. Stott stuck to it, but was given few
opportunities to sparkle.
Nyman had been commissioned by the Lille Festival, which over 20 years ago
was the first arts festival to rebel against the centralising grip of Paris.
It is now showing some muscle under director Brigitte Delannoy. Every year
there is an international scene. For 1993 it is the Orient Express (The TGV
by itself was considered too limiting). In contrast the Orient Express
traversed the continent, so the festival, which concentrates on music and
film, calls on musicians and styles from Vienna, Budapest and all the Balkan
stopping points east.
It also called on the Siobhan Davies Dance Company to perform Different
Trains, the work Davies choreographed to the music of Steve Reich. It was
re-staged for Lille, Davies having the confidence to add to the
characterisation of the dancers. It is a powerful piece with Reich's driving
minimalist score played by the Smith Quartet against the tape of a recorded
quartet and fragmentary and distorted words. The energy of the music, in
which Reich remembers trans-American train journeys of his youth and the
cattle trucks that took his relatives to Nazi concentration camps, is
matched by the rapid, agile, gestures of the dancers as they run from their
fate.
Sometimes their movements reflect the petty preoccupations of peacetime; but
the darker depths of entrapment give the work its dynamic strength. A giant
cog turns as the backdrop, reflecting the wheels of the train and the
remorseless fate. Davies' journey is a much more significant and affecting
experience than that of Nyman.
Also performed was her latest work, Wanting to Tell Stories, an elusive,
less concentrated work, but fine at relating bodies and poses and then
separating them through the screens of wire netting designed by David
Buckland. If you feel slightly cheated by the abstraction you can enjoy the
maturity of the dancers, rolling with the rhythms and still finding their
moments of ambiguous stillness.
Next year the Lille Festival takes as its theme The Promised Land, the hope
coming from the Israeli Palestine talks, although Delannoy chose the subject
before the recent breakthrough. This festival will grow in size and
influence. The local authorities are supportive with cash; a 6,000 seat
arena and a 1,000 seat music theatre are rising near the new station. The
Lille Festival grew up to entertain and stimulate the locals but, by next
September, Lille will be an hour from Paris, less than 30 minutes from
Brussels - and just two hours from London. Lille is going European and
wisely using the arts to anchor itself at the epicentre of the new market
place.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Arts: The Rape of Lucretia - fortissimo / Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The music is the main reason for celebrating the return of English National
Opera's 10-year-old Rape of Lucretia. This first of the Britten chamber
operas is nowadays one of the less often performed of his stage works, yet
it boasts one of the most ravishing and finely fashioned of all his scores.
In the Coliseum - London's largest theatre and therefore, one would once
have thought, miles too large for it - the instrumental filigree fills out
the spaces with unforced, unexaggerated radiance. A single phrase for the
harp conjures up images of Lucretia's serene domesticity (did any
theatre-composer ever re-imagine the instrument more inventively than
Britten?); the stuttering cor anglais lament after her rape achingly
uncovers thoughts and feelings temporarily too painful for verbalisation.
If, indeed, one wanted to demonstrate the mysterious power of music to make
fully-fledged drama out of inadequate verbal material, it is The Rape of
Lucretia that one might well scan for particularly pointful examples. The
artiness of Ronald Duncan's verse-libretto becomes no easier to bear with
the passing of the years. Yet, since the dramatic scheme beneath the
poetastery suggested possibilities to which Britten was responsive, the
opera becomes through its music an intensely affecting drama of adult people
and adult emotional conflict.
The music is well treated - and very well played - in this ENO revival. It
is not yet unfolded with ideal containment and reticence: on Wednesday the
conductor, David Parry, seemed too intent on urging drama, force of
statement, maximum volume from all his performers, and insufficiently
trustful of the score's innate carrying power. The performance was certainly
kept moving; there was no slacking of the reins. But there is a kind of
expressive delicacy that one recalls from Lucretia performances long past,
and which - to its slight detriment - this one lacked.
Vocally likewise: while the current ENO cast contains voices of genuine
'operatic' amplitude and authority, much more so than the English Opera
Group used to have at its disposal, the use of those voices was not always
disciplined to tapping the sense of the musical lines. Kim Begley, now a
splendid dramatic tenor in full sail, apt for Lohengrin or Siegmund in any
theatre, rang out from on high as the Male Chorus; mutatis mutandis, the
same qualities could be admired in Rita Cullis's Female Chorus.
Understatement was not an option chosen by either singer; nuance was
missing.
The other male members of the strong cast - Peter Coleman-Wright
(Tarquinius), Paul Napier-Burrows (Junius), even Richard van Allan's
well-remembered Collatinus - also needed to draw in their vocal horns. The
other females commanded much more of the refinements on which the vocal
writing is predicated: Jean Rigby once again a direct, deeply moving
Lucretia (apparently not in best voice), Yvonne Barclay a light, pretty
Lucia, and - best of all - Catherine Wyn-Rogers a Bianca of grave, calm
steadiness of utterance.
In 1983 Graham Vick's spare production, with its wooden platform, screens,
balconied walkway and absolute frankness of statement, carried a fierce
dramatic charge; rehearsed now by Sally Day, it seemed plain but not always
dramatically potent. But the wonderful beauty of the music is never scathed
or slighted: which is grounds enough for warmly welcoming the revival.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Arts: Unique sound of the Czechs - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech Philharmonic Orchestra is on a three-concert visit to London - two
in the Barbican's 'Great Orchestras of the World' series, one in the South
Bank's Czech Festival. Wednesday's at the Barbican offered two of Dvorak's
war-horses, the Cello Concerto and the 'New World' Symphony. A neat pairing
of late works from the composer's American period, the programme picked up
two historical threads - 1993 marks the centenary of the symphony, which was
also conducted by Dvorak himself as part of the Czech Philharmonic's opening
concert in 1896.
For their authenticity alone, the orchestra's Dvorak interpretations demand
attention. But there is no resting on historical laurels: the players are
equally rich in tradition and imagination. They produce a distinctive,
indeed unique, central European sound - warm strings, vibrant winds, raspy
brass (the horns especially characterful) - that sets the band apart from
the homogenised super-orchestras of the West.
The Czech Philharmonic's conductors have been distinguished. Wednesday's
concert was to have been led by one of the notables in the line, Vaclav
Neumann, but his indisposition brought a replacement in Vladimr Valek,
principal conductor of the Czech Radio Symphony Orchestra. He was efficient,
but the concert belonged to the orchestra and, in the concerto, to the
commanding soloist.
He was Lynn Harrell, who proved himself alert to the work's rhapsodic detail
and formal structure; the performance was enriched by the obvious mutual
admiration of cellist and orchestra. Harrell dug affirmatively into the
opening statement, and thereafter provided playing by turns fervent and
lyrical. Flighty in the passage-work, he was warm of tone in the moments of
tenderness.
Valek's account of the symphony was less comfortable. He conducted
confidently, from memory, with superficial results. The scherzo sounded
restless, even improvisatory, the outer movements fiery but pushed; the
finale, especially, was brash where it should have been broad. Valek
responded best to passages of folk-like jollification - where the Dvorak of
the Slavonic Dances is evoked (we heard two of them as encores - and to the
Largo, a slow, poetic performance allowing one to revel in the orchestra's
matchless sound. There is a chance to sample more of it in the concerts
conducted by Libor Pesek (at the Barbican) and Jir Belohlavek (at the
Festival Hall) this weekend.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Arts: Drawn to Michelangelo - Susan Moore visits the Casa
Buonarroti in Florence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's museum revolution is gathering momentum. Earlier this year, the new
Minister of Culture Alberto Ronchey decreed that the country's notoriously
inhospitable state monuments, museums and galleries should be open from 9am
to 7pm. No more apologies pinned to firmly closed doors. No more closures at
two.
Over the summer in Florence, for example, some 20 museums welcomed visitors
for late evening viewing too. The city's museums have authorised an
unprecedented number of loans to London's Accademia Italiana for a Lorenzo
the Magnificent show which opens later this month. A few years ago, such a
project would have been unthinkable.
This cultural perestroika is also affecting what the public sees. Visitors
to one of Florence's least known small treasure houses, the Casa Buonarroti,
off the tourist track in via Ghibellina, will find 18 of its finest
Michelangelo drawings on show together for the first time (until October
31). Their display is a bold move in a country where museums tend to exhibit
facsimiles of drawings rather than originals.
Michelangelo never lived at the Casa Buonarroti. The present house was built
on a site he bought for his nephew and was later decorated by his
grand-nephew Michelangelo the Younger with frescoes which turned the
master's life into history. Loans and gifts supplementing the family
holdings, including works returned by the Medici, have transformed the house
into a veritable shrine.
Alongside portraits by Bugiardini and Daniele da Volterra is the most recent
addition to the Michelangelo iconography: a marble group of the young
Michelangelo sculpting the famous head of a faun by one Cesare Zocchi
(1851-1922). It seems a fearless act of homage seen beside Michelangelo's
technically daring low-relief 'Madonna of the Steps' and the tumult of
intertwined figures in the 'Battle of the Centaurs'.
The greatest glories of the drawings collection have long since gone,
dispersed by the family and now largely divided between the British Museum
and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. What remains, as represented here, is a
fascinating group that reveals a great deal about the artist's range,
working practice and ever astonishing inventiveness.
We find figures studies and compositional sketches in pen and ink, black
chalk and red chalk, plans and elevations of churches and schemes for city
fortifications. There are vigorous working drawings precise enough to be
used by craftsmen, alongside extraordinary flights of imagination. A few
swift strokes of the pen on a letter to a friend describe how he painted the
Sistine ceiling.
Many of the drawings reveal Michelangelo's obsessive desire not to waste
paper, even though paper was no longer a luxury commodity. One particularly
beautiful early figure drawing, after a figure of Hercules on an antique
sarcophagus relief, was kept for some 20 years before being folded in four
and its verso re-used for jotting down expenses. The list includes the cost
of a pair of slippers for his nephew and heir Leonardo.
It is typical of Michelangelo's genius as well as his frugality that his
sketch for the elevation of San Lorenzo should be only some 10cm wide and
free-drawn in soft red chalk with little concern for accuracies of scale or
proportion. Other sheets here show him trying out various schemes for the
great staircase in the vestibule of the Laurentian Library and designing the
desk and benches for the reading room inside. On a drawing for the base of a
pilaster in the New Sacristy, he cannot resist adding an eye and a few extra
touches to turn the elaborate moulding into a profile of a gaping-mouthed
human head.
Most remarkable is a design for the monumental Porta Pia in Rome, the city
gate commissioned by Pope Pius IV and still immortalising his name. In this
much altered pen and wash drawing, heightened with white bodycolour,
Michelangelo has given his design a sculptural richness never previously
seen in architectural drawing.
In pride of place in the collection is one of the so-called 'presentation'
drawings. These exquisite chalk drawings were conceived as works of art in
their own right and given to his closest friends. This idealised head of
Cleopatra was presented to the Roman nobleman Tomasso dei Cavalieri. Its
recently uncovered verso presents an altogether more convincing image of the
queen post asp, wide-eyed and screaming.
Tomasso was obliged to surrender the drawing to Duke Cosimo de' Medici. In a
letter lamenting its departure, he said that it was like losing one of his
own children.

For decades, the Lancaster look has dominated country house interiors, so
whatever you feel about gardening, it might be a pity to miss tonight's
programme in the series, An Englishwoman's Garden (BBC 2, 8.30). Nancy
Lancaster, aged 95, created a lovely garden just off the M40 outside Oxford.
Including her in this hotchpotch series was obviously a temptation even
though Lancaster was born in the US. However, she is still better known for
her influence on the British concept in the postwar era of what makes for
impeccable good taste .
East: South Africa, An Indian Experience (BBC 2, 8.00) is the second of two
interesting programmes about the Indian community in South Africa. There are
roughly one million Indians in the country, and many of them feel that with
the coming of black majority rule they are likely to find themselves sitting
ducks.
Otherwise, it is a dismal enough Friday night's viewing except for the
gentle nudge of nostalgia which That Was the Week That Was (BBC2, 11.15)
gives to viewers of the right vintage.

European and American executives are used to looking around nervously to see
what their Japanese rivals are up to, but they do not usually regard modesty
as a prime characteristic of the competition.
Yet the fact that Japanese companies tend to underestimate their prowess in
bringing innovative products to the market first is a factor in their
success, according to the Boston Consulting Group.
'Japanese companies in general are faster (than those in the US or Europe)
but are also more self-critical about being slow.'
After studying 600 companies, it found that among those with turnover
exceeding Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m), Japanese corporations needed an average
of 19.1 months to develop a new product against 22.6 in the US and 23.4 in
Europe. Below this turnover level, Japanese companies needed 14 months
compared with 16 in the US and Europe.
Hans Seifert, a Munich-based partner of BCG, believes Japanese and other
southeast Asian companies will increase their strength in world markets,
citing trends in the printing sector - where German companies have
traditionally been strong - and in vehicles. 'The danger for Europeans and
Americans lies less in the technological potential of Asian competitors than
in their own complacency.'
BCG identifies three crucial areas which determine success in being first
with new products: simultaneous engineering, with full co-operation and
communication early in the development process; early prototyping so
opportunities and problems (in components as well as the full product) can
be spotted quickly; and a low ratio of design engineers to people in other
important functions like marketing, manufacturing and purchasing.
None of these depends on fancy new theories. 'These techniques have less to
do with restructuring or training and more to do with managing and doing,'
notes BCG. It is also vital that project teams have adequate power of
decision, insists Seifert. Top management should restrict itself to guidance
and advice and stay out of the detail.

Scientific breakthroughs are frequently represented by a flash of lightning.
Now researchers at Nasa, the US national Aeronautics and Space
Administration, in Washington DC, has discovered flashes of lightning which
are in themselves a scientific breakthrough.
They have recorded for the first time huge flashes of light - some 25 miles
long - in the upper atmosphere above a severe thunderstorm. The flashes are
as yet unexplained, but could be an electrical discharge, in which case they
could present potential problems for high-altitude aeroplanes. Nasa: US, 202

<TEXT>
A range of tests traditionally used to determine the toxicity of chemicals
has now been applied by UK chemists Boots to determine the mildness of its
latest babycare range.
Working with chemists at Nottingham University, Boots has used in vitro
(test-tube) testing of both the components and the final products. Included
in the six tests, for example, is a fluoroscein leakage test, in which
living cells are used as a barrier to prevent a dye leaking through a grid.
By measuring the extent of the leakage once the product is added, scientists
can test the damaging potential of the product. The bath products, shampoo,
lotion, nappy cream and baby wipes were measured for their damaging effect
on the skin and the recovery rate of the skin after use. Boots: 0602 418522.

<TEXT>
An electronic device which can detect black ice, and warn drivers of icy
patches before accidents occur, has been developed in France, by Metera of
Sille-le-Guillaume.
The battery-powered logging device is positioned at the side of the road at
notorious black spots. There it measures the temperature of the air and road
surface and the humidity. It calculates whether the road surface is
dangerous including such factors as the exposure of the site, tree cover and
winds.
The Emac 90 logging system communicates the information to the relevant
authorities automatically using a phone line. Alternatively, a road sign can
be illuminated to warn drivers. Metera: France, 43 20 87 10.

As Christmas approaches many retailers will want to install more tills to
help increase sales. The problem is that most point-of-sale equipment needs
a phone line to send purchase data back to the store's computer.
Tec, part of the Toshiba group, has overcome the obstacle with a range of
tills which transmits the information over a radio link. In the UK the
equipment uses the frequency allocated for cordless local area networks in
offices, at 2.46 GigHz. Tec believes the system will give retailers greater

FT  01 OCT 93 / Technology: On a mission to divide and rule - Paul Abrahams
explains the motives behind Glaxo's R&amp;D shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs company, is also one of the world's most
innovative. By any standard its research and development labs have in recent
decades developed a series of remarkably successful compounds.
These include Zantac, the world's best-selling medicine, which last
financial year generated revenues of more than Pounds 2.1bn. More recently,
the company has launched a series of ground-breaking molecules such as
Imigran, the migraine drug, and Zofran, an anti-nausea treatment.
Given Glaxo's R&amp;D record, last week's announcement that it is to reorganise
the top of its R&amp;D organisation will be scrutinised by groups trying to
emulate its success.
The reorganisation involves splitting the position of R&amp;D director and
appointing Sir Mark Richmond, chairman of the Science and Engineering
Research Council, as director of research. Goran Ando, the Swedish executive
recently appointed R&amp;D director, becomes director of group development and
product strategy.
Richard Sykes, Glaxo's chief executive who was elevated from the position as
R&amp;D director in March, insists the changes are not merely a result of his
promotion.
'Our mission is to create, discover, develop, manufacture and sell
prescription medicines. We are 100 per cent committed to prescription drugs.
We are not in the business of over-the-counter medicines, distilled water or
ice cream.'
Sykes insists that if Glaxo is to be successful in prescription drugs, it
must develop treatments that are safe and effective and offer added value.
'There's little point developing medicines that have little added value,' he
explains.
Glaxo plans to move into untapped markets not yet satisfied.
'The future success of this company in 10 to 20 years' time will be
dependent upon developing innovative medicines,' says Sykes.
Innovative drugs will emerge from a science base undergoing enormous change,
according to Sykes. 'We are witnessing a paradigm shift in biological
science. First, we are increasingly understanding the genetic basis of
disease. Every week, 3,000 genes are being identified. And second we know
more and more about microbiology - the process of the life and death of the
cell.'
By understanding the physiology of diseases, scientists will be able to
identify target sites for drugs more easily. This offers the potential to
develop more effective agents and treat chronic illnesses not well treated
at the moment, he explains.
'You have to harness these new technologies. Having access to them is really
critical for the future of the company and you need very good people to do
it,' says Sykes.
'We will have to have a lot of help from the outside. We have 1,500 people
involved in research internally, but that is not enough because of the rapid
expansion in knowledge base. Most advances are happening in academia and the
biotechnology industry, so it's critical to have strong ties.
'In the future, drugs will not come out of the pharmaceuticals industry.
They will come from research boutiques working on important targets.'
Glaxo has formal links with eight to 10 biotechnology groups. The company
also gives money to about 70 per cent of the UK's universities.
'In the past, we have had a traditional R&amp;D organisation. We now need to
change the structure to harness and implement the new technologies. It is
increasingly difficult for one man to oversee research and development. That
is why Glaxo decided to split the functions,' he explains.
As for Sir Mark, Sykes says he has exceptional scientific skills from his
experience of molecular genetics at Edinburgh University and microbial
biology at Bristol University. He has also developed organisational
abilities from running Serc and being vice-chancellor of Manchester
University. Sykes believes his period at Serc has placed him at the cutting
edge of science on an international basis.
He says Sir Mark's contacts in the scientific community will help him
recruit top talent for Glaxo's new Pounds 700m research complex at Stevenage
due to open in 1995. The company will hire a number of additional scientists
when the Greenford and Ware operations transfer to Stevenage.
Sykes says another reason for splitting research from development was the
huge difference in their objectives. 'In research you can't see where you
are going. There are lots of different avenues to explore. For development,
you know exactly where you are going. It's just there are a series of
regulatory hurdles in the way that you have to negotiate. Conceptually
they're very different and you need very different sorts of people to run
the two operations.'
The development process remains highly critical, insists Sykes. More than 75
per cent of R&amp;D expenditure goes on development, and 25 per cent on
research. Glaxo has one of the best development records in the industry, and
has set the gold standard for time taken to negotiate regulatory hurdles to
new drugs.
'The safety, efficacy and value data provide the platform for the marketing.
There have to be close links between the product strategy and development
process. That forms the rationale for Ando's appointment,' says Sykes.
Ando will be responsible for pre-clinical development, clinical development,
relationship with the regulators, product strategy, information technology,
management services and licensing. He will also liaise with the powerful
operating companies in Glaxo which explain development requirements of
national markets.
Sykes believes his reorganisation will help ensure the group's
pharmaceuticals R&amp;D investment - the largest in the world set at Pounds 850m
for 1994 - is well spent.

FT  01 OCT 93 / People: Spencer - trial run for academe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the UK's best regarded economic commentators is moving to the
academic world in a move which may set a new trend for City analysts who
feel like a quieter life.
After eight years in the City, Peter Spencer is taking over as professor of
monetary economics at Strathclyde University for an initial two-year period.
He will continue to work roughly a day a week at the Kleinwort Benson
investment bank, where he has been chief economist since 1991 in charge of
an eight-strong team. Spencer, 43, worked as an economist at Lehman Brothers
and CS First Boston after entering the City in 1985, just before Big Bang,
from a 13-year career at the Treasury.
Spencer explains that the move, which will involve a 'large' drop in salary,
is part of a long-term plan to give himself more time for serious economic
research as opposed to serving up the kind of off-the-cuff comments on
economics which City analysts are renowned for. 'I've never been quite sure
if I am an academic or a City commentator and now I am trying to be a bit of
both,' he says.
Spencer admits he will not miss the high-pressure City environment in which
clients and traders are increasingly quick to spot errors of judgment made
by economists. He himself suffered last year in the aftermath of Britain's
exit from the ERM because he had been one of the relatively few City
commentators arguing right up to the event that sterling would not drop out
of its fluctuation bands.
Among Spencer's achievements has been his contributions to research on the
'divisia' measure of monetary growth - a field which some believe could
provide a new way of monitoring economic fluctuations. In readiness for the
move to academe, Spencer and his family have been saving a lot of his City
salary rather than spending it, so he reckons the job switch will not be too
financially onerous.

Heidi Hutter has been appointed by Lloyd's of London as project director to
deal with the problems of outstanding liabilities on syndicates from past
underwriting years.
She will work on the creation of NewCo, the company to be established by the
start of 1996 to reinsure all liabilities up to 1986.
She will also lead a team working to develop a common method to calculate
the reserves necessary on the insurance exposures of syndicates in 'old
years', to deal with claims against asbestos, pollution and other risks.
This will help determine the reinsurance terms to be handled by NewCo for
the old syndicates after the end of the 1993 underwriting year.
Lloyd's decided recently that it would in the short term appoint a project
director to prepare for the creation of NewCo, and defer a decision on the
appointment of its managing director until nearer the time that it will
begin to operate.
Hutter, 35, gained a degree in maths at Cornell University, New York, joined
North American Reinsurance Corporation and moved to the Atrium Corporation
within Swiss Re in 1983. She has been vice president responsible for
underwriting of the European International Reinsurance Company since 1987.

<TEXT>
Cellnet, the UK's second largest cellular operator, is about to get a new
director now that Stafford Taylor is to be promoted to be BT's director of
personal communications.
Cellnet, a joint venture between BT and Securicor, lags behind Vodafone in
subscri-bers and profits. But Taylor, managing director since 1989, has
emerged with plaudits, given the constraints imposed on Cellnet by BT.
Cellnet's successful pioneering of low user tariffs last year is
particularly credited to him.
The appointment of a new director - to be announced - will be watched
closely for what it says about the priority BT chairman Iain Vallance gives
to BT's sole cellular operation. After AT&amp;T's purchase of McCaw, Cellnet's
low profile in the BT empire looks increasingly misplaced.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Management: Going it alone - Dominique Damon, the only
female executive director of a large Swiss company, talks to Ian Rodger /
Euromanagers to watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than a few Swiss eyebrows were raised when Dominique Damon joined
Alusuisse, the venerable aluminium and chemicals group, in 1988 to head its
nascent packaging division. The commanding heights of the big Swiss
companies have been notoriously closed to women and foreigners, and Damon,
who comes from Paris, is both.
Even today, she is the only woman executive director of a large Swiss
company. But if the eyebrows are still raised, it is for entirely different
reasons.
In seven years, she has pulled together a motley group of packaging
operations spread around Alusuisse, bought eight complementary companies in
Europe and the US and shaped them into a sparkling global performer.
Sales of the packaging division have jumped from SFr744m (Pounds 339.7m) in
1988 to SFr1.4bn last year, and it contributes more than a third of group
profit.
Alusuisse had been struggling for years to diversify from its historical
dependence on commodity aluminium products and so its appreciation of her
abilities is far from surprising.
Early this year, she was given responsibility for the group's industry and
transport equipment division, and has just been named deputy chief
executive.
There is a stereotype of the high-powered French female executive -
stylishly dressed, immaculately groomed, confident in carriage, dazzlingly
clever, tough, sexy.
Damon is different. She dresses simply and conservatively, wears no make-up
and does not try to hide her 46 years or her greying hair.
She speaks and moves softly, listens attentively and has a charming,
self-deprecating sense of humour. Only gradually do the sharp intellect and
iron will emerge.
She is, above all, a professional manager. She studied management in
university, and went straight to BSN, the French flat glass and food group,
after receiving a doctorate in experimental psychology in 1970.
At BSN she first worked in industrial relations and employee training in the
Boussois glass division for five years. She then switched to the food
division, just as it was acquiring the Gervais business.
As director of administration, she was responsible for the massive internal
reorganisation that followed.
In 1985, she moved to Carnaud to become chief executive of its FFr2bn
(annual sales) plastic packaging business, and was wooed away to Alusuisse
three years later.
She says she had no second thoughts about joining the Swiss group, having
been ignorant of Swiss business culture. 'I had always been in very
international groups, and here as well the management seemed very
international, not necessarily by nationality but by attitude. It was only
afterwards that I realised that perhaps Alusuisse was exceptional among
Swiss companies.'
She says she immediately felt comfortable with the management style of the
Alusuisse executive committee, which emphasised flexibility, teamwork and
motivating employees to participate in defining and achieving strategic
goals.
She recoils from defining her strengths as a manager. 'I like to avoid
labels,' but says she feels most strongly about motivating employees to take
a team approach to clients.
Significantly, in all the companies in which she has worked, the clients
have been highly sophisticated.
Whether trying to convince Renault to buy more BSN glass, Hypermarche to buy
more Danone yoghurt, or General Foods to use Alusuisse packaging for its pet
foods, the sell has always been a complex, technical one. Increasingly, the
supplier has to co-operate closely with the client in developing a product.
'It is not a question of sending along a salesman. All our managers must
have a relationship with the client, and we have to work as a team,' she
says.
She sees her own role as chief motivator. She travels constantly, visiting
her operating units, finding out what is going on, making sure they are
meeting their goals.
'If you don't know what people are thinking, you can go seriously wrong. And
the only way I can find out is to listen to them. Perhaps I do not have
sufficient imagination to figure things out for myself.'
She has also been careful to install a rigorous financial reporting system
at the packaging division's new home base in Paris. Each operating company
has clear goals, and is monitored by the week by one of her team of 12
central executives.
Her own interventions are less systematic. 'If a company is going well, it
may see me three times a year if it is going badly, it will see me every
month.'
So far, her system works admirably well. She claims that none of her
subsidiaries is in trouble at the moment, and she takes particular pride
that the executive teams of all the businesses she has acquired remain
largely intact.
Damon dislikes the term workaholic, but admits she makes sure there is a
telephone and fax available when she goes on holiday. 'I would find it hard
to break communications, because it would be so difficult to catch up when I
got back. And at this level of responsibility, I do not believe I should cut
myself off.'
Although she would not seem to have much time for family life, she is
obviously proud of her similarly over-achieving teenage daughter. Echoing
Hillary Clinton, she observes, 'perhaps she missed something by not having
me at home baking cakes, but I don't think so. And she has seen a lot of the
world.'
Where Damon goes from here is anyone's guess. She claims not to be
concerned.
'I have no need to think ahead 10 years. I have sufficient challenge and
satisfaction where I am.'
Would she want to work in a bigger company? 'I do not think the size of a
company is necessarily directly related to the complexity of managing it.'
Would she expect to become chief executive of Alusuisse? 'Everyone asks me
that. It is not my problem. It is not an important issue.
'I am very comfortable working in this team.'

FT  01 OCT 93 / Management: What it takes to be a regulator / A look at the
skills would-be industry watchdogs should have on their CVs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few months ago Clare Spottiswoode decided it was time she got a proper
job. This 40-year-old mother of four had had enough of juggling five
part-time jobs, and phoned up Saxon Bampfylde, a headhunting firm, to see
what it could do for her.
Her CV showed that she was an ex-Treasury economist and an entrepreneur who
had set up two businesses, one importing cotton and silk gifts, the other in
computer software.
The headhunter, which had just been asked by the government to find a
replacement for the combative Ofgas director-general Sir James McKinnon,
mentioned the job to her. 'Even if I had known the job was on offer, I never
would have applied. But when they told me about it I felt I was well suited.
I have a logical economist's background, and I've been at the sharp end of
business.'
Spottiswoode thought nothing about entering the macho gas businesses; she
survived as one of the first women at Clare College Cambridge, and says she
has been 'in a very male world all through'.
So she applied, and the rest, as they say, is history.
To outsiders, hers might seem an unlikely background for becoming regulator
of the monolithic gas industry. But it is no less likely than the
backgrounds of most of the individuals who regulate Britain's other
utilities.
Sir James, an accountant who was finance director at Imperial Group, also
knew very little about gas and regulation when he started. Equally obscure
were Don Cruickshank's qualifications for regulating the telecoms industry:
he was chief executive of the NHS in Scotland, and before that managing
director of Richard Branson's Virgin Group. Professor Stephen Littlechild
knew a great deal about monopolies when he was hired at Offer - the
electricity regulator - but he lacked much direct experience of the business
world.
There is no degree in regulating, nor any specific training for it. Yet the
job of regulator is one of the most difficult challenges in British
industry. What does it take to make a good one?
According to Sir James, the answer is more straightforward than it is often
cracked up to be. 'A good regulator does what he or she is told. It is as
simple as that. A regulator is given a number of tasks to do, there are
clear sets of rules in the legislation.'
He reckons that the only real requirement is that a regulator should have a
background in business, and must have experienced change.
His own 'basic business training', he says, was vital in helping him
understand the dynamics of competition.
Being able to deal with the media is also vital, he says. 'As regulator you
have no funds to put your message across. Unlike British Gas, I didn't have
Pounds 10m-Pounds 20m to spend on advertising.' Good relations with the
media are a matter of 'telling the truth and saying the same thing to
everyone'.
Sir James also believes that regulators should not take themselves too
seriously. 'If the Sun says you are 'as precious as a Ming Vase' or that you
have great control over the destiny of 18m people, you have to be careful or
you start to believe it. You need to keep your feet right on the ground. I
don't see myself as any different from anyone else.'
According to Saxon Bampfylde, which has been involved in the appointment of
most of the UK regulators over the past four years, the necessary qualities
are more complicated than Sir James makes out. According to the firm's
Douglas Board the most important is real live experience of competitive
markets.
'In all cases we have been looking for a very good player to become
referee,' he says. The problem is that people running big companies may not
fancy the idea of running an organisation with between 20 and 200 people,
especially when the salary is a fraction of what they might get in the
private sector. Sir James says he earns Pounds 73,000, while Cruickshank's
job - which took eight months to fill - was initially advertised at Pounds
90,000.
The second attribute is a powerful intellect. Board argues that regulating a
complex utility presents a larger intellectual challenge than that facing
most chief executives, who spend most of their time motivating and
implementing.
Good communication skills are essential, as well as a fair approach. A
suitable candidate would be prepared for a slightly lonely job; even though
they spend the whole day talking to interested parties, decisions are
generally taken on their own.
Regulators must also be good mangers of their own staff. 'About 50 per cent
of what determines whether the regulator is good is how he or she sets up an
office in terms of staffing, information, use of consultants and so on,'
says Board.
They need to be brave, and prepared to be unpopular. Board says that in
selecting the right person he looks for 'evidence of having done fearless
things, rather than just being able to talk fearlessly'.
They also need to take a long-term view.
Most of the decisions made by regulators will not start having any effect
within their term of office. This means there can be no quick judgments to
be made on which regulators are doing a good job.
Sir James takes away with him the satisfaction of having helped some
consumers get a better deal. Yet he says that this has been by no means the
biggest challenge of his career. Compared with the task of attempting to
turn around the Howard Johnson hotel chain in North America, it was a piece
of cake.

FT  01 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Blair pledges 'crusade' against
crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CRUSADE to free people from the fear of crime was promised by Mr Tony
Blair, shadow home secretary, in a determined attempt to establish Labour as
'the party of law and order' in Britain.
Mr Blair coupled a fierce condemnation of the failure of government policies
with a pledge that Labour would be 'tough on crime, and tough on the causes
of crime'.
He also attacked government proposals for replacing elected members of
police authorities with ministerial nominees, and the apparent intention to
amalgamate some of the smaller constabularies.
The next Labour government will introduce a wide-ranging package of
constitutional reforms, Mr Blair said.
He promised a freedom of information act, tighter control of donations to
political parties, abolition of the House of Lords, and the adoption of the
European Convention on Human Rights.
He also said Labour would establish Scottish and Welsh parliaments,
introduce proportional representation for the European parliament and hold a
referendum on the voting system for the House of Commons
'What we propose is a revolution in democratic accountability and control to
redistribute power from the government to the people,' Mr Blair said.

FT  01 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Party braced for Trident
setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTY officials last night sought to play down the impact of an expected
reversal for the Labour leadership when the votes after yesterday's defence
debate are counted today.
Delegates are thought to have defied the National Executive Committee in
approving a motion which demands the immediate cancellation of the Trident
nuclear weapons programme. It had the backing of several trades unions,
including the TGWU general union, and Usdaw, the shopworkers' union.
The leadership is also braced for defeat on another motion, calling for
defence spending to be cut to the 'average level of other European
countries'.
Mr John Smith's aides emphasised that the conference had already
overwhelmingly passed two motions in line with party policy, so the
decisions to be announced today would not matter.
A largely muted debate came to life with a speech from Mr Tony Benn, the
veteran Labour figure who was voted off the NEC earlier this week.
Mr Benn called for a massive transfer of resources 'from military waste to
the means of life', and ended with a warning that socialism was the only
alternative to barbarism.
Delegates supporting the motion on Trident argued that the savings from
cancelling the programme could be ploughed back into public services.
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said that cuts in the defence
industry could not be left to the market alone, and underlined Labour's
commitment to a defence diversification agency as a way of transfering
skills.

FT  01 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Cook attacks City
'short-termism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robin Cook, the shadow trade secretary, yesterday launched an attack on
the City for 'short-termism' and 'its obsession on growth through
acquisition'. He called instead for a long-term policy of investment in
industry.
He said business practice needed to be overhauled to reverse the UK's
decline in manufacturing industry.
Hostile takeovers were singled out for particular criticism, although the
number of mergers and acquisitions has fallen significantly over the past
year.
He said: 'As things stand a predator can go ahead with a takeover unless it
is against the public interest. We want to turn that around and say unless
the predator can demonstrate public interest it should not go ahead.'
Labour's plans to develop a longer-term approach to investment were recently
set out in the party's paper on industrial strategy, Making Britain's
Future.
While Mr Cook underlined the emphasis in the paper on allowing and
encouraging change rather than legislating to enforce it he said he was now
convinced that Labour may have to establish new institutions to help
implement its policy.
He suggested that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission should look into the
banks' internal operations as well as considering whether there should only
be four big clearers.
Apart from the what he called the banks 'misjudged' investment in property,
he wants them to be less risk-averse and more willing to lend to innovators.
'There maybe should be more of a role for the state as guarantor of loans to
small businesses.'
Labour also wants to encourage pension funds and building societies to
channel personal savings into industry.
Mr Alistair Darling, a Labour trade spokesman, said the Cadbury report on
corporate governance would not work unless backed by statute.
Companies must disclose the aggregate of all directors' pay, and the total
pay of the chairman and of the highest-paid director when different.
The code requires them to separate out the level of bonus in total
directors' pay and in that of the chairman or highest paid director.
Although the code is voluntary, many of Britain's 100 largest companies meet
the code of best practice on disclosure of directors' pay. Mr Darling said
it was essential that all companies complied with the code.
He added that self-regulation in the City had been a 'monumental failure',
citing Lloyd's of London and the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
'The days of gentlemenly agreements in supervising the banks are over. It's
no good how many times a governor of the Bank of England raises his
eyebrows, if you are dealing with people who want to take you for a ride
they will.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR will fight next year's elections to the European parliament on a
platform of support for economic integration and fixed exchange rates,
conference decided yesterday.
Delegates gave overwhelming support to a National Executive Committee policy
statement reaffirming Labour's faith in 'a co-ordinated strategy for
Europe-wide economic recovery.'
The statement confirms Labour's support for the exchange rate mechanism of
the European Monetary System, in spite of the collapse of the system earlier
this year.
It says that British re-entry 'will clearly require the adoption of policies
designed to strengthen our weakened industrial capacity and revive our
depressed economy'.
However, the statement does not set out a timetable for a British re-entry,
which the government has ruled out for the duration of the present
parliament.
The statement was strongly opposed by the leftwing Campaign group, which
described it as a capitulation to the 'strait-jacket of Euro-monetarism'.
Mr Tony Benn, MP for Chesterfield, dismissed the statement as 'the most
Euro-federalist document ever produced' by the Labour party.
The shadow cabinet said the statement would provide the basis for a Labour
landslide in the European elections in June.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said the election offered 'an
excellent opportunity to take a crucial step towards getting the Tories
out'.

FT  01 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Beckett seeks to secure her job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS MARGARET Beckett insisted yesterday that her position as Labour's deputy
leader was secure, in spite of rising speculation that her failure to give
Mr John Smith whole-hearted support over the reform of Labour's union links
had put her post at risk.
Shadow cabinet colleagues - including Mr John Prescott who is now seen as
the frontrunner for deputy leader should he want the post - publicly
expressed support for her and paid tribute to her behind-the-scenes work.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury and a newly
elected member of Labour's ruling National Executive, said reports that Mrs
Beckett had equivocated had been 'blown up out of all proportion'.
In private, however, many senior figures were sharply critical of her lack
of enthusiasm for reforming the union role in candidate selection, and said
that her strongest card was that there was no desire within the party for an
internal election.
Friends of Mr Prescott yesterday said that he should be rewarded for his
effective and bravura performance in Thursday's debate on union links with a
senior economic position. A transfer from the transport to the employment
portfolio was seen as the most likely move.
The manoeuvrings in advance of the shadow cabinet elections took some of the
gloss off Mr Smith's narrow but decisive victory on the role of the unions.
The speculation has also intensified the pressure on Mrs Beckett to produce
an effective performance when she speaks to the conference today on party
campaigns.
In a series of media interviews yesterday Mrs Beckett said that her position
was safe and that although she agreed Mr Prescott would be a 'superb' deputy
leader, 'I'm afraid I do think that I'd be a better one'.
She said she did not accept that she gave 'only qualified support' to Mr
Smith.
'It is nonsense for people to try to pretend there are some differences
between me and John or that it has caused problems for us and the party,'
she said.
Her comments, however, failed to put an end to discussion about her
continued future at a senior level. Some colleagues said that her task is
now to ensure that if anyone outside the shadow cabinet - such as Mr Bryan
Gould - sought to mount a challenge, he would not achieve support to force a
contest.
The prospects of a reshuffle after the shadow cabinet elections later this
month has prompted some frontbenchers to talk about a move from education
for Mrs Ann Taylor, whom many colleagues think is ineffective in the job.

FT  01 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Rehabilitation of the conquered
hero - Philip Stephens interviews Neil Kinnock as the union reforms he began
finally became a reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PRESCOTT was the public hero of this week's Brighton conference. But
as Mr John Smith savoured his victory on internal party democracy the
private plaudits were going to Mr Neil Kinnock.
After a week of relentless campaigning in favour of one-member-one-vote, Mr
Kinnock could draw almost as much satisfaction as his successor from the
defeat of the union barons. He, after all, started the process of loosening
the unions' institutional grip on the Labour party which culminated in this
week's vote.
Interviewed in Brighton's Grand Hotel, the former Labour leader said that
the vote had represented 'a contest over democracy' in the party. He added:
'The contest was won by the leadership. As a result the party is now more
democratic and self-disciplined than a week ago. That sends a good positive
message.'
The modern tradition of the Conservative party is that former leaders spend
their retirement vilifying their successors. It is no accident that Mr John
Major's Blackpool conference next week will be darkened by the long shadow
of Lady Thatcher. Sir Edward Heath did exactly the same for her.
Labour, in many ways an altogether rougher party, has a surprisingly
honourable tradition. Lord Wilson did nothing to undermine Lord Callaghan
who in turn declined to join the widespread sniping at Mr Michael Foot. Mr
Kinnock is following in their footsteps. He spent the days before
Wednesday's vote touring union delegations and conference fringe meetings to
drum up support for one-member-one-vote.
When the vote was won he offered generous tributes to his successor's
determination. A delighted Mr Smith responded by saying that he had learnt
how to lead from the front by following the example shown by Mr Kinnock when
he confronted Militant at the party's conference in 1985.
The gloom which enveloped Mr Kinnock after last year's general election
defeat appears to have been replaced by an inner calm. Friends say that
inevitably he still looks back in anguish to what might have been. He no
longer lets it show.
Asked about his own political future after his re-election this week to
Labour's National Executive Committee, he said if Mr Smith made it to 10
Downing Street it would be 'great' to get a telephone call asking him to
serve in a Labour cabinet. But he dismissed the speculation in Brighton that
he is campaigning actively for a return to the political top table: 'I can't
gear my life to sitting around and waiting for a call.'
He is following up the recent television series on his leadership with a BBC
documentary on the future of socialism and is looking at other possibilities
that do not conflict with his 'main job' of representing his Islwyn
constituency.
Mr Kinnock is concerned, however, that the long march to turn Labour into a
party of government on which he set off in the 1980s should not be halted
now. The end of the constitutional wrangle, he says, should give the party
the 'chance to settle down and concentrate on developing its policies'. But
that must not erode its new-found willingness 'to renew and reinvigorate
those policies which are no longer applicable'.
He added: 'We have to plan for the future, make a candid appraisal of our
policies. There is a difficulty sometimes in taking down the 'Do not disturb
signs'.'
He is quietly scathing about those in unions who combine public outrage
about the government's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement with the suggestion
that Labour should add Pounds 15bn to boost the level of investment. It
might sound exciting, but in reality it was 'immature and unrealistic'.
Instead Labour should concentrate on a handful of inter-related themes in
its policymaking: economic efficiency, mutuality or social cohesion and
democracy. A stronger economy would provide the opportunity for fairer
distribution of wealth. Constitutional change would buttress individual
rights and responsibilities.
He is convinced that if Labour proves that it is reasonable, and interested
in value and efficiency, the party has the chance to catch the national
mood. 'We can argue the case with confidence for better (public) services.
It goes with the grain. People want decent standards, more security.'
Mr Kinnock lost two general elections. He is determined Mr Smith should win
the next one.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR government should take action to bring the funding of political
parties out into the open, party supporters were told today.
Delegates debated a motion calling for a ban on all donations from foreign
nationals, and urging the recording of all donations above a minimum level
and the compulsory publication of independently audited accounts for
parties' income and expenditure.
Mr Andy Prodger of the National Communications Union said: 'It should not be
possible for company directors to hide their Tory handouts from their
shareholders and from their customers.
'All company donations should be subject to a vote by their shareholders,'
he said.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Glasgow wins fight for 700 MoD jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW has finally won the battle for the Ministry of Defence's new
personnel centre, which will bring the city up to 700 jobs.
It appeared several times that a guarantee to base the centre in the city
might be snatched away after it was announced in January that Glasgow was
the recommended site for the unified personnel centre to handle all Army pay
and pensions.
The proposal was to bring together a number of smaller offices around
Britain and create 700 jobs in Glasgow while safeguarding 400 existing jobs.
But then Stockport, Greater Manchester, entered a bid proposing a suitable
building which would cost Pounds 4m against Pounds 20m for one in Glasgow.
The decision to look seriously at the Stockport proposal angered Mr Ian
Lang, Scottish secretary, particularly as Rosyth lost the Pounds 5.5bn
Trident submarine refitting contract to Devonport.
After looking again in Glasgow, a cheaper, existing building at Kentigern
was proposed and consultations started.
But in July the MoD was inundated with a stream of representations and
intense lobbying from MPs proposing alternative sites around the country.
However ministers preferred the Kentigern proposal and the other
representations did not change their minds.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Shopping centre hit by Boots pullout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSAL to build an Pounds 85m out-of-town shopping centre near Chester
received a setback this week after Boots, the chemist group, pulled out of
the scheme, Vanessa Houlder writes.
Boots Properties, the group's investment and development subsidiary, became
involved in the Cheshire Oaks scheme in February when the Church
Commissioners, who own the site, selected it as a development partner.
They withdrew after failing to secure a principal tenant for the scheme on
terms that were acceptable to the commissioners. 'Given our assessment of
future returns, we could not make the deal work for all three parties,'
Boots said.
The withdrawal of Boots casts doubt on the viability of the 463,000 sq ft
scheme five miles north of Chester. It is planned to occupy 65 acres on a
230-acre development site.
Boots said it would focus its energies on other developments. It is involved
in a number of retail development schemes including new shopping centres in
Harrow, north-west London; Hastings, East Sussex; and Caerphilly, Mid
Glamorgan.
Occupancy rates for new shopping centres across the UK have risen from 67
per cent to 75 per cent in the last year, according to a survey by DTZ
Debenham Thorpe, property advisers.

FT  01 OCT 93 / US parts maker chooses Salford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OMEGA Engineering, the Connecticut-based manufacturer of components that
measure and control temperature, pressure, flow and humidity, is to set up
its European headquarters in Salford, on the site of the Irlam steelworks by
the Manchester Ship Canal.
About 500 jobs will be created over 10 years, more than 300 of them by the
mid-1990s.
Trafford Park Development Corporation, the government agency which markets
the site, is putting Pounds 3m of public money into the Pounds 25m project.
It won the investment against intense competition from Germany, France,
Italy and other parts of Britain.
The site, which was derelict six years ago, already houses three US
companies - Perkins, the diesel-engine company; Caterpillar, the
earth-moving equipment-maker; and Varn, which makes specialised chemicals
for the printing industry. Perkins will formally open a Pounds 12m parts
distribution centre at the site next Tuesday.
Mrs Betty Ruth Hollander, president of Omega, said yesterday that it would
develop a 26-acre campus with offices, research, production and warehousing.
The aim would be to attack European markets from Manchester.
'We looked all over Europe, but greater Manchester has the roadways we
needed and its airport and plenty of hotels for accommodating visitors and
training staff,' she said.
Omega, which started in 1962, makes components which measure and control
temperature, pressure, flow and humidity. It has plants in Connecticut, New
Jersey and Montreal.
Privately owned by Mr Milton Hollander and Mrs Hollander, Omega refuses to
divulge turnover or profits. The present staff is under 1,000, but growing
quickly. Some 225 defence and aviation jobs are to go in Scotland.
GEC-Marconi Avionics, which employs more than 4,000 people in Edinburgh and
Fife blamed the decline in defence orders.
In Fife, 300 new jobs are to be created with Solectron Corporation taking
over Philips Circuit Assemblies in Dunfermline.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Fishermen set out quota proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH fishermen, who comprise the majority of the UK fishing industry,
yesterday put forward a package of measures which they say would enable the
government to scrap its highly unpopular scheme for restricting the number
of days they may spend at sea, due to come into force in January.
In what could be a significant concession, the fishermen say they would be
prepared to accept limits on the amount of time they spend at sea, provided
the UK abandons the system of quotas on the quantity of fish they can catch,
which is a central part of European Community policy.
The package of proposals, which includes some that are less radical, was put
forward yesterday in response to an invitation from Mrs Gillian Shephard,
agriculture secretary.
Fishermen believe that the restrictions on the number of days they may spend
at sea will cause them severe hardship. They object to the quota system
which they believe has a shaky scientific justification.
The Scottish Fishermen's Federation proposes that the government abandons
quotas, either unilaterally or in agreement with its EC partners.
A 'more equitable sea time system' would be introduced, but fishermen would
be entitled to sell all the legally sized fish they have caught.
The federation believes its suggestion would enable the government to meet
its target of cutting fishing capacity by 19 per cent by 1996.

FT  01 OCT 93 / European works council marks Ford policy shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A EUROPEAN works council is to be established at the Ford motor company
covering its 100,000 employees in Britain, Germany, Portugal, Spain and
Belgium.
Mr Tony Woodley, TGWU general union national officer for the car industry in
Britain yesterday said: 'Ford workers throughout Europe can today celebrate
a new European unity among their unions.
'We recognise Ford operates as one European entity in the single market.
Unfortunately the backward British government has singularly failed to come
to terms with its social obligations towards workers in the European
community.'
Until now, Ford has opposed the idea of a works council covering all its
European operations. But the EC is soon expected to endorse a directive on
works councils that will compel Ford and other companies to introduce them.
The new body will contain full-time union officials and plant conveners from
the UK. German members will come from existing works councils in Ford
plants.
It has taken long discussions between the unions to reach agreement on the
Ford works council.
There are around 25 European-wide company works councils, mainly in
French-owned enterprises and other car companies.
Separately, the final touches are being put to a union pay claim at Ford in
the UK. Conscious of the troubles facing the company, union negotiators
intend to give their highest priority to job security rather than a big pay
rise.
Vauxhall faces industrial conflict if it fails to improve its existing
two-year wage offer to its 8,000 workers when it meets union officials next
Wednesday.
Mr Roger Butler, the AEEU engineering union's chief negotiator, said unions
would hold a strike ballot if the offer of a 2.1 per cent rise this year and
2.6 per cent next year is not increased.
The unions are seeking a substantial rise and a cut in working hours. They
say productivity has improved by 8 per cent over the past 12 months and the
company is making substantial profits.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Row looms on EC waste directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK will try to block a new European directive on waste disposal at next
Tuesday's European Council meeting in Luxembourg, Mr Tim Yeo, environment
minister, said yesterday.
The European Commission should not attempt 'pseudo-harmonisation' of
environmental standards which could 'properly be dealt with by member states
themselves', he said.
The UK objects to the EC plans to tighten rules on landfill, involving the
disposal of waste by burying it. The proposed directive would restrict the
practice, common in Britain, of burying industrial waste together with
organic household rubbish.
Some EC countries argue that the chemical reactions produced by this method
of 'co-disposal' are dangerous. The UK will argue that the reactions make
the hazardous industrial waste safer.
However, the UK intends to throw its weight behind the EC's controversial
plans for a directive on recycling packaging, which are also likely to
provoke a row on Tuesday.
The German scheme, which insists on manufacturers taking back all packaging,
has been close to bankruptcy, and has generated unwanted recycled plastic
and paper. The pollution inspectorate has made a deficit on its budget for
the second year running. The deficit for the year to March 1993 was Pounds
2.1m, just under 10 per cent of the inspectorate's income.

CANARY WHARF, the Docklands office scheme that went into administration in
May last year, yesterday cleared one of the last hurdles on its way back to
normal trading.
Unsecured creditors voted unanimously in favour of a restructuring package
which paves the way for the development to come out of administration and
return to trading by the end of October,
The 1,400 unsecured creditors agreed to approve company voluntary
arrangements which will allow them to be paid up to 15p in the pound. A
further 25p in the pound will be paid to 130 construction trade creditors to
provide warranties on work already done.
Backing by the unsecured creditors for the restructuring package was
necessary for the Pounds 1.1bn refinancing package agreed by Canary Wharf's
banks to go ahead.
The approval of the Jubilee Line Tube extension to east London, which
depends on contributions from Canary Wharf's bankers, also depended on a
positive vote by the unsecured creditors. The government is expected to
approve the Jubilee Line extension once the Olympia &amp; York companies come
out of administration.
The creditors' meeting at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in Bayswater, London,
attracted about 100 creditors. The meeting lasted little more than an hour.
Mr Stephen Adamson, one of the administrators, said he was delighted with
the level of support for the company's voluntary arrangements. 'After
protracted and complex negotiations with numerous parties we believe this is
the best deal for the unsecured creditors who would otherwise have received
nothing,' he said.
Following the creditors' vote of approval, Mr Adamson, Mr Nigel Hamilton and
Mr Alan Bloom of Ernst &amp; Young will apply to the High Court to be discharged
as administrators. Their application will be heard within the next 28 days.
The refinancing package, announced on September 10, involves the
restructuring of Pounds 568m of existing debt, additional new finance of up
to Pounds 278m and a further Pounds 300m payment to London Regional
Transport over 25 years for the completion of the Jubilee Line extension.
The creditors were told that if they had not agreed to the proposals, the
alternative was almost inevitably compulsory liquidation, which would have
meant that creditors would not receive any distribution on their claims at
present valuations.
Canary Wharf, which cost more than Pounds 1.5bn to build, has been valued at
between just Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m.
Once Canary Wharf comes out of administration, its corporate structure will
be reorganised under a new parent company, called Sylvester Investments,
controlled by the banks.

<TEXT>
SCHADE UK, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Dusseldorf-based group, is to
hire 100 extra workers for its Midlands plant, which supplies body trims,
mouldings and windows to Jaguar, Rover, Vauxhall and Ford, Tim Burt writes.
The recruitment drive will take the total workforce to 280 at the company's
Castle Bromwich plant near Birmingham.
Schade UK said the additional workers would join the production line in a
new 30,000 sq ft extension to the plant, which is dedicated to making
components for Jaguar.
Mr David Cowburn, managing director of Schade UK, said: 'This represents a
Pounds 4m investment and will increase our production capacity by 80 per
cent.'

FT  01 OCT 93 / Whitehall productivity 'lagging'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CIVIL Service has lagged behind the private sector in increasing the
productivity of its staff, according to a report published today by the
European Policy Forum, the independent think tank.
Between 1987 and 1993, the number of civil servants fell 7.3 per cent from
597,814 to 554,212, according to the most recent government figures.
The Forum contrasts these figures with productivity increases at the banks,
which it says are similar, people-intensive administrative organisations.
They have cut their staff numbers by more than 16 per cent in the past four
years.
The report will add to pressure on the government to curb Civil Service
staff as part of a drive to reduce public expenditure rather than increase
taxes.
Much of the reduction in civil service numbers has been achieved by
reclassifying civil servants to take them out of the figures, the Forum
says.
Examples include the transfer of 3,300 staff from the Department of Health
special hospitals to a special health authority in 1990. The introduction of
commercial management in the Rosyth and Devonport dockyards took out another
16,600.
Excluding such changes, numbers have fallen by just 17,382 since 1987, a
fall of 3.9 per cent. This contrasts with the big four banks which have cut
44,940 staff since 1989, a drop of 16 per cent.
The report says that similar staffing reductions in the Civil Service could
cut over 60,000 jobs, a 10 per cent reduction. It calls on ministers to set
targets for 'downsizing' on this scale over the next four years.
The Forum says that the failure to squeeze down numbers in many government
departments has added to public expenditure and reduced the scope for
improving the quality of services.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Appeal planned over Iraq arms case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAWYERS acting for a British businessman convicted of illegally exporting
arms to Iraq plan to appeal against the decision after the Scott
arms-for-Iraq inquiry uncovered evidence of government interference with
defence witnesses.
Although the trial of Mr Reginald Dunk took place in 1985, lawyers acting
for him believe they have good grounds now to argue that the conviction was
unsafe.
Appearing before the Scott inquiry in June, Sir Peter Egerton, a former
under-secretary at the Foreign Office, said that Customs officials had asked
Foreign Office officials to dissuade staff from the Jordanian and Iraqi
embassies from giving evidence on Mr Dunk's behalf.
Mr Dunk's solicitor, Sir Basil Rhodes, confirmed yesterday that he had
written to lawyers acting for Customs and Excise, which prosecuted the case
originally, to discuss possible compensation. He said that no figure had
been mentioned although his client had mentioned a figure of Pounds 1m.
Sir Basil said last night: 'The conviction is patently unsafe and improper
because there was an attempt to gerrymander the evidence.'
Customs would not comment on the case last night. But officials indicated
they were unlikely to agree to compensation without the case first going to
the appeal court.
The Dunk case falls outside the period being examined by the Scott inquiry
although the relationship between the judiciary and Whitehall falls within
Lord Justice Scott's terms of reference.

FT  01 OCT 93 / ERM departure 'boosted steelwork exports'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTS of steelwork for construction have risen by up to a fifth since
sterling left the exchange rate mechanism last September, manufacturers said
yesterday.
Invitations to tender for international contract have risen even faster,
according to a survey of orders received by the 12 largest UK constructional
steel producers.
The study, by British Constructional Steelwork Association, showed that the
companies had received international invitations to tender and requests for
price quotations involving more than 400,000 tonnes of steel since last
September. This compares with just 20,000 tonnes in the preceding 12 months.
Just over half the inquiries have come from continental Europe, particularly
from eastern Germany where demand for new construction has risen since the
reunification.
The association measures inquiries for jobs involving 750 tonnes or more.
Construction of a medium-sized supermarket would normally involve about 200
tonnes.
Mr Robin Booth, managing director of Booth Industries, based in Bolton, said
some continental European companies with orders in the Middle East and Far
East had bought cheaper UK steel in order to make the jobs more profitable.
Mr Rollo Reid, director of John Reid &amp; Sons in Dorset, said: 'Exports fell
sharply after the Gulf war but have started to pick up during the past 12
months. East Germany and Poland, where there is a strong demand for British
steel, have been particularly good markets.' In the first nine months of the
year the company has generated overseas sales of Pounds 6m, overtaking the
Pounds 5m earned in the whole of last year.
Mr Reid said: 'We have been quoting prices up to 25 per cent lower than
local German fabricators. We have even been asked, for the first time, to
price jobs in Japan.'
Mr Joe Locke, managing director of Watson Steel, part of the Amec
construction group, said: 'Opportunities to bid for international work have
increased considerably following sterling's devaluation. The largest order
we have won since leaving the ERM is a Pounds 2m steelwork contract for a
clothing distribution warehouse for Fruit of the Loom in northern Germany.'
It had been won against strong local competition.
The company is currently erecting the FFr120m (Pounds 13.7m) steel and glass
work for a high-speed rail station at Charles de Gaulle airport near Paris.
Mr Locke said: 'British firms have much more expertise in erecting buildings
with steel frames compared with the rest of Europe. This has allowed us to
develop a technological lead in a number of areas which, allied to our
advantages on price, is helping us to win valuable international work at a
time when orders in the UK have been in short supply.'

FT  01 OCT 93 / Pay rises faster in public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY IN the public sector rose faster than in the private sector for the
third year running in the year to April, according to the government's New
Earnings Survey figures for this year published yesterday.
The figures show a 4.3 per cent increase for the public sector compared with
4 per cent for the private sector. That is in spite of the fact that many
key public-sector groups had been affected by the government's 1.5 per cent
pay limit when the survey data was compiled.
Public-sector pay experts, such as Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance
Foundation, said the figures helped to explain why the government has
imposed another limit on public-sector pay next year. The figures also show
that public-sector pay is drifting well over official ceilings.
Mr Trinder said: 'The decentralisation of pay in the public sector may have
given flexibility advantages, but at a price.'
Taking the three years to April this year, pay in the public sector has
increased by 25.2 per cent compared with 18.6 per cent in the private
sector. Inflation was 12.4 per cent over the period. Over the same period,
the economy contracted by 2 per cent.
The public sector was also much more generous to the low-paid, with the
lowest 10 per cent receiving 4.8 per cent compared with 3.5 per cent for the
lowest-paid 10 per cent in the private sector.
Although women's pay rose slightly faster than men's at 4.8 per cent, the
biggest reductions in pay were for full-time non-manual women workers under
18, whose pay fell 9.3 per cent. This may reflect the lagged effect of the
abolition of wages councils for young people.
However, those workers who are still covered by wages councils saw their pay
rise 4.8 per cent, considerably above the average in the private sector.
Overall earnings inequality grew, with weekly manual earnings rising only
2.5 per cent to Pounds 257 compared with non-manual occupations which rose
4.4 per cent to Pounds 350. The average for women at Pounds 253 was just
over 71 per cent of the male figure of Pounds 354. That rises to 79 per cent
if overtime is excluded.
Greater London continued to see earnings increases higher than in other
parts of the country at 5.9 per cent - making an average of Pounds 408. The
lowest increases were in East Anglia at 1.3 per cent and Tyne and Wear's 1.7
per cent.
Average pay for managers and administrators was Pounds 460, a rise of 6.2
per cent, with average professional pay at Pounds 444, a rise of 5.7 per
cent.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Row looms on EC waste plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK will try to block a new European directive on waste disposal at next
Tuesday's European Council meeting in Luxembourg, Mr Tim Yeo, environment
minister, said yesterday.
The European Commission should not attempt 'pseudo-harmonisation' of
environmental standards which could 'properly be dealt with by member states
themselves', he said. Mr Yeo has been an outspoken advocate of subsidiarity
 -the devolution of decision-making to the lowest possible national,
regional or local level.
The UK objects to the EC plans to tighten rules on landfill, involving the
disposal of waste by burying it. The proposed directive would restrict the
practice, common in Britain, of burying industrial waste together with
organic household rubbish.
Some EC countries argue that the chemical reactions produced by this method
of 'co-disposal' are dangerous. The UK will argue that the reactions make
the hazardous industrial waste safer.
However, the UK intends to throw its weight behind the EC's controversial
plans for a directive on recycling packaging, which are also likely to
provoke a row on Tuesday.
The German scheme, which insists on manufacturers taking back all packaging,
has been close to bankruptcy, and has generated mounds of unwanted recycled
plastic and paper. The pollution inspectorate has made a deficit on its
budget for the second year running. The deficit for the year to March 1993
was Pounds 2.1m, just under 10 per cent of the inspectorate's income. A rise
in fees and charges to companies and government departments resulted in a
lower deficit than the previous year's shortfall of Pounds 3.1m.
The inspectorate is nearly half-way through a five-year programme of
licensing the UK's 5,000 most polluting industrial installations according
to the terms of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Shopping centre hit by Boots pullout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSAL to build a Pounds 85m out-of-town shopping centre near Chester
received a setback this week after Boots, the chemist group, pulled out of
the scheme.
Boots Properties, the group's investment and development subsidiary, became
involved in the Cheshire Oaks scheme in February, when the Church
commissioners, who owns the site selected it as a development partner.
It withdrew after failing to secure a principal tenant for the scheme on
terms that were acceptable to the commissioners. 'Given our assessment of
future returns, we could not make the deal work for all three parties,'
Boots said.
The withdrawal of Boots casts doubt on the viability of the 463,000 sq ft
scheme five miles north of Chester. It is planned to occupy 65 acres on a
230-acre development site.
The setback to Cheshire Oaks comes at a time when the prospects for future
large shopping centres are poor due to tighter planning guidelines and
modest expectations for a revival in consumer spending. An exception is
Cribbs Causeway, a large shopping centre outside Bristol being developed by
Prudential, the life group, which is due to begin construction next year.
Boots said it would focus its energies on other developments. It is involved
in a number of retail development schemes including new shopping centres in
Harrow, north-west London; Hastings, East Sussex; and Caerphilly, Mid
Glamorgan.
Occupancy rates for new shopping centres across the UK have risen from 67
per cent to 75 per cent in the last year, according to a survey by DTZ
Debenham Thorpe, property advisers. The survey covered 46 centres opened in
the last four years.

FT  01 OCT 93 / MoD rethink means 700 new jobs for Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW has finally won the battle for the Ministry of Defence's new
personnel centre, which will bring the city up to 700 jobs.
It appeared several times that a guarantee to base the centre in the city
might be snatched away after it was announced in January that Glasgow was
the recommended site for the unified personnel centre to handle all Army pay
and pensions.
The proposal was to bring together a number of smaller offices around
Britain and create 700 jobs in Glasgow while safeguarding 400 existing jobs.
But then Stockport, Greater Manchester, entered a bid proposing a suitable
building which would cost Pounds 4m against Pounds 20m for one in Glasgow.
The decision to look seriously at the Stockport proposal angered Mr Ian
Lang, Scottish secretary, particularly as Rosyth lost the Pounds 5.5bn
Trident submarine refitting contract to Devonport.
After looking again in Glasgow, a cheaper, existing building at Kentigern
was proposed and consultations started.
But in July the MoD was inundated with a stream of representations and
intense lobbying from MPs proposing alternative sites around the country.
Ministers preferred the Kentigern proposal and had seen nothing to dissuade
them from housing the centre in Glasgow.
Some 225 defence and aviation jobs are to go in Scotland. GEC-Marconi
Avionics, which employs over 4,000 people in Edinburgh and Fife blamed the
decline in UK defence orders.
In Fife, 300 new jobs are to be created with Solectron Corporation taking
over Philips Circuit Assemblies in Dunfermline.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Reform legislation must wait until 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of praise from Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, for the
efforts of Professor Goode and his colleagues, legislation on pension reform
will not come until at least 1994-95.
This has been clear since March when Mr Lilley announced that the Pension
Law Review Committee would be three months late reporting.
This meant the study was not available when ministers were making decisions
about the government's legislative programme for the next parliamentary
session, beginning in November. Indeed, the government is not technically
committed to implementing any of the report at all.
The only specific pledge Mr Lilley has made on the shape of future pensions
law came 15 months ago when he promised to give members of occupational
pension schemes a new entitlement to an annual statement saying how much
their savings are worth. This was in response to a report on the Robert
Maxwell affair from the cross-party social security select committee.
It seems reasonable to assume that, having set up the review committee in
the wake of Maxwell, Mr Lilley will draft what legislation is needed to
implement some, if not all, reforms the report recommends.
The first indication of the government's intentions will come in a Commons
statement Mr Lilley will make either when MPs return briefly to Westminster
later this month, or soon after the opening of the next parliamentary
session in November.
With the government also believed to have postponed politically sensitive
plans to raise the state retirement age for women, it is possible it intends
to combine these with what it decides to take from Goode into one omnibus
bill.
But with a small majority, there is no guarantee that ministers could steer
what would probably be a large and complex measure through parliament
unamended.
Already yesterday, Mr Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the Commons social
security committee, was appealing to 'radical' MPs to 'get hold' of the bill
when it arrives and amend it to give pensioners ownership of their own
pension-fund assets.
This would in effect overturn Prof Goode's recommendation that trust law
should 'continue to provide the foundation for interests, rights and duties
arising in connection with occupational pension schemes'. Mr Field said the
transfer of assets that such a step would involve would make selling council
houses 'pale into insignificance'.
He was optimistic that the report would form the basis of a worthwhile
reform, partly because of the proposals for a compensation scheme. This
would encourage the financial services industry to back effective regulation
'because otherwise they would pick up the bill'.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Goode report strikes a fine balance: Pensions industry
believes interests of both employers and members have been recognised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PENSIONS industry has given a broad welcome to the Goode Committee
report, saying it preserves employers' rights to abandon unaffordable
pension promises for the future while ensuring that past promises are kept.
'Our overall reaction is that it has struck a good balance between the
interests of employers and that of scheme members,' said Mr Ron Amy,
chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds and benefits manager
at Grand Metropolitan.
'However, there were a couple of areas in which we felt it could have gone
further,' he said.
The association would have liked to see mandatory training requirements for
all trustees, especially since the new regime will give them greater
responsibilities.
It regretted there was no specific requirement that assets be placed with a
custodian. A number of schemes still act as their own custodian.
The actuarial profession, while broadly welcoming the recommendations for
protecting pensioners, has sounded alarm bells about a proposal for minimum
solvency standards.
Mr Roger Key, partner at R. Watsons and Sons, consulting actuaries, said
there was a risk that the equities market would plummet because of the way
the minimum solvency requirement would be calculated.
The report recommends that actuaries calculate the so-called cash equivalent
value of the transfer value of each member, assuming the scheme were to be
wound up immediately. The sum is intended to represent the amount the member
would need to purchase equivalent benefits in the market although it does
not take account of actual market prices for annuities at any particular
time.
The actuarial profession now calculates these with reference to yields on UK
government gilts, and assumes that the rate of return the member will earn
on his investment is equal to those. However, more than 80 per cent of the
average UK pension scheme is invested in equities, most of that in the UK.
Mr Key said a sudden crash in the value of the UK equities market could
leave a scheme that met the 100 per cent solvency standard on one day very
far below that a few days later. Thus, for safety's sake, many actuaries are
likely to recommend that schemes switch their investments to gilts which
historically have yielded less than equities.
That could make pension schemes more expensive to finance, he said, and
discourage employers from providing defined benefit final salary schemes.
Mr Bill Rayner, senior actuary at consultants William M. Mercer, said that
while the effects on equity values could be dire, the profession had begun
to address the matter.
The Goode report directs the actuarial profession to consider ways of
narrowing the diverse methods used to calculate transfer values within the
industry.
In July, the Pensions Committee of the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries
began looking at calculation methods including whether some account should
be taken of equities.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Goode Committee: The main recommendations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There should be a new Occupational Pensions Schemes Act to codify
recommended reforms
A Pensions Regulator should be appointed
The roles of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Occupational Pensions Advisory
Service should be strengthened
A Pensions Compensation Scheme should be set up to cover fraud, theft or
misappropriation. This should be financed by a levy on all occupational
schemes
Scheme members should be entitled to appoint at least a third of all
trustees, with a minimum of two per scheme. Employers would not be able be
removed these members
There should be no restrictions on an employer's ability to take a
contributions holiday, provided the scheme has met minimum solvency
standards
Employers wishing to extract cash from their schemes should first obtain
permission from the Pensions Regulator, even if their trust rules
specifically permit them to do so. The Regulator should only give permission
under certain circumstances
Schemes should meet minimum solvency standards. They should not have assets
equal to less than 90 per cent of what would be needed to meet liabilities.
If they did, the employer should make up the shortfall within three months
and if this is not done, the Regulator should take remedial action
Employers should be free to amend their schemes to reduce or restrict
benefits for future service. They should also be free to wind up their
schemes entirely. However, they should not be able to restrict benefits
earned in the period of employment prior to changes in the scheme

FT  01 OCT 93 / Blueprint aims for pensions protection / A look at the
committee's detailed proposals for new safeguards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PENSIONS Law Review Committee, the advisory panel the government
appointed to advise it in the aftermath of the Maxwell scandal, has produced
a blueprint for sweeping reform of the way pension schemes are governed.
Broadly speaking, it calls on government to set out in law what has only
been enshrined in the concept of best practice, and to set up a pensions
regulator responsible for ensuring the law is followed.
The committee, chaired by Professor Roy Goode, made no bones about what is
saw as its mandate: to reassure pension-scheme members that benefits
promised in the past will actually be delivered while maintaining employers'
freedom to alter future commitments which they may not be able to afford.
'Many of our recommendations do little more than reflect best practice, and,
when taken with the simplification measures we have proposed, should add
few, if any, financial burdens to a well-run and properly funded scheme . .
. as a result, both employer and scheme members should feel confident that
the pension promise is more secure and that at the same time the employer's
future commitments can be limited to what is considered affordable,' the
committee wrote.
The committee's final conclusions include: An Occupational Pensions Act to
lay out a properly structured framework of rights and duties. There should
also be a new pensions regulator to see that the new law is enforced. 'The
root of the problem is that there is no comprehensive legal framework
governing occupational pensions.'
The Pensions Act should protect the 'pensions promise' that is, the pension
benefits which each worker has accrued up until either leaving employment or
the terms of the pension scheme for future service are altered.
Every breach of duty under such a pensions act should carry a sanction, some
of which would be imposed by the pensions regulator. Other breaches would be
treated as civil wrongs. The act would be supplemented with other measures,
including a code of practice which could cover such things as the frequency
and conduct of meetings of the boards of trustees.
There should be a Pension Compensation Board to administer a scheme in cases
of fraud, theft and other misappropriation only. It would be financed by a
levy on schemes and all disbursements by it would be in the form of a loan.
Any recoveries on behalf of the defunct scheme will reimburse the
compensation fund.
Pension-scheme members should have fuller and more frequent access to
information about their scheme.
Trust law is broadly satisfactory as the basis for the governance of pension
schemes. However, there is a need to modify some principles of trust law
with respect to the way pensions are governed. 'In particular, some curbs
need to be placed on the permissible content of scheme rules, especially in
relation to to certain of the powers that can be reserved to the employer
and the trustees and the scope of exemptions given to trustees from
liability for breach of duty.'
There shall be a minimum funding requirement for all schemes equal to 100
per cent of the liabilities of the scheme if it were wound up immediately.
However, there will be a margin allowed and a scheme shall not be in
violation of this standard unless assets fall below 90 per cent of
liabilities upon wind-up.
In the event that a shortfall below 90 per cent is discovered by the
actuary, the employer will have three months to make it good. Two weeks
after that the trustees must tell scheme members if the shortfall remains,
and try to recover the money from the employer. The regulator may also take
steps to force the employer to make the necessary payment.
Because actuarial valuations of pension schemes are relatively infrequent -
usually occurring every three years - trustees should be required to furnish
the regulator with an annual certificate of solvency from the appointed
actuary.
Cash payments to the employer from the pension scheme should not be
permitted without the express permission of the regulator, even if the
scheme's trust deed specifically permits it. In cases where the trust deed
does not allow withdrawals by the employer, the employer will have to notify
members that it has sought permission to do so from the regulator.
Generally, the regulator will not allow cash withdrawals unless future
pension benefits have been indexed against inflation and if there is no
danger that the surplus will be reduced to precarious levels.
There shall be no restrictions on an employer's ability to use a
pension-fund surplus to finance a so-called contributions holiday. However,
there shall be no contributions holidays either for employers or employees
if as a result, the scheme would fall below the minimum solvency standard.
The committee is also urging a change in tax rules to extend to 15 years
from five years the time in which surplus over 105 per cent of liabilities
must be disposed of.
Employers should not have the sole right to appoint trustees and should not
have the right to veto any trustee selected by scheme members. For
earnings-related schemes (with the exception of small schemes) active
members should be entitled to appoint from among themselves at least one
third of the trustee board, with a minimum of two trustees selected in this
way. For money-purchase schemes, active members should be entitled to
appoint at least two thirds of the trustee board.
Scheme members should be free to appoint a non-member of their scheme as a
trustee, such as a trade union representative, as long as the employer
agrees. Disputes may be referred to the regulator.
Member-appointed trustees can only be removed by the unanimous decision of
the other trustees and the regulator must be notified if this is done.
Certain rights must be reserved to the trustees, namely the right to appoint
the scheme's professional advisors including its actuary, accountant and
fund managers. They also have the right to decide the use of any unallocated
surplus in the event of a scheme wind-up and will direct the way in which
discretionary benefits are to be taken into account when members transfer
out of the scheme for any reason.
For early leavers, no change is recommended in the rules which require the
values of deferred pensions to uprated each year by either the retail price
index or five per cent, whichever is the lower, although the report notes
that some members favoured linking the uprating to an earnings index.
However, the actuarial profession should be required to tighten the bases
upon which transfer values are calculated. There are too many different
accepted practices to be used in calculating transfer values so that two
workers with similar working patterns and sala ries may have very different
sums upon leaving a scheme.
The regulator should have the power to fine schemes which do not pay
transfer values to early leavers within 12 months of departure.
In the case of scheme members who are transferred to a new scheme with the
sale of their employer, it is not reasonable to require the new employer to
provide future benefits equal to those granted by the previous employer.
Professional advisers to a scheme will be required to report serious or
persistent irregularities to the regulator.
On investment policy, a 'prudent man' rule should replace the complex
investment guidelines, and the committee sees no reason to ban the practice
of stock lending by schemes, provided it is done in conformity with
established practice. The minimum 5 per cent limit on self-investment should
be allowed to stand although there should be a bar on the provision of any
loans or other financial assistance to or the granting of guarantees for the
employer and associated companies.
Pension-fund trustees will not be required to place scheme assets with a
custodian independent from the fund manager as had been urged by some in the
fund management industry. The committee also decided against requiring that
all securities be held in the name of the customer.
The final report, some 1,000 pages long, was compiled after receiving 1,669
separate written submissions.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Proposals welcomed as 'step in right direction'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REACTION FROM members of pension schemes to the Goode committee's
recommendations yesterday was generally positive but many felt that the
committee had not gone far enough in its proposals to protect scheme
members' rights.
Mr Bill Rayner, a senior actuary at consultants William M Mercer, said:
'What is proposed is not a revolution but a clarification and extension of
present practice via a Pensions Act.' He said the recommendations should
force all pension-scheme trustees to adopt best practice - 'which is already
followed voluntarily by many but regrettably not by all'.
Mr Alan MacDougall, managing director of Pirk, independent investment
advisers to pension-fund trustees, welcomed the proposal to enshrine
members' representation in law and the requirement on trustees to provide
more information to scheme members 'in plain English'.
However he said: 'The major disappointment is that there is no clear legal
protection for member trustees. Goode is proposing majority voting, so the
members will always be in a minority on the board.' The committee has
recommended that members should be entitled to appoint at least one third of
the trustee board for earnings-related schemes, with the exception of small
schemes.
Mr MacDougall also said that the central question of who owns pension
schemes had been fudged.
The Trades Union Congress also said the recommendations fell short on the
question of member trustees' representation. Mr John Monks, TUC general
secretary, said the majority of trustees should be elected from the scheme
membership. He also said surplus money should be used to improve members'
benefits instead of employers being able to continue receiving refunds of
contributions from scheme surpluses.
Nevertheless, Mr Monks said the recommendations were a 'welcome step in the
right direction' and would help to protect workers' and pensioners'
benefits.
Mr David Harris, director of Chantrey Financial Services, independent
financial advisers, was disappointed that there was no requirement on
companies to appoint different auditors to its pension scheme. 'At the
moment auditors to the pension scheme are usually also the company's
auditors but that can lead to a potential conflict of interest.'
He doubted the viability of the compensation board, which will extract a
post-facto levy on occupational schemes should another Maxwell-type
situation occur. 'I am not sure that this is the way to fund a compensation
scheme,' he said.
The pensions ombudsman, who arbitrates in disputes, and the Occupational
Pensions Advisory Service, which deals with public queries and complaints,
both welcomed the report.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Rivers could run orange with pollution: A hazardous
side-effect of mine closures is rising water tables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEOLOGISTS, engineers and planners met in Durham yesterday to discuss a
potentially dangerous side-effect of pit closures - the threat of water
rising through abandoned mines to pollute rivers, killing wildlife and
contaminating drinking water.
Britain's recent wave of coal-mine closures and the proposed privatisation
of remaining British Coal assets is focusing attention on what is to happen
to its costly pumping activities.
The implications are serious for many coalfield areas of England and Wales,
but have struck first in County Durham which, after centuries of intensive
mining, has suddenly found itself without a single deep pit.
At present, a network of 11 pumping stations pumps 25m gallons of water
every day into the River Wear from below the warren of mineworkings. British
Coal has until now met the costs of up to Pounds 6m a year to keep dry its
remaining Durham coastal pits.
But it now has no operational interest in continuing the Durham pumping, as
the coalfield's only surviving pit, Wearmouth, in Tyne and Wear, does not
depend on it.
British Coal and the National Rivers Authority, the river pollution
watchdog, have been in negotiation for the past year over the issue.
British Coal is obliged to give the watchdog 14 days notice if it intends to
cease pumping. But the watchdog is considering legal action against British
Coal.
It is unclear whether legal action - possibly an injunction - could succeed.
Under the 1989 Water Act, permitting water to flow from abandoned mines is
not an offence, although causing it to do so is.
If the County Durham pumping ceased, the water table would rise into the old
mineworkings, and could become contaminated with sulphuric acid, iron,
manganese, aluminium and sulphates, which could then be discharged into
rivers.
The reality was demonstrated last year when 80m gallons of water from the
abandoned Cornish tin mine Wheal Jane polluted the River Carnon.
A recent study by the watchdog's consultants Wardell Armstrong concluded
that discharges of polluted minewater into the River Wear, initially around
Bishop Auckland, would begin three months after pumping stopped.
Stretches of the Wear could be affected by ochrous depots of iron compounds.
This could damage fish and river life and turn the water a vivid orange.
'Imagine an orange necklace around the peninsula of Durham Cathedral,' says
deputy county council leader Mr Bob Pendlebury, who chaired yesterday's
seminar.
The council also fears landslides and subsidence, due to waterlogging of
soils as the water table rises.
The delegates at yesterday's seminar agreed that action is required:
To ensure pumping continues until a solution to minewater pollution is
found. To press for a national working party, including government
departments, British Coal and the watchdog.
To provide the resources needed to assess environmental damage and potential
pollution and subsidence.
To seek legislation on environmental safeguards on abandoned mine workings.
North East Water, which supplies 150,000 customers from its Lumley works
near the Wear in Chester-le-Street has warned that, if pumping ends,
minewater pollution could force it to develop new treatment facilities on
the Tyne, costing Pounds 25m.
Government proposals on British Coal's pumping activities are not due until
November, when the privatisation bill is made public.

<TEXT>
PLANS to convert a compre-hensive school into a selective grammar school
have been announced by the south London borough of Wandsworth, the
Conservative 'flagship' authority.
The boys-only Ernest Bevin School is asking to select 90 of its annual
intake of 180 on academic criteria. For equal-opportunities reasons,
Wandsworth is asking the neighbouring girls' school, Burnt-wood, which has
opted out of local-authority control, to make a similar number of places
selective.
If Burntwood does not agree, Wandsworth plans to open a new girls' grammar
school.
Mr Tony Belton, leader of the Labour group, vowed to oppose the proposals.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Polly Peck charges dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office yesterday effectively ended its Polly Peck
prosecutions when it dropped all charges against Mr John Turner, the
company's former group accountant originally due to stand trial alongside Mr
Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman.
The criminal proceedings against Mr Nadir remain active and the SFO
yesterday insisted it would bring the Polly Peck chairman to trial if he
could be brought back from northern Cyprus where he fled in May to avoid
prosecution.
Efforts, including diplomatic moves, are still being made by the government
to ensure Mr Nadir's return. However, the central problem - the lack of an
extradition agreement between northern Cyprus and the UK - remains.
Investigators close to the case concede that the chances of Mr Nadir
returning to stand trial in the foreseeable future must now be regarded as
remote.
Mr Asil Nadir, speaking from his home in northern Cyprus yesterday, said he
was delighted the charges against Mr Turner had been dropped: 'It's great
news. Let's hope my case will also be dropped.'
The trial of both Mr Turner, who faced two charges of false accounting, and
Mr Nadir, who faced 13 charges of theft involving Pounds 34m, had been due
to begin on Monday at the Old Bailey. However, Mr Robert Owen QC, for the
SFO, told the court yesterday that there was 'little prospect' of Mr Nadir
returning to the UK by then.
He said that the SFO's case had been that Mr Turner had made accounting
entries to conceal the thefts carried out by Mr Nadir. Mr Turner's defence
would be seriously prejudiced if he were tried before a jury had brought in
a verdict on the alleged thefts by the Polly Peck chairman. There was also a
conflict in the evidence due to be given by Mr Nadir and Mr Turner over the
accounting entries.
It would be 'manifestly unjust' to postpone proceedings against Mr Turner
indefinitely while waiting for Mr Nadir to return to face trial.
Mr Turner, who had always denied the charges, was formally acquitted by the
judge and had costs awarded in his favour. Mr Turner said he he was 'clearly
pleased' with his acquittal.

FT  01 OCT 93 / No change to court dress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a year-long consulta-tion exercise, Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor
(above), yesterday announced that there would be no change in court dress,
Robert Rice writes.
Barristers will continue to wear wigs and gowns in court. High Court judges
will retain their ceremonial full-bottomed wigs, knee breeches, hose and
buckled shoes, beneath a scarlet cloth and fur mantle.
Responses from jurors, witnesses, the public, the legal profession and the
judiciary overwhelmingly backed the status quo. The majority felt that the
formal dress had a significant role to play in maintaining respect for the
authority and status of the court.
More than 500 responses were received from organisations and individuals.
Only 15 per cent of all respondents favoured abolition of daily court dress,
67 per cent favoured the status quo and the remainder favoured
simplification, such as abolishing the use of wigs.
Ceremonial court dress attracted comment from only 20 per cent of
respondents, of whom a fifth favoured its abolition.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Tories offer olive branch to Lady Thatcher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE party chiefs plan to offer an olive branch to Baroness
Thatcher, the former prime minister, in an attempt to orchestrate a show of
unity at next week's party conference in Blackpool.
Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, will use his speech on the opening day
of the conference next Tuesday to emphasise the continuity between present
policies and the Thatcher reforms of the 1980s.
Sir Norman, a long-serving cabinet minister under Lady Thatcher, is likely
to argue that her admirers have no reason to be hostile to the leadership of
Mr John Major, the prime minister.
This year's conference comes with Mr Major's position under threat after the
party's disastrous performance in two recent by-elections.
Morale has been further sapped by an increasingly bitter internal argument
over tax and spending ahead of next month's Budget. Combined with the
continuing rift over Europe, this has given the impression of a party
ravaged by civil war.
Lady Thatcher fanned the flames earlier this week by criticising the
government's plans to extend value added tax to domestic fuel. Party leaders
are now bracing themselves for an interview with the former prime minister
to be published in this week's Sunday Times, which is to start serialising
her memoirs on October 10.
In a separate development, Lady Thatcher has agreed to help raise money for
the party by attending one or two fund-raising dinners early next year.
The party said last night it welcomed the move both as a gesture of
reconciliation and because the former prime minister is a successful
fund-raiser. The party had an accumulated deficit of Pounds 19m at the end
of March this year.
Lady Thatcher is expected to arrive in Blackpool on Wednesday night and to
appear on the conference platform the following day for the debates on
employment and the economy.
This means she is likely to be present when Mr David Hunt and Mr Kenneth
Clarke - two of the most left-leaning members of Mr Major's cabinet - are
speaking.
The chancellor is almost certain to face calls both to rethink VAT on fuel
and to rule out Budget tax increases altogether.
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, plans to address a conference
fringe meeting on Thursday, just three weeks after his scathing criticism of
policy in a daily newspaper.
Lord Tebbit, the former party chairman, will also be active, with three
fringe appearances, culminating in a high-profile debate with Mr Clarke on
the future of Conservatism.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Recall for defective Lucozade bottles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham yester-day ordered the recall of 12m glass bottles of its
Lucozade soft drink after discovering a defect which caused the neck on some
of them to crack when opened.
The company said it had learned of the problem from Rockware, the
manufacturer, late on Monday. It said the problems affected 'only a very
small number' of bottles.
It has immediately stopped production and launched an investigation to
identify how many bottles had reached the market. It has asked retailers to
remove affected stock from their shelves and has set up a free telephone
helpline - 0800-318-066.
Production remained suspended while SmithKline Beecham and Rockware worked
to correct the defect. SmithKline Beecham could not estimate the cost of the
recall and loss of output, but said it would not have a material impact on
its financial position.
The recall covers 250ml and 300ml bottles containing original Lucozade and
orange barley, lemon barley and tropical barley flavours. No other products
in the Lucozade range were affected.
Two years ago, 5m bottles of Lucozade were recalled after the Animal
Liberation Front said it had contaminated some of them. The scare turned out
to be a hoax.

FT  01 OCT 93 / BR to compete on Gatwick line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELLERS from London to Gatwick Airport will be offered a choice of rail
services from Monday, as competition comes to British Rail in the run-up to
railway privatisation.
Gatwick Express, the non-stop airport link due to be privatised next year,
will face stiffer competition from BR divisions Network SouthEast and
Thameslink.
Passengers who are prepared to use the slower stopping trains operated by
the new competitors will pay Pounds 7.50 for their single journey, compared
with Pounds 8.60 on the express.
The introduction of competition on the route is a precursor to privatising
Gatwick Express next year.
A seven-year franchise to run the express service, one of the few profitable
routes on offer, will be put up for sale in April.
Until then, the service will be run as a 'shadow franchise', operating as a
stand-alone operating company with more than 400 staff and its own rolling
stock. Privatisation of the route is expected to be completed by October
next year.
The service carries 3.7m passengers a year between Victoria station in
London and the rail station in Gatwick airport's main terminal. For much of
the day, Gatwick Express offers four services an hour, covering the 27 miles
in 30 minutes.
It uses its own special platforms at Victoria, and the carriages are
designed to provide space for air passengers' luggage. With the launch of
the shadow franchise, it will also sell its tickets from separate ticket
offices at Victoria and Gatwick.
Express passengers pay a premium fare of Pounds 8.60 for the journey.
Although cheaper commuter trains run over the route, BR has not advertised
them and has discouraged their use.
The shadow franchise means these restrictions will be lifted.
Network SouthEast and Thameslink will be running frequent stopping services
in competition with the express, cutting the fare to Pounds 7.50 for a
single journey.
Network SouthEast will provide up to four services an hour into Victoria,
taking around 37 minutes and stopping at East Croydon and Clapham Junction.
Thameslink will offer at least two trains an hour into London Bridge
station, taking 33 minutes for the journey and also stopping at East
Croydon.
Thameslink services continue across the centre of London to Bedford, north
of the capital.
Mr Rob Mason, the new managing director of Gatwick Express, said yesterday
that he expected to lose business to the two cut-price services in the short
term.
However, Mr Mason hopes to win extra business by selling tickets for the
express through airlines and travel agents, so that people arriving at
Gatwick are already committed to using the service.
Negotiations will be completed during the shadow franchise on the track
charges to be paid for using the rail network, and leasing charges for the
rolling stock. Mr Mason said that he expected the management team to put in
a bid for the franchise if the experiment is successful.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Currency union 'dead' says minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN REDWOOD, Welsh secretary, last night staked his claim as
standard-bearer of the Tory right on Europe, with a declaration that the
Maastricht plan for a single currency appeared to be dead.
Speaking just a day after Mr Michael Portillo, his cabinet colleague who is
chief secretary to the Treasury, had set out his detailed agenda for the
European Community, Mr Redwood urged European politicians to 'get down to
tackling the problems that matter to people' such as jobs and prosperity.
The widening of exchange rate mechanism bands meant policy-makers could
'concentrate their energies' on recovery rather than the D-Mark.
He was addressing an audience of business executives in the Thames Valley.
Mr Redwood called for renewed efforts to improve the supply side of European
economies so that higher growth could be sustained in the longer term.
Delivering a strong warning about the folly of dashing towards a single
currency irrespective of whether convergence criteria had been met, he said
Europe was 'far from ready'.
He continued: 'So is the Maastricht plan for a single currency dead? It
appears to be so, on the basis of the timetable set out in the treaty.
'It now looks impossible for enough countries to meet the targets for budget
deficits and currency stability that the plan required.'
Recent events were not 'a green light for easier, faster monetary union' but
'an amber light for the whole process', he argued.
'If the countries of Europe are not close enough together to be able to keep
their currencies in narrow bands against each other, they are certainly not
close enough together to share the same currency,' he said.

FT  01 OCT 93 / ERM boost to steelwork exports seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTS of steelwork for construction have risen by up to a fifth since
sterling left the exchange rate mechanism last September, manufacturers said
yesterday.
Invitations to tender for international contract have risen even faster,
according to a survey of orders received by the 12 largest UK constructional
steel producers.
The study, by British Constructional Steelwork Association, showed that the
companies had received international invitations to tender and requests for
price quotations involving more than 400,000 tonnes of steel since last
September. This compares with just 20,000 tonnes in the preceding 12 months.
Just over half the inquiries have come from continental Europe, particularly
from eastern Germany where demand for new construction has risen sharply
since the reunification.
The association measures inquiries for jobs involving 750 tonnes or more.
Construction of a medium-sized supermarket would normally involve about 200
tonnes.
Mr Robin Booth, managing director of Booth Industries, based in Bolton, said
some continental European companies with orders in the Middle East and Far
East had bought cheaper UK steel in order to make the jobs more profitable.
Mr Rollo Reid, director of John Reid &amp; Sons in Dorset, said: 'Exports fell
sharply after the Gulf war but have started to pick up during the past 12
months. East Germany and Poland, where there is a strong demand for British
steel, have been particularly good markets.'
In the first nine months of this year the company has generated overseas
sales of Pounds 6m, already overtaking the Pounds 5m earned last year.
Mr Reid said: 'We have been quoting prices up to 25 per cent lower than
local German fabricators. We have even been asked, for the first time, to
price jobs in Japan.'
Mr Joe Locke, managing director of Watson Steel, part of the Amec
construction group, said: 'Opportunities to bid for international work have
increased considerably following sterling's devaluation.
'The largest order we have won since leaving the ERM is a Pounds 2m
steelwork contract for a clothing distribution warehouse for Fruit of the
Loom in northern Germany, against very strong local competition.'
The company is currently erecting the FFr120m (Pounds 13.7m) steel and glass
work for a high-speed rail station at Charles de Gaulle airport near Paris.
'British firms have much more expertise in erecting buildings with steel
frames compared with the rest of Europe,' said Mr Locke. 'This has allowed
us to develop a technological lead in a number of areas which, allied to our
advantages on price, is helping us to win valuable international work at a
time when orders in the UK have been in short supply.'

FT  01 OCT 93 / Switch to grammar school planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to convert a comprehensive school into a selective grammar school have
been announced by the south London borough of Wandsworth, the Conservative
'flagship' authority.
The boys-only Ernest Bevin School in Tooting is requesting the right to
select 90 of its annual intake of 180 on academic criteria. For
equal-opportunities reasons, Wandsworth is asking the neighbouring girls
school, Burntwood, which has opted out of local-authority control, to
consider making a similar number of places selective.
If Burntwood does not agree, Wandsworth intends to open a new 540-place
girls' grammar school.
Mr Edward Lister, Wandsworth council leader, said yesterday: 'Grammar
schools are at the top of every league table and I am delighted that
Wandsworth is able to make this choice available to parents.'
Mr Tony Belton, leader of the Labour group, vowed to oppose the proposals.
This is the first attempt by a local education authority to introduce
academic selection to comprehensive schools, although a number of schools
which have opted out of local-authority control have applied to make the
same change.
Wandsworth has established a record for pioneering education policies, and
the final decision on the plan will be made by Mr John Patten, education
secretary, after the borough has consulted locally.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Pressure over pit safety rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY backbenchers are putting pressure on the government over the new health
and safety regulations for the coal industry that come into force today.
In response to appeals from Nacods, the pit deputies' union, they are urging
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, to meet the concerns of miners over the
regulations. The rules separate the duties of pit inspection from
supervision - until now both carried out by Nacods, which is taking legal
action against the government over the changes.
Around 90 Conservative MPs have been approached by the union, including Mrs
Elizabeth Peacock, MP for Batley and Spen, and Mr Winston Churchill, MP for
Davyhulme, who both opposed the pit closure programme.
In letters to the backbenchers Mr Peter McNestry, Nacods' general secretary,
has warned that the new regulations eliminate 70 per cent of the safety
obligations enshrined in absolute statutory duties and replaced them with
more broadly defined duties and voluntary codes of conduct.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Russia, US in debt deal: Swift action on foreign aid to show
support for Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM, JOHN GAPPER and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA yesterday agreed on terms for rescheduling Dollars 1.1bn of debt
repayments to the US, as the Senate passed a bill paving the way for Dollars
2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) of aid to Russia and the other states of the former
Soviet Union.
The Senate voted overwhelmingly in favour of a Dollars 13bn foreign aid bill
and sent the legislation to President Bill Clinton for signature.
Within the Dollars 2.5bn total allotted to the countries of the former
Soviet union, Dollars 300m was specifically earmarked for Ukraine. Congress
also renewed conditions it wants Russia to fulfil before its share of the
aid is released.
The principal condition which Russia has not yet met is the withdrawal of
its troops from Latvia and Estonia. The bill gives the president the right,
however, to waive this condition if he determines it is in the US national
interest.
Congress has hurried to complete its work on the aid bill in an effort to
demonstrate US support for President Boris Yeltsin in the power struggle in
Moscow.
'It is in our best interest to put our faith and hope in democracy in
Russia,' said Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate subcommittee
handling foreign aid money.
'I think that the United States and the free world ought to hang in there
with a person that is clearly the most committed to democracy and market
reform of all the people now operating in Russia,' added Mr Clinton.
Aid to Russia and other countries will, however, be cut by the amount of
parking fines left unpaid by their diplomats in Washington.
Complex manoeuvring to find room for the aid package within the tight
constraints of the US budget meant that the bill needed to be signed into
law by midnight last night, when the US fiscal year ended.
Meanwhile, Mr Clinton extended new trading privileges to Russia by adding it
to the list of countries benefitting from the Generalised System of
Preferences, while Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary, signed an
agreement rescheduling Russia's bilateral debt with the US.
The agreement follows a similar bilateral arrangement between Russia and
Germany covering Dollars 5bn in repayments. Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's
deputy prime minister, said Russia would pay close to Dollars 1bn to its
creditors in the Paris Club of lender governments in the next week, adding
that Russia would also need to reschedule its Dollars 18bn of debt service
falling due next year.
Other elements of the foreign aid bill include authorisation for the White
House to lift restrictions on the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, and
to write off debts owed by low income countries.
It provides Dollars 1.02bn for the International Development Association,
the World Bank unit which provides low interest rate loans to the very
poorest countries - less than the Dollars 1.25bn a year which the US had
pledged for the next three years.
As expected, the bill includes no money at all for the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
Peter Norman adds from Washington: Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank
president, said the bank was 'frustrated' in its lending efforts by
constitutional problems in Russia.
He said some credits approved by the bank's executive board had not been
activated. These included financial assistance for privatisation and a
social safety net in Russia.

FT  01 OCT 93 / World Bank chief sees more cash needed for Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL financial support for the West Bank and Gaza Strip could be as
high as Dollars 2.5bn in the next five years, according to senior Israeli
and World Bank officials
Speaking on the eve of an international conference in Washington to
co-ordinate support for the occupied territories, Mr Lewis Preston, World
Bank president, said yesterday he believed the Palestinian regions could
require about Dollars 500m annually over five years.
Mr Jacob Frenkel, Israeli central bank governor, told the Financial Times
that the territories' needs could be Dollars 400m-Dollars 450m a year in
that period. Also, the international community needed to find a mechanism to
inject resources into the territories in the short run, so as to provide
support for the peace process, he said.
These estimates mark a considerable increase in the medium-term, compared
with earlier World Bank estimates of a Dollars 3bn financing required over
10 years.
The scaling-up reflects the anticipated higher costs of absorbing refugees
returning to the territories, as well as spending on new infrastructure and
institutions.
Mr Preston told a news conference that a World Bank mission will go to the
territories next week to identify specific projects that need support. In
the next two weeks, the bank's executive board will be asked to authorise a
Dollars 50m two-year programme of concessional finance for the territories
through the International Development Association (IDA), the bank's soft
loan facility. The board will also be asked to approve Dollars 4m technical
assistance over two years.
Moves to bolster the economies of the territories shift into a higher gear
today when officials from more than three dozen countries meet in Washington
to pledge support to an international aid effort.
It is understood that the US is prepared to provide Dollars 500m. The
European Community has promised Dollars 600m over five years. Japan has said
it will provide Dollars 200m over two years. Mr Frenkel said that Israel
would also provide finance for the territories.
Mr Preston yesterday said the World Bank was willing to take over
co-ordination of the aid effort. However, there are legal problems to be
overcome before bank funds can flow to the Palestinians.
The World Bank can only lend to entities with a government guarantee. This
rule would seem to exclude lending to the territories, but there are
precedents for other countries guaranteeing loans.
Some years ago, the bank lent to Papua New Guinea on the strength of an
Australian government guarantee.
Vietnam should obtain its first loan from the World Bank since 1978 in the
course of this month.
Mr Preston told a news conference at the end of this year's annual meetings
of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank that the bank expects to
make a Dollars 71m loan, as part of a total Dollars 350m lending programme
to Vietnam this year.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Argentine voters set to endorse reforms: Menem's
liberalisation has become Peronists' biggest electoral asset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RULING Peronist party in Argentina is virtually assured of victory in
Sunday's mid-term congressional elections. Pollsters expect the government
to take about 40 per cent of the votes, against 30 per cent for the
opposition Radical party.
The elections, for half the 257 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, should
confirm therefore the popularity of President Carlos Menem and his
free-market economic policies, ensuring continued political stability to
enable the government to deepen economic reforms.
In the four years since he took office, Mr Menem has implemented
far-reaching economic liberalisation which has brought low inflation and
rapid growth. These policies have become the government's biggest electoral
asset.
Mr Manuel Mora y Araujo, a leading pollster, says: 'Economics are
fundamental. People may say the government has many defects, that it's
inefficient and corrupt, but at least it does certain things well. You don't
change horses in midstream.'
Whatever the result, nobody expects economic stability to be affected. Mr
Pedro Lacoste, a business consultant, expects inflation to continue falling
to 4 per cent in 1994 from a forecast 8 per cent this year. Growth of 5 per
cent this year is expected to continue into 1994.
But victory on Sunday will probably not be enough for Mr Menem to gain the
support of the two-thirds of Congress he needs to change the constitution,
which bans successive presidential terms, and run for a second term when his
mandate ends in 1995. The Peronists hold only 45 per cent of seats in the
Chamber of Deputies and the poll on Sunday is not expected to increase that.
Even so, Mr Menem intends to keep up the pressure for his re-election. He
said on Wednesday he would call a plebiscite on the issue. This, however,
would not be binding on Congress.
Whether or not he has to abandon his ambition to remain in office, the
congressional election result is likely to suggest he will remain
sufficiently powerful to designate his successor, via presidential elections
due by December 1994. The outcome of the elections on Sunday, in which all
the main Peronist presidential candidates are participating directly or
indirectly, will narrow the field.
Mr Eduardo Duhalde, former vice-president and now governor of Buenos Aires,
Argentina's wealthiest province, should benefit from a decisive victory over
the Radicals. A coalition assembled by Mr Ramon Ortega, governor of the poor
north-western province of Tucuman, is expected to get 43 per cent of the
vote, against 16 per cent for the opposition.
The great unknown is the economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, who has
become Mr Menem's most powerful and most popular minister. He has fielded a
trusted aide to lead the Peronist campaign in his home province of Cordoba,
a Radical bastion. He has played a leading role in the campaign. If the
Peronists perform well there, by running the Radicals close, then Mr
Cavallo's supposed presidential ambitions - which he denies - will gain
added strength.
The political future of three powerful Radicals is also in the balance. Mr
Eduardo Angeloz, the conservative governor of Cordoba and Mr Menem's
opponent in the 1989 presidential election, has the most to lose by a strong
Peronist performance. Mr Federico Storani, a left-leaning politician, has
campaigned well in the Peronist heartland of Buenos Aires province and could
mount a credible challenge for the party leadership.
Senator Fernando de la Rua, a veteran centrist politician, is masterminding
the Radical effort in the city of Buenos Aires, where the party is
traditionally strong. However, he has picked weak candidates and the
Peronists - led by Mr Erman Gonzalez, a former economy minister - are
expected to do well. Mr Mora y Araujo doubts fringe politicians on the
extreme left and right will be able to gain much ground.
The Radicals are riven by internal divisions and will almost certainly pay
the price with yet another electoral defeat - their fourth consecutive
reverse. A rout in the 1987 mid-term elections led to the collapse in 1989
of President Raul Alfonsn's Radical government, amid hyperinflation and
social upheaval.
The election on Sunday demonstrates the growing solidity of Argentina's
political system. It is 10 years since the military returned government to
the civilians after a fierce seven years in power. The stresses that led to
six military coups since 1930 have largely disappeared. Despite widespread
criticism of the arrogance and corruption of their politicians, few
Argentines question the legitimacy of the democratic system.
Mr Lacoste hopes the government will seize the initiative and use its
remaining 22 months in office to implement overdue plans to reform the rigid
labour market, crack down on widespread tax evasion, and improve its
inefficient and corrupt social policies.
Above all, the pace of liberalisation cannot slacken: 'There is a great
dynamism and flexibility, making many sectors competitive. It's a question
of time, as country-risk declines, (before) an infinity of projects will
become attractive.'

US personal incomes rose more than expected last month, but sales of new
homes fell sharply, according to economic data released yesterday.
The Commerce Department said personal incomes rose 1.3 per cent last month
after a 0.3 per cent decline in July. However, the figures were distorted by
flooding in the Mid-west, which sharply reduced farmers' incomes in July.
Economists at C J Lawrence, the New York broker, said incomes probably rose
by 0.5 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively in July and August.
Personal consumption spending rose 0.4 per cent last month, the same pace as
in July. The figures point to an increase in real consumer spending in the
third quarter at an annual rate of about 4 per cent.
Sales of new homes fell 3.1 per cent last month and by 1.4 per cent in the
year to August.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton, aided by the PLO-Israeli landmark accord and
favourable reaction to his US health reform plan, has risen to a 56 per cent
approval rating among US voters, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Clinton, whose popularity plunged soon after he took office in January,
has climbed back above the 50 per cent level for the first time since April,
according to the poll by CNN, USA Today and Gallup. It found that 56 per
cent of Americans approve of the way Mr Clinton is working, while 36 per
cent disapprove.
Mr Clinton took office in mid-January with 58 per cent approval, but fell to
a record low of 37 per cent by June, after White House gaffes.
Americans appear to have renewed faith in his foreign policy skills, with 55
per cent approving, compared with 32 per cent disapproving.
A poll last month - before Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO leader, and Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, Israeli prime minister, came to the White House to sign guidelines on
Palestinian self-rule - showed Mr Clinton with 46 per cent approval on
foreign affairs.

<TEXT>
BRAZIL is due to begin next Wednesday what could be a profound
constitutional revision, which the government and business leaders hope will
help to solve some of the country's problems.
The revision, due to last at least until year-end, is in accordance with the
1988 constitution, which called for a review after five years. Even so, the
revision was in doubt because of opposition by left-wing politicians and
church groups, who fear it could undermine workers' rights.
Likely to be reviewed are bans on foreign investment in sectors such as
mining, and government monopolies in telecommunications and oil. Proposals
to amend workers' rights and job security for civil servants are unlikely to
be tabled as they are politically too divisive.
The Congress voted late on Wednesday to initiate its review, after noisy
protests from opposition groups. Under the process, the constitution can be
amended by simple majority, compared with 60 per cent majorities in both
chambers of Congress now required for any constitutional change.
Supporters of the review say it could help resolve economic problems such as
the federal government's deficit.
They blame the budget deficit on large transfers, required by the
constitution, from the federal government to states and municipalities.
Reduction of these transfers, or of the federal government's other
obligations, would bring down the deficit and help reduce inflation, they
argue.

PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand said yesterday France wanted a 'good

Uruguay Round accord would be ready by December 15, Reuter reports from
Stockholm.
On a visit to Sweden, Mr Mitterrand said France had a legal right to veto a
US-EC accord on cutting farm production and subsidies, but would prefer not
to do this.

FT  01 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland seeks urgency on trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, yesterday called on negotiators to redouble their efforts to
conclude the seven-year-old Uruguay Round of global trade talks by the
December 15 deadline.
Addressing a stock-taking meeting of Gatt's overseer Trade Negotiations
Committee, he said the overall picture was 'not a bad one' but much more
needed to be done - urgently.
He expressed particular concern about blockages in the negotiations on
improving market access for imports of farm goods and textiles - both areas
of critical interest for developing countries.
Mr Sutherland said he had asked Mr Germain Denis, chairman of the market
access negotiating group, to give these areas 'very special and urgent
attention', and would intervene himself if necessary. 'A larger share of the
responsibility for movement must lie with the major players,' he added.
The director-general, who has been circling the globe to enlist support for
the round from political leaders, said afterwards he would travel to Tokyo
this month to meet Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, and other
senior ministers.
Top of the agenda will be Japan's reluctance to liberalise its closed rice
market, now emerging as an important obstacle in the negotiations on
lowering trade barriers for farm goods.
The trip will also include Singapore, where Mr Sutherland will meet
ministers from the Association of South-East Asian Nations. Liberalisation
of financial services markets in these countries is seen as critical to the
success of negotiations in Geneva on market opening for foreign services.
The timetable for the Uruguay Round talks, agreed last July, says the shape
of the overall market access package for goods must be clear by mid-October,
with a further month to complete detailed tariff schedules for each country.
As of yesterday, 58 countries (the EC counting as one) had made
comprehensive tariff offers.
However, talks on lowering trade barriers for farm goods have been delayed
by uncertainty over the future of the US/EC Blair House accord on
agricultural subsidies.
On industrial goods, Mr Sutherland said yesterday that the 'unfinished
agenda', left over from last July's agreement on tariff cuts between the
four leading traders, was holding up the negotiations.

<TEXT>
THE SIX biggest steelmakers in the US filed an appeal yesterday against an
official ruling two months ago which had overturned tarrifs aimed at
preventing dumping of foreign steel in the US.
The appeal was against rulings in 42 cases by the International Trade
Commission, mainly in the area of relatively low margin hot-rolled and
cold-rolled steel. The ITC failed to find evidence of dumping by foreign
steelmakers, leading it to overturn tarrifs imposed by the Commerce
Department.
Foreign producers have already filed their own appeals against 30 rulings
after the ITC had found evidence of dumping of the more profitable
corrosion-resistant steel. The six said they would 'vigorously defend'
against these appeals.

FT  01 OCT 93 / World Trade News: European and US drug sales growth declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN and US drugs sales growth decelerated rapidly during the first six
months of this year. The Japanese market continued to recover following
price cuts last year.
The European prescription drugs market, hit by healthcare reforms in Germany
and Italy, actually fell from Dollars 25.2bn (Pounds 16.3bn) to Dollars
23.4bn, although the figures were affected by exchange rates. In local
currencies, drugs sales in pharmacies in the seven largest European markets
rose only 1 per cent, according to IMS International, the specialist market
research group. That compares with 10 per cent last year.
The German market fell from Dollars 7.1bn to Dollars 6.3bn - a drop of 11
per cent in D-Mark terms.
The decline in Germany is even more serious for the research-based drugs
groups selling patented products. This is because the headline figures mask
a considerable increase in prescribing of off-patent medicines by generics
companies. The 11 per cent overall drop in sales compares with an increase
of 9 per cent in West Germany during the first six months of 1992.
Prescriptions sales in France continued to grow, up from Dollars 5.9bn to
Dollars 6.2bn, a rise of 7 per cent in local currencies in spite of
government efforts to restrict prescribing. The UK market fell in dollar
terms from Dollars 2.7bn to Dollars 2.5bn, but rose in local currencies by
11 per cent.
The US, the largest single drugs market, was sluggish, with growth of only 3
per cent, from Dollars 17.5bn to Dollars 18.5bn. That was in spite of an
ageing population and the launch of innovative products.
The Japanese market was up from Dollars 6.1bn to Dollars 7.7bn - a rise of
13 per cent.

FT  01 OCT 93 / World Trade News: S Korea finds two sides to high yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISE of the yen is proving to be a double-edged sword for South Korea,
illustrating the complexity of its economic relations with Japan.
On the one hand, South Korea is enjoying an export boom and taking business
from Japanese competitors as its price competitiveness improves with the
won's 18 per cent fall against the yen this year.
On the other, Korean companies are having to pay more for the vital Japanese
machinery and components on which their industries are highly dependent.
On the plus side, Korean shipyards expect to receive a record number of
orders in 1993 and surpass Japan as the world's biggest shipbuilder.
Car manufacturers predict that shipments could match the export peak of
576,000 vehicles reached in 1988.
The country's three main electronics companies reported that their exports
of semiconductors and consumer products rose 52 per cent during the first
half of 1993.
Analysts predict that Korea's trade balance could record a slight surplus in
1993 after four years of deficits.
Particularly encouraging is the growing number of industrial orders from
Japan, which has maintained a persistent trade surplus with Korea since it
established diplomatic ties with its former colony in 1965.
Japanese companies are buying more steel products, petrochemicals, vehicle
parts and ships from Korea.
But this does not mean that Korea's trade deficit with Japan will shrink.
'As Korea's exports increase, the more industrial parts it needs to import
from Japan,' says Mr Stephen Marvin, head of research at Jardine Fleming
Securities in Seoul.
He predicts that Korea's trade deficit with Japan will increase slightly to
Dollars 8bn in 1993 from last year's Dollars 7.9bn. The import of Japanese
machinery and components heavily outweighs Korea's trade surplus in
agricultural and consumer goods to Japan.
The trade deficit with Japan would be even larger if Korea had not virtually
banned more than 250 Japanese products, including cars and consumer
electronics, during the last two decades as part of an 'import
diversification policy'.
The rising cost of Japanese industrial equipment is also causing problems
for the Seoul government as it tries to revive the ailing economy.
It planned that industrial investments would be the main engine for boosting
domestic demand and increasing gross national product growth above last
year's 4.8 per cent, the slowest since 1980. But Korean companies are
reluctant to expand their facilities when the cost of Japanese equipment is
so high.
Korea imports 35 per cent of its machinery from Japan and 40 per cent of its
electronic components.
The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy recently estimated that the trade
deficit with Japan would grow to Dollars 9.8bn by 1998, although its ratio
to the Korean GNP would decline from 2.7 per cent to 1.5 per cent.
The reason for the persistent gap is that during Korea's rush to
industrialise in the 1960s and 1970s, it neglected to develop an adequate
network of subcontractors to supply components to the country's big
conglomerates.
In addition, Korean businessmen acknowledge that Japanese production
equipment is of superior quality and cost efficient.
The government has partly succeed in reducing dependence on Japanese
technology by promoting the local production of some capital goods.
State financing of Won588bn (Dollars 726m) in soft loans will be provided in
the next five years to small and medium-sized businesses for the development
of 3,500 machinery items and components now imported from Japan. Tax breaks
are also being offered to Korean companies that buy domestic production
equipment.
Seoul believes the long-term solution to the trade problem is the transfer
of Japanese technology to South Korea.
But Japan fears that supplying advanced technology to Korea would only
enable it to become a more formidable competitor. Mitsubishi, for example,
was dropped from the recent competition to build Korea's high-speed train
because it refused to accept Seoul's demands for technology transfers.
Although Japan has been the biggest foreign investor in Korea, it now
prefers to invest in south-east Asia and China because Korean wages are the
highest on the Asian mainland.
However, Tokyo last year agreed to help establish a Dollars 20m foundation
that would funnel technology from Japanese to Korean companies.
The action was seen as an attempt to defuse mounting criticism against Japan
for its use of Korean women as military prostitutes, or 'comfort girls',
during the second world war.
In return, Seoul agreed to allow Japanese trading houses to expand their
operations in Korea, although limiting their role to exporting Korean
products. It banned them from import activity.
It also plans to halve the number of Japanese products on the import ban
list from the current 258 items by 1998. Japan will also be given the same
intellectual property protection that Korea has granted to the EC.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRESSMAN Richard Gephardt, leader of the majority Democrats in the US
House of Representatives, has held out the possibility of measures that
would modify the North American Free Trade Agreement enough to bring him to
vote for it, writes George Graham in Washington.
Mr Gephardt last week announced that he would vote against Nafta as it
stood, since side agreements on environmental and labour issues negotiated
by President Bill Clinton still left it deficient.
However, Mr Gephardt said he was considering mechanisms to address his two
concerns about labour rights and wages in Mexico, and the financing of
environmental and infrastructure work along the US-Mexican border.
While President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico has promised an increase
in Mexico's minimum wage in line with productivity gains, Mr Gephardt said
he was looking at ways of tying wages to productivity.
For funding work along the Mexican border, Mr Gephardt said he favoured a
fee on any item that crossed the border in either direction.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government yesterday officially approved plans to import rice
so as to cope with the worst harvest since 1945, after an unusually cool
summer and a spate of typhoons.
Mr Eijiro Hata, agriculture minister, yesterday said plans to import 200,000
tonnes of rice by year-end, as an initial instalment, were among the
government's emergency measures along with financial relief for farmers.
The decision comes ahead of the visit by Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture
secretary, on October 10-13. The US government is calling for Japan to use
the rice shortage as an opportunity to open its rice market.
However, Tokyo yesterday stressed that the emergency step would not lead to
a liberalisation of the country's rice market.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said the emergency imports
were separate from the rice issue being discussed within the Uruguay Round
of multilateral trade negotiations.
The government said the rice harvest index was at a record low of 80,
against an annual average of 100. Production for the year is expected to
fall to 8m tonnes, from an annual average of 10m. Agriculture Ministry
officials have suggested that more than 1m tonnes would be imported.

FT  01 OCT 93 / World Bank to study Kenya aid squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD Bank last night announced it had agreed to chair a consultative
group meeting on Kenya in November, paving the way for an end to a two-year
aid squeeze.
In a statement last night the bank said that it was 'encouraged by the
substantial measures taken recently (by the government) and by its
commitment to continue these efforts'.
The statement followed talks this week with Kenyan officials in Washington.
Apart from steps to reduce mismanagement in the financial sector, the
measures include abolition of import licensing, curbs on money supply, moves
toward a market-driven exchange system, and reform of maize prices, said
officials of the bank.
The officials said they expected the government to complete the purge of the
banking sector while continuing to implement reforms in other sectors.
The decision marks a significant step in the return to international
respectability of President Daniel arap Moi, subjected to aid 'sanctions' in
November 1991 by donors angered by his government's economic mismanagement
and human rights abuses.
At the 1991 meeting of the consultative group in Paris, chaired by the bank,
donors announced that they were withholding their response to Kenya's
request for new assistance. Aid in the previous two years had been worth
some Dollars 1.4bn.
'Delegates made clear their willingness to support Kenya's economic
development, but stressed that levels of aid also depend on clear progress
in implementing economic and social reforms,' the donors said.
Within two weeks Mr Moi lifted the ban on multi-party politics. A general
election which followed a year later saw Mr Moi returned to power amid
opposition allegations of rigging.
In the 12 months since then Mr Moi's new cabinet has turned its attention to
a growing economic crisis, its efforts reinforced by the damaging shortfall
in vital aid flows.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO British diplomats left Baghdad yesterday, saying they saw little
prospect of an early release for three Britons jailed in Iraq for illegal
entry, Reuter reports from Baghdad.
Later in the day, Iraq organised an unprecendented news conference by two of
the Britons, but it was not immediately clear whether it pointed to any
change in their status.
'It is clearly a political issue.  Iraq is doing an injustice by detaining
them,' Mr Mark Le Goy, a consular official, told Reuter as he left for
Jordan.
Mr Paul Ride and Mr Simon Dunn, two of the prisoners, later told the new
conference at a Baghdad hotel they were victims of circumstance.
'I am a victim of the situation whereby there is an area which is disputed.
 I was allowed to proceed as a civilian into a military disputed area,
without being advised that I was approaching it or Iraq,' Mr Ride said.
The two men said Kuwaiti border guards had not stopped or warned them, but
Mr Ride added: 'There is no point in apportioning blame.'  Mr Ride, Mr Dunn
and Mr Michael Wainwright are in Abu Ghraib prison, west of Baghdad.  Mr
Ride is serving seven years and Mr Dunn eight for entering Iraq illegally
from Kuwait.
Mr Wainwright, serving 10 years for cycling in via Kurdish rebel-held areas
in the north, did not attend the new conference.  'He is a little bit
tired,' Mr Khalid Jarjees, the Britons' lawyer, said.
Iraq last week released three Swedes jailed on similar charges, after
Sweden's king had made a personal appeal to President Saddam Hussein.
Iraq has demanded that Britain unfreeze Iraqi assets in British banks, in
return for the three men's freedom.  Britain has ruled out any deal.
AP adds from Nicosia:  Convicted PLO gunman Ian Daidson, a Briton imprisoned
eight years ago for killing three Israelis here, was freed yesterday and put
on a flight to London, officials reported.
Mr Davison 35, from South Shields in north-east England, was pardoned by
Cypriot President Gladcos Clerides on Wednesday, to mark the anniversary of
the island's independence from Britain.

FT  01 OCT 93 / UN sends biggest weapons team to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROLF EKEUS, United Nations envoy, is due to arrive in Baghdad today on a
mission to persuade Iraq to begin implementing permanent, long-term UN
monitoring of its weapons programmes - agreement to which could pave the way
to the lifting of sanctions.
Mr Ekeus, head of the UN special commission on Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, will join the biggest team of weapons inspectors to visit Iraq
since the Gulf war, which yesterday began what it hopes could be a
definitive investigation of Iraq's existing weapons capabilities.
The combined UN effort - perhaps the most critical since inspections began
immediately after the war - comes amid signs that Iraq's political and
financial stamina in weathering the three-year-old sanctions may be falling,
and that President Saddam Hussein is trying with greater urgency than even
to win back the right to export Iraqi oil.
The 50-strong UN team will spend more than a month making surprise visits to
declared and undeclared weapons sites, verifying information provided by
Iraq during high-level technical talks on their military programmes held
this month at the UN in New York.
Iraq also promised to hand over details of the complex and secret
international supply network which fed its chemical, biological, ballistic
and nuclear weapons programmes before the Gulf war - data Iraq has otherwise
withheld.
Full co-operation by Iraq during the inspection could thus go a long way to
satisfying the UN that Baghdad had destroyed all weapons of mass destruction
prohibited under the terms of UN ceasefire resolution 687.  Provision of
procurement details is considered vital to prevent Iraq from rebuilding its
military machine.  'This inspection is expected to provide us with enough
information for us to close a chapter,' Ms Anne Hecht, a special commission
official, said from Bahrain.
Iraq last week agreed that video cameras, installed at two missile test
sites as part of the long-term monitoring, could be switched on - a move Mr
Ekeus made a condition of his visit to Iraq to continue the technical talks.

FT  01 OCT 93 / LDP haggles over policy in unfamiliar opposition

JAPAN'S Liberal Democratic party, which ruled for 38 years until this
summer, spent its first national convention as an opposition party haggling
over what policies should be opposed and angering its elders by proposing
that a mandatory retirement age be introduced.
The LDP has yet to come to terms with life in opposition, and the party's
confidence has been eroded by fears that public prosecutors will soon arrest
a few of its MPs for funding offences committed while in government.
Prosecutors yesterday arrested a fourth executive at Shimizu, a leading
contractor, for his role in the alleged bribery of a prefectural governor,
who has been charged with accepting Y55m (Pounds 344,000) in bribes from
another construction company, Hazama.
During the convention, Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, an LDP faction head, was
questioned by delegates over his links to a separate incident, the arrest
this week of Mr Shuntaro Honma, governor of Miyagi, north of Tokyo, for
allegedly accepting bribes from construction companies.
Mr Mitsuzuka said he was surprised that Mr Honma allegedly collected Y20m
from a construction company for a recent election, as his advice to the
governor was 'wage a clean campaign'. He now believes the party 'should
carry out a sweeping political reform'.
But one of the reforms discussed at the convention was the abolition of
factions, such as that presided over by Mr Mitsuzuka, which have
traditionally been used to raise funds for candidates and ensure that there
is an orderly queue for ministerial appointments.
Mr Yohei Kono, the party's leader, said factions would be made redundant by
the passage of political reform bills, though he is the member of a faction
himself and owes his appointment to bloc voting by factions.
The party could not agree on whether an age limit should be set for its
candidates, and Mr Kono was uncertain whether he would punish senior MPs
implicated in corruption scandals. He said the party must restore its
scandal-tainted image, but then would not commit himself to a policy to
expel members linked to scandals.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Who Knows Whom to be SA bestseller: ANC links in a
publishing joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN does a fledgling investment company with no track record, no assets to
speak of, inexperienced management and no publishing expertise become the
perfect joint venture partner in a potentially lucrative publishing deal?
When that company has the probable future government of South Africa on its
side.
Thebe Investment Corporation, a black-managed company which has strong links
with the African National Congress, this week announced it had reached
agreement with Macmillan of the UK to launch an educational publishing
company. Thebe will own 42.5 per cent of the new company, Macmillan 47.5 per
cent and an existing small black-owned publisher, Skotaville, 10 per cent.
Though all parties to the deal deny this, rivals believe that Thebe will use
its excellent contacts with the ANC to see that the new company gets
lucrative contracts to publish school textbooks - just as the ruling
National party has for decades steered important public sector contracts the
way of Afrikaner businesses which have in turn helped bankroll the party.
The party channeled state business to other members of the white tribe of
Africa, with the aim of lifting Afrikaners out of poverty and strengthening
their hold on power.
The Thebe deal has caused consternation in South African business circles,
because the only apparent rationale for it is political. Many South Africans
fear the country's new rulers will take their principles of governance
straight from the National party.
Black empowerment - the mirror image of Afrikaner upliftment - is Thebe's
primary goal, says Mr Vusi Khanyile, managing director. Mr Khanyile was
formerly head of the ANC finance department; another member of the Thebe
board, Mr Tokyo Sexwale, is a chairman of the ANC in the powerful region
around Johannesburg and is one of its most prominent leaders; a third board
member, Mr Enos Mabuza, has strong personal links to the ANC though he holds
no official position.
Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, and Mr Walter Sisulu, deputy president,
are trustees of the Batho-Batho trust, Thebe's sole shareholder.
Mr Khanyile angrily denies suggestions that Thebe is an ANC company, and
insists that the political affiliation of Thebe board members is irrelevant.
'Our links with the ANC have nothing to do with the viability of our
business or the market share it will have,' he says, denying that Macmillan
can expect privileged access to the R500m (Pounds 100m) educational
publishing market.
Still, he adds: 'Business must ensure that it is in harmony with the
environment in which it operates. Thebe tries to remain in harmony with that
environment. So we wouldn't go out of our way to make enemies with any
political organisation.'
Thebe was set up late last year, relies almost entirely on loan capital and
has been plagued by frequent press reports of financial problems and alleged
irregularities since its launch. Asked why Macmillan should strike a deal
with a company such as Thebe, Mr Khanyile says only that Thebe is the
biggest black investment company.
This claim is impossible to assess, as Thebe discloses no financial details
of its operations. In any event, Thebe is not the only black company
Macmillan could have chosen. It is simply the best connected.
Mr Christopher Paterson, chairman of Macmillan's southern African
operations, says of the deal, which will involve an initial investment of
R2m from the three partners: 'It is a conscious act to come in and redress
the balance in educational publishing by starting a company which in its
demographic make up reflects that of South Africa' and which gives a high
priority to black employment.
Other businessmen dismiss these as 'pious platitudes'. One director of a
leading corporation says: 'It's but a step to a Nigerian situation where no
business is done on commercial logic. It's all done on . . . who you know.'
'Thebe adds no value to this deal,' says another. 'It could well lend itself
to abuse.'
A disgruntled publisher adds: 'One group of nationalists are just taking
over the levers of power from another group of nationalists.' Many fear that
in this, as in other areas of public life, the new South Africa could end up
having far too much in common with the old.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S opposition coalition yesterday gave notice that it intends to
declare a debating 'showdown' over the government's proposed budget bills
next Tuesday, when the Senate resumes.
The proposed finance package - now split into eight separate bills - has
been stalled for six weeks, because the government has been unable to secure
necessary support from two minority parties - the Green party and the
Democrats - which hold the balance of power in the Senate.
In a further effort to secure the budget's passage, Mr John Dawkins, the
treasurer, has offered to phase in an increased sales tax on wine over a
five-year period, and to provide cash grants, marketing funds and some other
concessions to wine makers. The tax, as it stands, has been condemned by the
wine industry, and has been universally rejected by the opposition and the
two minority parties.
The response from the wine industry is proving mixed. Small wine makers
yesterday expressed some interest in the Dawkins compromise, while the
Winemakers Federation of Australia has rejected the deal. Mr John Hewson,
opposition leader, said the coalition would continue to hold the line on the
wine tax rise.
The government has meanwhile insisted it will delay any implementation of
the personal tax cuts contained in the budget unless the Senate passes the
proposed indirect tax increases by October 21.

<TEXT>
THE NEW ZEALAND government said yesterday it would abolish a key link with
the British legal system and perhaps follow Australia's move towards
becoming a republic, Reuter reports from Wellington.
Mr Jim Bolger, prime minister, said New Zealand would cut its legal link
with Britain's Privy Council, the highest court of appeal for New
Zealanders. 'That's something that's being talked about in New Zealand and
I'm sure we'll do that reasonably soon,' Mr Bolger said on television. 'It's
part of nationhood in the sense of being totally in control of our own
judicial system.'
But he played down comments by Foreign Minister Don McKinnon that it might
also dump the monarchy, saying: 'It's not an issue the public are excited
about in New Zealand.'
Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, has unveiled plans to abandon
the monarchy and turn his country into a republic by the year 2000. Mr
McKinnon told Radio New Zealand that Wellington might follow Australia -
'Not with the same enthusiasm, but maybe (ending) up at the same destination
a few years later.'

<TEXT>
A CHINESE man accompanied by his wife and their six-year-old son hijacked a
Chinese airliner carrying 69 people to Taiwan yesterday, the fourth such
hijacking in six months, Reuter reports from Taipei.
The man, armed with a knife and carrying two bottles of ink which he claimed
were explosives, hijacked the Sichuan Airlines jet while it was on a
domestic flight from China's northeastern city of Jinan to Guangzhou.
The couple and their son, saying they wanted asylum in Taiwan, surrendered
to police soon after the airliner landed at Taipei's international airport.
Mr Jason Hu, Taiwan government spokesman, rejecting a request by Beijing
that the hijacker be returned to China immediately, said he would be tried
for air piracy in Taiwan.
Chinese aviation officials have accused Taiwan of indirectly encouraging the
hijackings by its refusal to send the hijackers back to China, where they
would probably face the death penalty. Mr Ma Ying-jeou, Taiwanese justice
minister, indicated yesterday that the island might eventually agree to
repatriate hijackers in order to deter future incidents.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Biggest UN weapons team visits Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROLF EKEUS, United Nations envoy, is due to arrive in Baghdad today on a
mission to persuade Iraq to begin implementing permanent, long-term UN
monitoring of its weapons programmes - agreement to which could pave the way
to the lifting of sanctions.
Mr Ekeus, head of the UN special commission on Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, will join the biggest team of weapons inspectors to visit Iraq
since the Gulf war, which yesterday began what it hopes could be a
definitive investigation of Iraq's existing weapons capabilities.
The combined UN effort - perhaps the most critical since inspections began
immediately after the war - comes amid signs that Iraq's political and
financial stamina in weathering the three-year-old sanctions may be failing,
and that President Saddam Hussein is trying with greater urgency than ever
to win back the right to export Iraqi oil.
The 50-strong UN team will spend more than a month making surprise visits to
declared and undeclared weapons sites, verifying information provided by
Iraq during high-level technical talks on their military programmes held
this month at the UN in New York.
Iraq also promised to hand over details of the complex and secret
international supply network which fed its chemical, biological, ballistic
and nuclear weapons programmes before the Gulf war - data Iraq has otherwise
withheld.
Iraq last week agreed that video cameras, installed at two missile test
sites as part of the long-term monitoring, could be switched on - a move Mr
Ekeus made a condition of his visit to Iraq to continue the technical talks.
Iraq has lately made a series of gestures which suggest it is in a more
compliant mood, including Mr Saddam's recent decision to release three
Swedes jailed for illegally entering the country. There have also been hazy
indications, originating from Iraqi officials in Beijing, that Baghdad might
also free hundreds of Kuwaitis held since the Gulf war - prisoners they have
hitherto denied existed.

FT  01 OCT 93 / UN chief seeks Libyan handover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary general, was last
night seeking an undertaking from Libya to set a time and place for the
handover of two men suspected in the Lockerbie bombing. UN diplomats
yesterday said Mr Boutros Ghali wanted a commitment to hand the pair over
within two weeks.
However, the diplomats confirmed that Britain, France and the US would this
morning present a draft UN resolution calling for tougher sanctions against
Libya, given Tripoli's failure to hand over the suspects before today's
deadline, set by the three on August 13.
The resolution will be circulated around the 15-member Security Council
immediately, but is unlikely to go to a vote for up to two weeks. It calls
for the freezing of liquid Libyan assets held overseas, estimated to be
worth Dollars 6.5bn (Pounds 4.2bn), and a ban on all exports of oil transit
and refining equipment.
Mr Boutros Ghali was due last night to hold his third meeting in a week with
Mr Omar al-Muntasser, Libyan foreign minister, and hoped to receive the
undertaking in a letter from the Libyans. The meeting follows a Libyan
statement on Wednesday that the government 'had no objection' to handing
over the two men for trial in a Scottish court, but that the decision to
stand trial lay with the two men, Mr Abdel Baset Ali al-Meghrahi and Mr Amin
Khalifa Fhimah.
In Tripoli, lawyers for the two suspects said they would meet the men on
Monday or Tuesday to offer advice as to whether, in their view, the pair
would receive a fair trial in Scotland. 'It will then be up to them to
decide,' Mr Ibrahim Legwell, one of a team of defence lawyers, told Reuters.
British diplomats said last night they would become convinced of Tripoli's
willingness to submit the two men to trial only when they were physically
handed over. 'We're interested in actual activity, not just letters,' said
one.
But the sincerity of Libyan intentions was clouded slightly further
yesterday by an attack in a Tripoli newspaper on the Foreign Ministry's
stated willingness to allow the two men to be extradited.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Poll wants Patten to dilute plan
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN OPINION poll released on the eve of the meeting today between the foreign
ministers of Britain and China to discuss political proposals for Hong Kong
has indicated that the people of the territory want to see the democratic
blueprint of Governor Chris Patten proceed rapidly, but in a diluted form.
A University of Hong Kong poll found that 52.5 per cent of respondents
wanted Mr Patten to put his proposals before the Legislative Council
(Legco), the colony's parliamentary body, as planned in mid-October. Such a
move would draw an aggressive response from China. Few, however, wanted the
proposals to proceed unchanged.
While Mr Patten will be able to draw encouragement from the response,
investors continued to speculate on the fate of the proposals. The Hang Seng
Index, the main barometer of market sentiment, rose 125.12 points to an
historic high of 7,676.22 amid suggestions that Britain was preparing to
make substantial concessions to China over the Patten plans.
The stock market rise was in part a reaction to a letter sent to British
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by Mr Martin Lee, leading pro-democracy Legco
member. Mr Lee wrote: 'It is widely suspected that the British government
does not have the backbone to follow through on its moral and political
obligations to us and is on the brink of total capitulation to Beijing.'
Brokers take this as a positive sign.
Tension has been mounting ahead of the New York meeting between Mr Hurd and
Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, and the governor's address to Legco
on October 6.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Output down in Japan for 23rd month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S industrial production fell an annualised 2 per cent in August,
declining for the 23rd month in a row, the longest on record.
The decline was the smallest year-on-year drop in industrial output in any
month since March, but not as severe as the market had expected,
Yet the recovery outlook is clouded by a 0.7 per cent month-on-month rise in
inventories in August, the fourth consecutive monthly increase, said the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
This indicates that production is still ahead of weak demand, despite a
series of workforce reductions and curbs on output from Japan's largest
companies recently. Stocks of unsold air conditioners, due to an unusually
cool summer, were a factor in the inventory rise, said Miti.
'The economy is still crawling along the bottom and it is too early to say
whether it will dip again or not,' said a Miti official. Mr Geoffrey Barker,
economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, added: 'There can be no autonomous
recovery while inventory levels remain so bloated.'
Month-on-month, industrial production fell 0.7 per cent in August and is set
to creep back by 0.7 per cent in September, only to subside again by 3.5 per
cent in the following month, said Miti. The previous record for a fall in
industrial output was a 20-month run of declines in the wake of the 1973-74
oil shock.
Not every sector is in hibernation, as shown by a 10.9 per cent year-on-year
rise in housing starts for August, reported by the Construction Ministry
yesterday.
That is the 15th monthly rise running, a reflection of the fall in interest
rates and the impact of an increase in low-cost government housing loans.
Applications for state-funded mortgages doubled from April to early August.
The number of houses for sale rose 25 per cent in August after a 23.1 per
cent rise in July.
However, the growth in housebuilding was not enough to lift the construction
industry from its recession in August. Japan's top 50 contractors reported a
25 per cent decline in August orders, the seventh month running in which
they have seen order books shrink. A spate of scandals, resulting in the
arrest of executives from five leading construction companies over the past
two weeks, has dampened activity.

FT  01 OCT 93 / VW set to close Seat's Barcelona plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, the German car maker, appeared last night to be positioning
itself to shut down the Barcelona plant of its Spanish car subsidiary, Seat.
The office of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, said his deputy,
Mr Narcis Serra, had held several urgent telephone conversations already
this week with Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman. The two men are to meet
in Madrid next Thursday.
Up to 9,000 jobs would be threatened if VW were to decide, in the light of
Seat's large losses this year, to close the company's old plant near
Barcelona harbour and concentrate Seat production at its modern new factory
at Martorell, about 25km south of the Catalan capital.
The Seat crisis, which on Wednesday resulted in the resignation of the
company's chairman, Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, has come at a bad time for
the Madrid government. Mr Gonzalez's minority socialist administration is
trying to negotiate a wages pact with the main trade unions in Spain and to
win support from regional parties in Catalonia and the Basque country so as
to be able to pass its 1994 budget, presented to parliament yesterday.
Yesterday, though, the unions accused government of conniving with VW to cut
jobs.
In Barcelona, union officials promised fierce resistance to any effort to
close down the plant, which produces Seat's new Toledo and old Marbella
models.
Spanish government officials said Madrid would do everything possible to
help the plant survive, but this was likely to boil down to little more than
persuasion.
Mr Piech plans to spend several days in Spain next week to try to calm
political tempers and popular fears roused by his demands for harsh cuts at
Seat.
The fire-fighting exercise will begin at the VW headquarters in Wolfsburg
today, when leaders of Spain's most important trade unions, the UGT and
CCOO, fly in for talks.
Mr Piech and Mr Klaus Volkert, leading spokesman for the German workforce on
the group supervisory board, would explain Seat's structural and financial
problems, VW said.
Mr Daz Alvarez's 'mutually agreed' resignation was announced one day after a
VW group board meeting had rejected as insufficient his rationalisation
proposals, including a 22 per cent cut in Seat's 23,000 workforce.
VW's demands for radical and rapid action had followed the recent disclosure
that Seat was heading for an 'unexpected' DM1.25bn (Pounds 500m) loss this
year. Volkswagen undertook to inject DM1.5bn but has refused any further
financial assistance.

FT  01 OCT 93 / BMW plans workforce of 2,000 for US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BMW, the German executive and luxury carmaker, is to hire 300 production
workers in 1994 and 700 more in 1995 for its planned US car plant in
Spartanburg, South Carolina.
The company said the workforce of the manufacturing operation, its first
plant in North America, would total more than 1,200 by late 1995 and would
grow to 2,000 by the late 1990s.
The first production workers will be recruited in January and most of those
hired during 1994 will be sent for training to BMW plants in Germany.
Mr Al Kinzer, president of BMW Manufacturing, said that the basic wage of a
production worker at the Spartanburg plant would begin at Dollars 12 (Pounds
7.70) an hour and would rise to Dollars 16 an hour within 24 months. BMW
would also pay a Dollars 100 attendance bonus for 'perfect on-time
attendance' during each four-week period during the year as well as an
annual company performance bonus.
Gross wages for car workers are broadly comparable in Germany and in the US,
but German carmakers are burdened with the highest total wage costs (gross
wages plus social costs such as payroll tax) in the world motor industry.
According to the German Auto Industry Federation (VDA), German carmakers
have total wage costs of DM47 an hour (in December 1992), 37 per cent higher
than in the US at DM34.4 an hour.
Mr Kinzer said workers at the Spartanburg plant would have 10 vacation days
and 13 paid company holidays. BMW said its German workers have 30 days'
vacation and 13 public holidays.
According to the VDA German car workers clock up only 1,483 hours a year, 27
per cent fewer than the 2,022 hours worked by a US car worker.
BMW said the average gross pay for an assembly line worker at its German
plants was DM24 or Dollars 15 an hour.
The Dollars 400m plant was expected to begin production in the autumn of
1994 with output rising to 300 a day by end of 1996.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Angry workers vow to fight job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ONE thing that really irritates workers at Seat, the Spanish subsidiary of
Volkswagen, is that the parent German group even brought in soil when it
built a new plant at Martorell, 35 kilometres west of the old Seat factory
at Barcelona.
'VW changed the Spanish washroom taps at Martorell to German ones and laid
down German earth for the gardens,' Mr Inocencio Jaramillo, a Seat union
organiser, said yesterday at the main plant in Barcelona. He and the other
12,000 workers could soon be out of a job.
The gleaming Martorell plant, opened earlier this year following a Pta244bn
(Pounds 1.2bn) investment, was supposed to be the symbol of VW's future in
Spain. The Barcelona factory, now more than 40 years old, is the obsolete
symbol that VW would prefer to forget.
Although the German group has not specified the closure of the Barcelona
plant, it has indicated it wants stringent cuts in its loss-making Spanish
subsidiary. It was the failure to deliver such cuts that led to the
resignation of Seat's chairman, Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, on Wednesday.
Few at Seat doubt that the cuts mean the curtain will come down on the old
plant but the Barcelona workers are quietly confident that their cause is
not yet lost.
'VW simply cannot do it,' said Mr Jaramillo, a neatly dressed clerical
worker who held court, surrounded by boiler-suited colleagues, in the
basement offices set aside for union activities in the plant's main
administration building.
A group of Mr Jaramillo's colleagues were travelling yesterday to the VW
headquarters at Wolfsburg for meetings with chairman Mr Ferdinand Piech. 'If
he (Mr Piech) wants to close us down, he will be firmly told it is quite
impossible. We represent a political cost that neither Volkswagen nor the
Spanish government can pay for.'
The quiet determination, however, masks a very real fear that the writing is
indeed on the wall. The Barcelona plant was condemned just as soon as
Martorell, with a labour force of 6,500, came on stream.
Closure of Barcelona is such an emotional issue it can hardly be faced. The
employees who crammed into the basement office have been with Seat almost
from the start. At least half the Barcelona labour force is over 50 and all
feel proprietorial about the company.
'If we go, it is the end of Seat as a company, as a trade mark, as an
identity,' said 'Tomasn', who is a veteran, like Mr Jaramillo, of more than
20 years with the car manufacturer.
'From now on it will be just Volkwagen, perhaps that is what the Germans
always intended.'
Closure of the plant, which occupies a square kilometre of an industrial
estate called the Zona Franca (freeport), south of the city, is also a
stunning blow to Barcelona. 'We are the lungs of the Zona Franca, we keep it
going,' said Mr Jaramillo. 'Some 40,000 indirect jobs will be affected by
our closure.'
If Seat, by far the largest employer on the estate, shuts down there will be
extreme nervousness at neighbouring plants operated by Nissan and by a
subsidiary of Fiat, both of which are making heavy losses.
Seat's Barcelona workers promise 'strong, very strong, action', if the
closure is forced through. At the very least they will bring Martorell to a
'standstill'.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S regions yesterday issued a powerful challenge to President Boris
Yeltsin as the head of the Russian Orthodox Church attempted to broker a
peaceful end to the siege of the Russian parliament building.
Representatives from 62 of Russia's 88 regions demanded a lifting of the
siege, and a reversal of his decree dissolving parliament, threatening 'all
necessary measures of economic and political pressure to restore
full-blooded constitutional legality' if their demands were not met by
midnight last night.
Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai, who attended the meeting, wrote it
off as unrepresentative and therefore illegitimate. But the government is
sufficiently concerned about what is happening outside Moscow for three of
its senior members to be setting off to the Far East, Siberia, and southern
Russia.
Potentially more significant than the unrealistic midnight deadline was the
regional officials' announcement they planned to form a Federation Council
which would supplant a similar body foreseen by Mr Yeltsin as the unelected
upper chamber of a new parliament.
They reserved for it alone the right to endorse changes to the Soviet-era
constitution to organise a new bicameral assembly, and to convene and
monitor simultaneous elections of both president and parliament. Formally,
they said it would be up to the parliament to agree to its own dissolution
and set a date for elections.
Holed up inside the White House in Moscow, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the
parliament's speaker, said that 'everything would now be decided by the
regions'. It emerged yesterday that Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi had
contacted both Aleksy II, the Russian patriarch, and the regional leaders,
seeking their mediation.
Mr Yeltsin yesterday repeated that he would not repeal his decree but did
meet the patriarch, and a close aide, Mr Gennady Burbulis, said all means
had to be found to secure a dignified exit from the White House for Mr
Khasbulatov and Mr Rutskoi.
In an attempt to keep up popular support despite unpopular economic measures
such as freeing bread prices, Mr Yeltsin increased social security payments
81 per cent yesterday. Continuing to woo the deputies, he issued
instructions guaranteeing each a job in his administration.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Bosch workers agree to surrender fringe benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT BOSCH, the electrical and engineering group, has struck a
ground-breaking bargain with its German workforce which will cut employees'
fringe benefits and other 'voluntary' payments by around DM180m (Pounds 72m)
a year.
The deal, announced yesterday, will hearten other leading industrial
companies which are negotiating for similar payroll savings with engineering
union officials.
The Bosch settlement followed eight months of discussions and intermittent
protest strikes aimed at reducing personnel costs by DM250m a year. The
group has already acted to cut materials and capital costs by a similar
amount.
Around DM70m was saved in April when directors' and non-unionised employees'
salaries were cut, and management unilaterally announced that a previously
agreed 3 per cent rise for hourly-paid workers would apply only to the basic
rate. Annual increments are usually applied to the total pay package.
Yesterday's agreement included cuts in shift premiums and canteen subsidies,
and spelt the end of interest-free home loans and spa cures at the company's
expense.
Although Bosch calculates that social, educational and other benefits and
bonuses will still cost it DM750m a year, the settlement marks an important
breakthrough in industry's efforts to restrain costs.
Success at Bosch, Germany's leading vehicle component supplier, will raise
hopes of progress in generally secret negotiations under way, especially in
the motor industry.
Germany's biggest union, IG Metall, has over the years negotiated a
substantial array of costly benefits for its membership, which are now under
scrutiny as management seeks to restore competitiveness.
These include free travel to work, anniversary bonuses, cures for paintshop
workers, beer allowances, extra sick pay and an extra month's payment at
Christmas. Also under debate are the day-long workers' assemblies, usually
held at least twice a year, in which production stops entirely.
The opening of negotiations in the Daimler-Benz group has already been
marked by protest strikes. On Tuesday this week more than half the workforce
at its Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary downed tools for an hour.
Similar moves by the government have also stirred unrest. IG
Bau-Steine-Erden, the construction industry union, for example, has called a
nationwide demonstration for this Saturday against Bonn's plans to cut
benefits paid when site work is stopped by bad weather.

BOSNIA is 'looking into the jaws' of a humanitarian disaster this winter,
the United Nations said yesterday, warning that its aid operation for the
former Yugoslavia faced a cash shortfall of more than 50 per cent.
The warning comes amid fears that the Bosnian parliament's virtual rejection
of the peace proposals on Wednesday will set off further fighting across the
region.
In an effort to salvage the peace process, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg, the international mediators, yesterday met in Geneva and spoke
to Bosnian, US and UN representatives.
The Bosnian parliament has said it will accept the peace deal, which would
turn Bosnia into a loose union of three ethnic mini-states, only if land
seized by force is returned.
Diplomats warned that it was uncertain whether the mediators could produce
fresh diplomatic initiatives rapidly. The reponse from the Serb and Croat
leaders remained unclear.
Although UN sanctions against Serbia have left the Serb leaders in Belgrade
keen for a settlement, the Serbs have insisted they will not yield any more
land.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said the Serbs would continue to
build their state. He accused the Bosnian Moslems of seeking to stall the
process.
As tensions rose across Bosnia, Gen Rasim Delic, commander of the
Moslem-dominated Bosnian army, yesterday said he had ordered his troops to
cease military actions against the Croats.
Most ceasefires to date in Bosnia have broken down rapidly, and some
observers suggested that the move might have been prompted by fears of a
renewed Serb assault.
As Serb forces renewed their sporadic shelling of Sarajevo, Gen Delic warned
that Serb forces were massing in northern and eastern Bosnia.
Meanwhile, the Bosnian government also appeared to be under fresh attack
from its own people, after thousands of Bosnian Moslems had taken to the
streets in the north-western enclave of Bihac to protest against a military
crackdown ordered by Bosnian President Alia Izetbegovic after Mr Fikret
Abdic, Bihac's leader and Mr Izetbegovic's rival, declared the enclave
autonomous.
Bosnian troops were reported to be advancing on the town of Cazin, where
civilians had seized the local radio station in a gesture of defiance
against Mr Izetbegovic.
Yugoslavia today will strike six zeros from its dinar notes because of
soaring inflation. After the redenomination, 1m dinars will be equivalent to
one dinar. One kilogramme of meat yesterday cost 20bn dinars (DM10 or Pounds
4.10).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has revised
downward its growth estimates for the US, Japan and Germany, three stalled
motors of international economic activity, Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Jean-Claude Paye, OECD secretary general, told the Council of Europe's
parliament in Strasbourg yesterday that a feeling of disappointment summed
up the present situation among the 24 OECD nations.
In the US, gross domestic product was forecast to grow 3 per cent next year,
taking into account inflation, rather than the 3.1 per cent forecast
published in June.
This growth relied on an upturn in foreign demand, Mr Paye said.
The Japanese scenario was much bleaker, he said. Instead of the forecast
3.25 per cent real GDP growth in the second half of this year, the OECD now
sees stagnation and growth of only 2 per cent for 1994.
This contrasts with a forecast increase in activity next year of 3.3 per
cent.
German growth next year has been drastically marked down to not more than
0.5 per cent from the 1.4 per cent earlier forecast.
The other European nations would see mediocre performance.
Mr Paye pointed to the apparent failure of the US and European models of
economic life in sustaining growth and jobs.
In the US, labour was highly mobile and competition speeded adjustments. In
Europe, governments were more interventionist and there was a
long-established social security system.
But there has been a stagnation or even deterioration in US average living
standards and more than 30m people were classed as poor.
In Europe, unemployment was rising everywhere.
Mr Paye said it was vital that OECD countries' policies should succeed
otherwise, 'Fear of the future will continue to hold sway.'

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PROGRAMME to fight rising crime, announced yesterday by Germany's interior
minister, Mr Manfred Kanther, has sparked virulent protests from the liberal
Free Democrats, adding to strains on the coalition government.
The programme, which Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his allies hope to put to
parliament in the autumn, aims to strengthen police forces and improve
co-ordination between them and security agencies.
Crime, from small burglaries to operations by organised gangs and growing
numbers of racist attacks, is expected to be a big issue in next year's
elections.
The measures, however, include permission to place listening devices in the
homes of suspects and allowing policemen, acting as undercover agents, to be
involved in criminal actions, steps which threaten to further divide the
Bonn coalition, already weakened by disputes over the choice of a
presidential candidate and a healthcare plan for the elderly.
The Free Democrats (FDP), junior partners in the coalition, are struggling
to sharpen their party's profile, and hope their opposition to the measures
will tap into the historical suspicions of many Germans about strengthening
the security forces and about state surveillance of individuals.
'We are convinced that some essential legal principles should not be given
up,' Mr Burkhard Hirsch, FDP deputy responsible for domestic security, said
yesterday. 'It is a populist simplification to fight crime by passing more
laws and closing your eyes to the causes behind it.'
The FDP also opposes plans for tougher penal sanctions against criminals
under 21 in order to deter delinquents from crime and clamp down on racial
violence. It argues that racial violence can only be tackled by changing the
status of foreigners in Germany and devising an immigration policy - an
issue on which conservative members of the government refuse to move.

SARAJEVO
Requiring food aid: 380,000. Being delivered: 78%
Most of Sarajevo's food aid has got through in recent months, but the city
is critically short of fuel: 85 per cent of the population depends on
nautral gas, and the city's water pumps depend on electricity.
SOUTHERN BOSNIA AND HERCEGOVINA
Requiring food aid: 335,000; being delivered: 21%
The situation here is criitical, aid agencies say, with fighting between
Moslem and Croat forces blocking most deliveries. The Split warehouse has
stockpiled food, but agencies warn of disaster in cities like Mostar if
fighting continues.
CENTRAL BOSNIA AND TUZLA
Requiring food aid: 740,000; being delivered: 48%
The Tuzla region is relatively stable, but there is strong concern about
Tesanj and Maglaj, where up to 150,000 Moslems have been cut by Serb forces.
Clashes between Moslem and Croat forces have also isolated many communities,
with critical situations reported in Jablanica, Zenica, Vitez and Vares.
EASTERN BOSNIA
Requiring food aid: 336,000; being delivered: 69%
A considerable proportion of the aid supplied from Belgrade is getting
through. However, clashes between Moslem and Serb forces around the Moslem
enclaves of Zepa, Goradze and Srebrenica have blocked some convoys, and all
these towns are seriously overcrowded with refugees, with the water supply
in Srebrenica reportedly serious.
BANJA LUKA AND BIHAC
Requiring food aid: 489,000; being delivered: 78%
The situation is relatively stable, with most food aid supplied from Zagreb
reacing the area. Concern remains, however, about continuing harrasment of
the Moslem population in Serb-held Banja Luka and the presence of a large
refugee population.

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AN UPHILL STRUGGLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE humanitarian crisis this winter is likely to be considerably worse than
last year if the Bosnian war continues, UN agencies warned yesterday. Nearly
3m people in Bosnia, twice as many as last winter, are expected to need food
and shelter aid: the numbers are rising each day as fighting isolates more
communities. But agencies say they remain short of funding. Food aid alone
in the former Yugoslavia is projected to cost Dollars 1.7m (Pounds 1.1m) a
day, with the total bill for emergency aid expected to be nearly Dollars
500m, half for Bosnia. 'Last winter the weather was fairly mild and people
had reserves of food and energy,' says Mr Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for the
UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Sarajevo. 'This winter they are
exhausted, and the situation will be far worse.'
CLOTHING AND SHELTER
The UNHCR estimates that 500,000 people will need 'winter relief items'  -
3,500 tents, 3.6m sq m of plastic sheeting, 396,000 mattresses, 4m candles,
800,000 pairs of socks, and sweaters, gloves, vests and shoes for 400,000
people. With only Dollars 43m received of the Dollars 68m needed, there are
severe shortages of clothes.
FUEL
With most electricity and gas supplies in the region cut, and distribution
of diesel hampered by fighting, lack of fuel will be one of the most
critical problems this winter, particularly in the cities. Sarajevo alone,
which has no stocks of coal, is estimated to need 80,000 tonnes of coal.
FOOD
The UN's World Food Programme estimates that 2.7m people will require food
aid for the next six months: more than 260,000 tonnes of wheat flour, oil,
biscuits, meat, fish, salt and sugar.
The cost, including one month's emergency stocks, will be Dollars 200m.
Donations of wheat have left the WFP with sufficient carbohydrates for the
next three months but only 50 per cent of the necessary high-protein foods,
and little stocks for beyond January.
Although the food is stacked in warehouses in Split, Zagreb and Belgrade,
the WFP has been unable to build up stocks in crisis spots, and fighting in
central Bosnia has already prompted reports of imminent starvation in some
isolated communities.
SEEDS
The UNHCR has distributed nearly 4,000 tonnes of vegetable and wheat seeds
which could feed 900,000 people when the harvested next summer. But fighting
has prevented the distribution and sowing of some of the seed, which needs
to be planted by early October.
MEDICAL SUPPLIES
Recent outbreaks of hepatitis have left the World Health Organisation
alarmed about the deterioration in health conditions. About 1m people have
lice or other health problems arising from lack of hygiene and water.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUNNING the European Community presidency for the first half of next year
will be the first important foreign policy test for the new Greek government
after the October 10 election.
With the opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement holding a steady lead in
opinion polls, anxieties about Greek obstructiveness in Community affairs,
frequent under previous Socialist administrations, are reviving. Independent
polls predict Pasok will win up to 44 per cent of the vote, against 41 per
cent for the conservative New Democracy party, enough for a working majority
in parliament.
However, the timing of the election, six months earlier than expected, has
relieved European Commission officials. A disruptive election campaign and
probable change of government midway though the Greek presidency loomed as a
nightmare scenario in Brussels.
If the Socialists return to power, the first question will be whether Mr
Andreas Papandreou, the Pasok leader, will have the stamina to make the
rounds of EC capitals and be an effective chairman of next year's summit on
Corfu. In 1988, when Greece last held the EC presidency, a shaky-looking Mr
Papandreou, recovering from heart surgery, called an early halt to
proceedings.
Mr Papandreou will have to work hard in any case to reassure Greece's EC
partners that his new-found enthusiasm for European economic union, a
central theme of his campaign speeches, is more than a convenient election
tactic.
Still, the constraints of being the EC's poorest member, together with
Greece's commitment, accepted by Pasok, to meeting the Maastricht targets
for economic convergence, should make a new Socialist government more
co-operative than its predecessors.
Greece is unlikely to stop raising difficulties over regional issues. It
will go on blocking attempts to unfreeze Ecu400m (Pounds 306m) in EC aid to
Turkey under the Fourth Financial Protocol and will do its utmost to prevent
full diplomatic recognition of the ex-Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
However, regardless of the election outcome, Greece's dependence on EC
transfers to shore up its current account and provide the bulk of
co-financing for public investment projects will mean that Greek
policymakers will think twice before straying far from the Commission's
agenda for 1994.
Moreover, the presidency will coincide with efforts to speed transfers from
the Delors II package of infrastructure funding, from which Greece hopes to
get almost Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13bn) over the next six years.
Greece's own priority for the presidency will be to push for a co-ordinated
EC policy on the Balkans, and to help develop communications and economic
co-operation.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Changeover at the Bundesbank: Tietmeyer - high priest of
hard money / FT writers report on the significance of today's handover of
the Bundesbank presidency. For the guests gathered amid the dignified
surroundings of Frankfurt's Palm House, the key issue can be summed up in
one word - power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, PETER NORMAN, QUENTIN PEEL and CHRIS PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A grandiloquent ceremony of speech-making and chamber music in Frankfurt
today, Mr Hans Tietmeyer takes the helm of the institution which has become
the dominant force in European economic policy-making.
The audience for his inaugural address as president of the German Bundesbank
will include Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a dozen foreign central bank governors,
and top names in German business and finance.
In attendance, too, will be several of Mr Tietmeyer's eight surviving
brothers and sisters from his clannishly Catholic birthplace in Westphalia,
on the north German plains.
For many of the 750 guests in the dignified botanical surroundings of the
19th century Palm House in Frankfurt, the key issue can be summed up in one
word: power.
As Germany struggles with its deepest post-war recession, and the EC
weathers the aftermath of the summer monetary crisis, how Mr Tietmeyer
deploys the Bundesbank's might is a question that occupies the whole of
Europe.
Of massive build and earnest countenance, Mr Tietmeyer, 62, a one-time altar
boy, aspired in his youth to become a priest.
Mr Tietmeyer believes that the Bundesbank's authority is spiritual as well
as temporal. It stems from moral prowess as well as economic muscle.
At present, however, Europe is experiencing pain rather than salvation from
the Bundesbank's crusade to stem the inflationary consequences of German
unification.
At the pinnacle of a 30-year career near to the apex of German
policy-making, Mr Tietmeyer has acquired a fearsome reputation for tireless
intellect and missionary zeal. He knows that, today, his words will be
weighed with unusual attention well beyond united Germany's borders.
Those expecting significant changes from the Bundesbank are, however, likely
to be disappointed. Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, the Dresdner Bank chairman, sums up
the general feeling: 'I expect the continuation of a solid monetary policy
aimed at preserving stability.'
Mr Tietmeyer has been a member of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats since 1960.
He joined the Bonn Economics Ministry in 1962, the penultimate year of the
stewardship of Mr Ludwig Erhard, the economics minister during the post-war
'economic miracle'. He served for eight years as state secretary in the Bonn
Finance Ministry when Mr Kohl took over from Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in
1982. He went to the Bundesbank in 1990, and in August 1991 he became
Bundesbank vice-president under Mr Helmut Schlesinger, who officially bows
out at today's ceremony.
A man who can appear in turn both outspoken and enigmatic, Mr Tietmeyer
displays the best-known characteristic of his native Westphalia:
stubbornness. He prefers, however, to call the quality 'steadfastness' or
'persistence'. And he can combine it, where necessary, with subtlety,
eloquence and flexibility.
His true feelings are often a mystery. Professor Karl Schiller, economics
minister between 1966 and 1972, who built up a good relationship with Mr
Tietmeyer, calls him 'an extrovert'. On the other hand, one Frankfurt banker
who knows him well calls him humourless and impersonal - 'a cold fish'. In
negotiations, he switches character depending on whether he is speaking
compliantly, in English, or aggressively, in German. Perhaps because of
this, the verdict of Mr Anthony Loehnis, a former international director at
the Bank of England  - who converses with Mr Tietmeyer in English - is
flattering. 'Unlike many Germans,' says Mr Loehnis, 'he has a sense of
humour.'
Mr Tietmeyer combines Mr Schlesinger's economic expertise with the political
skills and international experience of Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the previous
president, who resigned in 1991 after a row with Mr Kohl over financing
German unification.
An adviser from a large US investment fund who knows Mr Tietmeyer well says:
'He is much more internationally and politically sensitive than Schlesinger,
with a clear sense of the inter-connections between Germany and the rest of
Europe and the rest of the world . . . He has a sense of things which
Schlesinger never talked of except when referring to Tietmeyer speeches.'
So far at the Bundesbank he has been highly cautious. In contrast to both Mr
Schlesinger and Mr Pohl, he has not so far upset the foreign exchange
markets through careless remarks on the D-Mark - an achievement in which he
takes some pride.
On the other hand, Mr Tietmeyer is well known for his penchant for lecturing
people (including, on occasion, Mr Kohl) and for bluntness in international
gatherings. He shows most irritation when Italian officials reprimand the
Germans over excess government spending.
During the ERM crisis meetings two months ago in Brussels, he announced
sarcastically that the French appeal for unlimited intervention to save the
franc was tantamount to asking for the Bundesbank to be closed down.
He finds his belief in the virtues of free enterprise best expressed by Mr
Erhard's doctrine of the social market economy - where a capitalist state,
with a controlled 'safety net' for the underprivileged, is held as the best
method of maintaining social stability.
There is a touch of piety in an autobiographical note written for his
leaving examination in 1952 at the Catholic high school he attended in
Munster not far from his birthplace.
The young Tietmeyer declared himself 'interested in public life' and eager
'to build up the state (of the federal republic).' As a 22-year-old, he
started to study theology before switching to philosophy and economics. Dr
Wilhelm Schmulling, aged 80, Mr Tietmeyer's former class teacher, remembers
him as 'hard-working' and 'co-operative' but adds: 'I never thought he would
become Bundesbank president.'
Mr Tietmeyer likes to stress a strong ethical dimension to Bundesbank
policies. Comparing the differences between the UK's relatively settled
history, and Germany's past vicissitudes, Mr Tietmeyer once said: 'You have
the House of Lords, the Queen and your established traditions. . . We have
the Bundesbank as our pillar of stability.' Mr Heinrich Tietmeyer, a younger
brother, himself a priest, says the new Bundesbank president believes that
'keeping the D-Mark stable is part of keeping people stable'.
Mr Tietmeyer has the reputation and the appearance of a quintessential hard
money man; the Bundesbank's traditions, indeed, allow him little doctrinal
leeway. But if Germany's 3.6m unemployment continues to rise, his personal
dilemma over the need to cut interest rates may be more acute than generally
recognised.
However, as a sign of Mr Tietmeyer's relative flexibility on interest rates,
he suggested a  1/4 point cut in the German discount rate at the crucial
meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making central bank council on July 29.
This was designed to help counter pressure on the French franc. Mr
Tietmeyer's proposal, backed by several other members of the council, was
turned down, however, by Mr Schlesinger.
As this example illustrates, Mr Tietmeyer faces a formidable array of tasks.
He must bring down Germany's unusually high 4 per cent inflation rate and
keep the D-Mark stable, at a time when many economists believe German
industry's competitiveness problems warrant a lower currency level.
He must use his influence with Mr Kohl to help restore order to Germany's
public finances, and at the same time attempt to build EC monetary
co-operation.
He must also win co-operation from the Bundesbank's sometimes fractious
16-man policy-making council, where each member has the same one vote as the
president.
Mr Otto Schlecht, a former state secretary at the Economics Ministry, says
Mr Tietmeyer's capacity for hard work can be a weakness. 'He has a problem
in working in a team. . . He doesn't delegate.'
He warns Mr Tietmeyer against trying to 'dominate' the Bundesbank council.
'Otherwise, they will become obstinate.'
He does not come to the job untrained or without connections. Among his
former political proteges are Mr Johannes Ludewig, the economic adviser to
Chancellor Kohl, Mr Horst Kohler, his successor as state secretary in the
finance ministry - who now presides over the German savings bank federation
 -and Mr Gert Haller, the ministry's present state secretary.
He played a leading role in drawing up Bonn's policies on economic and
monetary union (Emu) during the past two decades. His work on early EC plans
for Emu in 1970-72 convinced him that monetary union would only be feasible
if Community states showed far more convergence, not just in economic
policies and performance, but in economic structures.
In 1982, he was the main author of a strategy paper by the then economics
minister, Mr Otto Lambsdorff, which warned that welfare spending under Mr
Schmidt's government was threatening to run out of control. This paper
contributed to the collapse of Mr Schmidt's coalition.
In 1988, he escaped an assassination attempt outside his house in a Bonn
suburb. In 1990, he was chosen by Mr Kohl to lead negotiations on the
introduction of the D-Mark into east Germany. By prompting the collapse of
industry east of the Elbe, necessitating massive fiscal transfers to eastern
Germany, the terms of the 1990 accord greatly contributed to the sharp rise
in the German budget deficit which the Bundesbank now so abhors. He has
since admitted that mistakes were made in the unity deal - but adds that, if
Bonn had pressed for full disclosure of the east German economic malaise,
the political will for unity would have ebbed.
Mr Tietmeyer's former actions in Bonn have an echo in other policy areas,
too. Mr Kohl's latest appeals for 'solidarity' to finance German unity bear
marks of Mr Tietmeyer's thinking from the late 1960s, when he consistently
argued for 'social dialogue' between the forces of capital, labour and
politics.
On the international economic circuit, Mr Tietmeyer has been almost equally
active. 'He is one of the big men of his time,' says one senior
international economic official.
Since 1990, Mr Tietmeyer has chaired meetings of the so-called 'working
party three' of central bankers and treasury officials at the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. According to Mr Kumiharu
Shigehara, the OECD's chief economist, 'he was one of the best chairmen I
remember', although he could occasionally be 'a bit harsh'. Over the EC's
negotiations on Emu, Mr Tietmeyer will be 'extraordinarily vigilant',
according to one top Bonn official.
One area in which, embarrassingly for the Bank of England, he was proved
right concerned Britain's entry to the ERM in October 1990. At the outset,
Mr Tietmeyer - like Mr Pohl - forcefully told the UK government that the
pound's level against the D-Mark was too high. When sterling was forced out
of the ERM in September 1992, his argument seemed to have carried the day.
His relationship with the main advocate of Emu, Mr Jacques Delors, the EC
Commission president, is adversarial - partly reflecting Mr Tietmeyer's
period in 1984-87 as chairman of the EC monetary committee, when Mr Delors
would undermine positions taken by the committee.
Over the 'convergence criteria' laid down to guide the path to Emu under the
Maastricht treaty, the Bonn official says: 'He will be very, very attentive
to any deviations from the path of Islam. . . He is completely humourless on
the subject of Emu.'
His concern about monetary union is that only the 'right countries' should
join, the official adds. Despite the summer upheavals, the EC still plans to
go ahead with the so-called stage two of Emu next year, under which a new
European Monetary Institute will be set up to co-ordinate EC monetary
policy.
However, Mr Tietmeyer's basic aim is to ensure that stage two will not water
down the Bundesbank's autonomy to set German monetary policy as it sees fit.
Although he sees the advantages of exchange rate stability, he said recently
his main commitment is to internal rather than external monetary stability.
Of crucial importance will be Mr Tietmeyer's relationship with Mr Kohl. Mr
Tietmeyer acted as the chancellor's 'sherpa' preparing economic summits
during the 1980s.
But, partly because of his propensity for sermonising, the chancellor got on
better with Mr Tietmeyer's successor as finance ministry state secretary,
the more emotional Mr Horst Kohler.
Hopes - or fears - that Mr Kohl will have an undue influence on Mr Tietmeyer
are, however, unlikely to be realised. 'It is accepted by everyone that he
is a Bundesbank man,' says one central banker.
Mr Kohl knows that any attempt to put overt pressure on Mr Tietmeyer is
likely to be counter-productive. None the less, there remains a lingering
feeling that the relationship between Bonn and Frankfurt will be closer than
in the past. According to a top Bonn official who is close to both Mr Kohl
and the new Bundesbank president: 'Tietmeyer will forget his Bonn past - but
only as much as he needs to.'

FT  01 OCT 93 / Changeover at the Bundesbank: Secretive society of Germany's
listening bank - Mr Tietmeyer will require diplomacy rather than an
autocratic hand to lead the Bundesbank council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANALYSING the mood and inclinations of the 16-member Bundesbank council that
meets bi-weekly to discuss interest rate policies has become increasingly
complex.
Among the line-up are four professors, three former finance ministers in
state governments, and two one-time journalists. Most members have had
previous careers as public functionaries (Beamte) - but only three have
risen from Bundesbank ranks.
Made up of the seven-man directorate, headed by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, and nine
chairmen of the regional central banks from the German Lander (states), the
council has an average age of 59. Only one woman has ever sat on the
Bundesbank council, and she left five years ago. Each member has one vote
and the independent-minded regional bank chairmen have shown a growing
tendency to counter the views of the directorate.
The council's deliberations are normally kept secret. Formal minutes are
released after 30 years. However, for the past decade the council has only
kept approximate minutes.
The present council is relatively inexperienced - half have sat on the board
for two years or less - which could aid Mr Tietmeyer's efforts to wield
control. On the other hand, the new president, said by critics to be a poor
communicator, will need to launch a diplomatic offensive to win council
members over to his side.
One view circulating in Frankfurt is that the sometimes autocratic Mr
Tietmeyer will try to force his views on the board, which could turn some of
the more rebellious members against him.
On the other hand, Bundesbank officials warn against over-estimating the
significance of the change of presidency. One member of the council says:
'To speak of controlling the board is not correct. No president can force
discipline on us. . . Everyone has his own ego.' Of the 16-man board, one
seat - in Hamburg - is vacant, but is being filled for the time being by the
regional bank's vice-president, Mr Hans-Jurgen Siegmund.
Only one board member, the new Bundesbank vice-president, Mr Johann Wilhelm
Gaddum, 63, has had mainstream private-sector business experience. He once
headed his family oil trading business.
However, two other directorate members, Mr Gunter Storch and Mr Edgar
Meister, are former public-sector commercial bankers. Mr Horst Schulmann,
60, the head of the Hesse regional central bank, had a spell working for the
steel group Hoesch.
While directorate members are chosen by the Bonn government, regional
central bank chiefs are selected by state governments. Nominations are made
on the basis of politics as much as competence. The somewhat colourless Mr
Gaddum is a former Christian Democrat (CDU) politician and long-standing
friend of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Mr Gaddum's appointment as No 2 to Mr Tietmeyer - also from the CDU -
countered the long-standing tradition of drawing president and
vice-president from the ranks of both the government and opposition. Mr
Schulmann, a former personal adviser to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and state
secretary in the Bonn Finance Ministry until the change of government in
1982, is believed to have been offered the job, but turned it down.
This may have been partly for personal reasons, since Mr Tietmeyer took his
state secretary job in Bonn when Mr Kohl became chancellor in 1982.
Other strong figures on the board are Professor Reimut Jochimsen, 60, the
Social Democrat regional bank president from North Rhine-Westphalia, and Mr
Lothar Muller, 66, the hawkish head of Bavaria's regional bank, who after 14
years on the council is now its longest-serving member.
Mr Jochimsen's independent views have occasionally alienated Mr Schlesinger,
the former president. Mr Jochimsen was mooted as a candidate to become
deputy under Mr Tietmeyer, but Chancellor Kohl is believed to have turned
down the idea because of Mr Jochimsen's sceptical statements about the
Maastricht treaty.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Death toll in Indian quake climbs to 10,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 100,000 army and police personnel were deployed in rescue operations
yesterday after an earthquake rocked the Indian states of Maharashtra and
Karnataka, killing 10,000 people and injuring at least that many, according
to Indian television.
Some reports put the death toll as high as 16,000. Thousands are feared
trapped under the debris of their homes.
The earthquake, measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale, hit an area seldom
affected by severe seismological disturbances. Its epicentre was in the
border region of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, but the impact
was felt over a vast area covering six other states.
The quake was followed by six milder aftershocks. In the cities of Bombay
and Hyderabad, people rushed from their homes in the pre-dawn darkness.
The populations of entire villages in the economically backward rural
districts of Osmanabad and Latur in western Maharashtra were wiped out when
villagers were crushed under their mud and brick huts as they slept. The
area is drought-prone but small farmers, growing mostly millet, had a good
monsoon season this year.
Although the worst-hit areas are too poor to have an effect on the country's
economy, disruption may affect the sugar cane and industrial belt of
Ahmednagar district.
Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma appealed to voluntary organisations to
help in the government's relief efforts for what is Maharashtra's worst-ever
disaster, and the world's fourth-worst earthquake in the past decade.
Neighbouring Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars since
independence in 1947, offered to send help. Acting President Wasim Sajjad
and Mr Moeen Qureshi, caretaker prime minister, sent messages to their
Indian counterparts to express sympathy.
Western aid agencies were yesterday launching relief appeals The
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies sent
Dollars 66,000 (Pounds 42,857) in emergency funds and Christian Aid Pounds
50,000. Medical and food supplies in the region were said to be short.
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, pledged Rs20m (Pounds 420,000)
from a government relief fund. A crisis management group under the
chairmanship of Mr Zafar Saifullah, the cabinet secretary, met in New Delhi
to co-ordinate relief work. Mr Rao said he would visit the area as soon as
he was certain his presence did not impede relief operations.
India's last big earthquake was in the hills of Uttarkashi in the north on
October 20 1991, when 1,500 people died.
The worst earthquake on record in the subcontinent was in 1935, killing
30,000 in Quetta, in present-day Pakistan.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Big pensions reforms urged: Goode report calls for industry
watchdog and compensation scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEEPING reforms of the way occupational pension schemes are governed were
recommended yesterday by a government advisory committee appointed in the
aftermath of the Maxwell pensions scandal.
In a 1,000-page document, which was given a broad welcome from employers and
pensions groups, Professor Roy Goode, chairman of the committee, recommends
a law spelling out for the first time how schemes should operate and a
compensation scheme covering fraud, misappropriation and theft. It suggests
compensation be financed by a levy on all occupational pension schemes.
It also urges the creation of an industry regulator, minimum solvency
requirements and representation for scheme members on boards of trustees.
However, it stops far short of curbing employers' use of contributions
'holidays' or requiring them to help pensions keep pace with inflation, and
would allow them to wind up schemes that become too expensive in the future.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said the government would
consider the recommendations contained in the Pensions Law Review Committee
report. It would be 'inconceivable' for legislation to be introduced before
the 1994-95 parliamentary session, he said.
Mr Lilley added: 'The government is keen to encourage greater private
pension provision and to maintain the positive contribution which company
pension schemes have made. We will wish to take whatever steps are necessary
to re-establish confidence that the structure of occupational pension
schemes is secure, stable and fair to all.'
Welcoming the report, the Confederation of British Industry said it struck
'the right balance between improving the position of scheme members and the
security of benefits on the one hand and the interests of employers - who
underwrite most of the obligations - on the other'.
Mr Ron Amy, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, the
industry trade body, said there was nothing in the report likely to prompt
employers to abandon final salary pension schemes - which promise pensioners
a proportion of their final salary upon retirement - in favour of money
purchase schemes. Those simply promise that a sum of money will be invested
annually on an employee's behalf.
'I don't think this will accelerate the move to defined contribution
schemes. That is already happening on its own for employers for whom it is
appropriate.'
Employers' groups had warned the committee, made up mainly of their
professional pension advisers, that radical proposals would cause
final-salary schemes to be abandoned. Such schemes are seen as the most
secure form of retirement provision.
However, the actuarial profession sounded alarm-bells over the report's
recommendation that a fund's assets should always equal the cost of meeting
all existing pension promises if it were wound up immediately.
That might prompt schemes to switch their assets out of equities - in which
they are largely invested - to lower-yielding UK government gilts. 'There is
a serious risk that the equities market would plummet,' said Mr Roger Key,
partner at consulting actuaries R Watson and Sons.
Explaining the report's objectives, Prof Goode said: 'Our concern is to
provide a system which is fair and secure and practical and not too
difficult to administer.'
Prof Goode said some issues had proved particularly difficult to resolve.
Among them was a suggestion that employees who left schemes before
retirement - the vast majority of members - should be entitled to better
protection against inflation.
The committee was also particularly divided over the suggestion that an
industry compensation scheme should also cover poor investment performance
or maladministration. Both, in the end, were rejected.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Gummer advocates one-tier local government structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLAND'S two-tier local government structure should be replaced with a
series of unitary authorities, even if it costs more than the present
system, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, announced yesterday.
He also said that the Local Government Commission for England would complete
its work next year, having previously been due to finish in 1997. The
commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, former director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry, has already recommended the abolition of
three county councils.
Mr Gummer said he wanted unitary authorities because 'it's much clearer
where the responsibility lies'.
The measures alarmed business leaders and led to angry opposition from
county councils, which said transition costs might reach more than Pounds
1bn. Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants used by the commission, produced figures
suggesting that the transition costs for small unitary authorities might be
prohibitive.
District councils, which have campaigned for unitary - or single-tier -
authorities on existing boundaries, reacted positively.
Mr Gummer announced the shift by changing the policy guidance to the
commission, with the effect that: Retaining the existing two-tier structure
is now expected to be 'the exception'. 'Local consensus' is now important,
and the commission is to give 'particular weight' to proposals jointly put
forward by groups of authorities.
The importance of cost has been downgraded and the commission is not now
'precluded from recommending an option which would be marginally more
expensive than the status quo'.
'Very large' unitary authorities will need 'special justification in terms
of community identity'. Statutory and voluntary joint arrangements between
authorities can now be recommended for strategic planning.
The CBI welcomed the 'shorter period of uncertainty', but described the
revised guidance as 'fuzzy'. It said local businesses had consistently put
cost and quality of local services at the top of their list.
Mrs Josie Farrington, deputy chairman of the Association of County Councils
said: 'The case for changing local-government structure has yet to be made.
The proposals assume it has.'
But the Association of District Councils was 'delighted'. Mr Geoffrey
Filkin, chief executive, said very few districts would now ask for unitary
status without arranging mergers with other districts.

A Pensions Compensation Scheme to cover fraud, misappropriation or theft,
financed by a levy on all occupational schemes.
Appointment of a Pensions Regulator and strengthened roles for the Pensions
Ombudsman and Occupational Pensions Advisory Service.
An employer should not be restricted from taking a contributions holiday, if
the scheme meets a minimum solvency standard: assets of at least 90 per cent
of what would be needed to meet liabilities. Employers wishing to extract
cash from schemes should first obtain permission from the Pensions
Regulator.
Employers should be free to amend schemes to reduce or restrict benefits for
future service, or to wind them up entirely, but they should not be able to
restrict benefits earned before changes took effect.
Scheme members should be entitled to appoint at least a third of all
trustees, with a minimum of two per scheme.
A new Occupational Pensions Schemes Act to codify reforms.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Firefighters near to deal around 1.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SETTLEMENT of the threatened dispute in Britain's fire services is likely
today when local-authority employers are expected to agree to honour the
firefighters' pay formula in full.
'We are on the verge of a deal', Mr Ken Cameron, Fire Brigades union general
secretary, said yesterday.
The pay increase that firefighters can expect next month may turn out to be
less than the government's 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit for this
year, but Mr Cameron insisted that the union's fight was to preserve the
formula.
An official for local-authority employers said the firefighters' pay rise
would amount to between 1 per cent and 2 per cent.
The firefighters' 15-year-old pay formula links their earnings to that of
the upper quartile of male manual workers, based on the government's annual
New Earnings Survey, which was published yesterday.
The survey, a snapshot of the change in earnings for the year to April,
showed a 2.3 per cent rise for the upper quartile of male manual workers.
The average pay increase for all employees was 4 per cent and average gross
weekly earnings for full-time employees Pounds 317. Non-manual pay was
rising nearly twice as fast as manual pay and women's pay was rising faster
than men's.
The firefighters' pay formula requires that the April figure should be
adjusted to take into account earnings movements in the subsequent seven
months to November, as well as an annual survey of firefighters' earnings.
An official for the employers said yesterday it was 'good news' that the
relevant official earnings figure was so close to the government's 1.5 per
cent public-service pay limit.
The pay survey also shows that in the year to April 1993, public-sector pay
rose at 4.3 per cent compared with 4 per cent in the private sector.
Average gross weekly pay in the public sector was Pounds 321, compared with
Pounds 315.30 in the private sector. That is partly because there is a
higher proportion of managers and professionals in the public sector.
Medical practitioners averaging Pounds 736 a week were displaced from the
top of the earnings table by treasurers and company financial managers on
Pounds 746. The median level of earnings was Pounds 273 a week and the
bottom 10 per cent of employees earned less than Pounds 153 a week. The top
10 per cent earned more than Pounds 510.
