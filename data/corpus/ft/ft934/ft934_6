FT  17 DEC 93 / Thou shalt not cook the books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK

<TEXT>
God, of course, can see through the tricks of creative accountancy. But many
of his servants on earth cannot and have resolved to do something about it.
The effects of woodworm nibbling the pews and the depreciation of collapsing
spires may be shown in the accounts of English cathedrals for the first time
following the creation of a new working party.
The Association of English Cathedrals has set up a group to report next year
on how to present financial information regarding the 42 Anglican cathedrals
in England fairly and consistently.
This follows an analysis of their accounts which showed that there are as
many divergent and incomparable practices as there are cathedrals.
Mr Peter Burnham of accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, chairman of the
working party, said the matters to be considered included the valuation and
depreciation of cathedrals and related property, and the treatment of
legacies and donations.
One senior member of the Archbishop's Commission on Cathedrals, which was
set up in 1992 to consider matters including management, said yesterday:
'Cathedral accounting is disgraceful. It's a fascinating aspect of medieval
life. They get up to every trick in the books.'
He said the most scandalous practice was the use of 'off-balance sheet
finance' and 'concealment by canons' to hide in undeclared trusts the true
wealth of cathedrals from the attention of the church hierarchy.
The Cathedrals Measure of 1963 required accounts to be audited and
published. But it provided no guide-lines, and the Church commissioners do
not examine the accounts in any detail.
Equally important, medieval law dictates that the dean and canons of a
cathedral, once appointed, form a 'corporation spiritual' immune even from
the power of visiting bishops. Mr Burnham said: 'They are accountable only
to God.'
Mr Malcolm Hoskins of Touche Ross, a member of the working party who has
audited a cathedral in the past, said, perhaps rather inappropriately:
'Cathedrals are ancient buildings that need a hell of a lot of work (for
their upkeep). 'Like any other charity, if anything the incentive is not to
appear too financially healthy.'

FT  17 DEC 93 / National insurance increase 'brutal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday renewed its attack on the government's 1
percentage-point increase in employee's National Insurance contributions,
saying that the move was 'brutal' and had 'somewhat sinister possibilities
in terms of future policy'.
The accusations came at the start of a debate on a bill introducing the
contributions measure, which was due to pass through all its Commons stages
in six hours last night.
Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister, said in opening the debate
that the 'modest' rise was necessary because income was not keeping pace
with spending in the National Insurance fund.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said that the rise had a
'key and rather dishonourable' role in the government's strategy of forcing
up taxes to the equivalent of 7p on the standard rate of income tax.
He said: 'It is a rise in taxation - a substantial rise in taxation that
affects the vast majority of the working population.'

FT  17 DEC 93 / Top bond prize will rise to Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Premium bond owners could become instant millionaires as part of a new
structure for the savings-cum-lottery scheme. From April next year the top
prize in the premium bond draw, conducted by Ernie (Electronic Random Number
Indicator Equipment), will be Pounds 1m.
National Savings, the government department that runs the bond system, said
the change was not a response to the planned launch of a national lottery
late next year or early 1995.
The lottery, which will raise money for sport, charities and other causes,
is expected to reduce the attraction of premium bonds. However, National
Savings said the increase in the top prize from Pounds 250,000 was the first
change since 1980, and was a necessary update.
The prize system is being fully restructured - weekly prize draws will end.
The monthly draw, in addition to the Pounds 1m prize, will include two
prizes of Pounds 100,000, three prizes of Pounds 50,000, four prizes of
Pounds 25,000 and 10 of Pounds 10,000. There is no change in the way smaller
prizes - between Pounds 50 and Pounds 5,000 - are being allocated.
The changes mean the overall yield on the fund (annual prize money paid as a
percentage of money invested) will rise from 5 per cent to 5.2 per cent.
As a further incentive to buy bonds, the waiting period before bonds can
enter the draw is being reduced in February from three months to one month.
Bonds purchased in January and February will be eligible to take part in the
first Pounds 1m draw.
National Savings also said it was cutting the interest rates paid on many of
its savings products. The changes follow recent declines in building society
rates, themselves largely a response to the recent base rate cut from 6 per
cent to 5.5 per cent.
The new 41st issue of fixed-rate certificates will pay 5.4 per cent if held
for five years compared with 5.75 per cent on the 40th issue; new Series H
Capital Bonds will pay 7.25 per cent over five years, compared with 7.75 per
cent on Series G.
Rates on the First Option Bond, which needs to be held for only one year,
will fall from 6.34 per cent to 6 per cent.
Meanwhile, the return on the 7th issue of index-linked certificates will be
inflation plus 3 per cent over five years compared with inflation plus 3.25
per cent on the 6th issue.

FT  17 DEC 93 / London hints at early start to Sinn Fein talks: The
government may not wait for weapons to be handed in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was put on the defensive yesterday after Sir Patrick Mayhew,
the Northern Ireland secretary, indicated it might enter preliminary
dialogue with Sinn Fein without waiting for the IRA to hand in its weapons.
His remarks dismayed some Tory backbenchers, with one MP accusing the
government of giving in to the terrorists.
Downing Street said the government had made a non-negotiable demand that
Provisional IRA leaders end violence for good; those concerned should accept
that they had 'no need for weapons'.
Downing Street also signalled that a secret message sent to the Provisionals
on November 5 and made public later in the month gave an indication of
subjects the government would be prepared to address in exploratory
meetings. One subject that might be discussed was the restriction on
broadcasting direct speech by members of terrorist organisations in the
province and their apologists.
Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, is expected to report on a
review of the restrictions to the prime minister early next year.
Officials acknowledged that while there was no question of an amnesty for
IRA prisoners, the sentence of any prisoner could be reviewed under normal
procedures which took account of whether criminals were likely to reoffend.
The November 5 message set out three purposes for the exploratory dialogue
that the government originally proposed entering into in January, in return
for a permanent end to IRA violence. These were:
To explore the basis upon which Sinn Fein would come to be admitted to an
'inclusive political talks process'.
To exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able over a period to play the
same part as the present constitutional parties in the public life of
Northern Ireland.
To examine the practical consequences of the ending of violence.
For the first meeting of exploratory dialogue it was proposed that each
party could field up to three delegates plus possibly an additional group of
advisers. The British side was to be represented by 'senior officials'
acting under 'political authority and direction'.
Interviewed on BBC Radio Ulster, Sir Patrick said: 'At exploratory talks it
would be highly relevant as to when and how arms should be surrendered. You
cannot be sitting on top of arms and at the same time saying you are for
real when you say that violence is at an end.'
Separately, he signalled the government would not automatically say any deal
with Sinn Fein was off if one bomb exploded during the interim three months.
'If there is a bomb that goes off somewhere, that will count very heavily
against their credibility, but it is very important not to be tied down here
and now to precise circumstances when we do not know what they are going to
be,' he said.
Mr David Wilshire, Tory MP for Spelthorne, said he was 'appalled and
alarmed' at the prospect that the government did not expect the IRA to hand
over arms until the talks started. 'This means we have just given in to the
terrorists. I had a sense that this was too good to be true. We are
beginning to see some of the detail - and I don't like it,' he said.
Security sources in Northern Ireland said yesterday that an extended
ceasefire by the IRA would be matched by a phased reduction of the Army and
police presence.
Army commanders and senior Royal Ulster Constabulary officers are understood
to hold in reserve a contingency plan drafted in the event of an IRA
ceasefire lasting well beyond the traditional three or four-day Christmas
lull.
The sources insist that there would be no immediate return to barracks. But
measures including an end to security barriers in city centres and a
reduction in Army and police checkpoints would be taken 'within weeks'.
A senior Northern Ireland source who has acted as a channel of communication
in the past between the IRA and government officials said that Sinn Fein
officials were finding it difficult to persuade sectors of the IRA that the
joint declaration represented the best possible solution for the nationalist
community.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Names 'may sue compiler of league tables'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sturge Holdings, the Lloyd's agency, yesterday issued an injunction against
Mr John Rew, the co-editor of Chatset league tables of performance on the
insurance market. The action concerns alleged breaches of confidentiality in
publication of sensitive information.
Sturge warned that the action may lead to Names - individuals whose assets
have traditionally supported the market - on its syndicates suing Mr Rew,
who is chairman of their own action group.
The writ alleges that Mr Rew published information relating to Sturge
syndicates provided to him as chairman of the Sturge Names Action Group. It
seeks damages and interest for breach of contract and breach of confidence
for disclosing information provided in connection with the evaluation of the
legal disputes initiative launched by Lloyd's.
Sturge claims this information was circulated by Mr Rew in the Chatset
league tables last week, and also in a newsletter.
Sturge's concerns focus on 210, a non-marine syndicate. The Chatset guide
provides details including a memo to the board suggesting run-off figures of
up to Dollars 800m.
Mr James Macdonald, group finance director, said the information was highly
sensitive and its distribution to potential claimants, reinsurers and others
on the market could be extremely prejudicial.
'We are not trying to say the figures are wrong,' he said. 'This raises
questions about the whole way in which Chatset gets its information and then
purports to be an authority on Lloyd's'
Mr Rew yesterday called the writ 'codswallop' and said it would be
contested. 'The information belongs to Lloyd's Names. Any Name is entitled
to get it,' he said. 'Most are just not in a position to broadcast it.'
Chatset, which has proved a long-standing irritant to Lloyd's, last week
predicted that Names would face demands of up to Pounds 8.65bn from the
insurance market during the next 20 years.
The league tables have been published since the late 1970s and have long
been criticised by Lloyd's, but they have often proved accurate.
'The origin of Chatset was getting syndicate accounts which we were told
were secret,' said Mr Rew. 'The point has always been to make Lloyd's more
transparent but it's so hopelessly opaque.'
The High Court yesterday upheld the right of Lloyd's to pay out losses from
its central fund and recover these sums from Names to discharge their
underwriting obligations. Mr Justice Saville ruled that defences and
counter-claims put forward by Names as preliminary issues before legal
action were unfounded.

<TEXT>
The government has agreed to examine how it can best reduce the red tape for
employers in the administration of the Statutory Sick Pay scheme, Lisa Wood
writes.
Business organisations including the Confederation of British Industry and
the Institute of Directors have expressed concern about the proposed cut in
statutory sick pay subsidy to employers. The bill passed through its Commons
stages on Wednesday.
In future large companies, which can now claim back 80 per cent of statutory
sick pay after six weeks of employee absence will not be able to do so.
Smaller companies which can claim 80 per cent after six weeks will be able
to claim 100 per cent after four weeks.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Pentagon problems outlast Les Aspin: A tough job under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Both President Bill Clinton and Mr Les Aspin were immensely correct and
mutually complimentary on Wednesday evening when Mr Aspin's resignation as
US defence secretary was announced. Difficult though his tenure had often
been, there seems to have been no specific last-straw policy disagreement or
overriding personal circumstance that prompted him to go.
Mr Aspin, who had a heart pacemaker inserted this year, had dealt with much
controversy. The list includes ending the ban on homosexuals serving in the
military and giving women frontline combat roles, the decision not to send
additional US heavy armour to Somalia before the October Mogadishu
firefight, the 'Bottom-Up Review' of the US military entailing substantial
real reductions in the defence budget, the 'partnership for peace' approach
to European security, base closures, cutting the reserves and more besides.
Much of this will not be undone, and much of it owes a great deal to Mr
Aspin's sense of how far the Congress could be pushed in any direction.
Although some of his former congressional colleagues suspected him of ceding
too much to the military leadership over the force structure issue and over
the compromise he worked out for allowing gay men and lesbians to serve in
the armed forces, others believe he accurately assessed the point where
compromise could be reached.
The political costs, however, were heavy, outside and inside the Pentagon.
He inherited a defence department coming off more than a decade of military
build-up (plus the victory in the Gulf war) and very content with the
compatible leadership of Dick Cheney, the previous secretary, and General
Colin Powell, who retired in late summer as chairman of the joint chiefs of
staff.
The Aspin style, brought over from 22 years in Congress, was entirely
different. Though his intellect and military expertise commanded respect, he
was often disorganised, curious and theoretical, qualities directly at odds
with the idea of a structured military mind accustomed to taking clear
orders. A bevy of similarly-minded senior advisers meant the civilian
command of the US military was sometimes dismissed by the top brass as
'Aspin University'.
Paradoxically, he became a target of Congress because he did not behave like
a classic defence secretary.
Mr Clinton's insistence on collegiality may have been a constraining factor
to such a free thinker. Mr Aspin may also feel he suffered from a lack of
clear and consistent foreign policy direction from a president whose own
expertise was primarily domestic.
But the net effect was that the foreign policy triumvirate - Warren
Christopher, the secretary of state, Anthony Lake, the national security
adviser, and Mr Aspin - was under constant attack as things went wrong. The
Aspin weakness was that he was never as close to the president as the other
two, whose trust had been earned in the heat of a presidential election
campaign.
Thus it might well have been, as Washington thinks, that he was pushed out
of the Pentagon because he sensed he had lost the absolute confidence of the
president.
With Mr Aspin's departure, however, the whole question is re-opened of how
the US armed forces should be structured to face post-cold war threats, a
question he had sought to deal with in the Bottom Up Review, whose results
he announced three months ago.
In recent weeks, Mr Aspin has been at odds with the White House over a
Dollars 50bn (Pounds 33.5bn) gap between the amount allocated to defence by
the Office of Management and Budget over the next five years and the
Pentagon's estimate of what it needs to pay for the force structure settled
on, with Mr Clinton's blessing, in the review.
Even if this was not the last straw provoking Mr Aspin's departure, it is an
issue that will not go away for his successor, retired Admiral Bobby Ray
Inman.
Some military analysts foresee even greater financial problems in the long
term if the Pentagon sticks to the strategy outlined in the Bottom Up
Review. Mr Andrew Krepinevich of the Defence Budget Project, a Washington
think tank, estimates the Clinton budget could fall as much Dollars 30bn or
Dollars 40bn a year short of demands of the review.
While many defence analysts found the review to be a solid intellectual
exercise, some thought its results had been determined by its premises,
which sought to maximise the possible threats the US might face and so
justify a larger military structure than might otherwise have seemed
necessary.
The review's very terms of reference called for 'a thorough and compelling
list of New Dangers', which led to the conclusion that the US had to be
ready to fight two nearly simultaneous big regional conflicts.
'It was overkill - a way of justifying a major military structure by
inventing demons,' said Rear Admiral Eugene Carroll, who heads the Centre
for Defence Information, a Washington research organisation.
Admiral Inman could seek further budget cuts within the Bottom Up framework,
or he could look for an entirely new assessment of force structure needs.
But unless Russia's election results provoke a lasting shift in attitudes
towards defence spending, he is unlikely to be able to preserve his budget
at its current Dollars 260bn-a-year level.

<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said yesterday he would press on
with plans to bring all responsibility for bank regulation under a single
body, despite criticism from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, writes
Richard Waters in New York.
Mr Greenspan had claimed that the plan, which would strip the Fed of direct
involvement in bank regulation, would make it harder for the central bank to
carry out its other functions.
Mr Bentsen said: 'Bank regulation is not essential to the conduct of
monetary policy.'
He said the proposed new Federal Banking Commission would make all
information available to the Fed, allowing it to do its job unhindered. 'We
have carefully considered the Fed's arguments, but we find them
unpersuasive,' he said.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Inman named as US defence secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday named retired Admiral Bobby Ray Inman to be
the next US defence secretary, to fill the gap left by the resignation on
Wednesday of Mr Les Aspin.
Mr Inman said he had not wanted the job, but had agreed to take it out of a
sense of duty. He also said that he had voted for former President George
Bush in the last election, but had been convinced of Mr Clinton's 'absolute
commitment' to building a bipartisan consensus on defence policy.
In his new post, Mr Inman will have to take charge of a vast and unwieldy
bureaucracy of which Mr Aspin has not seemed fully in control. He will also
have to tackle serious defence budget problems as well as the difficult
issues surrounding US involvement overseas in areas such as Haiti or
Somalia.
While there seems to have been no specific last straw provoking Mr Aspin's
departure, he had gradually lost Mr Clinton's full confidence.
The appointment is still subject to Senate confirmation, but Mr Inman enjoys
broad support among members of both parties, and is not expected to face any
serious obstacles.
A Texan, now aged 62, he became at 49 the first naval intelligence
specialist ever to earn the rank of four-star admiral. He rose as a naval
intelligence officer to head the National Security Agency, which runs much
of the US's electronics surveillance, from 1977 to 1981. He became deputy
director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1981 - the price exacted by
Congress for accepting President Ronald Reagan's choice of Mr William Casey,
his campaign manager, to head the CIA - but resigned the next year after
policy disagreements.
He will be the first former career officer to serve as secretary of defence
since General George Marshall, who held the office under President Harry
Truman.
Although Mr Inman has won high praise from Congress, his private sector
career has been less glittering.
His three years at the head of Microelectronics and Computer Technology
Corp, a joint venture set up to strengthen US research in advanced
computing, went well enough, but he had to resign from his next business,
Westmark Systems, after the failure of its leveraged buy-out of Tracor
Holdings, a defence contractor.
Mr Inman said at the time that he found Congress less arduous to deal with
than the commercial banks.
'Congress will give you a good scrubbing, but only to make sure there's some
value in the money they're giving you. The banks will whipsaw you and drive
you bankrupt if they get the chance,' Mr Inman said.
He also served on the proxy board set up to preserve the US military secrets
handled by International Signal and Control, the ill-starred US acquisition
of Ferranti, the British defence group to which receivers were appointed
recently.
Mr Inman acknowledged yesterday that he had not succeeded at all the jobs he
had turned his hand to.
'I have not done them all as well as I would have liked, but I have worked
hard at them,' he said at a White House ceremony announcing his nomination.
'I would hope to spend a lot of my time on bringing best business practices
to the Department of Defence.'

FT  17 DEC 93 / Argentine city hit by job protests

<TEXT>
The Argentine government last night flew riot police from Buenos Aires to
retake the north-western city of Santiago del Estero from rioters.
Local police withdrew from the city's streets after rioters stormed the
governor's palace and pillaged the building. They then rampaged through the
courthouse and legislature, which they tried to burn down.
The rioting broke out after the provincial government announced plans to cut
jobs as part of an economic reform programme. Santiago del Estero is one of
Argentina's poorest provinces. One rioter said: 'We are all (dying) of
hunger. We are in the office of some thief and we are breaking everything.'
The uprising forced President Carlos Menem to cut short a visit to the
Vatican.
Earlier in the day, rioters and police traded gunfire, molotov cocktails,
stones and tear gas. Two were reported dead and dozens injured. Crowds later
fanned out through the city, ransacking the homes of prominent local
politicians, including that of Mr Fernando Lobo, the recently appointed
provincial governor.
This is the second, and most serious, recent outbreak of violence in
Argentina's provinces.
The deteriorating economies of many provinces is emerging as one of Mr
Menem's most pressing political and economic challenges. The federal
government is demanding that Argentina's 23 provinces reform their chaotic
finances by cutting public jobs, reducing spending and reforming their tax
systems. They rely on tax transfers from Buenos Aires to cover two-thirds of
their annual spending of Dollars 20bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US trade deficit is becoming increasingly unbalanced regionally, with
most of the shortfall accounted for by Japan and China, official figures
indicated yesterday, writes Michael Prowse in Washington.
The overall merchandise trade deficit declined slightly in October, to
Dollars 10.46bn (Pounds 7bn), against Dollars 10.62bn in September, roughly
in line with analysts' projections.
But the deficit with Japan rose 14 per cent to Dollars 6.1bn, the highest
since November 1986. That with China rose 8 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn. For
the year to date the combined deficit with Japan and China was Dollars
67.6bn, more than two thirds of the overall deficit.
By contrast, trade with the European Union is virtually in balance, with a
negligible US deficit of Dollars 11m so far this year.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Bentsen calls for single bank regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said yesterday he would press on
with plans to bring all responsibility for bank regulation under a single
body, despite harsh criticism of the plan from Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan.
Mr Greenspan had claimed that the plan, which would strip the Fed of direct
involvement in bank regulation, would make it harder for the central bank to
carry out its other functions.
In response, Mr Bentsen said yesterday: 'Bank regulation is not essential to
the conduct of monetary policy.' Under the Clinton administration's proposed
new regulatory system, the Fed would 'retain its existing authority over the
discount window and payment system,' he added.
The Fed fears that, if stripped of regulation, it will no longer have
immediate first-hand knowledge of commercial banks' activities, making it
difficult to judge how banks are responding to changes in monetary policy.
Mr Bentsen said, though, that the proposed new Federal Banking Commission
would make all information available to the Fed, allowing it to do its job
unhindered.
'We have carefully considered the Fed's arguments, but we find them
unpersuasive,' he said.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Mexico City rail contract awarded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium of Mexican construction companies and Bombardier, the Canadian
transport group, has won the concession to build and operate an urban
railway system in Mexico City at a cost of about Dollars 650m (Pounds 436m).
The light railway will be the first large public transport project in Mexico
that has been handed over to the private sector. The consortium will operate
the railway for 18 years and eight months, collect all revenues from
passengers, and assume financial risk of the investment.
The service will connect the north-west of Mexico City with the centre,
cover about 21km and include 27 stations. It is estimated that the railway
will take about 50,000 cars off the road each day, and help reduce Mexico
City's notoriously high pollution levels.
The winning consortium is made up of Tribasa, Grupo Mexicano de Desarollo
and Rioboo. Bombardier will supply about Dollars 300m of the equipment and
is expected to provide some of the financing through loans from Canadian
banks and the country's export-import bank.
While Tribasa and its partners have been chosen by the government for the
project, the terms and conditions of the contract still have to be
negotiated and full financing obtained. However Tribasa did not foresee any
problems that would prevent the project going ahead.
The train service should be ready by the end of 1996 or early 1997. Tribasa
and partners are expected to charge users about Dollars 1 per ride, much
higher than the tariff on the subsidised and state-owned underground system.
After the concession expires, the train service reverts to the government.
Tribasa reckons the government will award concessions for further light
railway lines in Mexico City in the near future.

FT  17 DEC 93 / President of Fiji dies in US hospital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SUVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau of Fiji, thrust unwillingly into the world spotlight
by the Pacific island nation's two military coups of 1987, has died while
undergoing treatment for leukaemia in the US, Reuter reports from Suva.
His death in a Washington hospital, at 75, brought a new note of uncertainty
to Fijian politics ahead of elections in February.
His deputy, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, acting president since Sir Penaia was
flown to the US last month, was expected to succeed him as head of state.
Sir Penaia was appointed in 1983 as governor-general, the representative of
the Crown. Fiji's 1987 election delivered unprecedented political power to
the Indian-led Labour party coalition, triggering a military coup by then
Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka which replaced it with an indigenous
Fijian-dominated government.
A tense stand-off ensued but Sir Penaia, nominally head of the armed forces,
finally accepted the new regime, bringing criticism from Britain and other
Commonwealth nations which in turn prompted Mr Rabuka to declare Fiji a
republic.
Sir Penaia accepted a role as the nation's first president and, for five
years while a new constitution was drawn up to guarantee political supremacy
to indigenous Fijians, he sought to cool the divisions in Fiji's
multi-racial society.
The president has wide powers and plays a key role in the appointment of a
prime minister. Under Fiji's racially based constitution, a successor will
be chosen by Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs, and must be an indigenous
Fijian.
Indians, who were brought to Fiji at the turn of the century to work on
sugar plantations, make up just under half of Fiji's 750,000 population.

FT  17 DEC 93 / PLO warns that peace process could be frozen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation warned yesterday
the peace process would be frozen if Israel did not allow Palestinians to
control the border crossing points in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town
of Jericho after Israeli troops withdraw.
Mr Yasir Abed Rabbo, a PLO executive committee member, said in Tunis:
'Either there will be a true Israeli withdrawal and true Palestinian control
on land and passages, or we will face an Israeli interpretation of the peace
deal less than autonomy; that means hindering the peace process.' In that
case, 'the peace process will be frozen.'
In Jerusalem, Mr Gad Ben-Ari, spokesman for Premier Yitzhak Rabin, said it
was impossible for Israel to compromise. 'It was made clear to PLO chairman
Yassir Arafat that if we do not have full control over the borders, bridges
and checkpoints, we would have no control over who is entering Israel. That
is why this is inconceivable.'
Mr Ben-Ari denied an Israeli press report that Mr Rabin would refuse to meet
Mr Arafat until he backed down, but said no date had yet been fixed for the
two men to meet. After last Sunday's summit in Cairo failed, the two leaders
said they hoped to meet again in 10 days to iron out their difficulties.
Israel's foreign minister Shimon Peres suggested in Paris yesterday the
possibility of allowing Palestinian observers at the border crossings. 'If
it is just a question of a Palestinian presence on the (Jordan River)
bridge, I think we can find a solution. But there must be someone
responsible for the border. You cannot have one border and two
responsibilities.'
Mr Peres reported progress in economic co-operation talks between the area
of future Palestinian self-rule and Israel. 'I think the Palestinians agree
with us today to create a market economy, an open economy with no border
with free movement of goods and trade between the two of us.' Problems
remained over the territories' Currency.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Hosokawa chalks up after-hours gains: Japan PM's growing
list of hard-won achievements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The nocturnal habits of Morihiro Hosokawa are the talk of Tokyo. Not that
Japan's prime minister is entangled in the sort of geisha scandal that
embarrassed a predecessor, but his after-hours administration is prone to
announcing its most important decisions past midnight.
A solemn Mr Hososkawa addressed a sleeping nation at 3.51am on Tuesday when
the seven party-coalition agreed that the country's rice market should be
opened to imports for the greater international good. The government's
decision last month to push ahead with political reform came in the early
hours and, on Wednesday night, fatigued legislators endured another long
evening of bargaining over an extension of the parliamentary session.
With the extension rammed through, Mr Hosokawa faces another 45 days of
late-night legislating, as the government intends to use the period to win
approval from a divided upper house for political reforms. The prime
minister has also extended his own deadline, having once promised to resign
if those reforms were not in place by the end of the year.
Hours of haggling with the opposition Liberal Democratic party and within
the coalition give the impression of indecision, but Mr Hosokawa is
accumulating a list of honourable achievements. The rice market is open, the
first stage of political reform is close to completion, and the government
has already produced one stimulatory package for an ailing economy and is
contemplating another.
The changes in prime ministerial form are also significant. Apart from the
unusual timing of his rice announcement, Mr Hosokawa caused a stir by using
a tele-prompter for the speech. Inevitable comparisons were made with the US
presidential preference for using such aids, but the point of improving eye
contact with the populace was understood.
For a coalition apparently ready to buckle at any moment under the weight of
philosophical differences among its seven member parties, the Hosokawa
administration remains remarkably popular. Since taking office in August, by
the reckoning of most media polls, his cabinet has maintained an approval
rating of just above 70 per cent. A poll this week suggested it had slipped
to 62.8 per cent, but another put it at 71.7 per cent after the decision to
open the rice market.
If the government's image was harmed by the rice debate, it was because of
the public bickering of the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan
Socialist party, the largest group within the coalition.
Divisions are widening between the SDP's left wing and the party pragmatists
who want to hold the coalition together. The left wing argues that political
reform will favour the LDP and that membership of the coalition has prompted
the SDP to abandon its principles for the sake of a short stay in power.
If the SDP withdraws, the coalition government will fall, but a snap
election would be inconvenient for all, including the LDP, which has an
approval rating of 28 per cent and would prefer that the public becomes
disillusioned with Mr Hosokawa before votes are cast again.
Having attempted to distinguish himself from past prime ministers by running
a clean coalition, Mr Hosokawa's reputation has been damaged most by
repeated questions in parliament from LDP legislators about his alleged
receipt of Y100m (Pounds 628,900) in loans from Sagawa Kyubin, a trucking
company at the centre of a bribery scandal.
LDP officials could soon be looking for a new leader, as Mr Yohei Kono, its
president, has seen his standing diminished by an inability to control the
party's factions and by public disapproval of the time-wasting tactics in
parliament.
Mr Masaharu Gotoda, 79, the LDP's elder statesman and a former justice
minister, thinks Mr Hosokawa 'still has a favourable wind, though the
direction of the wind is shifting'. He argues that the LDP must become 'more
serious', meaning that he wants fewer late nights in parliament.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Populous countries learn education lesson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The governments of the nine most populous developing countries yesterday
pledged to provide their children with universal education 'by the year 2000
or at the earliest possible moment'.
Their promises, delivered in New Delhi at an international education summit
sponsored by the United Nations, were in themselves little more than
statements of good intent.
However, reports presented to the summit showed that in most of the nine
states the past few years have seen marked improvements in literacy rates
and in the numbers of children going to school.
The nine nations - China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Brazil, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Mexico and Egypt - together account for half the global
population and 70 per cent of all adult illiterates. If the experience of
more developed nations is any guide, the progress made in education will
help cut population expansion and boost economic growth.
The Education for All Summit was robbed of some of its political impact by
last-minute cancellations by leaders who had planned to attend. President
Suharto of Indonesia was the only guest government head who signed the
summit declaration alongside his host, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian
prime minister. China was represented by a vice-premier and other nations by
education ministers.
Many of the nine countries' problems are similar, especially shortages of
money, teachers, schools and materials. All face difficulties reaching
children in remote rural districts and in persuading parents to send
daughters to school as well as sons, and all have many adult illiterates.
In the past three years, in every country education budgets have been
increased, though in some the gains have been limited by subsequent cuts or
by inflation.
Mr James Grant, the executive director of Unicef, says this renewed
commitment is due partly to the world-wide Education for All campaign
launched by UN organisations in 1990 and partly to the growing realisation
that economic growth and population control can best be achieved by
promoting education. 'Everyone is learning from east Asia,' he says.
However, the differences between individual countries are as important as
the similarities. The summit reports describe some glaring gaps in
achievement which are likely to get bigger before they get smaller, and may
not shrink at all without radical policy changes in the laggard states. As a
principal summit document says: 'To present the choice as now or never may
over-dramatise it, but not by much.'
Statistics are gathered from education ministries which often tend to
exaggerate achievements. Nevertheless, the overall trends are clear.
Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, and China have seen adult literacy rates soar in
the past decade to 70 per cent and above. The same countries already have 85
per cent or more of the children of primary school age enrolled.
Enrolment rates in Egypt are also creditable, though few experts believe the
official figure of 91 per cent and estimate the true figure is nearer 70 per
cent. Brazil's high enrolment rate, which indicates how many youngsters
start school, needs to be qualified by the fact that only 47 per cent
complete three years.
Unicef commends India for raising adult literacy above the 50 per cent mark.
Despite having one of the world's best-educated elites, India for long
neglected mass education, partly out of a lack of concern for promoting the
interests of the lowest castes. But the sight of east Asian countries
forging ahead in economic development prodded India into action.
Unicef is also satisfied that Bangladesh, despite its poor literacy rating
and its endemic poverty, has in the last two years under the premiership of
Mrs Khaleda Zia shown determination to get children, especially girls, into
school. The percentage of girls of primary school age enrolled at school has
risen in the past decade from 45 to 64. The Bangladesh Rural Advancement
Committee, the largest non-government organisation, has won international
renown as a pioneer in out-of-hours education for children who work or
cannot attend regular school.
The two countries that arouse the greatest concern are Pakistan and Nigeria,
where a decade of political turmoil and financial pressures have left
schools under-funded and demoralised. In Pakistan only 29 per cent of
children are even enrolled in primary schools, and less than 20 per cent of
girls. The diversion of funds from social to military spending, political
upheaval, and moves to cut so-called 'western' influences in education and
promote Islamic ones have all played their part in disrupting Pakistan's
schooling.
The summit papers show the contrast between Nigeria and another oil-rich
country, Indonesia, which invested its revenues more wisely. Even though
Indonesia lacked deep-rooted educational traditions, its post-colonial
rulers have made mass education a priority and 'transformed education from
the privilege of a tiny minority into a right enjoyed by nearly all', says
the report.
Ms Fay Chung, Unicef's chief education officer and a former education
minister of Zimbabwe, says the most important determinant of success is not
money but 'long-term political commitment'. The great enemy is political
instability.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Man who crafted faction rule / Obituary of Kakuei Tanaka
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kakuei Tanaka, in whose image modern Japanese politics was crafted, died
aged 75 in Tokyo yesterday after a long illness, which had cut short his
career but had also ensured he would not be jailed for his involvement in a
bribery scandal.
The gravel-voiced Mr Tanaka dominated Japanese politics during the 1970s and
1980s, when he perfected the faction system of the Liberal Democratic party,
which ruled the country for four decades until this year and served as the
conduit between business and the bureaucracy.
Popularly known as the 'computerised bulldozer' for his straight-talking
determination and ability to calculate cost and benefit, Mr Tanaka's
fund-raising powers allowed him to reward generously his supporters and
constituents, ensuring his faction was the most influential in the LDP.
Newly-elected politicians sought his patronage and promised him loyalty. Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the current prime minister, is a former member of the
Tanaka faction, and the coalition government's kingmaker, Mr Ichiro Ozawa,
learned his political skills in the company of Mr Tanaka and carried on the
Tanaka tradition of fund-raising.
Mr Tanaka's organisational ability and his financial resources ensured his
power even increased after his resignation as prime minister in late 1974,
when his personal finances were the stuff of public scandal after the 'black
fog' was lifted by a Japanese magazine.
Two years later, the 'shadow shogun' was arrested on suspicion of accepting
Y500m (Pounds 3.1m) in bribes, and he was sentenced to four years' jail in
1983. An appeal against his conviction was pending when he died.
But the troubles with the law did not diminish his popularity in his home
prefecture of Niigata, where he was consistently re-elected. His speeches
were laced with references to his humble origins and his love of his home
town, while his lack of a university education was popularly regarded as an
antidote to the arrogance of the Tokyo University graduates who controlled
the capital.
Campaigning in 1946, Mr Tanaka promised he would level the mountains hemming
in his home prefecture; 'then we shall have no more of the heavy snowfalls
that have tormented us for centuries'. On later becoming a minister, he
refused to attend the lecture provided by bureaucrats for education of the
incoming politician.
It was said there was a little bit of Mr Tanaka in every Japanese, that he
represented the embodiment of old rural values in the post-war political
world. He had a habit of wearing traditional wooden sandals with his
business suit, and his rough-and-ready speaking style conjured images of the
crude but endearing rice farmer.
But Mr Tanaka's later life, spent in a comfortable Tokyo compound complete
with pond jumping with Y1m carp, was far removed from that of the common
man, and the earthy campaigning style became in part affectation. He was
increasingly consumed by political intrigue, and his considerable personal
wealth became an ever larger target for public criticism.
Mr Tanaka began his business life in the construction industry, and Tanaka
Civil Engineering profited during the war, when poor health led to his
discharge from the army. His links to the construction and transport
industries allowed him to build the network of political influence, fuelled
by money from companies grateful for receiving lucrative public contracts.
His first skirmish with scandal came in 1948, when he resigned as
vice-minister of justice after allegations that he accepted bribes from coal
mining companies. But he returned as minister for postal services and
communications in 1957, later serving as finance and trade minister, when he
collected ideas for a grand plan to 'remodel the Japanese archipelago'.
Mr Tanaka was felled by a stroke in 1985 but did not retire from politics
until 1989. His former associates fought over control of his faction; his
daughter Makiko reformed his supporters' group this year, being elected to
the Lower House.
As with Mr Richard Nixon, the former US president, the sins of Mr Tanaka
were overlooked by the Chinese government, which remembered him fondly for
travelling to Beijing to normalise relations in 1972. China last night
'deeply mourned' his passing.

The official who led a recent extensive investigation of bureaucratic
corruption in South Korea was named yesterday as the country's new prime
minister.
Mr Lee Hoi-chang, the chairman of the government's board of audit and
inspection (BAI), was appointed by President Kim Young-sam after the entire
cabinet led by Mr Hwang In-sung, prime minister, resigned due to a
controversy over rice imports.
Mr Kim's announcement last week that Korea would open its rice market as
part of the Gatt talks has provoked daily street demonstrations. Political
analysts fault the government for having done little to prepare the public
for the decision, which broke a presidential campaign promise to protect the
nation's rice farmers from imports.
The choice of Mr Lee as prime minister was immediately approved by the
national assembly and a new cabinet is expected to be formed by the end of
the week.
Those who are likely to be replaced include Mr Lee Kyung-shik, the deputy
prime minister for economic affairs, and Mr Kwon Young-hae, the defence
minister, whose agency was a prime target of the new prime minister's
anti-corruption probes.
An estimated 3,000 government officials have been removed as a result of the
corruption investigation that BAI has conducted since President Kim, who
promised bureaucratic reform, was inaugurated in February.
Mr Lee served two terms on the supreme court since 1981 before heading BAI
this year.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary general, has said he is
going to North Korea on a fact-finding mission only and does not need the
approval of the US or any other country, Reuter adds.
The US has been noticeably cool about his visit, with State Department
officials neither endorsing nor publicly opposing it. Mr Boutros Ghali said
he did not intend to mediate in the crisis over North Korea's refusal to
allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities.
'If there is anything I can offer to the member states, to the Security
Council, I will do so,' he said. 'But I have no mandate and I will not do
any kind of mediation.'
North Korea yesterday sounded the alarm over what it sees as growing clamour
in the US for war at a time when the two countries are in confrontation over
nuclear inspection.
The official press carried attacks on Washington hardliners who, the
official Rodong Sinmun daily said, seemed bent on destroying chances for a
negotiated settlement.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Japanese money supply rise lower than expected at 1.5%

Money supply in Japan expanded by a slower than expected 1.5 per cent in
November, compared with a year earlier, indicating that business activity in
the country remains sluggish and that the economy appears to have turned
down during the past two months.
The average balance of M2 plus certificates of deposit had grown by 1.8 per
cent in October, and the Bank of Japan was hoping that the November rate
would at least equal that figure.
Japan's industrial production index for October was revised down yesterday
by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which said the fall in
production was 5.5 per cent against a month earlier, down from a provisional
decrease of 5.1 per cent.
The decline in the shipment index was also revised from 5.6 per cent to 6.0
per cent, while the inventory index was said to have fallen by 0.5 per cent,
instead of the provisionally reported 0.4 per cent.
Gathering signs that the economy is weakening are increasing pressure on the
coalition government to announce another package of stimulatory measures in
coming weeks.
However, the finance ministry has opposed the suggestion, insisting that the
country cannot afford another package and that the economy is on course for
recovery sometime next year.
The Japan Iron and Steel Federation gave an indication of the difficulties
ahead by forecasting that steel production in the year from April is likely
to slip to between 90m and 92m tonnes, the lowest level since 1970, and a
sharp fall from the 96.5m tonnes which is expected this year.
Steel companies expect demand to remain weak from core customers, including
the automotive and construction industries, but based their forecast on the
understanding that Japan's economy would expand next year by 0.5 per cent, a
relatively optimistic target.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Afrikaners and Zulus denounce new S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ISANDLWANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Afrikaners and the Zulus, South Africa's two most powerful ethnic groups,
yesterday gathered at two 19th-century battlefields in Natal - site of their
greatest military triumphs - to denounce the new South Africa and vow to
resist it, with force if necessary.
While the African National Congress staged a show of force in Soweto to mark
the anniversary of the formation of its military wing Umkhonto we Sizwe
(Spear of the Nation), hundreds of miles away in Zululand the ANC's main
rival, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party, celebrated the
victory of Zulus armed with spears and sticks over the military might of the
British empire, in the 1879 battle of Isandlwana.
Some 10,000 Zulus, almost all carrying the same weapons which humbled the
British - the assegai (spear), knobkerrie (club) and shield - roared their
approval as Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini called on them to prepare for war.
As the crowd bristled with menace, King Goodwill urged them to 'let the
valour and the honour that led to the defeat of the British in this place in
1879, rise up to claim Zulu warriors' at the Zulu nation's darkest hour.
'Resist, I command you, resist, I implore you. We will not be ruled by a
constitution we spurn. We will not be subjugated by a political party which
wants to destroy us simply because it wants to rule,' he added, in a
reference to the ANC.
Some 50km away at Blood River, site of the legendary 1838 battle in which
470 Voortrekkers (Afrikaner pioneers) triumphed over 10,000 Zulus, the
Afrikaner leader, retired Gen Constand Viljoen, used the anniversary to
deliver a far less militant message. But he used the same imagery of
darkness and danger to evoke the threat felt by Afrikaners.
It was as though Zulus and Boers, the two groups who feel most threatened by
the new South Africa, were making a symbolic retreat to the site of their
greatest military victories to draw strength for the battle ahead.
Addressing 1,500 people, few with obvious weapons, Gen Viljoen said 'the
darkest hour of the darkest night' had descended on the Afrikaner nation.
The Afrikaner must draw lessons from Blood River to avoid defeat, he said.
The Voortrekkers had called on God to defend them, swearing a sacred vow to
honour him if they were spared; their descendants should do the same.
'If you give us victory over the darkness which now faces us, we will renew
and reaffirm that vow,' he said.
Gen Viljoen believed battle could be averted. Not so Mr Eugene Terreblanche,
leader of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement),
who told 3,000 supporters Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader, wanted war, 'and he
shall have it'.

China, in move to suppress opium trade, blockades foreign merchants in
Guangzhou and forces them to surrender 1,400 tons of opium stocks. Merchants
withdraw to Hong Kong harbour under naval protection.
1840
Britain sends expeditionary force to open Chinese ports to trade, demand
apology and compensation for lost opium. Lord Palmerston, foreign secretary,
demands 'satisfaction for the past and security for the future'.
1841
Agreement between British and Chinese officials, later rejected by both
governments, cedes Hong Kong to Britain - which had not been demanded by
London - but fails to open Chinese ports. Before rejection of deal is known,
British naval force occupies Hong Kong island on January 26 and raises flag.
Jardine Matheson begins building first warehouse. Sir Henry Pottinger sent
to take charge of expeditionary force and secure full British demands.
1842
Lord Aberdeen, new foreign secretary, instructs that islands acquired in
course of war are 'not to be regarded in the light of a permanent conquest'.
Pottinger replies that 'this settlement (Hong Kong) has already advanced too
far to admit of its being restored to the authority of the (Chinese) Emperor
consistently with the honour ..of Her Majesty's Crown'. In Treaty of
Nanjing, later ratified by both governments, Pottinger secures opening of
ports of Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai, Dollars 21m compensation for
the lost opium and cession of Hong Kong island in perpetuity because the
British needed 'a port whereat they may careen and refit their ships'.
Pottinger becomes first governor.

1979
China's leader Deng Xiaoping meets governor Sir Murray MacLehose, tells him
investors in Hong Kong should 'set their hearts at ease'. Says China has
sovereignty over Hong Kong but that Hong Kong would have a 'special
position' as part of China. A negotiated settlement should be based on these
principles. Hong Kong would continue to practise its capitalist system for a
considerable time.
1982
Deng meets UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Beijing, rejects her
proposal of continued British administration of Hong Kong after 1997 but
agrees to begin negotiations. Says China will take back the whole area of
Hong Kong in 1997 but will adopt special policies to ensure its continued
prosperity.
1983
Thatcher, in message to Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang, says in March she would
accept transfer of sovereignty if an acceptable settlement was reached. In
October, after four fruitless rounds of talks, Thatcher, UK ministers,
governor Edward Youde and Hong Kong Executive Council members agree in
London to shelve Britain's insistence on administering Hong Kong after 1997.
Britain will explore China's blueprint for Hong Kong.
1984
China urges in February adoption of protocol giving it a substantial role in
Hong Kong in the transition period before 1997. Jardine Matheson says in
March it will move its domicile to Bermuda. In meetings with Deng in April
and July, Sir Geoffrey Howe, UK foreign secretary, persuades him treaty
should be detailed document and that the Joint Liaison Group proposed by
China for pre-1997 period should play less prominent role. On September 26,
after 22 rounds of formal talks, Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong
is initialled. On December 19, Thatcher and Zhao sign Joint Declaration in
the Great Hall of the People. Hong Kong is to become a Special
Administrative Region of China in 1997, enjoying a 'high degree of autonomy,
except in foreign and defence affairs'. Hong Kong to keep its economic
system, separate customs status and independent finances. Rights and
freedoms, including those of speech, press and assembly, to be ensured by
SAR's own laws. China's polices to be enshrined in Basic Law for the SAR and
'will remain unchanged for 50 years'.

1989
Hundreds of thousands march in Hong Kong on June 4 in protest at killings in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Sino-British relations worsen. Hong Kong people
demand faster democracy. In October, governor David Wilson announces Hong
Kong will build a new airport. Britain says it will give passports to some
Hong Kong residents and Hong Kong will have Bill of Rights.
1990
After negotiations in Beijing, Britain accepts pace of democracy slower than
demanded by Hong Kong campaigners. Legislative Council (LegCo) to have 18
out of 60 seats directly elected in 1991, 20 in 1995, 24 in 1999 and 30 in
2003. China promulgates post-1997 Basic Law for Hong Kong.
1991
After long dispute over Chinese objections to airport plan, Britain and
China reach agreement allowing it to proceed. UK Prime Minister John Major
visits Beijing in September to sign memorandum of understanding on airport.
Airport financing plans subsequently stalled again by Chinese refusal to
endorse them.
1992
Governor Chris Patten announces in October plan to broaden franchise of
indirectly-elected LegCo seats and make local government all directly
elected. He seeks discussions with Beijing. China refuses and promises to
reverse Patten reforms if enacted.

FT  17 DEC 93 / The Sino-British Impasse: Hong Kong - Hong Kong Governor
Chris Patten yesterday submitted electoral legislation in the face of
furious opposition from China, which says it will scrap the reforms when it
takes over in 1997. Hope of reaching the handover in a spirit of
co-operation is now in tatters. British and Chinese officials tell the story
of the controversial proposals to Simon Holberton

The gulf dividing Britain and China over Hong Kong suddenly yawned wider on
November 26. Negotiators meeting in Beijing had an exchange which suggested
the differences had become so great as to make further talks futile.
This was the 17th time that the officials had met in a lavish pavilion in
Beijing's Diaoyutai state guest house complex to discuss Britain's desire to
broaden democracy in Hong Kong before the colony is handed over to China on
July 1 1997.
The usual style of Mr Jiang Enzhu, the vice foreign minister leading the
Chinese side, was to lay out China's position in painstaking fashion. But on
this occasion he was remarkably direct. China, he said, had decided that
there would be appointed members on Hong Kong's district boards after 1997.
Mr Christopher Hum, the senior British official, replied that under
Sino-British agreements, appointments were nothing to do with Beijing. This
was a decision for Hong Kong's own post-1997 government.
Mr Jiang replied: 'What do you mean? We've got sovereignty after 1997.'
To the British, Mr Jiang's aggressive assertion was final proof that China
would not entertain political liberalisation in Hong Kong beyond the
agreements already reached with Britain - and that even those accords might
be in doubt. To the Chinese, it was Britain's attempt to push through
democratic reform that had undermined, perhaps fatally, the agreements on
which Hong Kong's future was based.
In the final days of seven months of talks, China had come close to striking
a deal on some of the British proposals, only to pull back at the last
moment. Mr Chris Patten, the governor, had failed to demonstrate to Beijing
that democratising Hong Kong's political system was in both Hong Kong's and
China's interest. Instead of the closer co-operation which he had sought,
mutual bitterness and suspicion had increased since his arrival on July 9
1992 as the 28th and probably last British governor.
He said in his inaugural address: 'I will do all that I can to remove
misunderstandings and to build up trust. Trust is a two-way street. Good
co-operation with China is my sincere aim and my profound wish.'
The governor was a skilful politician but his task was difficult from the
outset. He was to hand over perhaps the world's most successful capitalist
economy to a communist government which, believing its imperial forbears had
been robbed of the territory in 1841, had long mistrusted the British.
He himself set the hurdles even higher by deciding to seek a broadening of
the franchise. Hong Kong's economic success, he argued, was inseparable from
the rule of law, and the law was intimately linked to fair and open
elections.
In pursuit of closer links, Mr Patten sought to open a secret channel of
communication with Beijing. In London he had met Mr Ma Yuzhen, the Chinese
ambassador. According to a Hong Kong official: 'Mr Patten told him among
other things that if the Chinese would put someone in Hong Kong who he could
talk to then they would find the governor wholly open.'
The request was rebuffed. 'The response to his suggestions to ambassador Ma
was a stiff-faced note . . . from the Chinese saying it was a very good idea
that the governor should talk to someone and that the person he should talk
to was Zhou Nan,' the official said. Mr Zhou was the senior Communist party
official in Hong Kong, a man known from previous negotiations to be a
political hardliner.
With the attempt rejected, Mr Patten set out to design reforms which met
constraints imposed by Beijing while fulfilling Britain's pledge to enhance
democracy. Steps towards democratic rule were set out in the Joint
Declaration, the 1984 Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong's future, and the
Basic Law, the post-1997 constitution drawn up by Beijing. Mr Patten was
responding to demands in Hong Kong for faster reform after the June 1989
massacre in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
'I think the parameters were pretty clear,' Mr Patten said in one of several
interviews with the Financial Times. 'The Chinese had said . . . there could
not be any more directly elected seats . . . They said there shouldn't be
any liberal legislators on the Executive Council (ExCo).' ExCo, the
governor's private advisory council, had traditionally included senior
politicians.
Mr Patten decided to appoint professionals and business people to ExCo
instead of politicians. Rather than seeking an increase in directly-elected
seats on the Legislative Council - 20 in the 1995 elections - he would
broaden the franchise of the 40 indirectly-elected seats.
Voting for 21 existing 'functional constituencies', which represent
professional groups, would be by individuals instead of corporate bodies.
For nine new seats, Mr Patten wanted to enfranchise the entire working
population of 2.7m, divided into nine industry groups.
Ten more LegCo members were to be chosen by an election committee. The Basic
Law was silent on the committee's composition, though it did spell out
provisions for 1999. Mr Patten decided to end appointments to district
boards and municipal councils. Elected members of these would constitute the
committee.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, briefed Mr Qian Qichen, his counterpart,
on September 25 1992 in New York. The following day, Mr Patten sent a
message detailing his plans to Mr Lu Ping, director of Beijing's Hong Kong
and Macao affairs office. The governor says: 'At the Qian meeting there was
no response; he was just very polite about it all. Nothing happened and then
three or four days before the speech Lu Ping summoned our ambassador and
told him I should not go ahead with it but wait and discuss it first.'
According to China's Outlook magazine, Mr Lu told Sir Robin McLaren, the
British ambassador, that political development should proceed step-by-step
and in accordance with the Basic Law. The magazine said Mr Patten 'should
have listened carefully to opinions from the Chinese side and reached
consensus through discussion and revision before making an announcement.
Only in that way could his approach be regarded as being responsible,
co-operative and 'in good faith'.'
Mr Patten, however, pressed ahead. Though he called the plans he announced
on October 7 proposals for discussion with Beijing, his approach represented
a clear move away from the previous practice of negotiating issues with
China in advance of public announcement.
'We thought what we've got to do was sketch our view of what clean electoral
arrangements would look like. We thought that unless we did that the whole
argument would be conducted on China's ground rather than ours,' Mr Patten
says. 'The impulse for doing it was that it would have been politically
intolerable only announcing things where we had given way to China and given
way quite substantially.'
The response in Hong Kong was positive. This was crucial to Mr Patten, who
regarded popular support as his trump card. United Democrats party
politicians accepted the proposals as the best they could expect. Business
initially applauded Mr Patten - though as the confrontation with China
deepened, business people either kept quiet or began actively to oppose him.
Mr Patten went to Beijing on October 19 for talks. 'The meetings with Lu
Ping were pretty good, good in the sense that until right to the end they
were serious exchanges of views . . . I thought I'd been immensely
accommodating and vigorous,' said Mr Patten. 'I was very open, I was very
explicit.'
Mr Lu had specific objections to Mr Patten's plans. In an FT interview this
year, he explained China's opposition to the new functional constituencies.
'What he envisages is that all the workers will have a vote. For instance,
we're going to have a functional constituency for the textile industry. . .
According to his proposal it might be quite possible for somebody who is an
ordinary worker, maybe a cleaner, to be elected . . . That's what I asked
him: 'Do you think a cleaner, an ordinary worker in the textile industry,
can represent the interests of the textile industry?' I don't think so.'
China's denunciation of Mr Patten began while he was on the flight back to
Hong Kong on October 23. Beijing said Mr Patten's proposals violated the
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, as well as a secret understanding
between London and Beijing. They were another example of the British
conspiracy to retain an influence in Hong Kong after 1997 and of the UK's
inconsistency. Talks could only resume if the proposals were withdrawn.
Beijing said it would ignore any elections held without its consent and
would hold fresh elections under new arrangements - the so-called 'second
kitchen'. China also put in doubt the viability of business contracts after
1997 and raised questions about plans to expand Hong Kong's container port.
Mr Patten says: 'We thought that there were various decibel counts of
Chinese protest and I have to say it turned out to be at the extremest end
of what we anticipated.' Embarrassingly for him, what China saw as a secret
agreement in the so-called 'seven letters' had not featured in the planning
of his proposals. Mr Hurd had, in February 1990, written to Mr Qian agreeing
in principle to China's preferred structure for the election committee - a
four-part body consisting of business and professional groups, social
services and religious and political figures, and community groups.
A senior British official says: 'It is true that (the letters) were not
considered when drafting the proposals, but the governor was well aware of
them in the days before he went to Beijing.' Though Britain says the letters
were inconclusive and related to post-1997 Hong Kong, the British official
admits: 'I think the issue of the letters was an oversight on our part, an
understandable one but an oversight nevertheless. We should have been a bit
more cautious.'
A thaw in the Chinese position began in late December when Mr Lu said China
did not want a 'diplomatic war' with Britain. As Mr Patten prepared to table
legislation, Mr Hurd wrote to Mr Qian regretting that the two sides seemed
unable to talk about electoral issues. On February 11 Mr Qian replied that
China was prepared to discuss them.
After a month of 'talks about talks' - which stalled on the issue of Hong
Kong representation - Mr Patten gazetted his bill, but said it would not yet
be formally tabled because Britain still wanted talks with Beijing. A
further month passed before agreement was reached to hold talks.
Mr Patten has been torn throughout between his instinct to push ahead, and
Foreign Office advice to strike a deal with Beijing. He anticipated the
talks with dread, believing an agreement could only be struck on China's
terms. For Mr Patten it would be preferable to have LegCo water down his
proposals than for China to do so in secret talks, forcing him to present an
amended bill to lawmakers.
He says: '(It is) very difficult, very, very difficult, to see how we could
have just not talked, but if we'd gone ahead and put the legislation last
March/April one way or other it would all be over by now. But we couldn't
have not talked.'
Talks started on April 22. Four rounds were taken up with Mr Jiang Enzhu,
China's chief negotiator, attempting to get the British to agree to a
statement of 'principles'. According to Mr Patten, these amounted to 'you
won't do anything that we disagree with', and interpretations of previous
agreements designed 'to hog-tie us'.
Then Mr Jiang slowly laid out the Chinese position. He argued that the
system of appointments to district boards and municipal councils should be
continued. LegCo's directly-elected seats should be double-member
constituencies, with electors having one vote, instead of single-member
constituencies as Mr Patten proposed. Britain believes the Chinese proposal
is designed to limit the ability of pro-democracy politicians to win seats.
For the nine new functional constituencies, Mr Jiang argued for small
electorates. Mr Patten says: 'It was all pretty vague and they had nothing
to say on the 'through train'' - a set of criteria which would allow those
elected in 1995 to serve until the elections of 1999.
Mr Hurd told Mr Qian in July that after hearing the Chinese ideas, Britain
was prepared to make new suggestions. In July and August, Britain put
forward watered-down proposals, reducing the voting pool for functional
constituencies by two-thirds and accepting a four-part election committee -
though insisting its members should be elected. Mr Patten says: 'They
listened to all that and did bugger all.'
The gap was underlined on October 23 when Mr Jiang was asked by the FT for
his view on Mr Patten's principles that elections should be 'fair, open and
acceptable to the people of Hong Kong'. Mr Jiang replied: 'I don't know if
you've noticed, but Mr Patten's principles are not covered in the (letters)
between the two foreign ministers.'
However, on October 28, in the 15th round, the Chinese side came up with a
new proposal. Mr Jiang suggested Britain accept that Hong Kong delegates to
the National People's Congress and other 'people's congresses' could stand
in district board, municipal council and LegCo elections. The two sides
would agree to lower the voting age to 18 years; the voting method should be
single seat, single vote for district boards and municipal councils.
Finally, he suggested a formula to the effect that Britain could abolish
appointed members for district boards and municipal councils before 1997,
but it would be for the Special Administrative Region government to
determine the number of members after 1997.
Mr Patten says: 'Robin McLaren (UK ambassador to Beijing) at the table said
'Could you repeat that'. They said it twice. He then said a number of times
during the meeting: 'We interpret that to mean that you won't object if we
abolish appointed members before 1997 and the SAR government will decide
what to do afterwards.' They didn't disagree with that.'
The Chinese offer was drawn up into a memorandum of understanding (MOU). To
this was added a British requirement that the 'first-stage' agreement also
provide for settling the voting method for the directly-elected LegCo seats
on the basis of one-man, one-vote in single member electorates.
Mr Patten says: 'LegCo voted by solid majority for the voting method; the
leaders of political parties in LegCo say they believe in single seat,
single vote, and it is simply not realistic to put in legislation which does
not take account of that. We said that in our proposed MOU. And there were
lots of winks and nudges that suggested it was OK.'
The cabinet committee on Hong Kong affairs debated the Chinese offer in
London on November 8. It decided to allow the British team to seek a
'first-stage' agreement. However, Mr Patten was cleared, subject to Mr
Hurd's approval, to press ahead with legislation if a deal were not
obtainable. If 'non-controversial' issues were immediately legislated, there
would be up to two months to discuss 'controversial' aspects before they too
had to be put into law in time for the elections.
Hopes of a deal quickly faded. The 16th round was 'the worst on record',
according to Mr Patten. Mr Jiang said the LegCo voting method could not be
part of an agreement. He said Britain had misunderstood what Beijing had
offered on appointments to district boards and municipal councils. He would
clarify this misunderstanding only if Britain agreed to drop the LegCo
voting method from the package.
The round ended acrimoniously with Mr Hum, who had replaced Sir Robin as the
UK leader after the ambassador had been taken ill, telling Mr Jiang that the
next round would be the last opportunity for talks about the
'straightforward issues'. At the customary banquet at the end of the round,
Mr Jiang would not speak to Mr Hum for the first three courses, claiming
that he had 'spoiled his meal'.
At the 17th round on November 26, the Chinese said they did not want a
written MOU, but an oral understanding. It should cover what was offered in
the 15th round but not include the voting method for directly-elected LegCo
seats. Britain would have to agree to forswear unilateral action if it
accepted this offer, Mr Jiang said. The exchange about appointed members
followed. The talks had reached impasse.
Mr Hum told Mr Jiang legislation of 'straightforward' issues would now
begin. He offered a further round of talks on other aspects. But an official
Chinese account said: 'Facts show that the British side left the negotiating
table in a huff.'
Two days after he unveiled his proposals, Mr Patten set out his own
definition of failure. 'I think above all being thought not to have
recognised our moral as well as political responsibility for the way of life
of the people of Hong Kong,' the governor said. 'But it would also be
failure if I wasn't able to persuade China that Hong Kong is mature,
sophisticated, modest in its political ambitions and capable of doing a lot
more to look after its own affairs. I would have failed if I hadn't been
able to persuade China that politics in a free society is no threat . . .
But I may well fail.'

FT  17 DEC 93 / The GATT Agreement: Psychological boost for British
industrial exporters - The Gatt deal could create around 400,000 industrial
jobs in the UK over time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's Gatt package is being greeted by British industry as momentous
good news which should help in its struggle to raise the nation's exporting
effort. But the move to slash tariffs and open up global markets is a
two-way affair.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, was yesterday anxious to
play down the threat of still higher import penetration of UK markets and to
call instead on companies to use the stability of a world trade
liberalisation treaty to step up overseas sales.
'We must not say we can't do it. We have very considerable opportunities to
win in world markets if we put our minds to it,' he said.
The theme was picked up by Mrs Ann Robinson, director of policy at the
Institute of Directors. 'There are big benefits waiting, providing companies
prepare to respond to it and the Department of Trade and Industry provides
the support services for exporters which it has been putting in place,' she
said.
Mrs Robinson said Britain has concentrated too much of its sales effort
within other European markets and the new Gatt package should help them
refocus their efforts on alternative markets with much bigger potential.
Early industry estimates have suggested that the deal could generate as many
as 400,000 new jobs across British industry over time.
Britain's exporting effort has been improving recently and the country still
exports per head nearly 50 per cent more than the US and 20 per cent more
than the Japanese. Ministers were recently bold enough to commit themselves
to boosting the country's share of world trade from 5.3 per cent to 6.3 per
cent by the end of the decade - adding Pounds 10bn to exports at 1993
prices. It stood at 20 per cent 60 years ago.
Though the Uruguay Round will not be enacted until 1995, with many changes
then progressively phased in, the agreement was being greeted as an
important psychological boost for companies at a critical point in the
economic recovery.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, said the deal
would 'give a considerable boost to business confidence. It sends a positive
signal from world leaders to the business community that international trade
prospects should improve, barriers come down, markets open up and interest
rates fall'.
British business is also emphasising the importance of the agreement on
prospects for inflation. An IoD spokesman said: 'We have achieved low
inflation and the challenge is to keep it that way. Gatt should help make
that possible, eventually bringing down a whole range of prices, from food
and clothing to other products. We could even see inflation at zero.'
The Confederation of British Industry is also enthusiastic about a deal
which it says will help the 'lean and fit' businesses now emerging from
recession to take full advantage of a low inflation and low interest rate
base to tackle markets previously hard to penetrate.
The UK clothing and textile industries, where exports run at half the value
of imports, could derive marginal benefits from the Uruguay Round. The
agreement promises the phasing out of the UK's import quotas on supplies
from many Asian countries. But the effect on UK manufacturing will be small
because most production of low-priced garments such as T-shirts, and goods
such as cotton yarn has already ended in the UK.
At the same time tariffs and barriers imposed by other countries on UK
exports will be eased. The US and Australia, for example, should cut import
taxes from their current levels of 40 per cent or higher.
Some of Britain's privatised industries, which have since turned themselves
into global businesses, are also encouraged. British Steel, which has Pounds
4bn of annual sales - almost half of them overseas - says a reduction in
tariffs is good for suppliers and customers.
But work on achieving a multi-national steel agreement was decoupled from
the Gatt negotiations when it was realised that agreement between the EU and
the US was not going to be possible. British Steel said yesterday: 'It is
important to us that the US, the world's champion of free trade, is prepared
to open up its own market.'

FT  17 DEC 93 / The GATT Agreement: Trenchant fixer who masterminded deal /
Interview with Gatt chief Peter Sutherland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Sutherland, second cigar of the afternoon rolling between his fingers,
leant back in his armchair in Gatt headquarters in Geneva. 'I think this is
the first day in weeks when I can honestly say we haven't had a crisis,' he
said.
The nearest thing to crisis was a Christmas party for the staff of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Otherwise, this lakeside setting for
the last dramatic weeks of negotiation of the Uruguay Round of global trade
liberalisation had the air of a football stadium two hours after the end of
a big match.
In just six months, Mr Sutherland has taken the long-delayed negotiations by
the scruff of the neck and wrung a conclusion where none had been possible
for three Decembers. Perhaps history will say the round was by now ripe for
plucking, but the importance of Mr Sutherland's role cannot be
underestimated.
Even before his appointment was formally announced at the end of June, he
was putting in place a strategy for completion of the Round that has barely
needed to be changed since: fix the December 15 deadline as firm and final;
raise the profile of the Round to the highest possible level; and set a
clear working agenda that paced progress from July.
'There was a point very early in July when I took what I felt was a very
bold decision,' he recalls. 'It proved crucial. I simply recognised that
unless the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo in July did not come up with a
clear, specific initiative, the Uruguay Round process was potentially
destroyed: simple repetition of the generalised rhetoric of recent summits
was simply not adequate.'
So he met secretly with Japanese ministers in Paris at the annual conference
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with the aim
of ensuring that the Uruguay Round was 'the only issue for Tokyo'. That
succeeded. The Tokyo summit, and the Quad ministerial before it including
Japan, the US, the European Union and Canada, focused almost entirely on the
Round.
From there, he flung himself into a fearsome globetrotting agenda that began
in the UK, moved on to South-East Asia and Latin America and the fringes of
the International Monetary Fund-World Bank summit in Washington. He saw
Germany's Helmut Kohl and France's Edouard Balladur, then leaders from the
eastern and central European countries. He took individual trips to Japan
and to India.
'This was not an ad hoc process,' he says. 'It was deliberately planned,
calculated to get a certain momentum going - to create a political focus
based on publicity that would ensure the maximum degree of movement.'
In this he appears to have been a brilliant success. His public comments
have never failed to be trenchant. His private comments appear to have been
even more colourful. He has bawled out world leaders on the telephone;
carpeted lobbyists and politicians of any creed that seemed inclined to
block progress towards completion of the round. He wrought patience from
irritable and frustrated leaders from developing countries who watched
helplessly as the US and the EU wrangled over bilateral disagreements until
the sand had almost run out of the hourglass.
But behind the public relations, he put in place a work programme that
remained in place up to the close of negotiations on Wednesday. He appointed
deputies (there were none in place when he arrived). He appointed four
'friends of the chair' to chisel at specific problem issues such as market
access, dumping, and trade in services.
He set up daily strategy meetings to define blockages and to deal with them.
He launched open-forum 'heads of delegation' meetings for negotiators to air
frustrations. And he set firm rules for debate.
But it was only on Sunday, with the breakthrough solving the dispute over US
demands to change the rules regulating anti-dumping, that Mr Sutherland
realised the deadline was in his grasp. 'This was an absolutely crucial
breakthrough,' he said yesterday. 'We managed to convince the EU and the US
that the longer they left it before they settled their differences, the
greater the resistence there would be any proposals - even reasonable ones,'
he said.
The result was the dramatic US-EU 'agreement to disagree', which in reality
dumped on to the Gatt secretariat five large problems to negotiate at the
last minute in a multilateral context. These ranged from financial and
audio-visual services, to shipping, textiles and intellectual property
rights.
Then he started to 'gavel through' approval of different parts of the
negotiated text of the 550-page final act at a hectic pace. 'At one point,
we were gavelling through at a rate of one article every five minutes - it
became a matter of immense amusement,' one participant recalled.
No-one paused to recognise that the gavelling process in fact had no legal
authority. Yet the myth of the unchallengeable authority of the gavel
remained intact right through to Wednesday evening, when the entire text was
gavelled in a piece of pure theatre.
'Up to this moment, we have been firefighting,' Mr Sutherland said
yesterday. 'The agenda has been driven by the Uruguay Round. From here on,
we will be able to examine matters issue by issue.'
He insists he has not yet charted a strategy for the future. A two-day
retreat in January for himself and a small group of colleagues is intended
to get that in place. But a more-powerful World Trade Organisation is likely
to be a very different animal from the Gatt of the past 45 years. Planning
the new structure and functions of the WTO will absorb much time.
Perhaps Mr Sutherland's fighting qualities will be in less demand. 'If we
were worried about the occasional fight, we would not have appointed an
Irish rugby player as director general,' a colleague noted. Not just a rugby
player - but a prop forward too.

FT  17 DEC 93 / The GATT Agreement: Confusion over Section 301 powers on
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The extent of curbs placed by the new world trade accord on unilateral
action by the US was the subject of conflicting statements yesterday. In
particular, confusion arose over whether US Section 301 retaliatory powers
could be used against financial and audio-visual services specifically
exempted from fair trade obligations under the Uruguay Round services
accord.
US officials said the administration could continue to take unilateral
reprisals against unfair trading practices in services exempted from the
general services agreement obligation to give equal market access to all
trading partners, known as Most Favoured Nation treatment.
On Tuesday, at the end of their final negotiating marathon, Mr Mickey
Kantor, US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, European Union trade
commissioner, said that after failing to settle disputes on audiovisual and
financial services, both sides would be taking MFN exemptions in these
sectors.
The EU later argued that because these services are covered by the Uruguay
Round general services agreement, the US would in future be barred from
taking unilateral action. Since MFN exemptions are contained in country
schedules (part of the Uruguay Round services accord), these were
effectively sheltered from Section 301 attack.
Gatt officials share this interpretation. 'The US can't challenge MFN
exemptions under Section 301,' said one. 'The country schedules are an
integral part of the Uruguay Round deal.' 'If the EU tables an exemption and
the US accepts that, I don't see the US has a leg to stand on,' said
another.
The EU has taken several exemptions from MFN treatment in the audio-visual
sector, most importantly for its system of broadcasting quotas reserving the
majority of TV programming for European productions. The US, on reflection,
decided there was no need for it to do so, officials said.
Mr Kantor said on Tuesday the US would also be taking exemptions for
audio-visual services, but in the end decided not to do so, officials
stated. US officials say an MFN exemption simply removes the obligation of
countries to conform to non-discrimination rules, but does not protect it
from challenge that its practices are unfair. 'An MFN exemption doesn't mean
a country can do what it likes,' a US negotiator declared. 'There's nothing
in the services agreement that bars us from using Section 301.' That already
requires the administration to seek recourse under multilateral dispute
procedures where available.
The new streamlined Uruguay Round disputes settlement procedure will cover
services (and intellectual property) for the first time, obliging the US to
route more disputes through multilateral procedures. But 'if a country has
an MFN exemption we wouldn't have recourse under the services agreement', so
unilateral action would be possible, the US official added. Further
multilateral talks on maritime services will be held along with continuing
ones on financial services, as agreed by Mr Kantor and Sir Leon on Tuesday,
trade officials said. The shipping talks, like those planned for basic
telecommunications, are set to end in 1996.

Europe's personal computer manufacturers cried foul this week following news
that the European Union would maintain 14 per cent tariff barriers against
critical semiconductor components imported from outside Europe.
They predicted the result would be pared profits, damaged competitiveness,
and pressure to move production out of Europe.
The protest follows a last-minute decision by EU officials in the
tariff-cutting negotiations in the Uruguay Round of global trade
liberalisation to maintain tariff protection for imports of D-Rams, critical
components in all personal computers and other consumer electronics
products.
This was in spite of agreement to make sweeping tariff cuts across large
parts of the semiconductor and industrial electronics sectors.
'With almost no D-Ram production capacity in Europe, we have to import these
at high cost from Japan and Korea,' said Mr Bruno Lamborgini of Olivetti. Mr
Lamborgini is also president of the European Association of Manufacturers of
Business Machines and the Information Technology Industry (Eurobit).
'It's a nonsense to maintain a 14 per cent tariff wall, while reducing
tariffs on other components. It will have a powerful negative effect on
Europe's competitiveness, and may force us to move production out of
Europe,' he added.
The tariffs add Ecu20m (Pounds 15.24m) a year to Olivetti's costs: personal
computers account for 25 per cent of the company's sales.
The tariffs also hurt manufacturers such as ICL, Philips and Bull.
Eurobit accounts for annual computer output of about Ecu12bn, Mr Lamborgini
declared. 'Everyone works on extremely thin margins, and even a small amount
can make an immense difference to competitiveness.'
The only company appearing to benefit is Siemens of Germany, which has a
limited D-Ram capacity and may have plans to add to this in the near future.

FT  17 DEC 93 / The GATT Agreement: No 'slam dunk' shot for Gatt in Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has officially informed Congress of his intention to
sign a Uruguay Round package, but he repeated past vows not to 'enter any
agreement unless I am satisfied that US interests are protected'.
While praising the overall package, he said negotiations would continue to
work on 'a few areas of significance that we were unable to resolve at this
time'. This includes financial services, audio-visual trade and market
access.
'Some commitments were contingent on receiving satisfactory commitments from
other countries,' he said in a speech on Wedenesday night. 'We will continue
to work to ensure that the best possible agreement.'
Gatt - not to mention the newly named World Trade Organisation - is as
obscure as ever to most Americans; it is not likely to inspire the level of
passion achieved in the battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Congressional approval of the trade deal could be many months off, and might
even slip into 1995. Mr Clinton has 90 days in which to sign approval of the
package, then a further 90 legislative days before sending the implementing
legislation to Congress, already facing a packed agenda next year.
The long delay will allow both pro- and anti-Gatt forces, still trying to
disentangle the detail of the deal, plenty of time to muster arguments and
lobby congressmen.
Most of the business community in Washington yesterday was reacting
positively to the agreement. The chemical industry, however bemoaned the
failure of many countries to agree to tariff cuts.
'Our support for tariff reductions down to the 5-6 per cent range was
conditioned upon obtaining major country coverage in the round and the
elimination of non-tariff measures,' it said. 'If the developing countries
aren't on board, then the US must reserve the right to make adjustments to
its offer. . . to keep pressure on the developing countries to participate.
'We've been told this is possible, and urge it as a strategy of last
resort.'
Other industries have not achieved their objectives. However, it is by no
means clear they will strongly oppose it.
The main opposition that is surfacing is built around the core of populists
which fought the North American Free Trade Agreement. The followers of Mr
Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, may join in, but the trade unions may
split, depending on the gains achieved by their industries.
Congressman Jim Kolbe of Arizona, one of the cannier leaders of the Nafta
fight, believes it will not be 'a slam dunk', or easy shot, to get Gatt
approved by Congress.
Mr Kolbe was disappointed that the Japanese held firm against reducing their
tariffs on copper, a major commodity in the state. But he will still support
the deal.
'The issues in the Nafta were clear cut,' he said. 'This will be much
cloudier. There will be an attempt to pick off individual members by
different interest groups.
'Some agriculture people will oppose it and we could lose the
pharmaceuticals.' The environmentalists, who are beginning to appear to be
solidly against the pact, have exhausted their influence in the Nafta
battle.
Mr Abraham Katz, a former US ambassador to the OECD and president of the US
Council for International Business, says the members of his groups -
multinationals and service providers - will support the pact. It is
inevitable industry will be less united on Gatt than on Nafta, because many
had aims diametrically opposed. Exporters wanted the US dumping laws
weakened; domestic industry wanted them preserved. 'Every one of these
issues was a matter of balancing,' Mr Katz said.

Six European Union member-states said yesterday they were establishing full
diplomatic relations with Macedonia, despite strong opposition from Greece.
Diplomats from Germany, France, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark
made separate visits to the Foreign Ministry in Skopje to inform the
Macedonian government.
The move is set to irritate Greece, which takes over the presidency of the
European Union next year, and add an extra edge of controversy to EU
attempts to co-ordinate foreign policy.
Greece has insisted that recognition of Macedonia by its EU partners would
undermine the principle of a joint foreign policy because Macedonia's name
implies a territorial claim on the northern Greek province of Macedonia.
Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greek minister for European affairs, recently
provoked a diplomatic row by accusing Germany of acting like a 'bestial
giant' for pushing for recognition. Although he later apologised, the timing
of the announcement, rushed through just before Greece assumed the
presidency, seems likely to further strain relations.
However, British diplomats yesterday denied that the announcements had been
co-ordinated by Germany or its EU other partners. 'This was an entirely
national matter,' said the British Foreign Office, stressing that
recognition was a 'normal step' given that Britain and other European
countries had accepted Macedonia's entry into the United Nations in April.
Meanwhile, Mr Kiro Gligorev, Macedonian president, stressed that he wanted
'widespread co-operation' with Greece. Macedonia was willing to sign an
agreement guaranteeing the present border with Greece, he said.

The number of asylum applications to European countries has slowed in the
past year, primarily because of a drop in applications to Germany, according
to the Geneva-based Inter-Governmental Consultants on immigration, writes
Gillian Tett in London. During the first three quarters of 1993, 471,077
asylum applications were made to European countries, compared with 679,900
in 1992.

Tens of thousands of Romanians yesterday attended anti-government
demonstrations as part of a series of rallies and strikes organised by the
country's largest trade union, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. Unions
say that if the government does not meet their demands, they will hold a
strike in mid-January. Both the unions and pro-reform opposition parties,
which today bring a motion of no-confidence in the government, say the
economy will worsen unless privatisation and restructuring are accelerated.

Mr Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister, yesterday defended his
country's recycling scheme following a decision by European environment
ministers to introduce lower European recycling quotas than those in
Germany, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn.
In a statement, Mr Topfer, the architect of Germany's ambitious
environmental legislation, said the agreement would set back recycling
programmes in Europe and force Germany to produce more waste.
'It is not supposed to be the EU's job to standardise the environmental
tempo in all member states at any price or even to reverse it,' Mr Topfer
said.

Unisource, a Pan-European joint venture between the telecom companies of the
Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland, has entered into a partnership with
Sita, a global data network operator owned by airlines, freight forwarders
and other companies involved in world aviation, writes Ronald van de Krol in
Amsterdam.
The alliance will give Unisource access to telecommunications networks
outside of its base in Europe. For Sita, whose full name is Societe
Internationale de Telecommunications Aeronautique, the partnership will open
up opportunities to find customers outside the aviation sector.
Unisource's aim is to provide 'seamless' global data communications to
multinationals in direct competition with big telecommunications operators
such as AT&amp;T of the US and British Telecom. Unisource and Sita said their
networks were based on compatible technologies, making partnership between
them straightforward.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Russians caught between the extremes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is caught between two extremes: the message from elections last
weekend to slow down or abandon reforms - and demands of Russian reformers
and the international community for faster progress towards the market.
In Moscow yesterday, US Vice-President Al Gore appeared aware of the
strength of the message from the electorate when he criticised the
International Monetary Fund for being insensitive to results of harsh
economic measures with which it is associated. He spoke movingly about the
effect of vast and rapid budget cuts (implemented, it should be said, not by
the IMF but by Russian governments) on defence industry jobs.
Mr Gore's intervention, appeared at odds with a Russian White House briefing
on on Wednesday afternoon and surprised financial officials in Moscow and
his own entourage. At the very least it reflects uncertainty in the US and
among other Group of Seven countries about how to assist Russia in the
changed political climate.
'The whole thing is on hold,' said one official. 'We have a changed
situation here, in which it will be much more difficult for the government
to go forward with anything approaching austerity. The west will have to try
to look at how to reorganise its programmes to be more responsive to current
concerns.'
The reformers have not given up: Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister in
charge of finance, called on President Boris Yeltsin to speed up reforms -
and repeated his threat to resign if Mr Viktor Gerashchenko is reappointed
head of the central bank. But if Mr Gore's line is followed internationally,
the reformers may find they have lost support not just in the country, but
in the west.
Dr Andreas Gummich, Deutsche Bank's expert, said: 'The reformers must
address the problems raised by (the nationalist) Vladimir Zhirinovsky -
especially the law and order issue. And the IMF must take some lessons from
this too.' For the World Bank and IMF the dilemma is acute. The Bank has an
ambitious programme of lending more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) to
energy and other sectors in the coming year; the Fund has to decide whether
to proceed with the second, Dollars 1.5bn tranche of its 'systemic
transformation facility', crafted to give immediate support to the
reformers.
Even before the elections, these were in doubt. Curbing the budget deficit
to 10 per cent of gross national product for the year and to Rbs5,500bn in
the fourth quarter has been achieved only by deferring necessary payments of
an estimated Rbs5,000bn which will have to be met early in 1994. The year
will thus begin with a vast deficit.
The strategy, so far followed by the institutions and the G7, of agreeing
with Mr Gaidar's priority of bringing down inflation and restraining the
budget, is likely to be reviewed, especially in countries such as Japan that
have been sceptical about rapid reform. What may gain favour is specific aid
to certain sectors, that can be restructured with an assumption of continued
inflation.
In the past months, there have been indications that western business is
more interested in Russia. Fewer than 100 US companies had offices in Moscow
18 months ago; now at least 500 have.
But Mr James Tilley, vice-president of Conoco - whose Dollars 200m
investment in the Polar Lights oil project and plans for a further
investment of Dollars 3bn represent the largest western commitment to Russia
 -said: 'There will be a period of 2-3 months where people will think very
carefully about what is happening here. It will be difficult to get things
done with the government. If parliament and the people clearly indicate they
don't want foreign investment here, then we can't do business. But we don't
think that is the case. We think things have progressed to the point where
westerners can do business here.'
Mr Bruce MacDonald, whose BBDO advertising agency was one of the first in
Russia, said foreign businessmen had feared three things - a non-convertible
currency, a population with little money and political instability. 'The
first of these has been removed; second, spending power has greatly
increased; and the third is a function of a democratic vote.'
Mr Joseph Condon, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Moscow, said all foreign businesses wanted rapid action on a number of
fronts - taxes, duties on imports, licensing and finance and banking and the
lack of a commercial legal code. 'Russia is going through a profound
transformation. That transformation does not come easily and in my view will
not come quickly. It will probably take a generation.'
David White, Defence Correspondent, adds: Mr Malcolm Rifkind, British
defence secretary, warned yesterday of the risk of 'a resurgent, aggressive
Russia'. Although Russia's goals differed from the former Soviet Union's,
Nato had to face the possibility in future of an expansionist and
anti-democratic government in Moscow, he told the Royal Institute of
International Affairs.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Opel presses case against VW 'poaching': Frankfurt court to
hear GM unit's claim of unfair competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A German court will next month hear an action by the General Motors
subsidiary, Adam Opel, which claims that seven senior staff who left to join
Volkswagen should be suspended from work.
Opel is expected to produce evidence and statements to back its claim that
VW's hiring of the seven constituted unfair competition. The seven are close
associates of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former GM director, and
joined him within days of his move to VW last March.
Allegations of theft and industrial espionage against Mr Lopez and three of
these followers are under investigation by the German criminal authorities.
The US justice department is running a similar probe.
A Frankfurt civil court yesterday turned down on technical grounds an appeal
against an earlier rejection of Opel's request for a temporary injunction
barring the seven from working at VW for a year.
The court ruled that Opel should have laid its suit against VW itself, and
not Mr Lopez and Mr Ferdinand Piech, the group chairman.
Mr Horst Borghs, an Opel director, said he was confident of 'a different
result' at the full hearing, in which the complaint was directed at VW.
The US-owned company took up the suit after winning an injunction barring VW
from attempting to poach further staff. Statements supporting this case,
which includes allegations that Mr Lopez offered to double the salaries of
Opel managers if they switched to VW, are expected to be offered as evidence
at the January hearing. VW officials appeared concerned at the prospects of
a long legal process, consuming senior management's time which would be
better spent at work.
This was why the company had been prepared to settle out of court, a
spokesman said. VW had initially been prepared to suspend four of the seven
for nine months, but withdrew its agreement after Opel demanded further
concessions. Despite yesterday's apparent setback, Opel seems determined to
maintain the pressure on VW and Mr Lopez and keep the case in the public eye
until the results of the criminal investigation are known.
The civil court hearing, scheduled for January 5, could offer an opportunity
for Opel's lawyers to question Mr Lopez in public for the first time.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Kohl braves his 'twilight months'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The mood in Germany is more miserable than at any stage since the depths of
the last depression in 1980, and the popularity of Chancellor Helmut Kohl
has hit a new low, according to opinion polls.
The newspapers are talking of collapse in the ruling coalition and a
'twilight of the chancellor'. Yet Mr Kohl himself remains unmoved and
apparently immovable: 'It is only midday,' he said yesterday. 'I do not see
any sign of twilight.'
The occasion was the chancellor's traditional end-of-year press conference,
a ritual round-up of the government's successes, and failures, of the year,
and a chance for the media to tease and taunt their prime political target.
If the opinion polls are anything to go by, Mr Kohl is in dire straits. The
Forsa opinion research institute said yesterday that only 24 per cent of the
population would back him to become chancellor again, against 37 per cent
for his rival, Mr Rudolf Scharping of the Social Democratic party.
It is four points down on the chancellor's rating one year ago, according to
the poll for RTL television. On the other hand, no fewer than 39 per cent do
not like the idea of either Mr Kohl or Mr Scharping as chancellor.
As for the respected Allensbach Institute, the longest established of
Germany's opinion polling organisations, it says that the national gloom is
deepening. No fewer than 83 per cent of the population believe they are
living through particularly difficult and uncertain times, and fear it will
stay that way.
Barely one third of west Germans believe in a brighter future. The
pessimism, according to the Allensbach monthly poll in the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung, is worse than at any time since 1980.
Yet the chancellor's performance yesterday suggests that he sees nothing to
worry about. He demonstrated his faith in his ability to sit out any storm,
and emerge victorious at the general election in October 1994.
The chancellor could hardly be said to be cocky. His mood was subdued. On
most of the questions of the day - such as budget cuts, the Russian
elections, the state presidency, and his own re-election - his answers were
very much the same: 'You will have to wait and see.' But it is a formula
which has stood him in good stead up till now.

FT  17 DEC 93 / UK and France clash on EU aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and France are fighting over their shares of Ecu30bn (Pounds 23bn)
in structural aid for industrially depressed, high-unemployment regions.
The funding is for so-called Objective 2 areas, judged to be in industrial
decline. It is a much smaller portion of the overall Ecu156bn regional aid
budget for 1994-99. Most of that goes to the four poorest member states,
whereas Objective 2 funding is funnelled to the black spots in the European
Union's larger economies.
The problem arises because the regulations approved in July concentrate the
Objective 2 pot on a maximum of 15 per cent of the EU population.
Total bids put in by the 12 would cover 23 per cent of the Union's
inhabitants. Commission officials say that after very hard negotiations, 10
of the member states are more or less satisfied. But the UK wants Objective
2 funding to cover 40 per cent of the British population, while France wants
coverage for a third of its inhabitants.
Both countries have been asked to resubmit more reasonable bids. If they do
not, the Commission will be obliged to decide for them, and that would lead
to serious political friction.
Eligibility for the Objective 2 aid has until now required: an unemployment
rate greater than the EU average; a higher percentage of industrial
employment than the EU average; and a decline specifically in industrial
jobs.
These criteria, which are relatively easy to measure, were ratified in July.
But new, more judgmental criteria, for instance on aid to rebuild inner
cities, were added, complicating the share-out and stimulating over-bidding.
Commission officials, however, are particularly dismissive of some of the
areas on the UK's shopping list, such as the Isle of Wight and swathes of
the governing Conservative party's heartland in south-east England, which
they do not regard as meeting the criteria.
The clash between Brussels and London and Paris could widen if the
Commission makes any significant concession to the UK and France, since any
extra funding they get would have to be taken from their partners.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Skoda finds Volkswagen less than reliable: The Czech
government is asking the German carmaker to honour its promises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen's joint venture with Skoda, the Czech car manufacturer, had been
hailed as a shining example of east-west co-operation in the post-communist
era. Now it has become a source of embarrassment and friction between the
Czech government and the German vehicles group.
Today, at a meeting in Ingolstadt, near the Czech border with Germany, Mr
Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech Industry minister, will remind Mr Ferdinand
Piech, VW chairman, that the Czech government is still the majority
shareholder in the venture and should be treated accordingly. He will ask
for details of VW's plans for Skoda, where the German group has a 31 per
cent stake, which is due to be raised to 70 per cent by the end of 1995,
with an option to buy the rest later.
The meeting has been called after months of controversy culminating in a
fierce public exchange over VW's decision to cut its projected investment in
the venture from DM7bn (Pounds 2.75bn) to DM3.7bn and to scrap plans to
build a new engine plant. This follows an earlier row over the cancellation
by VW in September of a DM1.4bn investment financing package for Skoda only
hours before it was to be signed in London. The Czech government, which
holds a 69 per cent stake in the venture, says VW failed to inform it in
advance about these moves.
Prague accepts that VW, which faces big losses this year, may have good
reason for scaling down its plans for Skoda, but officials say they must be
consulted, and that VW must honour the joint venture agreement signed in
1991, over which there is a dispute about what is legally binding.
Prague officials say that the government is meeting its obligations to cover
any restitution claims against Skoda and its pre-1991 debts.
VW for its part, promised to produce an improved version of the popular
Skoda Favorit model, build a new engine plant, and develop a new car.
'We want to see these promises materialised. I don't consider (the engine
plant) to be fully out,' says Mr Dlouhy.
The difficulty for the government is that many of VW's promises of future
investments in Skoda are not part of the original contract, but were made
separately to ministers of the previous government. Ironically, VW was
chosen in preference to Renault for the venture primarily on the strength of
its investment plans, though these will now be considerably less than
expected. But what has hurt Czech pride most is that rather than Skoda
becoming a major car producer in its own right - fully developing and
building its own models - it could turn out to be little more than an
assembly plant run from Germany.
The government is also concerned that VW's moves to cut back its investment
will affect the value of Skoda's shares, making it more difficult to find
buyers for the final 30 per cent should VW not take up its option. 'We need
to show Skoda is in good shape if we want to get a good price. For that we
need a secure investment programme by VW. By cutting their investment by
half they undermine the implicit future price of these shares,' says a
Prague official.
Under growing public pressure and criticism of VW in the Czech press, the
government has to show it is fighting for Czech interests. Officials dismiss
as unrealistic suggestions that the government should find an alternative
investor, but they say the government as majority shareholder could force
management changes at Skoda, and decide how the annual dividend is used.
Most of all it will press to be kept better informed about VW's intentions.
'After all, unlike in Catalonia (VW's troubled Seat plant), we are still the
majority shareholder. We have the right to know (what VW is doing),' says
one official.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A report into last year's crash of an Airbus A320 in eastern France,
published yesterday, blamed a 'complex chain of causes' and made more than
30 recommendations. These included a modification to the design of one
instrument, and measures to strengthen cross-checking of information by the
flight crew.
Airbus Industrie said it had already introduced a modification to the layout
of the flight control unit in new A320s and had contacted airlines using the
old layout about plans to update them.
The report into the accident, in which 87 people died, said the aircraft was
descending four times faster than usual as it prepared to land at
Strasbourg. Several hypotheses were advanced to explain the rapid descent.
These included human error, possibly because the pilot had made a mistake in
setting the descent mode of the aircraft, or a technical fault in the
controls which change descent modes. In each hypothesis, however, the report
said 'an accident was possible because the crew were unaware of the anomaly
in the descent path'.
Airbus said the modifications to the flight deck design concerned the
display of descent modes.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Probe faults nine out of 10 pension transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only one in 10 cases where individuals transferred savings out of employers'
pension schemes into private plans was handled in line with regulatory
requirements, according to a pilot study published yesterday.
The report was produced by the accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick for the
Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. It covers 2 1/2
years from the start of 1991.
The overall figure for unsatisfactory cases shows that guidance issued by
the regulators improved standards to some extent. Before they acted, 95 per
cent of cases were unsatisfactory, although even afterwards this figure had
dropped only to 80 per cent.
Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said the report showed why the board
announced last week it was taking steps to prevent such low standards and to
ensure that people affected by bad advice could be fully compensated.
Privately, however, some other regulators have expressed dissatisfaction at
the way the SIB has handled the issue. They have doubts about drawing
conclusions from a sample of 735 cases, when there were about 300,000
pension transfers in the period covered by the report.
Within the industry, some leading pension providers intend to respond and
make clear their view that they are not implicated in the report's findings.
Life insurance company shares closed 2.5 per cent down yesterday although
the FT-SE 100 index was 1 per cent up at a new high.
The study came as MPs on the influential cross-party Treasury committee
announced that its next inquiry, starting in late January, would be into the
regulation of financial services, and would include the handling of these
pension transactions.
The MPs held preliminary sessions with Mr Anthony Nelson, the economic
secretary, and Mr Large earlier in the year, and both will be recalled.
Other regulators will also be asked for evidence early in the new year,
together with leading figures in the industry, such as Mr Mick Newmarch,
chief executive of Prudential, Britain's largest life insurance company.
Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of the committee, said the government's
belief that there was still no case for statutory regulation of financial
services would be one of the 'assumptions we will want to test quite
rigorously'.
The KPMG study referred only to pension transfer business handled by
advisers and sales agents regulated by Fimbra, Lautro and Imro, three retail
financial services regulators.
It did not cover organisations regulated directly by the SIB, such as banks
and building societies dealing in this area, since it was the SIB's concern
about the widespread non-compliance within its own constituency that
prompted it to question the pension transfer business being monitored by
other regulators.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Workers win control of United Airlines for Dollars 5bn pay
cuts

United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, has reached a deal with its labour
unions that would give employees a controlling stake in the company in
return for Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) worth of wage cuts and productivity
improvements over the next six years.
The deal will send a shock-wave through the US airline industry. Other big
carriers will be forced to reach similar agreements with their unions or
risk going out of business because of their uncompetitive costs.
United has been negotiating with its unions for nearly six months in an
attempt to bring labour costs down. Like other big US carriers, it has
suffered severe competition on domestic routes from smaller, low-cost
carriers.
The company had threatened to cut losses by contracting out all its
servicing and maintenance activities and divesting its short-haul operations
to newly-formed non-union subsidiaries if no agreement was reached. That
plan will now be abandoned.
Instead, 60,000 of United's 82,000 employees will accept wage cuts,
reductions in benefits and changes in working practices that will produce
savings over the next six years with a net present value of Dollars 5bn. In
return, they will receive new ordinary shares worth Dollars 173 each in a
recapitalised United, which will be held in employee stock ownership plans,
known as Esops.
The size of their stake will be between 53 per cent and 63 per cent,
depending on the value of United's existing shares at the time the
transaction takes place. United will compensate its present shareholders for
the dilution of their equity by giving them one new share plus Dollars 88
worth of cash, preferred stock and interest-bearing loan notes for every
existing share they hold.
The existing shares fell Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 144 yesterday amid
uncertainty over the value of the deal. The employee ownership scheme is the
third, but by far the biggest, in the US airline industry.
Earlier this year Trans World Airlines traded 45 per cent of its equity for
Dollars 660m worth of labour concessions and Northwest Airlines agreed to
swap up to 37.5 per cent of its shares for Dollars 886m worth of
concessions.
The deal was between United's management and two unions: the Air Line Pilots
Association and the International Union of Machinists.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Sharp drop in jobless to 2.81m: Unemployment lowest for 15
months - FT-SE 100 surges to new high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government claims that the economy is strong enough to withstand sharp tax
increases in the spring were strengthened yesterday by the unemployment
figures for November which fell to their lowest level since August last
year.
The seasonally adjusted jobless total dropped 36,100 to 2.81m, after a
revised 52,100 fall in October, bringing the rate of unemployment down to 10
per cent of the workforce. The November fall was the second biggest monthly
decline for four years.
The figures, coming against a backdrop of low inflation, pushed share prices
to an all-time closing high as investors raised their expectations for an
early cut in interest rates. The FT-SE 100 share index ended 32.4 up at
3,311.2. Sterling, after a morning fillip, closed unchanged against the
D-Mark at DM2.545. Against the dollar, it was just over half a cent stronger
at Dollars 1.489.
Good inflation figures earlier this week, pointing to a lack of price
pressures in the economy, were reinforced yesterday by average earnings
growth figures which held steady at 3 per cent in the year to October.
Optimism about economic prospects will be further fuelled by a Confederation
of British Industry survey published today which says order books have
improved in recent weeks, even though expectations of output increases have
slipped.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, said the fall in the jobless total
 -the eighth monthly drop so far this year - came as a 'Christmas message of
hope for unemployed people'. He added: 'Today's further fall of 36,100 in
unemployment means that we are ending 1993 with more jobs and with 176,400
fewer people out of work.'
But Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, said the downward
trend in unemployment would be reversed by tax increases and spending cuts
in the spring.
'Relatively small reductions in cyclical unemployment will have no impact on
the long-term structural unemployment caused by the run-down of
manufacturing, and a radical alternative programme of job creation is
urgently needed,' he said.
Both the level and rate of seasonally adjusted unemployment are at their
lowest since August last year. The rate of 10 per cent compares with 10.6
per cent in January when the number of people out of work and claiming
benefit peaked at just below 3m. The separate rates in November were 13.5
per cent for men and 5.4 per cent for women. During the month 28,000 fewer
men and 8,100 fewer women were unemployed.
Unadjusted, unemployment fell by 24,000 to 2.76m. The last time it was lower
was in June 1992.
There was an encouraging rise in vacancies, generally a reliable guide to
future trends in unemployment. The stock of unfilled vacancies rose by
6,500, while new vacancies notified to Jobcentres - about one third of all
vacancies in the economy - rose by 10,000 in November to the highest level
for nearly 3 1/2 years.
The figures also showed that in the three months to September, the workforce
in employment rose by 86,000, the second successive quarterly rise.
Manufacturing employment, however, fell in the third quarter, reversing two
previous quarterly increases.
Commenting on the figures, Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon
Brothers, said: 'It appears that the trend in unemployment is clearly down.'
However, he pointed out that unemployment was still at historically high
levels.

FT  17 DEC 93 / Sinn Fein reaction keeps hopes of Ulster peace alive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, KEVIN BROWN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of peace in Northern Ireland were kept alive yesterday when Sinn Fein
said it would take time to consider in detail its response to this week's
peace initiative by Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds.
As the British government sought to reassure Unionists at Westminster by
giving the go-ahead for a Northern Ireland parliamentary select committee,
Mr Gerry Adams, president of the IRA's political wing, said he was still
'personally and politically' committed to helping secure peace in Northern
Ireland. But he warned there were 'no quick fixes' to the province's
problems.
His statement reflected the difficulties the Republican movement is having
in co-ordinating a response to the prime minister's main demand that the IRA
should lay down its arms.
It is understood that an early meeting between senior Sinn Fein officials
and members of the IRA on Wednesday failed to produce an agreed response to
the joint declaration. The final decision is in the hands of the IRA's Army
Council which is understood not to have met in full session on the issue.
Mr Adams said the Downing Street declaration was the product of 'frenzied
activity' by the two governments after his talks with Mr John Hume, leader
of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, had
'focused them on this issue'. He would be seeking clarification from Dublin
on some aspects of Wednesday's statement by the UK and Irish prime
ministers.
At Westminster, Mr Major came under pressure from his own back benches over
whether the declaration diluted the government's commitment to the Union. In
an acid exchange, he clashed with Mr Norman Lamont over the former
chancellor's assertion that the declaration stood 'a little oddly' with his
speech to the Conservative party conference in October.
In contrast to the cross-party plaudits for the government on Wednesday,
there were further backbench rumblings in the wake of a signal from Sir
Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, that the government might begin
talks with Sinn Fein without waiting for the IRA to hand in its weapons. One
Tory MP accused the government of giving in to terrorists.
Downing Street said the select committee decision - announced yesterday by
Mr Tony Newton, the Commons leader - was not related to the Anglo-Irish
declaration on Northern Ireland, which was 'on a separate track'. Officials
said the decision - which was not communicated in advance to Mr Reynolds or
Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader - was taken by Mr
Newton after consultation with Mr Major and Sir Patrick.
The IRA last night claimed responsibility for two bombs discovered earlier
by the track near Brookwood railway station, Surrey. Army teams blew up the
packages at the station.

FT  17 DEC 93 / European fund for refugees criticised in report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fund owned by 21 European governments to help refugees evolved into a
substantial investor in international money markets and provided lavish
rewards for its staff, according to a confidential official report.
The report by accountants Castel Jacquet Ernst &amp; Young into the activities
of the Council of Europe's Social Fund also says it exercised insufficient
care in monitoring how its loans, which totalled Ecu6.7bn (Pounds 5.1bn) at
the end of 1992, were used.
A loan from the fund had, for example, been used to finance the building of
a Sheraton hotel in Milan, according to Mrs Paule Dufour, president of the
fund's governing body, who has been trying to reform the institution.
The Ernst report also discloses that cheap mortgages for employees were used
for property speculation and executives were allowed to make large
withdrawals from a pension fund while retaining their jobs.
The fund's governing body meets in Paris today to elect a new governor,
following the resignation last month of Mr Roger Vanden Branden, who had
held the post since 1979.

FT  16 DEC 93 / (CORRECTED) The Gatt Deal: Banks regret 'bad news' on
barriers - Services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, ANDREW JACK and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 20th December 1993) appended to this article.
The failure of the US and the European Union to agree any important measures
to open international markets in financial services and maritime shipping
drew widely varying responses from the two industries yesterday.
Financial institutions mostly expressed disappointment, though some
expressed confidence that market forces would gradually bring about the
erosion of restrictions and freer trade which official negotiators had
failed to achieve.
The shipping industry, by contrast, expressed relief it had been left out of
the Uruguay Round, claiming inclusion could have formalised restrictive
practices rather than remove barriers to trade.
Mr Nikolaus Boemcke, secretary general of the European Banking Federation,
called exclusion of financial services from the Uruguay Round 'bad news',
because offers made during the negotiations might not remain on the table.
He was disappointed that countries outside Europe had not agreed to offer
reciprocal concessions similar to those available to them under the EU's
banking rules. 'Our weapons against entry into Europe are not very strong,'
he said. The main hope of European banks and securities houses has been that
the Gatt round would increase their access to markets in the Asia Pacific
region and Latin America, while protecting their right to establish
subsidiaries in the US.
However, there is now doubt about the future of some market-opening
proposals made in the talks, such as a Japanese offer to allow foreign
institutions to manage private sector pension funds.
There is also uncertainty about the future status of certain types of
cross-border activity, such as advisory work on international mergers and
acquisitions, which do not require establishment of a foreign subsidiary. To
some institutions, the negotiators' inability to agree on measures which
protected existing trade in financial services was as much a source of
regret as their failure to open markets.
Mr Bob Blower, assistant director of the British Bankers' Association,
expressed concern at the lack of a 'standstill' arrangement to prevent
future retaliatory action.
'To be certain that the rules will not change is very important if you are
considering setting up a subsidiary overseas. At the moment, the dangers of
retaliation are theoretical, but the world can change,' he said.
Shipowners have argued that their sector is already broadly liberalised and
that inclusion in the Gatt provisions would slow rather than speed
liberalisation.
CORRECTION
The Financial Times of December 16 incorrectly quoted Mr Nikolaus Boemcke,
secretary general of the European Banking Federation, as implying that
financial services and shipping had been excluded from the Uruguay Round
agreement on global trade liberalisation. In fact, both sectors are included
in the agreement. Further talks are continuing to settle outstanding
differences in these areas.

'The whole year 1993-94 result before tax and extraordinary items is
expected to be somewhat better than for 1992-93,' the company said. This

FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: French hotels group warns of
sharp fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Societe des Bains de Mer (SBM), the hotel and casino group and the biggest
single company in Monaco, yesterday warned of a sharp fall in net profits
for the current financial year.
SBM, which owns the famous Monte Carlo Casino and the luxurious Hotel de
Paris and Hotel Hermitage, reported an 18 per cent reduction in interim net
profits, to FFr88.1m (Dollars 15.03m) in the six months to September 30,
from FFr107.6m in the same period of 1992.
The group blamed the fall on the difficult economic environment, and on
financial charges relating to its ongoing investment programme and pension
provision.
It said the summer season had been reasonably robust in spite of the
pressures on the European economy, and particularly the Mediterranean
tourist market. It also made progress in controlling costs. However, group
turnover fell 11.6 per cent during the first half, to FFr932.7m from
FFr1.06bn.
The problem posed by this slowdown in activity was aggravated by the
volatile nature of SBM's casino business, which provided 73 per cent of
turnover in the last full financial year. The profitability of its gaming
interests is heavily dependent on the size of gamblers' stakes and by the
rate of wins and losses.

ING Bank of the Netherlands yesterday signed a letter of intent with the
Polish government under which it promises to buy a 25.9 per cent stake in
the Bank Slaski, the second of the country's state-owned banks to be
privatised.
The 2.4m shares are priced at 500,000 zlotys (USDollars 24.20) each, making
the investment worth around Dollars 58m when the agreement is signed early
next month.
The deal is the first acquisition by a western commercial bank of a
significant share in an eastern European bank.
It is also one of the largest foreign investment projects in Poland to date.
Mr Gerrit Tammes, the vice-chairman of the group's banking arm, said that
the purchase meant technical assistance for the Bank Slaski, while ING would
be acquiring 'knowledge of the market'.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is soon due to
approve a Dollars 165m financial package for Fiat Auto Poland, the Italian
carmaker's subsidiary in Bielsko Biala which makes the Cinquecento and Fiat
126 models.
The package is to consist of a Dollars 40m equity stake, which would amount
to around 10 per cent of the company's share capital, and Dollars 120m in
loans - part of which would come direct from the EBRD and the remainder
syndicated by the bank.
Fiat is due to produce around 250,000 vehicles at Bielsko this year and
plans to start assembly of the Uno model there next year.

<TEXT>
Mr Javier Alvarez Vara, president of the Spanish aerospace company Casa for
the past seven years, has been appointed head of Inespal, the aluminium
producer. The move is part of a reshuffle of top jobs in Spain's state-owned
corporations.
In a second move, Mr Manuel Fernandez Garca, a former trade unionist who
became chairman of the nationalised capital goods manufacturer Babcock &amp;
Wilcox in 1985, has been promoted to head the group of companies that form
the industrial backbone of the Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI), the
public-sector holding company.
The changes appear to represent an attempt by INI to put its more successful
executives into the holding's trouble spots.
However, Mr Alvarez and Mr Fernandez will be missed at Casa and Babcock &amp;
Wilcox respectively. Both companies have recently returned to profitability
after years of losses and are now seen as possible candidates for
privatisation.
Inespal is forecast to lose between Pta35bn and Pta40bn (Dollars
250m-Dollars 286m) this year on sales of Pta100bn.

<TEXT>
Poland's chief debt negotiator, Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, will give the first
sign of Polish willingness to compromise on its long-standing demand for a
50 per cent reduction in its Dollars 13bn debt to foreign commercial banks
when he meets negotiators from the London Club of creditor banks in
Frankfurt today.
He will present Warsaw's response to last week's revised package which
marked an improvement on the overall 28 per cent debt reduction package
offered by the banks in July. Mr Krowacki described the revised London Club
offer as 'a step in the right direction' but added: 'The situation remains
very difficult and the two sides remain far apart.'
Poland's response to the revised offer was 'part of an on-going process, it
is not a question of sign or reject,' he said. 'We still want the banks to
offer us a deal which is within our balance of payments possibilities,
bearing in mind current budgetary restraints and the repayment schedule to
official creditors laid out by the April 1991 agreement with the Paris
Club.' This sanctioned a two-stage, 50 per cent reduction of Poland's
Dollars 33bn official debt but imposed a repayment burden which will peak
towards the end of the century.
To date, the only movement on the Polish debt negotiations has come from the
300 commercial banks represented by the London Club, chaired by Mr Ernst
Moritz Lipp of Dresdner bank. The German banks hold 30 per cent of the
Polish bank debt, but US investment banks are big holders of debt bought on
the secondary market.
Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski yesterday said he had presented
his country's case for membership in Nato to US secretary of state Warren
Christopher, Reuter adds from Washington.
Mr Olechowski said he was given no immediate assurance from Mr Christopher
that the US would endorse the admission of Poland into the western military
alliance.
Poland was partitioned from 1795 until 1918 among Prussia, the
Austro-Hungarian Empire and Russia, and was dominated by Moscow between the
end of the second world war and the collapse of communist rule in the late
1980s.

Members of a US congressional delegation to Pakistan yesterday defended

fears of an 'Islamic bomb' had added to Washington's concerns over nuclear
proliferation, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. 'I think there's going to
be a major effort in the armed services committee and the foreign relations
committee to deal with this problem of non-proliferation,' said Senator
Larry Pressler of South Dakota, who sponsored an amendment leading to the
suspension of aid to Pakistan because of fears Islamabad had acquired the
capability to produce nuclear weapons.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Germany calls for tougher N-proliferation curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany yesterday unveiled a 10-point plan to strengthen the policing and
control of the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, called for tougher international
export controls and closer co-operation between potential suppliers of
technology for weapons of mass destruction.
He proposed an international conference to agree verification measures to
prevent the spread of biological weapons. j He also urged creation of an
international plutonium control system, and a register of nuclear weapons to
be held by the United Nations.
The initiative on non-proliferation comes at a time when concern over the
possible spread of nuclear weapons has been heightened both by the refusal
of North Korea to allow international inspections of its suspected nuclear
capacity, and by the success of right- and left-wing extremists in the
latest Russian elections.
Mr Kinkel warned that developments in Ukraine raised the fear that a new de
facto nuclear power might be created in Europe. His words came just a day
after opposition politicians in neighbouring Belarus suggested that they too
should refuse to return nuclear weapons to neighbouring Russia, in the light
of the election results.
At the same time, Germany's initiative amounts to a firm restatement of the
government's belief that non-proliferation should be under political
control, rather than becoming a military response to a perceived threat. In
particular, Mr Kinkel has not responded to US pressure for European support
for more 'counter-proliferation' measures.
The 10-point plan says the UN has agreed in principle that nuclear
proliferation is a threat to international peace and security. But it states
that any use of military measures to prevent the spread of nuclear arms
should be seen as a last resort, and should be specifically legitimised by
the UN Security Council.
The Kinkel plan, which will now be promoted by Germany with its partner
states in Nato, the European Union, Western European Union, CSCE and the UN,
calls for the unlimited and unconditional extension of the Nuclear
Non-proliferation treaty beyond 1995.
It suggests that the CSCE should be reinforced as an instrument to control
regional proliferation, and that the CSCE model should be imitated in other
regions.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Metallgesellschaft board to grill chief on liquidity gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive at the troubled Metallgesellschaft
metals, mining and industrial group, faces increasing pressure from the
Frankfurt-based group's supervisory board at a meeting specially convened
for tomorrow.
It is understood that the meeting will examine preliminary results of
intensive investigations by Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, leading
shareholders in the company as well as creditors, into Metallgesellschaft's
liquidity. The meeting is also likely to consider management responsibility
for what appear to be increasing difficulties.
The investigations were launched at the beginning of last week after
Deutsche and Dresdner granted Metallgesellschaft special credit facilities
to meet what were then described as temporary liquidity shortages arising
from the activities of MG Corp, the group's US trading subsidiary, in US
commodities futures markets. The extent of the liquidity support has not
been disclosed, but Frankfurt sources suggest that it may have been as high
as DM2bn (Dollars 1.2bn).
News of the special credit facilities prompted a fall in the share price
throughout last week in spite of a public declaration of support for
Metallgesellschaft from Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chief executive.
The shares, up DM4.9 to DM305.20 yesterday, have fallen by 28 per cent since
the beginning of last week and the group is now capitalised at DM2.7bn.
Mr Kopper said on Tuesday last week that Metallgesellschaft's liquidity
shortages arose for technical reasons and were not 'life-threatening'.
However, it is understood that since that statement, the banks have
reassessed the seriousness of the group's difficulties in the light of new
information. The banks are believed to be prepared to carry on supporting
Metallgesellschaft.
Mr Schimmelbusch, 49, an Austrian who has been head of the company since
1988, was voted German manager of the year in 1991, when his aggressive,
acquisitive management style marked him apart from older, more staid German
chief executives.
Since then, though, the group has suffered badly from an influx of cheap
metals from the eastern bloc and the severity of the German recession. In
the year to the end of September the group lost DM347m (Dollars 205m) on
turnover stagnant at DM25.5bn.
The immediate cause of the group's present plight was said last week to be
margin calls - cash pay-outs - on oils future contracts taken out by MG Corp
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, triggered by the sharp fall in oil
prices in recent month. Metallgesellschaft has insisted that it was not
engaged in speculative futures trading and that the futures contracts were
taken out to hedge contracts to supply physical stocks of oil.
However, analysts say that many questions remain unanswered and point to the
enormous risks associated with such trading activities, not least that
customers will renege on contracts to buy oil at high prices, leaving the
group facing a massive potential liability.

FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Fledgling group aims to lift MAS
 -Financial problems have dogged the airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the early 1990s Malaysia Airlines (MAS) surprised the aviation world by
announcing a multi-billion dollar aircraft purchase programme, at a time
when the storm clouds of an industry recession were already gathering. As
part of of its present five-year development plan, MAS has orders for 72
aircraft costing a total of MDollars 10.6bn (USDollars 4.16bn).
Yesterday it was announced that another substantial tranche of shares
previously held by the government would be transferred to the private
sector. MAS clearly hopes the deal will pave the way to making the airline a
leading international and regional carrier.
'We want to turn MAS into one of the super excellent airlines in the world
in terms of schedules and services,' says Mr Kamaruddin Ahmad, MAS's
managing director.
But it is far from clear whether MAS's new controllers will be able to
realise those ambitions and transform the flagging financial fortunes of one
of south-east Asia's biggest carriers.
With less government control, MAS could become a leaner, more
market-oriented organisation. But there are worries about the viability of a
deal which will see MAS pass into the hands of a group of investors with
little experience of international airlines.
There are also concerns about the financial health of what is one of the
world's fastest-growing carriers.
MAS began as Malaysian Airlines before the second world war. In the 1960s,
it was known as Malaysia-Singapore Airlines. In the early 1970s, the
organisation was split into MAS and Singapore Airlines (SIA).
While SIA has become one of the world's most financially successful
carriers, MAS has struggled to achieve profits, even though it carries more
passengers than its neighbour and competitor.
In 1992-93, MAS had pre-tax profits of MDollars 157m, less than half the
MDollars 372m forecast when the airline raised USDollars 700m at the end of
1992 in what was Malaysia's biggest rights issue. Moreover, the profit
included MDollars 337m from aircraft sales. If this had been stripped out,
MAS would have recorded a loss of MDollars 180m.
A 20 per cent increase in domestic fares together with a restructuring have
so far failed to produce results. Pre-tax profits for the six months to
September 1993 were MDollars 6.4m, a 96 per cent drop on the year-earlier
period.
While MAS points out that it is performing well compared with many other
airlines, analysts say the carrier should be doing better, given that it is
based in a region which is the world's fastest expanding passenger market.
The International Air Transport Association says passenger traffic in
south-east Asia is growing by more than 9 per cent a year, compared with
less than 4 per cent in Europe and 5 per cent in North America.
MAS's overall load factor, an important performance indicator, has dropped
from 66 per cent in 1991-92 to 63 per cent in 1992-93. Too much capacity has
been added on some routes while there is not enough on others.
'Bad planning and government interference have been the main problems at
MAS,' says one analyst. 'The expansion plan was overly ambitious and timed
over too short a period, causing considerable funding problems.
'Then the government has pushed MAS into opening routes to places like
Mexico City and Johannesburg - more for political than commercial reasons.
It also only recently allowed it to increase fares on loss-making domestic
routes. A wholesale sort-out is urgently needed, including big cuts in staff
numbers.'
Malaysia Helicopter Services (MHS), the company that is acquiring the MAS
shares, is a relatively small group involved in support services for the oil
and gas industries. It has a stake in Pelangi Air, a small Malaysian
carrier, and has been offered a share in a proposed second Malaysian
carrier. MHS also recently announced that it was taking a 25 per cent stake
in World Airways, the US passenger and cargo carrier, for Dollars 27.4m.
But the company has little experience of the international airline business
and there are doubts about its capacity to handle an airline of the size and
complexity of MAS.
There is also the question of just how independent of the government MAS's
new controllers will be. MHS is known to have close connections to senior
figures in government. One of the company's backers is said to be Mr Daim
Zainuddin, a former finance minister who is one of Malaysia's richest men
and treasurer of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the
country's dominant political party.
Industry observers fear the government is being too hasty in taking
advantage of the high MAS share price to sell its stake. 'The government
will be ridding itself of what has become a financially troubled company',
said one airline analyst. 'But the question is how much benefit will MAS get
out of the exercise? I still think there are going to be troubled times
ahead.'

carrier

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Malaysian government is selling a 32 per cent stake in Malaysia Airlines
(MAS), the national carrier, in a deal worth MDollars 1.79bn (USDollars
700m).
The shares, part of a 42 per cent MAS stake held by Bank Negara, the
Malaysian central bank, are being acquired by Malaysian Helicopter Services
(MHS), a company dealing in support services for the oil and gas industry.
It is understood that the sale is being arranged through a share swap, based
on two MAS shares for one MHS share. The share prices of both MAS and MHS
have risen recently on rumours of a deal. MAS shares last traded on Friday
at MDollars 7.35, while MHS stock traded at MDollars 15.70.
'The sale represents another step by the government to privatise further the
national airline,' the finance ministry said. 'With this sale, the majority
of Malaysia Airlines shares will be in the hands of the private sector,
including non-residents.'
Analysts say the government has taken advantage of a buoyant Kuala Lumpur
stock market to rid itself of shares in what has become a financially
troubled company.
MHS will become the biggest shareholder in MAS, which was partially
privatised in 1985. MHS is controlled by Mr Tajuddin Ramli, who is one of
Malaysia's leading business personalities. Mr Ramli's main company is
Technology Resources Industries, which is mainly involved in the
telecommunications sector.

Pharmaceutical stocks were strong ahead of an announcement, after the London
market had closed, that SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome had products
recommended for approval in the US.
SmithKline announced that the US Food and Drug Administration had given
initial approval to Kytril, the company's anti-nausea treatment for cancer
patients.
Kytril competes with the Glaxo product Zofran and is expected to achieve
sales above Pounds 80m this year. Approval will be a relief to the company,
which had problems with its application earlier this year. US sales could
add a further Pounds 30m to Pounds 80m depending on the precise guidelines
for use.
Wellcome received initial approval for a lung cancer drug. SmithKline rose 4
to 381p, Glaxo gained 6 1/2 at 695p and Wellcome added a penny at 635p ahead
of its annual meeting today.
Standard Chartered, one of the bank sector's and market's best performers in
recent weeks, endured a turbulent session as the market reacted violently to
suggestions of bad news on profit margins in its Far Eastern business.
The news, sourced from a routine press conference given by Standard's
general manager in Hong Kong, quickly filtered into the London market, where
Standard shares plunged from an opening 1194p to a low point of 1038p.
However, some soothing comments from Standard officials in London, who
sought to emphasise that the Hong Kong manager's statement had been
misconstrued and was not specifically about Standard Chartered, saw the
share price recover strongly to close a net 16 off at 1179p, and 'bid only',
according to marketmakers.
Suggestions that Land Securities may be lining up a big property acquisition
failed to help the share price, which fell victim to profit-taking following
the stock's recent impressive run. The deal, said to be worth Pounds 125m,
is believed to involve some 120 properties from a wide variety of high
yielding sites owned by Royal Insurance. Land shares - which began the year
at just 444p - fell 8 to 784p, but turnover was relatively moderate.
Two other property groups were undermined by talk of directors' share sales,
with British Land slipping 3 to 428p and Frogmore Estates down 12 at 499p.
Meanhwile, London Industrial, which specialises in light industrial
properties, made its market debut at 320p. The shares were well received and
closed 16 ahead at 336p.
The two English power generators delivered exceptionally strong
performances, responding to a statement from Offer, the electricity industry
regulator, that it may not recommend a referral of the companies to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Offer said it wanted an agreement with the generators on more competition in
the industry by the sale of some existing generation plants, and assurances
on prices for a reasonable period until a more competitive market is
achieved.
Dealers said the market was looking for an agreement between the companies
and the regulator and that such an agreement would trigger another
substantial uprating for the shares. National Power reached a peak 453p
before ending 13 ahead at 449 1/2 p after turnover of 11m. PowerGen raced
forward to an all-time high of 511p before closing 9 up at 509p on 5.1m
dealt.
A big US seller took Reuters Holdings to a day's low of 1731p as the price
reacted to a sharp fall on Tuesday night in New York. When the stock had
been offloaded, the shares rallied to end 16 down at 1736p.
International conglomerate Hanson advanced 5 to 268 1/2 p as the group said
its US coal subsidiaries hit by the recent national coal strike would start
production again within the next few days.
Shares in RMC, the construction industry group, jumped 26 to 930p as
marketmakers were gripped by a stock shortage.
Forte appreciated 10 to 258p as hopes rose that its Ital-ian venture with
Ciga will fight off challenges from other hoteliers.
Maligned supermarket stocks continued their quiet march back to respectable
levels, having been heavily sold during the spate of recent pre-Christmas
price war stories. Yesterday, one leading food retail analyst said: 'Some
investors are realising that the price competition is not as aggressive as
they were led to believe.' All the leading stocks made good gains, with J.
Sainsbury up 9 at 440p, Tesco 9 at 213 1/2 p, Kwik Save 18 at 570p and
Argyll 6 1/2 at 268p.
Food manufacturers were also strong, but Tate &amp; Lyle, amid market concern
over the glut of corn in the US market, slipped 3 to 396p.
A profits warning from Pentos sent the shares plummeting 8 1/2 to 26p.
Newspaper publisher Daily Mail &amp; General Trust gained smartly after
reporting a 74 per cent profits rise and a nine-for-one bonus issue to
improve marketability of its shares. The 'A' stock rose 612p to Pounds
115.12.
Publisher Dorling Kindersley slid 89 to 221p after issuing a profits warning
and announcing the resignation of its managing director.

FT  16 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Seminar lifts BP shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers adopted a strongly bullish view of BP shares after the UK oil group
gave what a number of oil sector specialists described as an impressive,
competent and confident presentation to analysts and institutional fund
managers in London yesterday. The company is scheduled to deliver a similar
message to US analysts this morning in New York.
The London market registered its pleasure by marking BP shares higher,
closing a net 6 1/2 firmer at 333p after keen turnover of 11m.
Talking after the presentation, specialists said there was every chance that
BP would resume the strong upward path that saw the shares rally from the
180p mark in August 1992 to the 360p reached in November this year.
The stock has fallen back sharply from those highs amid stories that US
holders have turned sellers of the shares. BP reached a peak 377p in July
1987 and approached that level again in August 1990.
Mr David Simon, BP's chief executive, told the assembled group that BP is on
track to meet its profits target of Dollars 2bn by 1995 and had increased
this to Dollars 3bn for the following year, emphasising that these targets
hinged on an oil price of between Dollars 16 to Dollars 18 a barrel.
However, the market's arch-bear of BP, Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull,
remained unimpressed. 'It was a slick performance,' he said, 'delivered with
more style than substance; we are still sceptical and still sellers of BP.'

FT  16 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With only one full trading day before expiry of futures and options
contracts linked to the FT-SE 100 Index, dealers were furiously rolling out
positions yesterday, writes Peter John.
The situation was intensified by some economic data which pushed the Footsie
futures contract for December higher at the outset.
December opened at 3,259 and powered up to 3,293 as dealers with short
positions tried to roll out their holdings to the contract which expires in
March.
Those adjustments ensured that the contract traded at a premium of around 7
points above cash, compared with an estimated fair value of zero. It also
pushed the March contract to a premium of between 22 and 25 above December,
when most houses estimate that it should be at a premium of around 14.
Open interest, the number of existing short and long contracts, remained
high, although derivatives dealers calculated that there would only be some
25,000 contracts left open by the start of dealing today. Of these, it is
expected that between 12,000 and 14,000 will be allowed to expire while the
rest will be rolled forward.
By the official close, the December contract was at 3,285, a premium of 8 to
cash, with 17,292 lots dealt. Some 10,000 of those represented rolling
forward to March, which was pushed up to 3,308.
In after-hours' dealing, December moved forward to retest the day's high,
suggesting that there will be more upward pressure on the markets today.
Total traded options volume was uninspiring at 31,079 lots, with Lucas
Industries the most active stock option (2,532 lots) as bid speculation
returned.

FT  16 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Inflation news drives FT-SE Index to
new peak - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International considerations were put aside on the London stock market
yesterday, and the FT-SE 100 Index closed at a new peak on hopes that,
following good news on domestic inflation, UK interest rates can be reduced
sooner than expected. Pre-expiry activity in stock index futures continued
to inspire Footsie-listed stocks, and dollar firmness supported the
multinationals.
The UK stock market gathered pace towards the close, ending the session with
a gain of 30.4 on the FT-SE 100 for a final reading of 3,278.8. The FT-SE
Mid 250 Index, also at an all-time high, finished at 3,631.5, up 17.2.
The market opened cautiously as Wall Street's overnight weakness was
mirrored by further losses on European bourses, with the political
developments in Russia taking the blame. However, good premiums on both
December and March futures contracts soon inspired careful buying of
equities in London.
But the announcement that underlying inflation in the UK had dipped from 2.8
per cent to 2.5 per cent, better than predicted by the market, put muscle
into the rise in equity prices. The welcome confirmation that domestic
inflation remained subdued raised hopes that UK interest rates may yet be
cut before the end of the year.
The good news on domestic inflation took the London market's attention away
from today's policy meeting at the Bundesbank. At the same time, general
economic optimism was boosted by a further rise in retail sales last month.
Gains were extended across the range of the market, with the surprising
exception of store shares, which remained overshadowed by suggestions that
Christmas trading may disappoint the best expectations.
A further advance was signalled when the March futures contract on the
Footsie moved above 3,300, indicating market confidence that domestic
interest rates will be lower by the end of the first quarter of 1994.
Several analysts have predicted that rates will fall to 4 per cent.
A strong performance from the dollar stocks was highlighted by BP following
a confident meeting with analysts in London yesterday. Pharmaceuticals were
also in demand, and there was renewed buying of the bank shares which have
heavily outperformed the stock market over the past month.
Among the day's newcomers, Mercury World Mining Investment Trust, the
biggest trust launch on record, ended at a discount of a few pence to the
100p issue price after turnover of 12m shares.
Seaq volume increased to 752.7m shares yesterday from Tuesday's 705.5m, but
traders stressed that futures-related trading had played an important part;
genuine investment business was good, but not outstanding, according to
dealers at a leading international brokerage house. Non-Footsie activity
dipped to around 60 per cent of the total, indicating the significance of
futures-related business as the big securities traders sought to unwind
positions in futures.
On Tuesday, retail business returned a value total of Pounds 1.47bn, again
an excellent figure by comparison with this year's daily averages and also
for a pre-Christmas trading period.
Equities ended the day on a very confident note, although traders were
prepared for further turbulence today from the futures markets as December
positions are rolled forward into March.

FT  16 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Kodak profits warning takes
Dow lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
In a session dominated by a big sell-off in Eastman Kodak shares, US equity
markets were broadly lower yesterday, as stocks failed to benefit from
further evidence of economic expansion, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 25.71 at 3,716.92,
while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.22 easier at 461.84. In the secondary
markets, the American SE composite lost 1.89 at 459.94 but the Nasdaq
composite rose 1.50 to 752.97. New York SE volume was heavy, with 332m
shares traded.
The Dow dropped at the opening, largely because of a plunge in Kodak's share
price. After the photographic products company said its 1994 earnings would
be 'quite modest', the shares weakened Dollars 7 1/4 , or about 11 per cent,
to Dollars 55 1/2 in turnover of 11.7m shares. The announcement led at least
two Wall Street analysts to downgrade the stock.
The market attempted a rally near midday, with fresh evidence of growth in
the manufacturing sector gener-ating interest in other Dow components.
Caterpillar gained Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 85 5/8 and 3M Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 111 3/4 after the Federal Reserve issued its strongest report of the
year on industrial production. It showed a 0.9 per cent increase in
November, after a revised 0.8 per cent rise the previous month. Capacity
utilisation also exceeded forecasts, climbing 0.6 percentage point to 83 per
cent, the highest level since August 1989.
But the blue chips retreated again as the US Treasury market, which had
virtually ignored the stronger than expected economic data, seesawed in a
volatile session influenced by a sharp turnround in gold bullion prices. In
late trading, the inflation-sensitive 30-year government issue was unchanged
at 99 15/16 .
By the close, Procter &amp; Gamble was down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 55 3/4 and
Mobil Dollars 2 at Dollars 74 1/2 . Alcoa lost Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 70
5/8 , with market commentators concerned that recent advances in its share
price had been unwarranted.
Although reaction to the completion of world trade talks was muted,
defence-related and aerospace issues were mostly stronger on the Gatt treaty
announcement. General Electric rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 103 3/8 and Boeing
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 42 3/4 . McDonnell Douglas slipped Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 109 1/2 on news of an unfavourable settlement over compensation
claims related to the C-17 military aircraft programme.
In the agricultural sector, which is expected to benefit from the Gatt deal,
Archer Daniels Midland added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 23 5/8 . A newly
announced Clinton smog-control plan would increase the use of corn-derived
ethanol, a market dominated by ADM.
Fruit of the Loom declined Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 27 7/8 after Prudential
Securities lowered its earnings estimate for the company. In other textile
issues, VF Corp retreated Dollars 1 to Dollars 45.
Canada
Toronto continued Tuesday's sharp retreat yesterday in heavy trading. The
TSE 300 index fell 18.8 to 4,225.6 for a two-day drop of 67 points. Losses
led rises by 482 to 339 after volume of 83.3m shares.
Nine of the 14 sub-indices ended lower, with mining, off 1.97 per cent, and
energy, down 1.25 per cent, leading the way.

FT  16 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Pakistan surges despite textiles crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan's share prices, traditionally tied to the fortunes of the country's
textile sector, have been surging ahead in spite of a crisis in this year's
cotton crop.
The KSE-100 index climbed 30.45 to a third consecutive record high of
1,955.91 yesterday, for a 4.4 per cent rise so far this week, on top of the
9 per cent advance last week.
Almost a third of the 657 companies listed on the KSE are engaged in
textiles and the loss of at least 15 per cent of this year's cotton crop is
bound to hit the troubled sector further as higher raw material costs feed
through.
The government has already stopped the export of raw cotton in the face of
expected shortages at textile manufacturing factories. The cost of cotton
bought by industry has risen by more than 25 per cent during the past month.
However, much of the KSE's buoyancy is still being attributed to Pakistan's
newly found political stability after several months of haggling between
rival leaders in their bids for power. Some analysts say the bullish trend
is also due to expectations of higher profits in the financial sector,
multinational corporations and industries involved in the manufacture of
chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
According to Mr Nasir Bukhari, a leading Karachi stockbroker: 'Pakistan's
two-year-old programme of deregulation of the private sector is now expected
to pay off with higher profits for industries involved in these areas.'
Some investors believe that the KSE-100 index will top 2,000 before the end
of the year, and that the expected launch on Wall Street of a Morgan Stanley
Dollars 60m 'Pakistan investment fund' will add to the bullish tone.

FT  16 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Six new highs registered
around the Pacific Basin
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing political turmoil on the final day of the special parliamentary
session kept many investors away from the market, but the Nikkei average
closed higher on index-linked buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index rose 180.42 to 17,489.15. The Topix index of all first
section stocks edged up 1.34 to 1,452.35.
Share prices fluctuated on index-linked trading by arbitrageurs. Weakness on
the Chicago futures market overnight dragged the Nikkei down to a low of
17,169.52 during the first 15 minutes of trading. Index-linked buying in the
afternoon pushed the index to a high of 17,536.15 just before the close.
Volume totalled 210m shares, against 221m. Declines led rises by 522 to 464,
with 175 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 11.52 at
1,207.18.
Investors were cautious as negotiations between the coalition government and
the opposition parties over the extension of the parliamentary session
dragged on.
Although the Liberal Democratic Party, the leading opposition party, is
expected to compromise eventually, its threat to boycott talks if the
parliamentary session were extended heightened public anxiety.
Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said that in spite of the political
uncertainty, investors were banking on Mr Hosokawa's pledge last week to
implement measures to help the economy, and his show of concern over a weak
stock market.
High-technology issues were strong, led by Sony, which rose Y120 to Y5,430.
Hitachi moved ahead Y20 to Y835 and Toshiba Y18 to Y702.
Sumitomo Metal Mining, which climbed Y47 to Y847, saw continued popularity
on a rally in the gold market.
However, banks lost ground on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan fell
Y40 to Y2,850 and Fuji Bank Y20 to Y1,890. Brokers were also weak, with
Daiwa Securities down Y40 to Y1,220.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 23.93 to 19,225.17 in volume of 36.8m shares.
High-technology issues were higher, with Nintendo, the video game maker, up
Y50 at Y7,150.
Roundup
The region scored another six new highs. A potential seventh, Bombay, was
officially open but brokers refused to trade for the second consecutive day
to protest against a ban on carry forward deals.
BANGKOK, where there were worries about overheating in financials, still
managed a 2.4 per cent advance, the SET index finishing 36.07 higher at a
new peak of 1,519.06.
Turnover amounted to Bt32.03bn, second only to the record Bt36.27bn set on
November 3 this year.
TAIWAN's financial sector soared and offset heavy profit-taking elsewhere,
the weighted index hitting a 22-month high of 5,161.80, up 58.84.
Turnover swelled to TDollars 129.65bn, the heaviest since June 1990. The Big
Three commercial banks all closed limit up, while Cathay Life Insurance
surged TDollars 8 to TDollars 194.
SINGAPORE saw strong domestic retail buying due to low interest rates, which
pushed the Straits Times Industrial index ahead by 18.93 to a new peak of
2,271.24 in volume of 555.7m shares.
KUALA LUMPUR set its high on buying of index-linked stocks, the KLSE
composite index adding 23.43 at 1,116.09.
Analysts said that expectations of a successful conclusion to world trade
talks also boosted sentiment.
JAKARTA, a recent critical choice for 1994, peaked again with the official
index 7.76 stronger at 543.84 on both foreign and domestic buying.
HM Sampoerna extended a strong performance, rising Rp700 to Rp12,000 on an
upward earnings revision.
SEOUL fell just short of its year's high as the composite index climbed 8.66
points to 865.86 on follow-through buying in blue chip manufacturing stocks
and shares with low price/earnings ratios.
HONG KONG reflected profit-taking by institutions, the Hang Seng index
shedding 76.22 to end a volatile day at 9,945.26.
AUSTRALIA fell on Wall Street's weakness overnight and on declining metal
prices, the All Ordinaries index closing 16.7 lower at 2,069.9.

FT  16 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Schering slides on news of
Hoechst group drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses recovered from their early afternoon lows, but this was ascribed to
domestic and technical factors, rather than the international influences
advanced earlier this week, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT fell further over the official session with the DAX index 39.27
lower at 2,110.70, compared with 2,128.07 at the end of the post bourse on
Tuesday. However, the Ibis-indicated DAX recovered in the afternoon to close
at 2,126.82.
Mr Glen Liddy at Kleinwort Benson said that traders were squaring their
positions in the afternoon, after the drop from an intraday peak of 2,187.28
on Monday, and that volume was thin by then. Over the next two days, market
professionals will be seeing details of the Gatt deal, Bundesbank decisions
on money supply and interest rates today, and triple witching in the futures
and options market tomorrow.
Yesterday's worst drop among the blue chips looked ahead to Monday. Schering
fell another DM63, or 5.9 per cent to DM1,010 after the Hoechst subsidiary,
Behringwerke, called a Monday press conference on its multiple sclerosis
drug, Deoxyspergualin (DSG). Less than two months ago Schering hit a high of
DM1,170 on prospects for its own ms drug, Betaseron.
Stock market turnover rose from DM9.2bn to DM9.9bn. The drip, drip of bad
news from Daimler-Benz continued with a nine-month group loss of DM2.05bn
according to US accounting methods. The shares slid DM17, or 2.3 per cent to
DM737.50, Mr Liddy observing that the decision to produce the new 'baby'
Mercedes model in Germany, rather than abroad, sat strangely with the
group's cost-cutting ambitions.
PARIS showed a gentle recovery at the end of a volatile, and busy day, the
CAC-40 index closing 6.13 higher at 2,162.63 after a high of 2,180.19 and a
lower of 2,137.43. Turnover climbed from FFr4.82bn to an estimated FFr6bn.
Canal Plus slid FFr151 to FFr1,109, having been suspended limit-down at one
point in the day. James Capel put a sell note out on the pay TV group
yesterday after a late Tuesday warning from the company that 1994 earnings
could be down by as much as 20 per cent.
Canal Plus corporate shareholders include Havas, down FFr19.60 at DM436.20,
and Generale des Eaux, FFr21 lower at FFr2,707.
There were signs that the late 1993 gamble on cyclicals was being shelved
for the time being and that defensive stocks were coming back into the
reckoning, L'Oreal rising FFr30 to FFr1,230 and LVMH by FFr43 to FFr3,758.
However, Rhone Poulenc and Institut Merieux were hit by delays in their
mutual merger plans, falling FFr4.80 to FFr143.70, and FFr205 to FFr2,097.
MILAN surged in the last 45 minutes, prompting suggestions of window
dressing on the last day of the December account. The Comit index added 3.23
or 0.6 per cent to 595.00, but the late rise was more clearly reflected in a
227 or 2.2 per cent advance to 10,551 in the real-time Mibtel index.
Mediobanca, the merchant bank, found strong demand, adding L540 to L14,793.
Interest was also high among the telecommunications issues with Stet L88
ahead at L4,169 and Sip L54 firmer at L3,458.
Among industrials, Olivetti rose L18 to L1,971 as the post and
telecommunications minister, Mr Maurizio Pagani, said that the winner of
Italy's second mobile telephone franchise will be chosen by the end of April
next year.
For the January account, 52 new companies join the automatic trading system,
including Pirelli, Calcestruzzi and Alitalia, bringing the total traded on
screen to 152.
ZURICH continued its consolidation, although low volume tended to exaggerate
movements. The SMI index, 1.2 per cent lower at one stage, picked up as
investors were attracted back by the lower prices to finish 17.2 or 0.6 per
cent easier at 2,850.6.
Nestle, the most active issue, shed SFr15 to SFr1,237. SMH, the watchmaker
fell SFr14 or 6.2 per cent to SFr209, and bearers in Swiss Re and Winterthur
by SFr28 to SFr740, and SFr23 to SFr855.
Moving in the opposite direction, BBC added SFr15 to SFr1,028 and Holderbank
put on SFr10 to SFr885.
MADRID recovered from intraday lows on late futures-related buying, the
general index easing 0.15 to 305.07. Banesto dropped Pta45 to Pta2,215,
after a low of Pta2,125, after Standard &amp; Poors lowered the banking group's
short term rating. Volume was boosted by basket trades to Pta26.6bn.
AMSTERDAM recouped ground lost earlier in the day to finish flat. The CBS
Tendency index ended unchanged at 139.3, but up from a low of 138.8.
OSLO fell 1.1 per cent with investors uncertain about the outlook, partly
because the current low prices for Norway's North Sea oil make further
interest rate cuts unlikely. The all-share index dropped 6.34 to 568.9 in
thin turnover of MKr372m.
Norsk Hydro lost NKr4 to NKr204 while Saga Petroleum A shares dipped NKr0.5
to NKr69.5.
ISTANBUL rose another 2.4 per cent as demand for privatisation shares
continued to lift the market. The composite index added 439.7 to 18,583.2
for a cumulative two day rise of 7.1 per cent.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Dollar firms against yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar rose to a five-month high against the Japanese yen and is
expected to test Y110 today, writes Conner Middelmann.
The dollar strengthened to Y109.86 before closing at Y109.65, up from
Y109.35 on Tuesday. It finished New York trading at Y109.76. It received a
lift from Tuesday's November trade figures, showing Japan's trade surplus
against the US narrowing for the first time in nearly three years, and a
stream of strong US economic data at a time when the Japanese economy
remains troubled.
Moreover, expectations of a reduction soon in Japan's 1.75 per cent official
discount rate to stimulate the economy are keeping the yen under pressure.
'With the fiscal package delayed, the onus is once again on monetary policy
to help the economy, and the Bank of Japan is coming under increased
pressure to ease,' said Mr Stephen King, deputy chief economist at James
Capel. He expects the dollar to trade around Y121 by the end of 1994 and
predicts Y130 for the second half of 1995. 'Interest rates will stay low,
and when the recovery does come, it will be weak by historical standards,'
he added.
The US currency also gained more ground against the D-Mark on residual hopes
that the Bundesbank's central bank council would cut official interest rates
at its meeting today. It ended at DM1.7160, up from DM1.7135 but off the
day's high of DM1.7205. It closed in New York at DM1.7172.
The resolution of the Gatt world trade talks had next to no impact on the
currency market, with an agreement already heavily discounted for days. 'The
market is relieved all the brinkmanship of the last weeks is over and it can
settle down to business as usual,' said Mr King.
In the UK money market, the short-term sterling interest rate contract slid
sharply on disappointment that the Bank of England did not lower interest
rates following the better than expected inflation numbers. This offered an
opportunity for many traders holding long positions in the contract to take
profits after its recent strong run.
The November retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments rose
by 2.5 per cent year-on-year, after a 2.8 per cent increase in October. The
headline inflation rate came in at 1.4 per cent last month, the same as in
October.
Immediately after the RPI release, the March short sterling contract jumped
to 95.00, but when the Bank of England's operations made it clear that there
would be no immediate rate cut, the contract quickly sold off to a low of
94.81. It ended at 94.85, down 0.09 point from Tuesday.
A senior money dealer commented: 'It was an overbought market, and too many
people were long of it.'
There are still lingering hopes that the UK central bank could announce a
rate reduction later this week, although the shake-out in the futures pit
indicated that those have waned significantly.
Market conditions remained tight, causing money rates at the short end to
firm again. The Bank of England announced a shortage of Pounds 2.65bn, which
was later revised down to Pounds 2.5bn. In early operations it purchased
bills totalling Pounds 1.65bn for resale to the market on January 5 and 6 at
5 13/32 per cent. In further operations, the Bank bought bills amounting to
Pounds 37m, followed by another Pounds 190m in the afternoon and late
assistance of around Pounds 645m.
As long as residual hopes for a near-term rate cut persist, the Bank will
keep a tight grip on market liquidity, said a trader. But if the Bundesbank
leaves rates unchanged today and hopes for a base rate cut wane further,
'the Bank will probably ease off and money market conditions could relax',
he predicted.
'I do not see another base rate cut this year - the signals the authorities
have given are very, very clear,' said Mr Philip Shaw, group economist at
Union Discount, one of the eight London discount houses.
Sterling eased to DM2.450 against the D-Mark from DM2.550 in thin turnover.
The French franc advanced further against the D-Mark, boosted by the Gatt
world trade agreement and hopes of more French easing. Contrary to perceived
economic wisdom, rate cuts tend to bolster the French currency on hopes that
they will stimulate the sluggish economy.
The franc finished at FFr3.418 per D-Mark, up from the previous day's
FFr3.422 close. It hit a high of FFr3.4128 during the day, boosted by a call
for lower interest rates by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. He told
parliament in a speech that lower rates were a necessary condition for
economic recovery in France.
The French currency's continued strength indicates that even if the
Bundesbank leaves rates unchanged today, there is a reasonable chance of
French easing before Christmas, said Capel's Mr King. 'With the franc at
this level, they must be rebuilding reserves very quickly and must be
seriously thinking about lowering rates,' he added.
The remaining currencies in Europe's exchange rate mechanism were little
altered against the D-Mark.
The Belgian franc was unchanged at BFr20.86 to the D-Mark. The Danish krone
ended at DKr3.923, down from DKr3.916 on Tuesday. The Italian lira finished
at L987.0 against the D-Mark, barely changed from L987.1 the previous day.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US agency under attack for
cut-price metal sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Complaints that the US Defence Department is dragging down already-depressed
metals prices by sales from its strategic stockpile are growing.
Sales of zinc by the Defence Logistics Agency, the Pentagon unit overseeing
these disposals, are being criticised by Australia, Canada and Spain as well
as the US's domestic zinc association.
Canada is also complaining about DLA nickel and lead sales and in the recent
past Bolivia has called unsuccessfully for tin disposals to be halted.
The stockpile was established in 1939 to accumulate strategic materials to
avoid shortages during time of national emergency. It has bought and sold
millions of tonnes of metal and other commodities since then.
The American Zinc Association claims that since March more than 36.3m lb of
stockpiled zinc has been sold by the DLA at 3 to 4 cents a lb below the
prevailing market price. 'Such a discount drags down the entire market.
Efficient private-sector producers lose normal price levels when competing
against the government's low-price, taxpayer-subsidised sales,' says Mr
George Vary, AZA's executive director.
He calculates US taxpayers lost well over Dollars 1m from the zinc sales
while one of the four remaining US zinc smelters - Zinc Corporation's.
Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 54,000-tonnes-a-year plant - was forced to shut for
at least a year and another, Big River Zinc's Sauget, Illinois, smelter has
laid off 7 per cent of its hourly workforce.
'The law specifically places responsibility on the government to avoid loss
to taxpayers and to avoid undue disruption to markets when the stockpile is
disposing of materials. What we have seen is exactly the reverse,' says Mr
Vary.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysia to join International
Cocoa Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR, SAN JOSE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia, one of the world's top five cocoa producers, will join the
International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO), according to Mr Lim Keng Yaik, the
country's primary industries minister, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur.
He said he had instructed the Malaysian mission in New York to begin the
signing and tabling of instruments to enable Malaysia to join the
International Cocoa Agreement by February, and subsequently become a member
of the ICCO.
Malaysia likes the new agreement, which started in October, because it no
longer tries to maintain a buffer stock, a ministry official quoted Mr Lim
as telling a luncheon meeting on Tuesday.
Members of the organisation decided in September to liquidate its 230,000
tonne stockpile over four and a half years.
The ICCO will also send a team to Indonesia, which is set to overtake
Malaysia this year to become the biggest producer in the Far East and the
fourth biggest in the world, to try to persuade it to join the organisation,
Mr Lim said.
Representatives of coffee producers from Indonesia, Brazil, Colombia,
Central America and Africa will meet in New York today and tomorrow to
evaluate the operation of the coffee-retention scheme with which they are
trying to boost world coffee prices, said Mr Arnoldo Lopez, president of the
Costa Rica Coffee Institute, reports Reuter from San Jose.
'It'll be a reunion of the administrative committee of the retention plan to
analyse compliance' with the scheme that went into effect in October, he
said.
'We should also receive information about how Asian countries are
incorporating retention mechanisms,' said Mr Lopez, who is also vice
president of Costa Rica.
Latin American coffee producers agreed at a meeting in October in Brazil to
retain 20 per cent of exports to boost low market prices. African countries
joined the scheme and Indonesia, the world's third-largest producer, is
expected to begin retaining coffee on April 1. 'We hope other Asian
countries such as Vietnam, India and Papua Nueva Guinea adopt the mechanism
to increase the effectiveness of the retention scheme,' said Mr Lopez.
He said that the leaders of the global coffee-producers' association
established in Brazil would discuss assuming control of the export retention
scheme at the New York meeting.
The initial results of the retention scheme were encouraging, Mr Lopez said.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Grain traders eye post-Gatt
Europe - US futures exchanges are jockeying to be the first to offer risk
management in freshly-competitive markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union cereal growers may view the gradual erosion of export
subsidies under the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with
foreboding, but the world's biggest futures markets are anticipating the
adjustments with considerable excitement and are already jockeying to be the
first to provide risk management services to freshly-competitive markets.
'There is going to be a fundamental shift in the way commodities are priced
and marketed, but it is going to take several years,' says Carol Brookins,
president of the Washington-based consulting firm World Perspectives. 'If
you're no longer protected from the world market, you will tend to need ways
to manage risks.'
World grain traders have hedged risks and established world prices in the
Chicago Board of Trade's wheat, maize, and soyabean futures pits for more
than a century, regardless of the origin or destinations of their produce.
At the end of November, the CBoT had traded more than 5m agricultural
futures contracts this year. Now the CBoT is girding its loins for
challenges and co-operation in Europe.
Two weeks ago exchange members voted to form a foreign consulting subsidiary
to lend technical expertise and other assistance to emerging futures
markets. In exchange for its services, the CBoT will seek equity interest in
the new markets, or low rates for trading access for its members.
Although the subsidiary is equipped to deal with financial futures, 'I think
the immediate demand will be in the agricultural area, as large parts of the
world move from government-controlled markets to open market mechanisms',
says Mr Fred Grede, the CBoT's executive vice president for strategy and
planning. While the new subsidiary has no contracts yet, there have been
many inquiries, Mr Grede says. The CBoT is also seeking co-operative
ventures with established exchanges.
Its first venture may well be with the Matif, France's fast-growing futures
exchange. Matif is best known for its government bond contracts, but in 1988
it merged with the French commodities exchange and it is now well-positioned
to become a dominant player in European agricultural derivatives.
While wheat futures in Paris may have to wait until the market opens further
with the implementation of Gatt, rapeseed prices are already at world
levels, making the need for a futures markets more urgent. Matif plans to
launch rapeseed futures next year, in co-operation with the french oilseeds
trade group, Onidol.
That contract could open the door for other European agricultural
derivatives. The success of Matif's rapeseed project depends on the
participation of German and Danish producers. Like most European farmers,
they are not familiar with futures. 'We have a very extensive education
campaign ahead of us,' says a Matif official.
Officials at both the Matif and the CBoT say the two exchanges are
discussing co-operation on the rapeseed contract, and do not rule out the
possibility of a mutual offset arrangement between Chicago and Paris. Such
co-operation could give the contract more liquidity, and a longer trading
day.
Germany may also make a bid for rapeseed futures. German laws prohibiting
futures trading are expected to be revised early next year. The regulatory
change could pave the way for futures trading in Hamburg, where Mr Peter
Grohmann, a futures consultant, is seeking financing for an exchange. Mr
Grohmann says that he plans to include pig futures, as well as energy and
financial contracts, in his product line.
Germany already has an electronically-traded financial futures exchange, the
DTB, but Mr Grohmann says starting an open-outcry exchange for commodities
will be difficult. 'Germany is in the childhood stages of futures trading.
Investors are very conservative, and producers don't know what futures are,'
he explains.
Although London is firmly the centre of European financial derivatives
trading, industry experts believe France, and the Matif, will evolve as
Europe's agricultural trading centre. 'France is the second largest
agricultural exporter in the world, and the Matif has the people, committed
members with expertise, who want to do it,' says Ann Berg, a veteran Chicago
grain trader and a newly-elected member of the Chicago Board of Trade.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: World nickel output registers
sharp decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nickel production fell sharply in the first ten months of this year, mainly
because output in Russia, the biggest producer, dropped by nearly one third
compared with the same months in 1992, according to the International Nickel
Study Group.
Consumption of the metal also slipped back but was still well ahead of
output.
The study group's statistics show nickel output fell by 85,000 tonnes or by
11.7 per cent to 639,000 tonnes in the ten months. Much of the drop was
accounted for by Russia, where production was down by 64,000 tonnes or 31.5
per cent at 139,000 tonnes.
Nickel consumption in the ten months fell by 1.68 per cent or 11,200 tonnes
to 652,400 tonnes. Again the Commonwealth of Independent States was mainly
responsible - consumption there was down by nearly one third or by 33,000
tonnes to 70,000 tonnes.
Meanwhile, the International Lead and Zinc Study Group estimated yesterday
that in the first ten months of this year mine output of both lead and zinc
outside the former eastern bloc countries was falling fast but production
and consumption of refined metal continued to hold up well.
Mine production of lead was down by 10.7 per cent or 205,000 tonnes to 1.7m
tonnes and mine output of zinc fell by 9.3 per cent or 439,000 tonnes to
4.29m tonnes. Canada was mainly responsible - in the ten months its mines
produced 48 per cent, or 139,000 tonnes, less lead and 24 per cent, or
267,000 tonnes, less zinc.
Production of refined lead slipped by 1.1 per cent to 3.68m tonnes while
consumption was down by 1 per cent to 3.67m tonnes. Output of refined zinc
eased up by 0.7 per cent to 4.55m tonnes and consumption showed a stronger,
2.3 per cent, rise to 4.58m tonnes. The study group said zinc consumption
was down by 1 per cent in Europe and by 7 per cent in Japan but this was
more than compensated for by a 7 per cent increase in the US and strongly
rising demand in Korea and Taiwan.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LCE aims to expand agricultural
futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Commodity Exchange says it is looking to expand its agricultural
futures contracts if Europe moves towards a free market.
'The launch of a European grain contract would require a change in
government attitudes. There's no need to hedge at the moment because
European Union prices provide a base level,' says Mr Robin Woodhead, chief
executive of the exchange.
The exchange at present trades domestic wheat and barley futures, where
volume rarely climbs above 500 lots a day. But a recent study of the
contracts showed that companies such as Dalgety found them useful in hedging
grain sales in the UK.
'We found the trade were very anxious that we didn't de-list those
contracts. They are very well established and cover their costs,' says Mr
Woodhead.
The LCE realises that while the contracts remain domestically-based they
will never trade high volumes, but in order to boost turnover, they would
have include international trade.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian mineral sales boost
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MELBOURNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mineral exports are expected to boost Australia's commodity sales by 4 per
cent to ADollars 49bn (USDollars 33bn) in 1993-94.
The official forecasting agency, the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and
Resource Economics, said this week that earnings from mineral resources
would rise by 7 per cent to ADollars 31.7bn. Most of the increase was
expected to come from higher exports of gold, coal, crude oil and natural
gas.
In contrast, rural export earnings were forecast to fall by nearly 2 per
cent to ADollars 17.3bn, largely because of falls in wool and grain prices.
The volume of mine production was forecast to rise by 2.6 per cent in
1993-94. Black coal production was expected to reach a record 185m tonnes,
up 7m tonnes. Iron ore output was put at a record 120m tonnes, up 3.5m
tonnes.
Abare also predicted a brighter medium-term commodity outlook. It said
commodity exports would rise by a further 13 per cent to ADollars 55.4bn in
1998-99 (at 1993-94 prices).

FT  16 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Inflation data boosts long-dated UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Good news on the inflation front provided the UK government bond market with
an excuse to climb still higher yesterday, with long-dated gilts gaining up
to half a point at one stage and leaving the market a quarter point higher
on the day.
However, the release of strong retail sales figures dampened hopes of an
imminent cut in the base rate, leaving the short end of the market unchanged
or slightly lower on the day.
The November inflation data was better than expected. It left the annual
rate unchanged at 1.4 per cent but depressed the underlying rate (excluding
mortgage interest) to 2.5 per cent year-on-year, down from 2.8 per cent in
October.
Gilts rallied on the news, but slipped back later on to close a quarter
point higher at the long end.
Retail sales figures for November were stronger than expected, and the
healthy consumer spending pattern led the market to tone down its hopes of a
near-term rate cut.
The main European government bond markets yesterday appeared to have
recovered from the shock of the Russian election results and generally ended
higher on the day.
After a tumultuous day on Tuesday, bunds recovered yesterday with dealers
stressing that the market had earlier over-reacted.
The main news was the announcement of a new 30-year Federal bond issue,
details of which will be revealed on December 28. The existing ultra-long
Federal issue underperformed the rest of the market on the news.
Market participants will be waiting to see the outcome of today's Bundesbank
council meeting and ensuing press conference at which the central bank will
announce its 1994 money supply growth target. Dealers said they expect the
target range to stay unchanged at 4.5 to 6.5 per cent.
Spanish government bonds edged up on foreign buying ahead of the release of
inflation figures yesterday, and the market ended firmer across the yield
curve.
Although the year-on-year inflation figure edged up to 4.7 per cent last
month from 4.6 per cent in October, dealers said the figure was in line with
expectations and that the market paid closer attention to underlying
inflation, which showed a rise of 5 per cent, against 5.3 per cent in
October.
Among the other high-yielding markets, Italian government bonds gained on
hopes of a cut in interest rates and expectations that the 1994 budget will
be approved shortly.
At yesterday's auction of a further L1,500bn of Italy's 30-year bond,
dealers said demand was 'pretty good', giving a cover ratio of about 1.6
times, while the net yield on the bond has fallen to 8.25 per cent from 8.62
per cent when the first tranche was sold.
The US Treasury market finished on a firmer note yesterday in a volatile
session which weathered further evidence of economic expansion and a sharp
turnround in gold prices.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was  1/32 higher at 99 1/2 , to
yield 6.282 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was 3/32 ahead at
100 3/32 , yielding 4.182 per cent.
The market took in its stride reports reinforcing the impression of strong
growth in the manufacturing sector. In its biggest jump of the year,
November industrial production jumped 0.9 per cent, compared with forecasts
of about 0.6 per cent and a revised October rise of 0.7 per cent. Capacity
utilisation rose 0.6 points to 83 per cent, the highest since August 1989.
The muted response suggested that the news had already been factored into
the inflation-sensitive long end. Declining Comex gold futures provided
further support. By midday, the long bond was posting moderate gains.
Later, gold prices reversed course and finished 40 cents up on the day,
pushing the 30-year issue in the opposite direction. However, the long bond
see-sawed back into positive territory near the end of the session, with the
price swing exaggerated by the thin level of trading.
Bonds with shorter maturities edged higher on the announcement that the
Treasury would not increase the size of next week's monthly auction of
two-year and five-year notes.

FT  16 DEC 93 / International Bonds: CCF offers two-year floating-rate notes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Commercial de France (CCF) provided some interest in a quiet Eurobond
market yesterday when it raised FFr3.5bn through an offering of two-year
floating-rate notes (FRNs).
An official at the bank said that the short maturity of the notes would
appeal to domestic money-market funds, short-term funds and corporate
treasurers.
He added that, as well as injecting fresh liquidity into the short end of
the market, the issue was also the first FRN offering to be linked to the
Paris inter-bank offered rate (Pibor), the short-term French interest rate,
since late 1990.
The notes, which carry a quarterly coupon equal to three-month Pibor, were
priced at 99.91 to give a yield of five basis points over Pibor. When they
were freed to trade the notes slipped to 99.85 bid, to yield seven basis
points over Pibor.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency, said yesterday
that it had lowered its rating on Banesto's short-term debt to A2 from A1
and removed it from Credit Watch where it was placed with negative
implications in June.
S&amp;P said that its action reflected the sharp increase in the Spanish bank's
non-performing loans (to 8.28 per cent of total loans as of September this
year from 4.87 per cent in September 1992) and the negative effect that this
deterioration in asset quality was having on the bank's income statement.

FT  16 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Bundesbank plans 30-year
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank will set the terms for a new 30-year government bond
offering, its first for eight years, on December 28. The central bank said
other 30-year issues would follow and a 30-year issue for the Treuhand, the
German privatisation agency, is planned for March.
The move signified a determination to make use of the long end of the German
yield curve on a regular basis. 'There will be more of these. The Bundesbank
is committed to use this segment of the market in a routine way,' it said.
Following the announcement, the Deutsche Terminborse, Germany's futures
exchange, said it will launch a new futures contract based on 15 to 30-year
Treuhand bonds and Bunds in late February or early March next year.
The DTB said the decision was based on the Bundesbank's commitment to create
a liquid market in long-dated Bunds. 'If there is a liquid underlying
market, then we should offer a product,' it said.
The Bundesbank described the two moves as 'a concerted action', designed to
strengthen the attractions of Finanzplatz Deutschland, Germany as a
financial centre.
It described the new issue as a response to demand from German and
international investors. However, dealers said that the existing 2016 bund
underperformed the market yesterday.
Its yield spread over the 10-year bund has widened from 42 basis points last
week to about 50 points. 'There is no sign of clients queueing up for a very
long-dated issue,' said one trader.
A European bond analyst said: 'We heard rumours that the 30-year issue would
be launched at a spread of 50bp over 10-year bunds but that would be very
tight. We think it is more likely to be 60 - 65bp over the 10-year as this
would be in line with spreads in France and Holland.'
The DTB contract, provisionally named the Buxl (Bund extra-long) future,
will have a notional 6 per cent coupon.
The DTB already lists Bund (long-term) and Bobl (medium-term) futures, and
will launch a Fibor (short-term German interest rate) contract on March 18,
allowing DTB members to trade the entire German yield curve.
An official at Liffe, the DTB's arch-rival for market share in German
interest rate products, said it was 'too early to consider' launching a
30-year Bund contract.

FT  16 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Foreign bank creditors of
Efim agree compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign bank creditors of Efim, the former Italian state holding company,
have this week been repaid a string of international loans - some 17 months
after the company was put into voluntary liquidation in July 1992.
However, the settlement of the dispute, which at one stage threatened
Italy's standing as an international borrower, still leaves unresolved the
position of loans taken out by former Efim subsidiaries which are not 100
per cent owned by the parent company.
The deal between Mr Alberto Predieri, Efim's special administrator, and
creditor banks covers six international loans in dollars, sterling and Ecu.
Creditor banks will receive all the principal due, along with 70 per cent of
the interest.
The banks' willingness to forgo the remaining interest partly reflected
satisfaction at finally being paid after a string of disappointments this
year, as reimbursement appeared imminent and was then postponed.
The compromise also indicates hopes on the part of the banks that the
Italian authorities will now look more favourably on calls for full
repayment of loans to Efim subsidiaries which were not wholly owned by the
parent company. Such borrowers include Agusta (helicopters), Alumix
(aluminium) and Breda (railway equipment).
The banks' willingness to compromise on interest was also influenced by
resolution of the bitter dispute over outstanding swap contracts taken out
by Efim, and then terminated by bank counterparties after the company was
deemed to be in default.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Former Soviet Moldova has set up its first stock exchange to trade shares in
enterprises being privatised, said Mr Oleg Crasnogon, deputy finance
minister, Reuter reports.
The exchange, with a founding capital of Dollars 60,000 has been formed by
commercial banks and investment trust companies.
'The market will shortly be full of shares in enterprises being privatised,'
Mr Crasnogon said.
Moldova plans to sell 30 per cent of state-owned property, or some 1,600
enterprises, by end-1994.
Economists say the percentage may be closer to 40 - 45 per cent given
sell-offs of state collective farms, which are being converted into joint
stock companies.

FT  16 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Mixed feelings on Italian
bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy and Spain are the most favoured European bond markets for the first
half of 1994, while Italy and the UK are the least favoured, according to a
survey of 70 traders, economists and fund managers by IDEA, the market
analysis company, writes Tracy Corrigan.
The findings of the survey reflect the strong divergence of views on the
Italian market.
The survey also showed a wide range of expectations on the performance of
the UK gilts market, with predictions for 10-year yields at the end of June
ranging from 5.25 per cent to 7.2 per cent with a median of 6.45; they are
currently at 6.3 per cent.

<TEXT>
MCI Communications, the second-largest US long-distance telephone company,
is to take a one-off charge of up to Dollars 150m in the fourth quarter to
cover the cost of its continuing realignment into three strategic groups,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
Under the reorganisation, announced in September, MCI is scrapping four
domestic divisions and one international unit, and creating three separate
groups - one for US operations, one for overseas business, and one for
emerging technologies such as interactive multimedia and wireless
communications.
The costs incurred have been related mostly to the streamlining of MCI's
engineering and network operations facilities, and the relocation of those
operations to lower-cost areas.
The latest charge will also help pay for commercial litigation contingencies
and other restructuring moves, including those linked to its forthcoming
acquisition of British Telecom North America.

FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: QVC raises objections to
Paramount auction rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
QVC Network, the television shopping company making a hostile Dollars 10bn
takeover bid for Paramount Communications, yesterday raised a string of
objections to the ground-rules announced by Paramount for an auction of the
company.
Paramount retorted that it believed its plan 'will provide the best value to
Paramount shareholders, will provide a level playing field for all bidders
and, ultimately, will permit the Paramount shareholders to make their own
choice if all the bidders co-operate'.
The exchange follows Paramount's announcement on Tuesday of the procedures
it will adopt to comply with an order by the Delaware Supreme Court that it
create a level playing field between bids for the company from QVC and cable
company Viacom.
Paramount, having reached a friendly Dollars 9.5bn takeover agreement with
Viacom, had previously refused to consider seriously QVC's higher offer.
Paramount announced on Tuesday that it would hold a single round of bidding,
with each bidder submitting its best and highest offer by next Monday,
December 20.
QVC complained that the procedures provided 'no assurance of fair
treatment'.
Mr Martin Lipton, QVC's legal adviser, said in a letter to Lazard Freres,
Paramount's financial adviser, that the past record of the Paramount board
'does nothing to inspire QVC's confidence that the board will be objective
in exercising the unbridled discretion it has reserved to itself -
particularly in that those who orchestrated the past violations are going to
continue to be intimately involved in the process'.
He complained that the procedures purported to reserve to the board the
power to extend the submission date for bids; to 'negotiate' the bid of one
bidder with the other; and to 'change the procedures at any time without
prior notice'.
He said if QVC were the higher bidder on December 20, the Paramount board
might 'negotiate' the QVC bid with Viacom, 'extend' the submission date and
elicit a higher Viacom bid. On the other hand, if Viacom were the higher
bidder, the board could close the bidding and block any subsequent, higher
QVC offer.
Mr Lipton proposed a series of changes to the procedures, and added that QVC
would have preferred a system of 'open and public bidding until the highest
offer is received'.
Paramount said it would review his ideas and make any adjustment to its
procedures necessary to make the process work effectively.

FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: IBM will not take up Groupe Bull
rights

<TEXT>
International Business Machines of the US will not subscribe to next year's
FFr8.5bn (Dollars 1.44bn) recapitalisation programme for Groupe Bull, the
loss-making, state-owned, French computer group, the two companies announced
yesterday.
The US computer group, which acquired 5.6 per cent of Bull's shares in early
1992, cited 'other financial priorities' for its decision. IBM itself is
struggling to cut costs to improve its weak financial performance. The US
company is expected to cut tens of thousands of jobs at its European
operations over the next 12 months.
IBM said, however, that it remained committed to its alliance with Groupe
Bull and that the two computer groups would continue to work on joint
projects. In particular, IBM said it would continue to collaborate and
possibly expand its work with Groupe Bull on Reduced Instruction Set
Computing (RISC) microprocessor technology.
Bull said other existing industrial agreements, such as the manufacture of
circuit boards by Bull for its US partner would also continue.
Bull's other principal shareholders, the French state, France Telecom, and
NEC, the Japanese electronics group, have agreed to provide their share of
the refinancing package. The French computer group, which is on the list of
21 publicly-owned companies slated for sale by the French government has
debts of about FFr10bn and has suffered losses of about FFr15bn over the
past three years.
Bull said yesterday that its board of directors had approved a plan to allow
the company's management and staff to participate in the capital of the
company. This was described as 'a first step towards privatisation'.
Despite IBM's decision, Bull will receive FFr8.5bn in new capital next year.
This represents about two-thirds of 1993-1994 commitments announced in
October by the French government and France Telecom, the state-owned
telecommunications group.

<TEXT>
Scandinavian Airline Systems (SAS) is considering the sale of all its
non-core operations as it reorganises following the collapse of the Alcazar
joint airline project and seeks to stem heavy losses.
'We will concentrate on our flight operations and sell our other
operations,' Mr Jan Reinas, chief executive, said in a newspaper interview
published yesterday.
'In principle, everything that is not directly connected to flight
operations is on our potential sale list. Some sales are in the final
phase.' He did not specify which.
The main non-core SAS operations include eight hotels, the Nordic operation
of Diners Club credit cards and part of SAS Service partner, a catering unit
previously wholly owned by the airline.
Mr Reinas said SAS would seek to strengthen its existing links with British
Midland Airways, Swissair and Austrian Airlines. The company is to raise its
holding in British Holdings, British Midland's parent, to 40 per cent from
35 per cent next July.
The chief executive said that 'time will tell' if SAS would at some stage
acquire all of British Midland but SAS officials said he did not mean to
imply any foreseeable intention to do so.
Mr Reinas said the SAS was studying whether its structure, grouping Swedish,
Danish and Norwegian-owned companies, could be reduced to a more efficient
single structure.

Poseidon Gold, part of the Australian-based Normandy Poseidon mining group,
has launched a ADollars 268m (USDollars 180m) bid for Aztec Mining, the gold
and base metals miner. The bid was immediately rejected by Aztec's chairman.
Poseidon Gold is offering 68 cents a share for Aztec, compared with the last
sales transaction on Tuesday of 58 cents. News of the bid sent the shares to
70 cents.
Mr Tom Johnston, the chairman of Aztec, last night said: 'I have spoken with
directors of Aztec's 37 per cent shareholder, Alumax (the US metals group)
and they agree that the bid is opportunistic, ill-timed and unwelcome.
'They will not accept this offer. It has been made at a low point in the
base metals price cycle.'

<TEXT>
ANZ, the Australian financial services group, has had its 1993 accounts
qualified for the second successive year because of doubts surrounding the
company's ADollars 250m (USDollars 163m) exposure to court action in India,
report Bruce Jacques in Sydney and agencies.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the group's accountant, said uncertainties remained on
the outcome of a claim totalling Rs5.06bn (USDollars 161.3m) against ANZ by
the National Housing Bank of India.
But the auditors added that they agreed with the basis upon which the
financial statements were presented.
The claim arises from a financial crisis in India which resulted in an
agreement for arbitration over the disputed monies.
Under the previously-announced agreement, ANZ Grindlays in India has paid
the Rs5.06m to the National Housing Bank of India, but can have the amount
returned with interest if it successfully defends the claim.
ANZ directors said in their annual report, out yesterday, the arbitration
was unlikely to be completed before the middle of 1994.
They also noted 'inadvertent breaches of India's Foreign Exchange Regulation
Act' by ANZ Grindlays. 'These matters were discovered by our staff and
reported to the relevant authorities for investigation,' ANZ directors said.
'After reviewing these issues in detail, directors do not consider it
necessary to make any provision for loss.'
ANZ made a ADollars 246.5m net profit in the year to September 30 against a
ADollars 579m loss in the previous year.

Italy's move to fully computerised share trading gathers pace today with the
transfer of 70 more stocks to the screen-based network, writes Haig Simonian
in Milan.
This follows a more important shift earlier this year, when some of the most
heavily-traded stocks transferred to screen-based trading.
The latest transfer brings to 152 the number of shares traded on-screen. It
marks the fifth switch of shares to the screen-based system since
computer-based trading made its debut in November 1991 with shares in five
companies. By early next year, the bourse hopes computer-based trading will
cover almost all the 331 separate issues listed.
From next January, 32 lightly-traded warrants and the four foreign stocks
listed in Milan will be covered by the new five-day settlement period,
compared with up to six weeks at present.

The sale of 1.375m 'A' shares, equal to 2.8 per cent of SKF's voting rights

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Vitro and Corning, the Mexican and US glass companies, have decided to end
joint ownership of their consumer glassware divisions, although they will
continue an alliance through supply and distribution agreements.
The companies formed two subsidiaries, Vitro Corning and Corning Vitro. Both
will sell their minority stakes to their partners. Corning will also pay
Vitro Dollars 131m, roughly the amount Vitro paid Corning when joint
ownership was concluded last January.
Corning Vitro had sales last year of more than Dollars 700m and Vitro
Corning achieved turnover of about Dollars 230m.
The joint ventures suffered from the different administrative practices of
the two companies. 'Managing from two countries was more complicated than we
anticipated,' said Corning. 'There were different (management) structures,
styles and accounting systems.'
Corning said the different needs of customers in the US and Mexico
complicated the integration of sales and distribution. Corning's US
customers, especially the large discount stores, expect the timely and
regular delivery of products packaged in a certain way, while Vitro's
Mexican customers are less demanding.
'The separate ownership structure will allow each company to concentrate on
their respective businesses, while relieved of the complexities of managing
two different operations in rapidly changing markets,' said Corning. 'Both
companies need increased flexibility to respond more quickly to customer
expectations and the marketplace.'
Corning separately announced that with Siecor Corporation, a joint venture
with Siemens of Germany, it had agreed to acquire the fibre-optic cable
business of Canada's Northern Telecom for Dollars 130m. Corning will provide
Dollars 87m and Siecor Dollars 43m.
Corning intends to finance the Vitro and Northern Telecom transactions with
an equity offering in the first quarter of 1994. The two transactions and
related financing will not affect Corning's earnings per share or debt to
capital ratio, the company said.

Zenith, the troubled US television and electronics manufacturer, plans to
re-engineer its core consumer electronics and cable businesses and
restructure other product lines.
The reorganisation, which comes barely a year after the company's last
significant restructuring, will result in a fourth-quarter charge to
earnings of about Dollars 30m, the company said.
The charge will require the company to amend a Dollars 90m revolving credit
agreement with GE Capital, its lead lender.
The restructuring will affect Zenith's computer monitor and magnetics
businesses, where production capacity is being reduced.
The action will affect two production plants in Mexico and, to a lesser
extent, manufacturing operations near Zenith's headquarters in Glenview,
Illinois.
Combined with previously-announced restructurings, Zenith expects the moves
to reduce costs by about Dollars 50m in 1994.

FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Porsche in DM200m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Porsche, the German luxury sports car company, is planning a rights issue
which will probably raise about DM200m (Dollars 117m) in cash to help fund
the development of its new model range.
'This decision shows that the Porsche and Piech families who own the company
remain committed to preserving Porsche as an independent company,' Porsche
said. 'With this decision the families also demonstrate that they are
convinced of a speedy recovery for the company.'
The Stuttgart-based company said that family shareholders (who own all the
group's ordinary shares) and outside shareholders (who can buy the group's
quoted preference shares) would participate in the issue in equal measure.
Porsche said that turnover for the last financial year was DM1.9bn, down
from DM2.7bn in the previous year. Full details of the group's earnings
situation will be presented next month, but it is thought that Porsche will
report a loss of around DM250m for the last financial year.
Current-year losses are believed to be running at half of last year's level,
and Porsche is unlikely to break even until the 1994-95 business year.
In spite of its poor earnings situation, Porsche is a cash-rich company,
with about DM650m in net cash before 1992-93 losses are taken into account.

<TEXT>
Suzuki Motor of Japan and its partners in the Magyar Suzuki joint venture in
Hungary yesterday agreed to increase equity to Ft11.7bn (Dollars 117m) after
heavy losses at the car assembly operation.
The infusion more than doubles Magyar Suzuki's original equity of Ft5.5bn,
with which the venture was established in 1991 as the largest Japanese
investment in eastern Europe. Total project costs exceed Y32bn (Dollars
293m).
Suzuki, the parent company, will control 49.9 per cent of the capital
compared with 40 per cent when the group was formed. This follows a vote of
shareholders yesterday.
Suzuki's partner Itochu, the Japanese trading house, takes 15.5 per cent
compared with 11 per cent in 1991.
Suzuki attributed the losses, which it has not quantified, to the
depreciation of the Hungarian currency against the yen. Exchange rate
movements made the import of parts from Japan more expensive, and increased
the burden of Magyar Suzuki's yen borrowings, which the company can now
repay.
In addition, recession and the importation of second-hand cars have
depressed the Hungarian new car market.
Local industry analysts also say many Hungarian customers regard the Swift
hatchback model produced at Suzuki's factory in Esztergom as too small.
Sales have recently begun to increase, with Suzuki forecasting 7,600 local
sales and a 25 per cent market share for 1993.
The company is nevertheless trying to gain easier access to the EU market so
it can offload output originally planned to reach 50,000 by the third year
of production. To meet EU requirements, Magyar Suzuki plans to increase
domestic content to 50 per cent and EU content to 10 per cent.

<TEXT>
Air France and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
are demanding financial compensation from the Czech government after
claiming that they overpaid for their minority holdings in CSA, the Czech
national airline.
The Air France group, in partnership with the French state financial
institute, Caisse des Depots, and the EBRD each acquired slightly less than
20 per cent of the Czech group's capital in 1992 for a total of Dollars 60m.
The National Property Fund, a Czech institution set up to administer
privatisations and oversee the state's shareholdings, is the largest
shareholder with 49 per cent.
Air France yesterday said it was in 'constructive conversations' with the
Czech government but declined to give details. The French airline, which
provided crew training and other services in payment for a large share of
its own interest in CSA, and the EBRD are understood to be seeking a capital
injection by the Czechs into CSA to compensate for the over-valuation of the
airline at the time of the original deal.
The discrepancy in the airline's valuation came to light in an internal
audit report published last week showing it was overvalued by about Kcs746m
(Dollars 25m). This was due in part to the original calculation having being
made on the nominal value of tickets sold without taking discounted fares
into account.
The row will come to a head on Monday at an extraordinary shareholders'
meeting in Prague, which will also attempt to resolve the Czech airline's
growing financial crisis. Government officials expect CSA to make a Kcs1.2bn
loss this year, following a loss of Kcs211m in 1992.
According to Czech press reports, Air France is increasingly concerned by
CSA's mounting losses.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, said recently the government
would not provide any more finance for CSA until the roots of its crisis had
been properly established.

FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Pressure at Metallgesellschaft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive at the troubled Metallgesellschaft
metals, mining and industrial group, is set to come under increasing
pressure at a specially convened meeting of the group's supervisory board
tomorrow.
It is understood that the meeting will examine preliminary results of
intensive investigations by Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, large
shareholders in the company, as well as creditors, into the Frankfurt-based
group's liquidity.
The investigations were launched last week after Deutsche and Dresdner
granted Metallgesellschaft special credit facilities to allow it to meet
what were then described as temporary liquidity problems. These arose as a
result of the activities of MG Corp, the group's US trading subsidiary, in
US commodities futures markets. Frankfurt sources suggest that the liquidity
support may have been as high as DM2bn (Dollars 1.1bn).
News of the special credit facilities triggered a fall in the share price
last week in spite of a public declaration of support for Metallgesellschaft
from Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chief executive. The shares, up DM4.9
to DM305.20 yesterday, have fallen 28 per cent since the start of last week
and the group is now capitalised at DM2.7bn.
Although Mr Kopper said last Tuesday that Metallgesellschaft's liquidity
problems were caused by technical problems and were not 'life-threatening',
it is understood that since then the banks have reassessed the group's
problems in the the light of new information. The banks are believed to be
prepared to carry on supporting Metallgesellschaft.
The group has been hit by cheap metals imports from eastern Europe and the
severity of the German recession. In the year to the end of September it
lost DM347m. The immediate cause of the current problems were said last week
to be margin calls - cash pay-outs - on oils future contracts taken out by
MG Corp, triggered by the recent sharp fall in oil prices.

shares

<TEXT>
Shares in Eastman Kodak, the troubled US photographic products group,
tumbled 11.5 per cent yesterday after a profits warning from Mr George
Fisher, the recently-appointed chairman and chief executive
Mr Fisher said a review carried out in his first two weeks in the job had
revealed that the company's profits next year would fall far short of stock
market expectations. 'Consensus estimates of Kodak's earnings (are) well
above what I believe we will be able to deliver,' he said.
The company gave no indication of why the outlook for next year had changed.
Mr Fisher, however, hinted that revenues would not grow as fast as the
company had expected.
Analysts had anticipated earnings up by as much as one third in 1994, as
Kodak cut costs to rebuild its profits but Mr Fisher said growth would be
'quite modest, in the mid-single digit range, unless we see considerably
more growth than now anticipated'.
Earnings this year would be 'essentially level' with 1992, he added. Then,
the company recorded net income of Dollars 1.15bn, or Dollars 3.26 a share.
Kodak's share price tumbled Dollars 7 1/4 to Dollars 55 1/2 as analysts
rushed to cut their forecasts for the company's earnings. By the close they
had fallen below their level of six weeks ago, when the announcement of Mr
Fisher's appointment cheered the stock market.
Prudential Securities cut its forecast for this year by 30 cents a share, to
Dollars 3.25, and for next year by Dollars 1.25 a share, to Dollars 3.50.
These figures include the Eastman Chemicals business, which Kodak plans to
spin off by the end of this year.
Mr Fisher, hired from Motorola, where he was chairman, to replace the ousted
Mr Kay Whitmore, continued to emphasise growth as the main way for Kodak to
shrug off its earlier problems. While saying the company would have to lower
its costs 'over time', he admitted this was not the long-term answer.
The company would not make earnings forecasts in future, Mr Fisher said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering group, is selling
about 19 per cent of its quoted Ansaldo Trasporti subsidiary in a further
attempt to raise cash and limit its stake in the company.
The placing will cut Finmeccanica's holding to 67 per cent from more than 86
per cent. The group has been hit by the recession and plunging demand for
the aerospace products of its Alenia subsidiary.
In recent weeks, Finmeccanica has launched US initial public offerings for
minority stakes in its Union Switch &amp; Signal and Elsag Bailey Process
Automation subsidiaries.
The latest deal is being managed by Paribas and Lehman Brothers.
Finmeccanica formerly held about 60 per cent of Ansaldo Trasporti, but its
share rose after an acquisition last year.
First-half 1993 sales at Ansaldo Trasporti fell sharply to L318.7bn (Dollars
188m) from L407.5bn, while new orders dropped by more than half to L324.5bn.
Finmeccanica's own first-half results showed a pre-tax loss of L159.9bn
against net profits of L180.5bn in the same period in 1992. The group is
expected to break even in the full year due to asset sales.
Price Waterhouse, the international auditing and consulting group which is
being sued by the new management of Italy's troubled Ferruzzi-Montedison
group, has decided to join the legal action being taken against five
ex-Montedision managers and the heirs of Mr Raul Gardini, the group's former
head.
Price Waterhouse alleges the individuals knowingly concealed 'fraudulent
acts' and 'violated the obligations imposed on them by law' in relation to
their auditors. The auditors are demanding compensation for damage caused
and indemnification against any claims for compensation.

In a second move, Mr Manuel Fernandez Garca, a former trade unionist who
became chairman of the nationalised capital goods manufacturer Babcock &amp;
Wilcox in 1985, has been promoted to head the group of companies that form

FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: More cash for Magyar Suzuki
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Suzuki Motor of Japan and its partners in the Magyar Suzuki joint venture in
Hungary yesterday agreed to increase equity to Ft11.7bn (Dollars 117m) after
heavy losses at the car assembly operation.
The infusion more than doubles Magyar Suzuki's original equity of Ft5.5bn,
with which the venture was established in 1991 as the largest Japanese
investment in eastern Europe. Total project costs exceed Y32bn (Dollars
293m).
Suzuki, the parent company, will control 49.9 per cent of the capital
compared with 40 per cent when the group was formed. This follows a vote of
shareholders yesterday.
Suzuki's partner Itochu, the Japanese trading house, takes 15.5 per cent
compared with 11 per cent in 1991.
Suzuki attributed the losses, which it has not quantified, to the
depreciation of the Hungarian currency against the yen. Exchange rate
movements made the import of parts from Japan more expensive, and increased
the burden of Magyar Suzuki's yen borrowings, which the company can now
repay.
In addition, recession and the importation of second-hand cars have
depressed the Hungarian new car market.
Local industry analysts also say many Hungarian customers regard the Swift
hatchback model produced at Suzuki's factory in Esztergom as too small.
Sales have recently begun to increase, with Suzuki forecasting 7,600 local
sales and a 25 per cent market share for 1993. The company is nevertheless
trying to gain easier access to the EU market so it can offload output
originally planned to reach 50,000 by the third year of production.
To meet EU requirements, Magyar Suzuki plans to increase domestic content to
50 per cent and EU content to 10 per cent. Suzuki executives have said,
therefore, that they plan to use part of the capital infusion to help
domestic component suppliers meet Japanese quality standards.
The Hungarian government supported the recapitalisation by granting a
Ft1.3bn guarantee to Autokonszern, the group of Hungarian companies which
had an original 40 per cent stake in Magyar Suzuki, now lowered to 30.1 per
cent.
The authorities, faced with demands for cash from the budget and loss-making
state enterprises, were reluctant to back the infusion, but wanted to avoid
a dilution in the Hungarian stake below 25 per cent.
The government said earlier its support was necessary to avoid bankruptcy at
Magyar Suzuki.
'The government did not want to scare away Japanese capital by having the
failure of a Japanese company in Hungary,' said Mr Szabolcs Szekeres,
chairman of the state holding company AVRT.

<TEXT>
Schering, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, yesterday
won approval from shareholders to merge its agrochemical division with
Hoechst.
The merger, which will allow Schering to concentrate on the core
pharmaceutical business, will create a group with a combined annual turnover
of DM3bn (Dollars 1.75bn), making it the world's second-largest company in
this sector. Hoeschst will be the majority shareholder with 60 per cent of
the capital.
The joint venture, called Hoechst Schering Agro, will have an equity of
DM700m.
Mr Guiseppe Vita, chairman of Schering, said turnover in the company's
agrochemical sector had fallen 8 per cent since November last year. He said
earnings for 1993 'would not reach the expected after-tax level of DM11m'.
The company blamed the decline on the fall in plant protection sales.
Hoechst expects a net profit of DM42m from its own agrochemical divisions
this year, rising to DM117m in 1994.
The announcement of the merger yesterday coincided with a fall in Schering's
shares after Behringwerke, a subsidiary of Hoechst, said it would next week
present the first results of trials for a new multiple sclerosis drug.
Analysts said the trials could pose competition for Betaseron, Schering's
multiple sclerosis treatment.

Champagne
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French champagne industry yesterday won its legal battle to ban Yves
Saint-Laurent, the French fashion house, from using the name Champagne for
its latest women's perfume in France.
The appeals court upheld an earlier verdict in the industry's favour by
ruling that YSL and Elf Sanofi, its parent company, must by December 31 stop
using the name Champagne for the fragrance and its publicity in France.
Mr Claude Saujet, chairman of Elf Sanofi's beauty products division, said
his company would comply with the ruling by removing the word 'Champagne'
from the product, its packaging and promotional material. 'We didn't want a
fight,' he said. 'But we're going to obey the law.'
The perfume, which was launched throughout Europe in September, will
continue to be sold in France in its original bottle, which resembles a
champagne cork. The only name left on the product will be that of Yves
Saint-Laurent, the fashion designer. It will still be called Champagne
outside France.
Elf Sanofi, which earlier this year acquired YSL in a highly controversial
FFr3.6bn (Dollars 614m) deal, now the subject of an official investigation
into alleged insider trading, sought to play down the financial implications
of the ban.
Mr Jean-Paul Leon, executive vice-president, said it expected to incur costs
of no more than FFr10m in abandoning the name. He said Champagne had been 'a
great success' by generating turnover of FFr200m in its first three months
on sale in Europe. It was the best-selling fine fragrance in France, he
said.
Elf Sanofi has spent FFr100m on launching Champagne which means that,
unusually for a perfume in its first year, the product is already
profitable.
However, the French ban could affect the long-term potential of Champagne if
the domestic name change confuses overseas consumers.

issue shares to that value. The issue will take place some time before the
official opening of the tunnel on May 6.
Eurotunnel has said it needs a further Pounds 1bn of working capital on top

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Borne up by a strong spread of activities /
A look at BAe as it continues its search for European partnerships and Asian
joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace is in the throes of wide-ranging discussions with other
aircraft manufacturers to establish a series of new European partnerships
for turbopropeller and regional jet aircraft modelled on the European Airbus
large airliner manufacturing consortium.
These partnerships would complement rather than conflict with the company's
efforts to negotiate joint ventures in the turboprop and regional jet
sectors with emerging Asian aerospace industries in Indonesia and Taiwan.
Although in recent months BAe has appeared intent on refocusing its
aerospace activities on its profitable defence operations and on its 20 per
cent stake in the Airbus consortium, Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive,
insisted that the company wanted to maintain a 'strong spread' of commercial
aerospace activities.
'We need a good mix of civil and military businesses to get the necessary
volume throughput to remain a leading competitor,' he said.
He argued that BAe's military aircraft business could not survive without
the company's activities in Airbus and other commercial aircraft programmes
which were providing work for BAe's military facilities.
BAe has continued to lose money on its commercial aerospace activities with
the biggest losses this year in its turbopropeller business which has now
been regrouped at Prestwick in Scotland.
In the first half of this year, the commercial aircraft operations made an
operating loss of Pounds 81m compared with Pounds 286m. Turboprops accounted
for about Pounds 60m of the loss. The Airbus activities also made a small
loss, while the regional jet business operated close to break-even after the
Pounds 1bn provision made in 1992.
BAe now sees the longer term future of its turboprop and regional jet
activities as part of a broader restructuring of the European commercial
aerospace industry. The company would like to see strong European
partnerships in both the turboprop and regional jet businesses in which it
would hold a minority stake.
For BAe, the most encouraging prospects appear to centre on a
rationalisation of the European turboprop sector. BAe has been holding talks
with Aerospatiale, its French Airbus partner, over possible collaboration in
turboprops. Aerospatiale and BAe have also held separate talks with Casa,
the Spanish Airbus partner. Discussions have also been held between BAe and
Saab and the Canadian Bombardier group, which owns Shorts of Belfast and de
Havilland, the turboprop manufacturer.
'For the first time, there really is a seriousness developing in these
talks: I am confident something positive will happen,' said Mr Evans.
BAe has signed an agreement with Indonesia to explore collaboration in the
turboprop business. It believes it cannot turn its back on the emerging
Asian aerospace industries but sees co-operation with countries like
Indonesia focused on specific projects rather than on a broad front.
In Europe Mr Evans sees an opportunity of integrating scattered
manufacturing assets to rationalise the sector.
In the regional jet sector, BAe has not altogether given up hope of a joint
venture with Taiwan Aerospace. But the protracted and now stalled
negotiations have cast doubts on the much publicised venture. Meanwhile, BAe
has decided to pursue its regional jet activities on its own while
considering other collaborative options in the event of the Taiwan deal
finally collapsing.
BAe believes the most rational alternative would be co-operation with
Fokker, the Dutch regional jet manufacturer taken over this year by Deutsche
Aerospace, the aerospace subsidiary of Germany's Daimler-Benz group.
BAe attempted to negotiate a partnership with Fokker three years ago.
Although the talks broke down in part because of competing product lines,
there is a compelling argument for the two companies to form the nucleus of
a European regional jet consortium modelled on Airbus.
Mr Edzard Reuter, Daimler-Benz chairman, suggested he would welcome closer
collaboration between Deutsche Aerospace and BAe on regional aircraft
programmes. Mr Reuter said 'we are still meeting, we are still discussing'.
But it is on Airbus that BAe is pinning its long-term hopes in the
commercial sector. 'We've got an opportunity to turn Airbus in turnover
terms into one of, if not the, biggest company in Europe by the end of the
decade,' Mr Evans said.
Airbus , however, was now facing a growing challenge from Boeing, its main
US rival. 'Boeing has woken up late in the day to the threat of Airbus and
is now working to reduce the cost of its products and its production cycle
times.'
Mr Evans believes Airbus has even bigger opportunities to reduce its costs
than Boeing. 'If Boeing manages to cut its costs by 25 per cent we should be
able to reduce Airbus costs by 40 per cent if we can harness efficiently all
the assets.'
The immediate issue was not transforming Airbus into a public limited
company. 'A plc is no panacea, it's a catch phrase,' he argued. Instead, the
big challenge was to give Airbus more control of the assets deployed in the
airliner business by its four partners including BAe, Aerospatiale, Deutsche
Aerospace and Casa.
BAe has still not broken even on its investment in Airbus. However, Mr Evans
expected the business to become more profitable as its volume of activity
grew. 'But we can't sit back and ignore the new competitive pressures facing
Airbus. We've got to find ways to move it forward. And I think we will in
the end set up an Airbus aerostructures company which will be completely
under Airbus control.'
That could ultimately also be the way ahead for the troubled European
turboprop and regional jet industries.

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals cut Bulmer to Pounds 2.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HP Bulmer Holdings, the cider maker, reported an 11.9 per cent increase in
first half pre-tax profits to Pounds 12m after adjustment for exceptional
losses of Pounds 8.6m on the sale of its pectin business.
On an FRS 3 basis, however, profits for the half year to October 29 declined
from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 2.66m.
Helped by a buoyant UK cider market, in which volumes grew 10 per cent to
88.8m gallons in the year to September, operating profits on continuing
businesses rose 20 per cent to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 12.3m).
Turnover improved 7 per cent to Pounds 139.5m in spite of lower soft drinks
sales and a depressed beer business.
Adjusted earnings per share rose 15.7 per cent to 15.02p and the interim
dividend is lifted to 4p (3.75p).
Operating profits from UK activities rose from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 13.2m.
Share of the draught cider market increased from 52.6 per cent to 54.7 per
cent. Scrumpy Jack led the growth with volumes through pubs ahead 40 per
cent. Strongbow sales rose 4 per cent but Woodpecker showed a modest
decline.
In the take-home market Scrumpy Jack sales were up 42 per cent. Strongbow's
growth was affected by increased competition from economy and private label
brands, and Woodpecker volumes, reflecting declining demand for sweet cider,
fell 11 per cent.
Bulmer almost doubled sales of its economy products to 3.6m gallons and now
accounts for 29 per cent of the sector, which is growing at an annual rate
of 37 per cent.
Mr John Rudgard, chief executive, said an independent review of the UK cider
market, commissioned by the company, predicted continuing growth with annual
volumes reaching 110m gallons by the end of the decade.
The company is extending its orchards and investing Pounds 20m in new
manufacturing technology.
Profits from Australian operations rose from Pounds 740,000 to Pounds
911,000 while Stassen in Belgium achieved higher than expected growth,
contributing profits of Pounds 706,000. Sales in France rose 71 per cent.
Borrowings at the period-end totalled Pounds 41.6m but will be reduced to
Pounds 33.2m, with gearing of 45.8 per cent, as a result of the pectin
disposal.

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: SB drug should win approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, yesterday announced
that the US Food and Drug Administration had sent it a letter indicating
that its anti-nausea compound Kytril was approvable.
The letter does not constitute an approval, but it does indicate that the
medicine should soon receive a licence. The news is a relief forthe company
which has been plagued by regulatory problems in recent months.
Kytril will compete directly with Zofran, one of Glaxo's fastest-growing
medicines with sales last year of Pounds 365m, of which Pounds 219m were in
the US. Kytril's sales last year were Pounds 32m and are expected to reach
Pounds 75m, according to analysts Wertheim Schroder.
Last March, the FDA's gastrointestinal advisory committee felt unable to
recommend approval for Kytril because of potential carcinogenic and
cardiovascular side effects.
Wellcome, the UK drugs group, announced yesterday that Navelbine, its
anti-cancer compound, had been recommended by FDA's oncology drug advisory
committee for use in advanced non-small cell lung cancer either as a single
agent or in combination with cisplatin, another chemotherapy product.
The committee's advice is normally taken by the FDA.

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: GWR buys four radio stations for Pounds 15m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GWR, the Bristol-based commercial radio group that owns a stake in Classic
FM, joined the industry 'premier league' yesterday with a four station deal
valued at about Pounds 15m in cash and shares.
GWR said yesterday it had conditionally agreed to buy all the shares of
Radio Trent, Mercia Sound and Leicester Sound from Capital Radio for Pounds
4.77m in cash and more than 1m GWR shares.
At the same time GWR has bought Beacon Broadcasting, the last of the large
independent stations, for a total Pounds 3.69m, including debt.
The deal, which will take GWR's potential adult audience from 2.9m to 7.1m,
including a completely new sphere of influence in the Midlands, will give
the company 17 radio licences and an annual turnover of Pounds 18.8m.
The acquisitions will be financed partly by raising Pounds 8.72m net through
a placing and open offer. Shareholders can acquire shares at 565p in the
enlarged group on the basis of 10 shares for every 19 held. Both the Daily
Mail and General Trust and Capital Radio will take up their maximum
entitlements.
Under the deal Daily Mail will hold 20 per cent in the enlarged group and Mr
Roger Gilbert will become deputy chairman. Capital will also have a 20 per
cent stake. GWR, Capital and Daily Mail are likely consortium partners in a
bid for INR 3, the third national commercial radio station.
The deal puts GWR in the ranks of the large regional groups such as Clyde in
Scotland, Metro in the north, and Capital in London.
'These companies are going to drive the industry towards a greater share of
advertising revenue,' Mr Ralph Barnard, chief executive of GWR, said
yesterday.
Capital decided to sell partly because it recognised GWR's expertise in
managing small and medium-sized radio stations. Media Sales Marketing,
Capital's advertising sales house, will now sell on behalf of GWR.
Capital shares rose from 254p to 281p.

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sweb freezes domestic prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Western Electricity yesterday pledged to freeze its prices for
domestic consumers until April 1995 as it announced a 28 per cent increase
in profits and a 19 per cent dividend rise.
The Bristol-based distributor made Pounds 30.6m (Pounds 23.9m) before tax in
the six months to September 30 - in line with market expectations.
Turnover for the period rose slightly from Pounds 381.4m to Pounds 385.8m.
Mr John Seed, chief executive, described the outcome as 'a sound set of
results'.
One of the main contributors was the continuing drop in costs, which are
targeted for a 10 per cent reduction - a further 250 jobs are to go over the
next four months. There was also a 2.1 per cent rise in electricity units
distributed.
However, the company emphasised that profits were boosted by a Pounds 2.8m
drop in net interest, thanks to the large positive cash balance resulting
from changes in the timing of coal contract payments.
There was also a Pounds 1.3m contribution from Sweb's share in the
newly-completed Teesside power station.
The retailing business reduced operating losses from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds
1m, and Mr Seed said he expected it to be breaking even by the end of the
financial year.
The price freeze, which follows a Pounds 9 rebate for household customers
earlier this autumn, will mean that Sweb will effectively hold charges level
for three years.
Earnings per share improved to 19.9p (15.1p).
The dividend rise, which takes the payment from 5.9p to 7p, was lower than
that of some other recs, but Mr Seed said it was 'reasonable'.
COMMENT
The headline profit rise is misleading, as the company took some trouble to
point out yesterday, thanks largely to fortuitous changes in coal contracts.
The underlying growth is closer to 15 per cent, which makes this a steady,
middle-of-the-road set of results underpinned by cost cutting and
improvements in associated activities such as retailing. The dividend
increase was the standard for the sector. The prospective yield of just
under 4 per cent puts Sweb in the middle of the field.

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Water shows 20% rise to Pounds
4.12m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bristol Water Holdings continued to make progress both in its regulated
water business and in the development of non-regulated activities. Pre-tax
profits advanced by 20 per cent, from Pounds 3.43m to Pounds 4.12m, in the
six months to September 30.
Sales for the regulated business expanded 7.5 per cent, which combined with
external turnover of Pounds 2.3m from non-regulated businesses led to group
turnover rising by 16 per cent to Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 26.1m).
Operating profits rose 13 per cent to Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 5.65m) despite big
increases in the depreciation charge arising from the continuing capital
programme.
Capital expenditure, which grew from Pounds 8m to Pounds 11m, was funded
using the proceeds of the 8.75 per cent irredeemable preference shares
issued last November.
Fully diluted earnings per share, after minorities, edged ahead to 39.9p
(39.7p). The interim dividend is stepped up to 11.1p (10.3p).

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Shoprite to expand after 88% jump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shoprite, the discount food retailer, yesterday unveiled an ambitious
expansion plan following an 88 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the
year to October 31.
The company said that profits of Pounds 5.08m (Pounds 2.7m) would enable it
to open at least 50 new stores over the next 12 months, almost doubling its
size.
The group, based in the Isle of Man, said improved turnover of Pounds 164m
(Pounds 87.5m) showed demand was rising for its discount outlets in
Scotland, where it already has 66 stores.
Mr Deryck Nicholson, chairman and joint managing director, said: 'We believe
our trading format is capable of sustaining at least 200 stores in Scotland
by 1996 with the potential for a similar number in northern England.'
He said the expansion would be financed from the group's own resources and
borrowing.
Disposals and leaseback transactions helped raise Pounds 5.6m, which, after
the acquisition of 30 new stores, left the group with Pounds 1.8m cash in
hand compared with Pounds 288,000 last time.
Gearing, currently 51 per cent, is expected to exceed 60 per cent next year.
Mr Nicholson, whose father Ken was a co-founder of the Kwik Save discount
chain, said the balance sheet had been strengthened by a Pounds 9.7m rights
issue in January and the expansion would not require another placement.
The improved performance last year mainly reflected double-figure percentage
growth at the 33 stores operating in Scotland for the whole 12 months.
On the Isle of Man, however, the retail, property and vehicle retailing
interests proved less buoyant.
Discount supermarkets on the island were performing only satisfactorily,
while trading conditions for its Mercedes-Benz dealership remained
'extremely difficult'.
Earnings per share jumped from 3.77p to 5.64p.
The proposed final divided is increased to 1.6p, making a total for the year
of 2.2p (1.5p adjusted).
The shares rose 8p to close at 178p.

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Kunick in black with Pounds 4.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUNICK, the amusement machines and care homes group, returned to the black
with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.8m for the year to September 25, against
losses of Pounds 11.8m last time.
The swing was achieved both through a Pounds 1.2m contribution from the
nursing homes business jointly owned with County NatWest Ventures, compared
with a loss of Pounds 55,000 last time, and the absence of Pounds 12.2m in
exceptional charges for restructuring.
Profits were also helped by a sharp fall in interest charges from Pounds
5.99m to Pounds 2.1m. This was partly the result of the Pounds 12.5m sale of
50 per cent of Goldsborough Holdings, the nursing homes division, last year.
At the operating level, profits were 7 per cent lower at Pounds 6m, due to
the sales of the visitor attractions business. Sales were 14 per cent down
to Pounds 94.1m.
Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said the group intended to float
Goldsborough in the first half of next year, if conditions were appropriate.
The division was expected to double profits in the current year, he said.
The proceeds of flotation would be used to help Kunick increase its exposure
to the amusement machine-linked leisure market.
In the UK, Kunick's amusement machine business surged ahead due to
restructuring and the increased Pounds 6 payout which had proved
'tremendously popular' with players. Operating profits rose by 23 per cent
to Pounds 3.2m, on sales 9 per cent lower.
In France, where Kunick supplies amusement machines and runs a franchised
retail chain, operating profits increased by Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 3.5m. The
care services division doubled to Pounds 850,000.
The dividend is passed for the second consecutive year. Earnings per share
were 0.02p, against losses of 7.34p.

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Northern Electric advances 28%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Electric, the power distributor for the north-east of England,
announced a 28 per cent increase to Pounds 52.6m in pre-tax profits for the
half year to September 30.
The interim dividend is lifted by 17.5 per cent to 7.4p, although the
company said that was partly to reduce the disparity between the two halves
of the year.
The underlying increase was 15 per cent, said Mr David Morris, executive
chairman.
Northern is splitting the role of chairman and chief executive. Its decision
to promote Mr Tony Hadfield from managing director to chief executive from
April 1 means that only one of the 12 regional electricity companies,
Norweb, has a combined chairman and chief executive. East Midlands split the
two jobs last week.
Northern's pre-tax result, up from a restated Pounds 41.1m, was achieved on
turnover of Pounds 460.7m (Pounds 395.5m). Operating profits advanced from
Pounds 40.7m to Pounds 48.3m.
Earnings per share worked through 30 per cent ahead at 32.1p (24.7p).
The improvement was helped by a 1.4 per cent inc-rease in electricity units
distributed, with domestic sales up 4.2 per cent and commercial up 3.6 per
cent.
Units to industry fell but the rate of decline is slow-ing.
Supply profits rose from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 2.8m as the company reaped
the rewards of selling electricity to large customers in the liberalised
market outside its area.
It claims about 400 sites outside its area on top of the 200 it supplies
inside it.
Retailing made profits of Pounds 700,000, against a small loss last year.
Two more out-of-town superstores had been opened which were trading above
expectations, Mr Morris said.
Northern has a staff of 4,700 and expects to reduce that by about 3 per cent
each year including this.
The company has Pounds 28m cash, having started the year with Pounds 39m
debt and 9 per cent gearing. It expects to be cash neutral at the year-end.
COMMENT
Northern's aggressive drive to win customers outside its natural monopoly
region marks it out from other regional power companies. It also makes some
investors nervous. These results will alleviate the anxieties, with supply
profits beginning to show through clearly, and Pounds 8m to Pounds 10m
possible for the full year. From April the supply market will become more
competitive as an extra 45,000 sites become eligible to choose who supplies
their electricity. That will be the real test of Northern's faith in a
business where margins are slim at best. In other areas there is little to
distinguish Northern from other recs and little to either worry or excite
shareholders. At yesterday's close the shares are fairly valued with a
prospective dividend of 24.7p producing a yield of about 4.4 per cent.

Losses at Haemocell, the USM-traded medical equipment maker, rose from
Pounds 1.69m to Pounds 2.13m pre-tax for the year to end-August after taking
account of an exceptional provision of Pounds 413,000.
Before the provision, which related to the termination of the distribution
agreement with Stryker Corporation of the US, the deficit was in line with
the directors' forecast in August.
Turnover expanded from Pounds 676,000 to Pounds 1.12m. Losses widened to
10.1p (9.3p) per share.

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Maintained market share aids Acatos &amp;
Hutcheson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Acatos &amp; Hutcheson, the edible oils and fats manufacturing group, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits up 30 per cent from Pounds 7.83m to Pounds 10.2m
for the 53 weeks ended October 3.
Turnover rose to Pounds 222.1m (Pounds 200.9m for 52 weeks).
Mr Ian Hutcheson, chairman, said that 'in spite of all our difficulties we
have succeeded in maintaining or improving our market shares in all
principal sectors.'
He expressed confidence in the company's medium to long-term future but said
that 'the threat of increased competition is always with us and this year
there have been some developments which cause me to be cautious in regard to
our likely results in the current year.'
Last month the company announced the closure of its Bootle factory with the
loss over the next 18 months of about 250 jobs. Provisions of Pounds 4.2m
would be 'adequate'.
The board proposed a final dividend of 5p to give a total of 8p (6.5p),
payable from earnings of 20.9p (16.2p).
Operating profits rose to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.1m). The company booked a
Pounds 2.73m (Pounds 1.49m) exceptional charge against rationalisation.
A&amp;H also booked a net Pounds 139,000 one-off charge against goodwill written
off on disposal of a Spanish subsidiary and the recovery of investment in
and loans to former Spanish operations.
This charge compares with last time's Pounds 274,000 gain after some earlier
provisions were released and on the recovery of funds that had been tied up
in former Spanish operations.

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Exports help lift Chemring 9.5% to Pounds
5.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Chemring Group, the maker of anti-missile chaff, distress
rockets and waterproof clothes, rose 9.5 per cent from Pounds 5.21m to
Pounds 5.71m in the year to September 30.
With turnover up by only 4 per cent to Pounds 39.4m (Pounds 37.9m), margins
were improved, said Mr Philip Billington, chairman, because of the
monitoring of group costs and manufacturing efficiencies.
Exports accounted for 61 per cent of turnover. The defence side still
accounted for 60 per cent of turnover, in spite of efforts to lift the civil
side.
'Defence keeps rising,' Mr Billington said, 'and there's still a significant
number of little wars.' He added that while Budgets might cut the numbers of
big-ticket items like aircraft, countermeasures remained strong sellers to
armed services.
Middle East markets continued to expand, while the growing economies of east
Asia wanted independent defence forces, Mr Billington said.
Chemring commands some 65 per cent of the global market in its commercial
marine business, though recession shrank the leisure side.
Fully diluted earnings were 18.8p (17.2p) per share and the final dividend
is lifted to 6p for a 9p (8.15p adjusted ) total.

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Pentos warning hits share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Pentos fell sharply yesterday after Sir Kit McMahon, the new
chairman, warned that the specialist retailing group would incur a
'substantial' loss before tax and exceptional items this year and pass the
final divid-end.
In the wake of the warning the group's shares lost almost a quarter of their
value and closed down 8 1/2 p at 26p, a nine-year low.
Sir Kit, who replaced Mr Terry Maher as chairman early last month shortly
after the group announced its first ever loss and passed its interim
dividend, blamed the expected deficit on tough trading conditions and, in
particular, losses at the Athena poster shops and increased interest costs.
He added that 'substantial write-downs and charges will be necessary and
will be taken as exceptional losses in the current year.'
In addition, he said a full review of the group's accounting and disclosure
policies had been undertaken as a result of which it was proposed, for
example, that property profits, relating mainly to 'reverse premia', would
be separately disclosed.
The group's treatment of these upfront payments by landlords has been
heavily criticised by some analysts. Yesterday, Sir Kit said reverse premia
'are not expected to be material in future years.'
He said recent trading had 'not matched earlier expectations for the group
as a whole.' Like-for-like sales at the flagship Dillons bookshops had
continued to be 4 per cent up on last year, but despite an encouraging
first-half performance at the Ryman stationery stores, second half sales
were down 2 per cent on a comparable basis.
Price cutting and fierce competition meant the Ryman computer shops were
showing a 12 per cent decline in like-for-like second half sales. In
addition, Athena's retail sales continued to run below last year, although
there had been some improvement in the second half with UK sales down 2 per
cent on a comparable basis. Furthermore, Athena's wholesale and overseas
sales had been below expectations.
As a result, Sir Kit said 'significant trading losses will be incurred at
Athena for the year as a whole.'
The trading statement also revealed that Mr Bill McGrath, the incoming chief
executive who formally takes up his new job on January 1, had already begun
work on improving the performance of Pentos and had initiated a full review
of the group's strategic options.

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Amber Day chief executive resigns after
four months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The revolving door for executives at Amber Day Holdings, the discount
retailer, took another spin yesterday with the resignation of Mr David
Thompson from the board after only four months as chief executive.
Mr Thompson, who joined last year as finance director, is the latest to
depart from the controversial group, which runs the What Everyone Wants
retail chain, and has had three different chairmen in the last 15 months.
Mr Peter Carr, who became executive chairman in August, said Mr Thompson's
resignation arose from the reduced scope of the company's activities and the
concentration of its administration in Glasgow to where, for personal and
family reasons, he felt unable to relocate.
Mr Thompson has resigned as a director, but will remain with the company
until April 30. Although Mr Thompson was on a three-year contract and had a
salary of Pounds 180,000, Mr Carr said he would receive no compensation
payment, but would retain options on 400,000 shares. Amber Day's shares
closed 1p higher at 63p.
Amber Day's institutional shareholders have been concerned by the size of
previous pay-offs. Mr Philip Green stepped down as chairman last September
with a golden handshake of Pounds 1.13m. Mr Stacey Ellis, a former Inchcape
director who replaced Mr Green but left after a boardroom tussle with Mr
Carr in August, received Pounds 500,000.
Mr Carr yesterday told the group's annual meeting that Amber Day was
currently in discussions with its advisers over the injection of new funds
into the company.
A rights issue seems most likely, at least partly backed by Warburg Pincus,
the US investment institution which has a 12 per cent stake. Write-downs and
provisions have reduced the balance sheet, and gearing currently stands at
about 80 per cent.
The chairman said the overriding objective of his five-year plan for the
company was to develop as the leading discount store operator in the UK.
Since August, six new stores had opened, bringing the total to 58, and he
intended to open at least another four by July.
Mr Carr said the UK retail sector did appear to be experiencing a gradual
recovery and the business was well positioned to benefit from any further
upturn.
'To that end, we plan to approximately double the current number of outlets
and to expand the company's geographical spread on a national scale over the
period.'

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Alvis rises strongly to Pounds 5.07m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower reorganisation charges coupled with stronger performances in some
businesses helped Alvis, the defence contractor, report pre-tax profits
ahead from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 5.07m in the year to September 30.
The board is, however, proposing to hold the final dividend at 0.5p, giving
an unchanged total of 1p, in spite of earnings per share of 2.4p (losses of
5.5p).
'The order backlog at September 30 1992 was more than this year's Pounds
80m. There has been a small erosion of the order backlog. But this reflects
timing of particular orders as much as difficult conditions in the defence
and aerospace markets,' said Mr Nick Prest, chief executive.
He said the company did not expect to see any significant upturn in orders
before late 1994 or early 1995.
Alvis booked lower exceptional charges of Pounds 1.08m (Pounds 5.24m),
mainly against relocations and redundancies, which flattered the comparison
at the pre-tax level.
Turnover increased 5 per cent to Pounds 97.3m (Pounds 92.4m) and trading
profits rose 15 per cent to Pounds 5.75m (Pounds 4.99m).
Alvis Industries in Coventry made a contribution to profits compared with
last time's break-even. Helio, the optics business now owned by Alvis's 51
per cent-owned Avimo Singapore subsidiary, achieved a 'substantial increase
in profits' on the back of a high level of orders.

FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: 60p flotation price gives SEC market value
of Pounds 9.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A price of 60p a share was fixed yesterday for the flotation of Securitised
Endowment Contracts valuing the trader in second hand with-profits insurance
policies at Pounds 9.1m.
The capitalisation falls short of the Pounds 10m-plus the company had
originally indicated, reflecting a cut to the price earlier envisaged
following flat results from Policy Portfolio, SEC's main quoted competitor.
None of the three founder directors is selling shares and they will hold
59.4 per cent of the issued share capital after the float.
One of them, Mr Bernard Klug, the executive director with responsibility for
corporate planning and development, was formerly non-executive director of
Honorbilt, which went into administrative receivership in 1990.
Dealings in the shares on the USM begin on December 21 following a placing,
completed yesterday, of 5.7m shares. Broker to the placing is Williams de
Broe, who also underwrote the deal.
The flotation price is 10 times SEC's earnings per share for the year ended
September 30 (adjusted for a one-off pension contribution).
The notional gross dividend yield for the year is 7.3 per cent and the
flotation will raise Pounds 3.1m net of expenses. The funds will be used to
repay bank debt of about Pounds 965,000 and to finance a substantially
larger stock of assigned policies than SEC has to date been capable of
holding.

FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Greencore advances 14% but warns
on present year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greencore, the Irish sugar and agribusiness group, yesterday reported a 14
per cent increase in pre-tax profits from IPounds 29.6m to IPounds 33.7m
(Pounds 32m) in the year to September 24.
The 1992 pre-tax figure was restated from IPounds 31.5m under FRS 3 to take
account of extraordinary items of IPounds 1.85m and profits from related
companies.
Group turnover improved marginally to IPounds 394m (IPounds 388m), although
a successful 'campaign' - the three month processing period - led to a
IPounds 9.7m increase in sales from continuing operations to IPounds 392m.
Growth in the current year, however, is likely to be undermined by a sharp
decline in crop yields following bad summer weather.
Mr Bernie Cahill, chairman, warned that sugar beet yields alone could fall
by up to 30 per cent.
Reduced crop yields would have a damaging impact on the group's three
divisions - sugar, agribusiness and other food - which last year contributed
to increased operating profits of IPounds 40m, against a restated IPounds
36.7m.
Of the three divisions, operating profits in sugar showed the biggest
improvement with a 12.5 per cent rise to IPounds 22.3m on sales of IPounds
127.2m (IPounds 123.1m).
Turnover in agribusiness rose 4.4 per cent to IPounds 141m with profits up
to IPounds 9.5m (IPounds 9m). Other food contributed profits of IPounds 9.2m
(IPounds 8.4m) on static sales of IPounds 124.3m (IPounds 124.6m).
Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, finance director, said operating profits were hampered
by a IPounds 964,000 loss on the disposal in October of Chambers, its
Northern Ireland distribution company, and a small potato subsidiary.
The balance sheet, meanwhile, was strengthened by falling interest rates,
which declined from more than 40 per cent in the first half to about 7 per
cent at the year end.
In a bid to avoid crippling interest charges, the group had cut stocks,
placed increased emphasis on operating efficiency and used profits to
increase cash balances from IPounds 5.3m to IPounds 18.7m. Gearing fell from
61 per cent to 24 per cent.
Earnings per share came in at 33.9p, against a restated 28.8p. A final
dividend of 5.5p (5p) makes an 8.8p (8p) total.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Union deal secures mini-car for Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz is to build its revolutionary mini-car in Germany after
reaching a deal with the workforce which will reduce the company's labour
costs by DM200m (Pounds 80m) a year, according to Mr Helmut Werner,
chairman.
Mercedes, mainstay of the loss-making Daimler-Benz group, will spend DM500m
fitting out its new plant at Rastatt in south-west Germany. Production of
the so-called A-Class, the company's first venture into the small car
market, will start in 1997. A year later, when there will be capacity to
produce 200,000 cars a year, the plant will employ around 3,000. At present,
1,300 put together fewer than 200 E-Class executive saloons a day.
After a late-night deal with the Mercedes workers' councils, Mr Werner
presented the decision as evidence of how well the German system of
co-determination functioned. Other potential sites - in Britain, France and
the Czech Republic - 'had such great cost advantages over Germany that a
decision for Rastatt on economic considerations seemed almost impossible,'
he declared.
And yet labour and management pulled off a near miracle. Quite how was not
spelt out, but details include union acceptance of modest pay cuts and
smaller bonuses for all workers, shorter working weeks for some, and
Saturday working without overtime pay in a trade-off for concessions to ease
the pain of planned job cuts. Daimler is in the process of cutting 51,000
jobs group-wide.
The cost-saving scheme resembles an agreement at Adam Opel, the local
General Motors subsidiary which ensured that its plant at Kaiserslautern was
chosen to manufacture a new diesel engine. Together with the wage cuts
associated with the planned introduction of Volkswagen's 'four-day week',
the deals add substance to the view that motor manufacturers, at least, have
come to grips with the inflexible working practices and excessive wage costs
blamed for most of the structural problems plaguing German industry.
Daimler, which yesterday reported a nine-month loss of DM2bn, under newly
adopted US accounting principles, is feeling the need for change more than
most. But it is also feeling other pressures. It has announced the closure
of six Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) sites and a radical shake-out at its
lame-duck AEG subsidiary.
In relative terms its job-cutting is no more rigorous than the hundreds of
other economy drives. Its global workforce is still around 375,000.
But as Germany's largest industrial concern, it tends to be the focus for
the frustrations of manufacturing workers nationwide.
After announcing several investments in vehicle manufacture outside Germany,
if the group had also 'exported' the A-Class car jobs it would probably have
unleashed new waves of protest within Mercedes. In light of its New York
Stock Exchange listing and the impending public offering of part of Deutsche
Bank's Daimler stake, the group's efforts to gain credibility in the world's
largest capital market would scarcely be helped by further hue and cry.
But whatever the political considerations, Rastatt was always the preferred
choice. Mr Werner Niefer, Mr Werner's late predecessor, proclaimed it
'simply the most up-to-date automotive factory in the world'.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Dorling Kindersley shares fall on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dorling Kindersley, the publisher which became a glamour stock after its
flotation last year, yesterday shocked investors by announcing the departure
of its managing director and issuing its second profits warning in a
fortnight.
The shares plunged 89p to 221p, reducing the group's market value by Pounds
55m to Pounds 136m. They had already fallen from a peak of 351p in October -
just a year after they were floated at 165p.
The group, which produces illustrated reference books and multimedia
products, warned that continuing problems at its Tiptree distributor and a
projected shortfall at DK Education, which supplies teaching packages to
schools, meant pre-tax profits for the year to next June would be less than
the Pounds 9.65m achieved last time. Analysts had been expecting the group
to make about Pounds 11.5m pre-tax until the first warning last month.
Dorling Kindersley said yesterday that trading in the pre-Christmas period
was being disrupted by a computer problem at Tiptree Books, owned by Random
House, the US publisher. Its managing director Mr Richard Harman, 45, had
resigned 'to pursue other interests'. He had a three-year rolling contract
for which he would receive a nominal sum, but was being allowed to exercise
options on 650,000 shares.
Mr Peter Kindersley, chairman, said the departure was a mutual decision as
Mr Harman's interest had 'begun to flag'. It was not fair to blame the
company's problems on him.
Mr Harman had been with the company for nine years but had seen his
management role eroded after the appointment of Mr Peter Gill as finance
director and Mr Rod Hare as operations director. Mr Kindersley said: 'His
successor, Rod Hare, is a particularly effective hands-on manager, with a
thorough knowledge of the business.'
Dorling Kindersley has given three months' notice to Tiptree and will itself
take over distribution of its DK Family Library, which sells to homes,
offices and schools. It asked Arthur Andersen, the accountants, to assess
damages and a claim will be made.
Dorling Kindersley remained confident about its core businesses. One factor
driving City enthusiasm has been the group's role in pioneering CD-Rom
multimedia products.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Daimler plans roadshow for US stock offering: Innovations at
Germany's largest industrial group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz is planning a 10-city marketing roadshow in the US early next
year to promote the planned public offering in New York of 3.2 per cent of
the group's stock, currently owned by Deutsche Bank.
Mr Gerhard Liener, group finance director, said the aim was to increase the
volume of trade in Daimler shares on the in New York Stock Exchange. The
secondary offering of 15m American depositary shares (ADSs), each
representing one tenth of an ordinary Daimler share, with a current market
value of more than DM1bn, would come by early February.
The underwriters also have an option to acquire up to 2.25m extra ADSs,
representing a further 225,000 ordinary shares, to cover over-allotments.
The offering is believed to be the second biggest by a European company in
the US, after British Telecom.
The move will cut Deutsche Bank's holding in Daimler to slightly under 25
per cent. Although speculation persists that further reductions in the
bank's holding are likely, Mr Liener said the close ties between the two
companies would continue. Deutsche's offering is part of a growing trend
among German banks to liberate capital for more fruitful deployment in the
mainstream banking business.
The sale of Daimler shares follows the group's listing on the NYSE on
October 5, which made it the first German company to be traded there. The
timing of the new offering is linked to the conversion, expected to be
approved this week, of shares in MAH into ordinary Daimler stock. MAH is a
holding company, set up at Daimler's initiative in the 1970s to hold 25 per
cent of the group's stock and protect it from takeover.
In a statement agreed with Deutsche, Mr Liener said the bank did not wish to
be the only stockholder retaining a blocking minority. 'We intend to offer a
good third of the share capital made available to private stockholders,' he
said.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Four Lonrho directors set to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four of Lonrho's oldest directors - the ones most closely identified with Mr
Tiny Rowland - are on the verge of agreeing to resign before the end of the
conglomerate's financial year.
Their departure would leave Mr Dieter Bock, joint chief executive with Mr
Rowland, in complete control. It may also herald the early departure of Mr
Rowland from the group that he has dominated for the past three decades.
The four directors discussing their terms of departure are understood to be
Mr Rene Leclezio, chairman, and Mr Peter Youens, both in their 70s, and the
two deputy chairmen, Mr Paul Spicer and Mr Robert Dunlop, who are in their
mid-60s. All four are seen as Mr Rowland's strongest supporters on the
Lonrho board. The normal retiring age of directors at most companies is 65.
Mr Rowland, who is 76, last month threatened that any attempt by Mr Bock to
get rid of the 'Lonrho pensioners' would lead to a 'fight over my dead
body'. However, he recently appeared to soften his opposition, saying that
any resignation would only be acceptable if it was at the behest of the
director. He also stressed that he was now 'at one' with Mr Bock.
Under Lonrho's articles of association, directors can only be dismissed with
the unanimous agreement of the board. This effectively means it is almost
impossible to fire anyone on the board.
Mr Bock, the German financier with 18.8 per cent of the stock, has long been
in favour of changing the articles to bring them into line with modern
company practice. He recently received the support of Mr Rowland and the
board to ask Morgan Grenfell, Lonrho's merchant bank adviser, to prepare a
paper updating the articles.
Some of the main changes expected to be recommended are the dismissal of a
director by simple majority of the board instead of unanimous approval; a
retirement age of 65; the re-election of all directors; and the maximum
number of directors that can be appointed to the board. The proposed changes
would then be put to Lonrho's annual meeting in March.
The changes are understood to be among the main factors behind the decision
of the four directors to enter into negotiations on the terms and conditions
of their early departure.
They are expected to agree soon that they will go during this financial
year, which ends in September 1994. Some of the directors have not only been
paid big salaries - up to Pounds 400,000 - but are already taking their
pensions. Their payoffs are expected to be generous.

<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange board will today consider a proposal to create a
separately managed exchange with its own chief executive to handle trading
in the shares of smaller companies.
This 'Enterprise Market' would operate under the aegis of the main stock
exchange, which would retain control over certain of its activities.
The proposal, contained in a report from the stock exchange's smaller
companies working party, says that separate management is needed to
distinguish the companies with shares trading on the new exchange. The only
alternative would be to give the new exchange lower regulatory requirements.
The report will say that unless the new market has either separate
management or lighter regulation it will never be able to distinguish itself
from the main exchange and thus will have little reason for its creation.
The board could either approve the report in its entirety or reject some of
the recommendations. It will be released as a consultation document.
The question of governance is believed to be the most controversial aspect
of the proposed new market, intended as a successor to the Unlisted
Securities Market, which closed earlier this year.
Venture capitalists and others involved in the promotion of small companies
believe a less regulated market would never gain public confidence. Indeed,
they have proposed that the new market require more frequent trading
statements than the main exchange.
However, the stock exchange is said to be uneasy about ceding too much
authority to a separate body. Also, in the light of recent amendments to
stock exchange rules, making it easier for small or new companies to have
their shares traded on the Official List, the exchange is said to have been
sceptical about whether there was sufficient justification for the new
market.
The report was delayed by the illness of the committee's former chairman, Mr
Ian MacPherson, chairman of Low and Bonar. There were also internal
divisions, particularly between industry members and stock exchange
representatives. The report urges the creation of the Enterprise Market as a
distinct market under the aegis of the stock exchange. It is understood
requirements would differ little from those of the USM. The new entity would
embark on a marketing campaign to attract high growth companies.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Daily Mail issues non-voting shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Daily Mail and General Trust yesterday announced a bonus share issue of
non-voting shares in an attempt to increase liquidity in the stock.
The move responds to City concerns that the share price of around Pounds 116
was too 'lumpy', leading to thin trading and difficulty with screen formats.
The issue will be on the basis of nine non-voting shares for each voting and
non-voting share.
This will not alter the ownership of the DGMT with Lord Rothermere,
chairman, and family interests continuing to hold 50 per cent of the total
equity and 75 per cent of the voting shares.
It is highly unlikely that Lord Rothermere would ever change the voting
rules because he wants to ensure that family interests retain control.
Mr Peter Williams, finance director, acknowledged that the issue of such a
large number of non-voting shares was against recent trends towards
enfranchisement. He pointed out that shareholders had had a good run - since
1982 the value of the shares had increased by 1350 per cent.
DMGT, publishers of the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, also announced
annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 66.7m, up 74 per cent on the previous
year's restated figure, on turnover of Pounds 683.9m. Trading profit in the
year to October 3, before reorganisation and redundancy costs, increased by
Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 89.1m.
At Associated Newspapers, all three titles generated record advertising
revenue with the Daily Mail achieving a 15 per cent increase. Northcliffe
Newspapers, the regional publishing group, produced a modest increase in
trading profit. Euromoney Publications has already announced a 28 per cent
in pre-tax profits. But Whittle Communications, of the US, incurred a loss.
A final dividend of 112p makes a total of 148p, against 130p. Adjusted
earnings per share, before exceptional items, rose from 400.6p to 501.6p.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Go-ahead for Thorp welcomed by foreign customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government finally gave the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant the
go-ahead yesterday, ending nearly a year of controversy over the project.
The Pounds 2.8bn plant, which has taken nearly 10 years to build, is
designed to reprocess used nuclear fuel from reactors, extracting the
reusable uranium and plutonium.
Japanese and German power utilities, Thorp's main foreign customers, greeted
the decision with relief. Mr Kohji Kaneko, general manager of the Federation
of Electric Power Companies, said: 'We're glad that the government has
decided as we had hoped.'
Dr Thomas Roser, chief executive of the German Atomforum, the main lobby
group for the nuclear industry, said he welcomed the decision.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, told the House of Commons that
'there is a sufficient balance of advantage in favour of the operation of
Thorp'.
The decision, which settles one of the thorniest questions of industrial
policy facing the government, was immediately condemned by environmental
groups and opposition MPs. It now faces a final threat of judicial review
from Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group.
In rejecting calls for a public inquiry, Mr Gummer said he was satisfied
that there were 'no issues raised which would cause us to believe that
further consultation or debate is necessary'.
But the government told British Nuclear Fuels it would have to report each
year on plans to cut radioactive emissions.
Mr John Guinness, chairman of BNF, who yesterday 'warmly welcomed' the
decision, said: 'No other industrial activity has undergone such detailed
and wide-ranging public scrutiny over the past 16 years as Thorp. The plant
has faced three parliamentary debates, two public consultations, and intense
media coverage and analysis.'
Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat spokesman, said: 'Giving the go-ahead to
Thorp without an independent public inquiry is dangerously wrong,
undemocratic and possibly illegal.'

FT  16 DEC 93 / Upturn can withstand tax rises, Clarke says: Underlying
inflation rate at 26-year low of 2.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK economy is recovering strongly enough to withstand tax increases
planned over the next two years, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said
yesterday.
He told the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee that
recovery, helped by low interest rates and a 'spectacularly good' outlook
for inflation, was 'established and strong enough' to survive the planned
fiscal tightening.
His comments came as official figures showed the Treasury's preferred
measure of underlying inflation - the year-on-year rise in the retail prices
index excluding mortgage interest payments - falling to its lowest level for
26 years at 2.5 per cent last month, compared with 2.8 per cent in October.
The headline rate was unchanged at 1.4 per cent.
Although price pressures in the economy seemed 'pretty well under control',
he said the government would take no risks with inflation and would not
hesitate to raise interest rates should pressures start to pick up.
However, Mr Clarke said he was 'pretty confident that we will not get into
trouble' with the government's 1 per cent-4 per cent target for underlying
inflation 'in the near future'.
He said the real test of the government's policy would be keeping inflation
down and maintaining competitiveness once people believed economic recovery
was established.
Mr Clarke acknowledged that the cumulative taxation effect of the two
Budgets this year would amount to between Pounds 15bn and Pounds 17bn in
three years' time, or the equivalent of 7p on the basic rate of income tax.
He described the tax rises as necessary to bring public finances back in
order, adding that the way in which the revenue would be raised was
politically acceptable.
'The first thing I had to do was to make sure that we had taken the
necessary decisions to deal with the level of borrowing and the public
finances,' he said.
'I looked for increases in taxation which were best judged to be supported
by the general public and best judged to have minimum adverse impact on the
economy.'
Mr Clarke said he had no target level for sterling in mind as the government
set policy based on a range of monetary and asset value factors.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Aspin quits as US defence secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Les Aspin last night abruptly ended an often controversial tenure as US
defence secretary by submitting his resignation to President Bill Clinton.
Appearing with the president at the White House, Mr Aspin, citing 'personal
reasons', said it was 'time to take a break and undertake a new line of
work'.
Mr Clinton, who apparently did not seek the resignation, was lavish in his
praises of the 55-year-old Mr Aspin, the first member of his cabinet to
depart. His resignation takes effect on January 20, by when a replacement,
who is subject to Senate confirmation, is expected to be named.
Names which may be considered include Mr James Woolsey, head of the CIA,
Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Congressman Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma and
Admiral William Crowe, a close Clinton adviser and due to be the next US
ambassador to London.
The president commended the 'comprehensive review' of US military structure
Mr Aspin completed in September and which is designed to meet the needs of
the post-Cold War era.
Mr Aspin's health has been a source of concern all year. He underwent heart
bypass surgery this year and although he has claimed to have made a full
recovery his very heavy workload may have exacted a further toll. He has
also come under fire, along with Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of
state, and Mr Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, for failing
effectively to articulate US foreign policy.
More specific criticism has been directed at his refusal to approve a
request for more heavily armed equipment for US troops in Somalia, prior to
the disastrous Mogadishu firefight in early October which cost the lives of
18 US servicemen.
Mr Aspin also bore the brunt of implementing Mr Clinton's controversial
policy of ending the military's ban on homosexuals. This rendered him
unpopular with many senior serving officers, as did his restructuring of the
military's overall mission, which entails a substantial reduction in real
terms in defence spending over the next five years.
Two weeks ago Mr Aspin implied that defence cuts might have been too deep,
prompting budget director Mr Leon Panetta to doubt that additional funding
could be made available. There is, however, no hard evidence that this
intra-administration fight was a factor in his decision to leave.

tend to escalate beyond the levels budgeted.'

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Dorling Kindersley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market lathered itself into such excitement about Dorling
Kindersley's prospects that the scale of its disappointment has been
correspondingly great. After last year's flotation, the group's shares shot
up to a peak rating of 35 times historic earnings. An attractive illustrated
books business combined with the multi-media appeal of its trading
association with Microsoft made Dorling Kindersley a market darling. Now, a
second profits warning in as many weeks and the abrupt departure of its
managing director has dented that image. The present inability to quantify
the scale of the distribution difficulties at Tiptree adds a real edge of
nervousness given that 20 per cent of its sales go through the business. New
problems at its educational business indicate another worry.
Against that, the company's potential in multi-media remains intact and the
appointment of Microsoft's business development director to its board helps
shore up confidence. But how well the management resolves the dispute with
Tiptree may provide a good test of its competence to exploit opportunities
elsewhere.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Electricity generators
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In marking up PowerGen and National Power by 2 and 3 per cent respectively,
the market is assuming that Offer's latest intervention further reduces the
likelihood of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission reference. Though Offer
denies any direct pressure from Whitehall, the government is unlikely to
relish another inquiry into a privatised industry so soon after its awkward
experience with British Gas. Not only would that get in the way of the
government's plans to sell its remaining 40 per cent stakes; the outcome
would also be unpredictable, especially if the generators managed to have
the inquiry broadened. That may help explain why Mr Stephen Littlechild, the
regulator, couched his message in the form of an offer of a deal rather than
a threat.
It is difficult, though, to see him striking anything other than a weak
agreement with the generators. To stimulate competition would require plant
sales. Without such disposals, a switch in pricing mechanism may not make
much difference to pool prices. Yet Mr Littlechild stressed that plant sales
would be voluntary, as if he assumes the generators would happily cede
assets that might be used in competition against them.
The real shock for the equity market would be if these arguments prompted Mr
Littlechild to opt for a reference after all. National Power has
out-performed by 30 per cent this year, PowerGen by 50. In contrast to
British Gas, investors have never been inclined to fret about the
possibility of a reference.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sight of Viscount Rothermere blithely flouting the worldwide trend
towards share enfranchisement would normally induce fund managers to foam at
the mouth with apoplexy. Perversely, Daily Mail and General Trust's bonus
issue, which cuts the proportion of voting shares to total equity from 50
per cent to 5 per cent, was greeted with enthusiasm. Shareholders bought
into Daily Mail in the knowledge that the Rothermere family's voting power
would never be diluted. The scrip issue improves the liquidity of the stock,
which at Pounds 116 a share had grown too heavy.
Given the performance of the A shares, such equanimity is understandable. Mr
Rupert Murdoch's recent super share proposals for News Corporation are not
analogous. The Rothermere interests have no intention of expanding Daily
Mail's total equity base nor selling their allocation of A shares.
Moreover, Daily Mail's newspaper business is performing soundly and is
beginning to benefit from the patchy recovery in advertising spend. The
Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday have even been able to lift cover prices
without undue damage to circulation. The full year's numbers will be
depressed by heavy spend on the launch costs of new supplements and
investments in a rag bag of other media interests, ranging from GWR Radio to
a Hungarian provincial newspaper. But the company remains one of the
highest-rated newspaper groups. Its challenge is now to diversify into
fruitful areas without diluting its quality of earnings. It would do well to
match the success of Euromoney, where its initial investment of Pounds 6,000
in 1969 is now worth some Pounds 250m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Accounting Standards Board cannot be accused of taking the line of least
resistance. Its proposals on acquisition accounting have been barely watered
down during consultation, despite vigorous opposition from those with a
vested interest in promoting takeovers. Freedom to make provisions on
acquisition for all manner of anticipated costs has done much to encourage
unnecessary deal-making. Having enjoyed an accounting advantage over their
international competitors through the 1980s takeover boom, UK companies
might now find themselves worse off.
Still, acquisitions which depend on a favourable accounting treatment are
usually not worth making. The ASB is surely right that reorganisation costs
and anticipated losses should be charged to profits rather than buried in
the balance sheet. By sweeping away the layer of provisions with which
acquisitive companies mask performance, this approach can only be good for
transparency. It also ensures that all reorganisation expenditure is treated
the same way regardless of who makes it. Potential prey will no longer be at
a disadvantage, though companies which make excessive provisions in the
normal course of business should perhaps take these proposals as a shot
across the bows.
By restricting the scope for asset write-downs, the ASB will also reduce the
amount of goodwill arising from takeovers. But goodwill will not melt away
entirely. The next task for the standards-setters is deciding how it should
be treated. The option of writing off goodwill to reserves probably
encouraged the wilder abuses of acquisition accounting. Yet alternatives -
such as amortising goodwill over a fixed period or holding it in the balance
sheet subject to revaluation - face widespread opposition. Finding a
solution to that problem will be an even harder task for the ASB.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Doing good, despite themselves: Martin Wolf says the Gatt
deal will bring benefits to almost everybody, but getting there was too
difficult
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What will the Uruguay Round trade deal mean to the world economy?
There are two answers to this question: the first is that it should be a
very good thing, provided it is ratified. On balance, the agreement looks
even better than sensible participants might have hoped seven years ago when
the round was started in Punta del Este. The second answer is that nobody
knows precisely. That analysis is impossible rarely prevents economists from
attempting it, in this case at least in an excellent cause.
Official studies, sponsored by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, the World Bank and the Secretariat of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, have estimated the increase in global economic welfare
at between Dollars 213bn and Dollars 274bn in 1992 US dollars in 2002. That
would be between  3/4 and 1 per cent of gross global income at that time.
These estimates are almost certainly too low.
The estimate of Dollars 213bn, which appeared in a joint study by the OECD
and the World Bank published in May of this year, is based on the assumption
of a 30 per cent across-the-board reduction of all tariffs (and input
subsidies) on all commodities1. The estimate of Dollars 274bn comes from an
OECD study published this autumn, which assumes a 36 per cent global
reduction in tariffs and the trade-restricting effects of import barriers
for both industrial and agricultural products2. The results differ from the
first study, mainly because the calculations made for the latter paper
included cuts in industrial non-tariff barriers.
Somewhere in the middle comes a study by the Gatt Secretariat, published at
the end of November 1993, which estimates an aggregate income gain of
Dollars 230bn by 20053. What makes this study significant is that, unlike
the others, it is based not on hypothetical liberalisation, but on offers
made by trade negotiators by November 19 1993.
According to the Gatt Secretariat, those offers included:
An increase in the scope of bound tariffs on industrial products in
developed countries (that is, tariffs which cannot subsequently be raised,
except in special circumstances) from 78 to 97 per cent and in developing
countries from 21 to 65 per cent.
Offers of tariff reductions from developed countries covering Dollars 464bn
of their industrial imports out of the total of Dollars 612bn not already
duty free.
A doubling, from 20 to 43 per cent, in the proportion of developed country
merchandise imports entering duty free.
Trade-weighted average reductions of 38 per cent in the tariffs of developed
countries, from 6.4 to 4 per cent.
Smaller proportionate reductions in tariffs on textiles and clothing, the
most important industrial category for developing countries, at least
partially offset by a commitment to abolish the multi-fibre arrangement,
under which these imports are restricted by developed countries.
A 36 per cent overall reduction in the tariff equivalent of agricultural
barriers.
Market access commitments in agriculture that would make the proportion of
bound agricultural tariffs broadly the same as those for industrial goods
for the first time in the Gatt's history. Offers to liberalise imports of
services from 88 countries.
The best estimate of the benefits should come from the Gatt study, which is
based on actual rather than hypothetical offers to liberalise. But the final
market access agreements have ended up both more comprehensive and more
liberal than when the Gatt study was prepared a month ago.
There are four, still more fundamental reasons why even the Gatt study, like
the other two, underestimates the ultimate benefits of the round. First,
they ignore the stimulus to trade in services, already 21 per cent of world
trade; second, they do not take account of the benefits of a strengthened
set of rules and procedures, culminating in the agreement to establish a
World Trade Organisation; third, they assume that the status quo could have
been maintained if the Uruguay Round had failed; finally, they ignore the
dynamic benefits of a more competitive and integrated global economy.
The last is the fundamental point. As is shown in the chart, growth of world
merchandise exports has consistently led that of output. Over the whole
period between 1950 and 1991, the volume of total world exports grew 12
times, while world output grew six times. More startlingly still, the volume
of world exports of manufactures rose 23 times, partly because this is where
trade liberalisation was concentrated, while output grew only eight times.
It is impossible to prove that rapid growth of trade drove growth in output,
but cross-country experience supports that presumption. The rise of the east
Asian economies as a source of exports of manufactures, for example, ran
alongside their exceptionally rapid increases in real incomes. This success
has already made the region a third pole of world trade and world economic
activity, along with North America and western Europe (see chart). Because
they came to realise that a heavy tax on imports imposes a heavy tax on
exports, more than 60 countries, including erstwhile convinced
protectionists, announced unilateral market opening measures during the
course of the Uruguay Round.
According to the Gatt Secretariat, the success of the Uruguay Round might
make a 12 per cent difference to the volume of world trade in 2005,
increasing it by Dollars 745bn (in 1992 US dollars) over what it would be if
it had continued to grow at the average achieved between 1980 and 1991. The
largest increases in trade are projected to occur in clothing, textiles and
agricultural products, at present the most protected areas of world trade.
Assume that the relation between the expansion of trade and output that
existed over the whole postwar period continues until 2005. Under the
Secretariat's assumptions for trade, world exports would rise at 5 per cent
a year until 2005, which would be consistent with annual output growth at
3.5 per cent, as against 2.9 per cent without the Uruguay Round trade
expansion. Global economic output would then be some 8 per cent, or Dollars
2,000bn (in 1992 US dollars), higher by 2005 than it would otherwise be.
This may well be an overestimate, just as the calculations further above are
underestimates. But it may also be no further from the truth.
The important puzzle, however, does not concern the size of the gains, but
how difficult they are to achieve. In Gatt parlance, the trade
liberalisation that is the source of the gain is a 'concession' to one's
partners. The aim of clever negotiators is to minimise concessions, while
maximising those from others. As a result, the more successful is a country
in the negotiation game, the less it benefits.
This is why the most peculiar aspect of the gains is their distrubution. As
the chart shows, it is the European Union, Japan and European Free Trade
Area countries that are expected to have the largest proportional welfare
gains. How can that be? It is mainly because they are being forced to
liberalise in agriculture, precisely what they have tried hardest to avoid.
The Uruguay Round deal is an excellent thing, which will benefit almost all
participants in the long run. But if only there were a less agonising way of
persuading countries to abandon the protection that does them so much harm.

<TEXT>
It is too soon to say whether yesterday's remarkable joint declaration by Mr
Albert Reynolds and Mr John Major will lead to peace in Northern Ireland.
The prime ministers have produced a document which demonstrates that there
is no valid reason for a continuation of violence. The effectiveness of
their carefully-constructed argument will now be put to the test. It will
succeed if the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries are amenable to reason,
but fail if they continue to behave like mindless terrorists.
This was clear to everyone in both the British and Irish parliaments
yesterday. As Mr Major told the House, he cannot force the IRA to lay down
its arms; he can only urge it to do so. The Irish view is that, since the
loyalists say that their own violence is retaliatory, an IRA ceasefire
should lead to general peace. The initial reaction from Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, was 'disappointment', but it should study the
document further.
With Mr Reynolds, Mr Major has produced in a single declaration a summation
of the positions taken by both the British and Irish governments. The right
to self-determination of the inhabitants of the island, expressed separately
in the north and the south, is acknowledged. Irish nationalists have an
undertaking that if they manage to persuade a majority of Northern Ireland's
inhabitants to choose a united Ireland, the British government will accept
that.
Exploratory talks
Three months after disavowing violence as a means of struggle, and
persuading the IRA to lay down its arms, Sinn Fein would be invited to join
exploratory talks. As part of an overall political settlement Mr Reynolds is
ready to renounce his government's constitutional claim to the north. The
Ulster unionists are promised, for the umpteenth time, that no change in the
constitutional status of the province will be made without the consent of
its voters.
These propositions, wrapped in layers of reassuring phraseology, should in
all sanity constitute a helpful step towards peace. No entrenched position
is compromised, but a democratic path to the settlement of disputes is laid
down. The sense of hope that this engendered yesterday was reflected in the
House of Commons. The Labour leader, Mr John Smith, welcomed the document
'with enthusiasm'. Most backbench responses to Mr Major's statement were
congratulatory or friendly, give or take one or two doubting Tories.
Studied neutrality
Of particular significance is the fact that the most important unionist
leader, Mr James Molyneaux, was helpfully non-committal. Without his studied
neutrality, there could be no progress. The most recalcitrant unionist, the
Rev Ian Paisley, was predictably outraged. On the nationalist side, Mr John
Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said that the
Major-Reynolds paper was 'one of the most comprehensive declarations that
has been made about British-Irish relations in the past 70 years'.
This broad welcome should give the IRA much to ponder. The very
reasonableness of the Downing Street declaration, as yesterday's document
will probably be called, could further isolate the proponents of violence
within the republicans' natural constituency. Those in the US and
continental Europe who have expressed sympathy with Sinn Fein in its
struggle against British 'imperialists' should note Mr Reynolds's signature
alongside Mr Major's. As Mr Smith said yesterday, there was no excuse for
the bombing and shooting in the first place. Any shred of justification that
some might have clung to has now been stripped away.
Whether or not yesterday's initiative leads to a cessation of hostilities,
the two prime ministers fully deserve the praise that has been heaped upon
them. Both took a political risk when, in Dublin as in London, each assumed
responsibility for seeking peace in Northern Ireland. As Mr Major observed,
in a sharp response to Mr Paisley, this would be expected of any prime
minister. In doing his job, Mr Major has on this matter risen above the
mundane. He has shown persistence, courage and a fine grasp of detail.
Presenting the result to the House yesterday, he displayed these qualities
at their best.

Conclusion of the Uruguay Round is truly a triumph in adversity. Securing
agreement among so many countries on such a complex raft of trade agreements
frequently seemed an insuperable challenge in the past seven years. To have
done it at a time of sluggish growth, political uncertainty and
protectionist pressures is an extraordinary achievement.
Whatever the shortcomings of the result, the original vision of a broad
expansion of international trade law is now much closer to fulfilment. More
remarkably still, so is the dream that drove the founding fathers of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade: that of a liberal, rules-based
international trading system overseen by an authoritative world trade
organisation. Just as the Gatt helped foster economic integration and growth
in the postwar decades, the new agreement should provide powerful
underpinning for the world economy, fresh impetus to competition, and fresh
hope for those developing and former communist countries that have been
opening up to international commerce.
Several individuals deserve credit. Mr Peter Sutherland and before him Mr
Arthur Dunkel, Gatt directors-general, worked tirelessly to cajole
recalcitrants - especially the US and EU - into settling differences. Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, has dispelled the most serious
doubts about his and the administration's commitment to multilateral free
trade. Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, played a difficult
hand with consummate skill and, by luring France into the fold, arguably
saved the Union from a political crisis of alarming proportions.
Reduced danger
The importance of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round is essentially
threefold. First, as well as containing substantial tariff cuts, it promises
to bring large areas of trade that have up to now been 'outside the law' -
above all in farm produce, services and textiles - within Gatt disciplines.
Inclusion of farm trade, though incomplete, will reduce the danger of
international conflict over dumping of subsidised surpluses, reinforce
market-based agricultural reforms that are gradually being introduced in the
developed world, and give developing countries a better chance of exploiting
their comparative advantage as food producers. The accord on services -
though also not as far-reaching as hoped - begins the extension of rules to
the fastest-growing sector of world trade, and in theory could generate
gains as great as those stimulated by the establishment of multilateral
disciplines for manufactures more than 40 years ago. In textiles, gradual
phasing out of the protectionist Multifibre Arrangement will eventually
allow greater international competition and force overdue restructuring of
textile industries in the developed world.
Tougher protection
Second, the agreement will deliver tougher protection for intellectual
property rights, a source of increasing conflict between developed and
developing countries. Third, it provides for a significant elaboration of
rules designed to ensure that trade is fair as well as free. It promises
greater clarity concerning when and for how long countries will be permitted
to resort to 'safeguard' measures against imports, to impose anti-dumping
duties and to subsidise domestic industries. While this does not go as far
as intended in the previous draft Final Act of December 1991, the overall
aim has not in the end been fatally compromised.
All this is not to say that a brave new world of perfectly liberal trade is
at hand. Significant uncertainties remain concerning the trade policies of
the biggest players, the US and EU, with the former reaching all too readily
for unilateral instruments of 'managed trade' and the latter increasingly
following suit. At least one large, and rapidly growing, trading power -
China - remains outside the multilateral framework. Moreover, yesterday's
accord does not touch on emerging trade issues, from competition policy to
the environment, which will offer ample potential for conflict in future.
These matters will deserve urgent attention as soon as the ink from the
Uruguay Round is dry. Before that, however, the signatories should celebrate
a victory for the international rule of law, and concentrate on getting the
accord ratified and implemented.

RUSSIA 2010. WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE WORLD By Daniel Yergin and Thane
Gustafson Random House, Dollars 23, 300 pages
A book bearing this title gives rise to fears of a
teach-yourself-Russian-politics book with a little futurology thrown in. It
is not. It is an extraordinarily intelligent piece of work.
Daniel Yergin is author of The Prize, a compendious and exciting history of
oil, and of a revisionist history of the Vietnam War, Shattered Peace. Thane
Gustafson is a scholar whose published interests cover Soviet energy policy,
politics and the military. Together they have applied a level of experience
and acute judgment which raises Russia 2010 to the level - rarely attained -
of a book which qualifies for the accolade 'essential'.
Reading it while Russia's latest crisis roared in the background meant being
struck by the extent to which their framework could contain and explain
events whose precise nature they could not have forecast. There are mistaken
judgments - as when they predict, in one of their scenarios of the future,
that government control of the media helps squash a nationalist upsurge. One
recent lesson is that control, when exercised ineptly, causes a wave of
support for the media underdog, in this case Vladimir Zhirinovsky. But these
are minor shortcomings.
The American diplomat-scholar George Kennan, writing after the second world
war, said that, in trying to understand the Soviet Union, we tread 'the
unfirm substance of the imponderables'. Yergin and Gustafson illuminate
present imponderables by taking on the internally contradictory nature of
post-Soviet Russia. Freedom ushers in scope for a new despotism and strong
central control holds out the only chance for the rational working of a free
economy. While interviewing the leader of a neo-fascist movement calling
itself Liberal Democratic, I was grateful for an analysis which incorporates
paradox and the apparently enduring reality that truth in Russia includes
falsehood - and falsehood, truth.
Yergin's and Gustafson's aim is to 'apply scenario planning to the future of
Russia'. They believe that 'the collapse of communism stands as the most
important development for the entire world at the end of the 20th century'.
Their exercise is intended to overcome what Anthony Eden, former British
prime minister and victim of Suez, despairingly said was governments'
tendency to be 'always a lap behind, the fatal lap'. Thus the book contains
four scenarios outlining Russia's likely future.
The first scenario is the present 'muddling down', as the authors call it: a
weak central government, a continuing struggle for power and property,
relative freedom, fractious relations between the newly independent states
of the former Soviet Union which cannot live comfortably with each other but
cannot live without each other, soft budget restraints and demoralised
security forces. The prognosis is contradictory. It 'could lead to a Russian
version of the economic miracle (and) . . . it is fertile ground for
extremism' (as we have just seen).
The second scenario is called the 'two-headed eagle'. It is a reassertion,
up to a point, of central authority: a mildly authoritarian, rather than
extreme, reaction to chaos which threatens after an attempt to assassinate
President Yeltsin; order is re-established but this involves top-down
stimulation of a market economy; those running the state, while they lack
the pro-market zeal of Gaidar and the reformers, nonetheless quietly adopt
elements of their programme.
At least as persuasive a scenario, sadly, is the third - the 'time of
troubles: chaos and reaction'. A military junta takes over from the weak
president who succeeds a demoralised Yeltsin, and suppresses most free
institutions. Yet, because the junta has no long-run alternative, it resorts
again to the market, albeit one contained within a centralised,
nationalistic and authoritarian state framework.
The last scenario is the most fantastic. The authors call it the 'chudo', or
miracle. In this instance, a government which holds steadily to a pro-market
course, overcomes the political obstacles and safeguards a new class of
property owners and pro-market technocrats. 'By 2003 the Russian economy
begins growing at a 9 per cent annual rate,' suggest the authors, 'fuelled
by abundant manpower, resourceful Russian management, high and rising
personal incomes, natural resources and foreign capital.' For this outcome,
Russia has to navigate between the re-establishment of a strong state
controlling the 'market' (the Chinese model) and the disintegrative
tendencies in the 'muddling down' scenario. But there are few signs the
Russian authorities have the sophistication for this.
The authors also propose eight 'surprises' (mostly unpleasant) and sketch in
a western response, raising the final paradox, namely that the west is at
once marginal (in terms of direct influence) and crucial (in resources and
know-how) to Russia's development.
In international life - to quote the authors citing Kennan again - there is
'nothing final in point of time, nothing not vulnerable to the law of
change'. This book helps us understand the vulnerabilities of this century's
greatest problem child.

by evading the conditions'.

What a fickle world. It was only a few months ago that Dillons, part of the
once high-flying Pentos book retailing chain, took over Midland Bank's
splendid old headquarters in Birmingham and turned it into the UK's largest
bookstore outside London. Old banking hands saw it as another symbol of the
long-term decline of what used to be Britain's biggest bank. Now Midland is
bouncing back under new owners and Pentos, headed by ex-Midland chairman Sir
Kit McMahon, needs to reduce its borrowings.
Perhaps Midland should buy back its old headquarters and move out of London.
It would help distance Midland management from its interfering parent, HSBC
Holdings, and give the impression that it was returning to its original
roots in the Midlands. Just an idea.

One US congresswoman who is not going to be pleased with the UK government's
decision on the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant is Elizabeth Furse, an
Oregon Democrat.
No friend of the British nuclear lobby, she said recently that she didn't
want to face up to a failed nuclear proliferation policy and 'find that our
closest ally tripped us up'. Born in Kenya and brought up in South Africa,
she became a US citizen in 1972, growing grapes near Portland before she ran
for Congress last year. Much of her life has been spent campaigning for
migrant farm workers and American Indians, and against apartheid. But it's
her outspoken stance on nuclear power which will really upset some older
members of Britain's military brass.
After all, her father was an admiral in Britain's Royal Navy, as was her
grandmother, who founded the Wrens. So much for the traditions of the silent
service being handed down . . .

A quick post-mortem on the research output of some of the world's top banks
shows that even the bankers were as unprepared as the rest of us for the
outcome of last weekend's Russian elections.
Chemical Bank forecast, just two days before the vote, that 'pro-reform
deputies will dominate the new parliament'. At least it mentioned
Zhirinovsky as a 'political wild card'. Salomon was even more wrong-footed,
predicting as late as December 9 that 'reformist forces will place strongly
in the December 12 parliamentary elections'.
Even David Roche, Morgan Stanley's east European supremo, got it wrong. 'We
pusillanimously predicted either the constitution passes with a pro-reform
parliament, or it passes with a fudged parliament. None of us expected what
we have - a bloody awful parliament. None of us realised just how similar
Russia is to the Weimar Republic.'
Let's hope that Roche has got it wrong again.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Observer: Sino-Irish declarations?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Was it wise for Britain and Ireland to call yesterday's statement a joint
declaration? Given that Britain's last joint declaration - its 1984
agreement with China over Hong Kong - is now threatened, another form of
words might have been preferable.
Just like the Anglo-Irish accord, Hong Kong's was an attempt at squaring a
few circles. Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher said in 1984 that the joint declaration
 -guaranteeing Hong Kong 'a high degree of autonomy' under Chinese
sovereignty from 1997 - had 'brought our countries closer together. It has
increased our mutual understanding, respect and trust.'
You wouldn't have thought so yesterday, when China crossly rebuffed Hong
Kong's governor, Chris Patten. It described Patten's proposed electoral
reforms as having 'demolished the foundation of Sino-British co-operation' -
code for the joint declaration.
Another triumph bites the dust; no doubt Ian Paisley will have been watching
closely.

After 25 years of bloodshed, the provisional IRA has been offered the best
chance it may get to extricate itself from its campaign of violence. Some
among its leaders will be tempted to take it.
The joint declaration by the UK and Irish prime ministers, announced in the
wood-panelled splendour of the state dining room in Number 10 Downing
Street, does not square the circle between the fears of Northern Ireland's
unionists and the aspirations of its nationalists.
But then language, no matter how carefully crafted, cannot disguise the
realities which divided Ireland and then divided the community in the north
of that island.
Nobody looking at the history of Ulster since 1968 - stained by the killing
of about 3,000 people and littered with failed political initiatives - could
say confidently that Mr Major and Mr Reynolds have found the philosopher's
stone.
Nor could anybody listening to the thundering venom of Rev Ian Paisley,
leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, underestimate the hatred
and mistrust which seeps through the political pores of the province.
When men speak easily of blood and God in the same breath, the normal rules
of political judgment must be suspended. There are already mutterings of a
backlash by the Protestant paramilitaries against Mr Major's 'treachery'.
Then there is the IRA, an organisation which seems to have all but lost its
raison d'etre during the past 25 years in an ever more brutal and random
killing spree.
Behind the synthetic charm of Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of the IRA's
political wing, Sinn Fein, are terrorists who will find it hard if not
impossible to kick the habit of murder.
So it is not difficult for cynics to place the Downing Street accord among
all those other failed attempts to find a political solution to a tribal
war.
Even some of his cabinet colleagues are not quite sure whether the prime
minister has been naive in falling for what one described this week as the
'peace bandwagon'.
But Mr Major and Mr Reynolds believe that this time the public mood is
running in their favour. Even if the IRA cannot be coaxed quickly to the
negotiating table, there is an opportunity to break the acquiescence of the
law-abiding nationalist community upon which the gunmen depend.
Sinn Fein kept its counsel yesterday. But producing a document which won the
acquiescence of Mr James Molyneaux, the moderate Ulster Unionist leader, and
applause from Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour
party, which is mainly Catholic, was of itself no mean achievement.
The declaration is a tortuous document, showing all the awkward joins
inevitable in any paper subject to literally hundreds of hours of
word-by-word bargaining. Its central message, however, is relatively
straightforward.
Both the London and Dublin governments offer a guarantee that the unionists
in Northern Ireland will never be coerced into unification with the
republic. As part of an overall political settlement Mr Reynolds is ready to
renounce his government's constitutional claim to the north.
London, for its part, acknowledges it is neutral about the aspirations of
the Irish nationalists. It has no selfish, strategic or economic interest in
remaining in Northern Ireland. It will not stand in the way of unification
if a majority in the province so decides.
But the document is more than simply a synthesis of past public statements
or a rewriting of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. In his recognition of the
unionist veto, Mr Reynolds has become the first Irish prime minister to
accept publicly the reality of partition.
In return for the entrenchment of the constitutional guarantee for Ulster,
Mr Major has gone further than any British prime minister before him in
speaking the language of the Irish nationalists.
To take one sentence from the most hard-fought section of the statement:
'The British government agree that it is for the people of the island of
Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise
their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and
concurrently given, north and south, to bring about a united Ireland, if
that is their wish.'
The wording is deliberately labyrinthine. The demonology demanded it be so.
But the message is clear. In return for Mr Reynolds's implicit acceptance of
Irish partition, Mr Major has reinforced the studied neutrality of the
British government over the ultimate future of Northern Ireland.
The government will not join the ranks of the nationalist 'persuaders', but
nor will it stand against such persuasion. The door has been opened to those
in the Republican movement who want to exchange the bullet for the ballot
box. Sinn Fein could have a probationary place at the negotiating table
within three months of an end to violence.
British intelligence reports suggest there is a power struggle within the
IRA army council between those who want to end the terror campaign and those
who are determined to fight on. Neither Mr Major nor Mr Reynolds is sure
which side will come out on top.
Mr Molyneaux may find it hard to offer grudging support for the initiative
if Mr Paisley succeeds in his aim of mobilising hard-line unionist opinion
against the declaration. The Protestant gunmen lurk in the background.
The planned talks designed to shape a political settlement will be a
hazardous and protracted affair. There is no guarantee that the statements
of principle agreed by the two governments can be turned into new political
structures for Northern Ireland.
But Mr Major and Mr Reynolds joined yesterday in insisting that there was no
moral alternative to the course upon which they had embarked. Now it is up
to the IRA.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Unnerving aspect of fiscal policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN GRIEVE SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Detailed reading of the Budget Red Book raises questions about the
Treasury's conduct of fiscal policy which go much deeper than the pattern of
tax and expenditure changes which have taken the political spotlight. The
assumption seems to be that changes in taxation or expenditure do not affect
demand, output or employment, and that the pace of recovery is something to
be forecast, but not susceptible to human intervention.
It is unnerving that in a deep recession the Budget can take an extra Pounds
5.5bn out of the economy in an effort to reduce the public sector borrowing
requirement without consideration of effects on demand. It is also
symptomatic that neither the text nor the tables indicate any interest in
the level of unemployment: it is the one important economic variable not
forecast, merely assumed to remain virtually constant.
As Samuel Brittan commented (Economic Viewpoint, December 2), the Treasury
has reverted to the pre-Keynesian orthodoxy of the 1920s which had such
disastrous results. To have held such views then may be excusable, but to
shrug off any responsibility for demand management today amounts to
professional incompetence.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pouring cold water on hopes of boom
for oil supertankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From K D SHILLETO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is to be hoped that potential investors in oil tanker shares will
take any prospectus offering a bright future with a supertanker of salt
('Hopes launched of uplift in tanker shipping', December 9). The tanker
business has only 'boomed' since the second world war as a result of major
conflict: Korean war, first Suez, second Suez, etc. Normal standards of
supply and demand are irrelevant to it.
A new VLCC (very large crude carrier), the crude oil workhorse, costs
Dollars 90m to build and requires a daily hire of Dollars 40,000 over 10
years to make a reasonable profit. Current hire, in an admittedly unusual
seasonal dip in freights, stands at about Dollars 12,000. It has not once
been above Dollars 30,000 a day for any period in the past 20 years.
Wherein lies the sudden enthusiasm for public subscription? That so many
existing VLCCs reach 20 years of age between now and 1997 while the
replacement programme of new vessels remains unsatisfactory is insufficient
reason to anticipate higher freight rates, unless it is assumed that another
Exxon Valdez occurs and in a place where it is noticed - the Florida coast,
Cote d'Azur or Yokohama Bay.
Relying on knee-jerk public and government reaction to ban old tankers after
such an event seems a somewhat casino approach to investment, but that's the
only way profit will accrue. If there is no Exxon Valdez repeat, old tankers
will continue to trade at freight rates the new cannot match.
Scrapping of ageing VLCCs has resumed this autumn after a lull, but a
notional overall surplus of tonnage still exists in the market. Increased
scrapping in 1984 will bring balance almost within grasp if the world
recession fades and oil consumption growth re-sumes.
Meantime a growing number of economists believes the oil industry has
peaked. Gas is taking ever more of the energy market and, unlike oil, it is
not flexible. Markets lost to gas are lost for 20 years, or until the gas
runs out.
The truth is that old salts in the tanker business smell the possibility of
a boom, want to be part of it but cannot make the figures fit to a banker's
eye. Caveat emptor. Or leave it to the professionals.

<TEXT>
Sir, In 'Electronics sector warned of 27,000 job losses' (December 7), you
quote a report stating that Scotland's electronics industry is too reliant
on manufacturing, which is likely to be lost to lower cost competitors. The
picture is not that bleak. While UK-based R&amp;D and marketing must play a
bigger role if we are to become serious global competitors, UK manufacturing
does not need to rely solely on cost.
In the personal computer industry, lead time and benefits of manufacturing
within a day's journey of the customer outweigh the cost penalties. All the
leading PC manufacturers serving the European market manufacture in Europe,
many in Scotland. In our view, they will continue to do so.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Don't be so down on jam today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is the best way that the British economy can take advantage of the
opportunities opened up by the Gatt accord and rise to the challenges of
more competition, which are an essential part of the exercise?
There is one answer, which is tempting to the economic elite, among whom
there is a consensus that the British people consume too much and are
undertaxed. One sees this in City circulars, hears it from Treasury
officials and finds it in the conclusions of learned articles. It unites
much economic opinion across sectarian lines. The view is upheld by
monetarists and Keynesians, Labour and Conservative economists, and many
independent analysts who have studied national incomes estimates of
different countries.
The case is superficially attractive for those who think that there is
something wrong with a country that is different from the international
average, or has changed its own behaviour. The top graph shows UK
consumption, both private and government, as a ratio of GDP.
There was a temporary bulge in the consumption ratio around the 1974
election at the time of the miners' strike, the three-day week and the oil
price explosion. One likely reason is that the wage explosion, following the
breakdown of the Heath pay policies, temporarily boosted real pay. After
reaching a low point in the late 1970s, following the Labour government's
pay policies and the restrictive fiscal and monetary policies associated
with the IMF credit, the consumption ratio gradually recovered during the
Thatcher years, and then really shot up during the recession years which
followed her departure. (It is important to be clear that we are talking
about ratios. Private consumption actually fell between 1990 and 1992. But
it rose as a proportion of a shrinking or stagnant GDP because fixed
investment and stock-building shrank even more.)
If we take a cross section instead of a historical look, a similar picture
emerges. The total consumption ratio has always been higher in the UK than
that of either the Group of Seven or the European Union average; and the gap
has widened - the overall consumption ratio is at about 87 1/2 per cent in
the UK, compared with about 80 per cent in these other groups.
What is supposed to be so wrong with a relatively high consumption ratio?
The argument is that, if it could be lowered, there would be more resources
set free for investment and exports. The result, according to this
mainstream view, would be improved competitiveness, faster growth and a
better balance of payments. The motto of this school is the Queen's in Alice
Through the Looking Glass: 'Jam tomorrow and jam yesterday - but never jam
today.'
The objections to the anti-consumption thesis are on several different
levels. Too many macro-economists, who ac-knowledge that they cannot guess
the fortunes of specific industries, enjoy instead playing with big building
blocks like consumption and investment which enhances their own job
satisfaction. But they still mistake the role both of government and of
economic analyst.
The government's role is to provide those goods and services that are judged
to be better provided collectively than through the market and to execute
transfers between citizens. On the macro-economic side, it is to support an
adequate non-inflationary growth of demand and to keep its own budget in
order - which will not always mean an exact balance. The distribution of the
national income, between consumption, investment, exports, stock-building
and so on, is the business of people and companies. It is not one that the
government should make for them or that it has shown any aptitude for doing
in practice.
I do not want to deny that the UK consumption ratio is too high, but to
declare an aggressive agnosticism. When the gap between actual and potential
output has been eliminated, growth is back to trend rates and the normal
level of overseas capital inflows has been established, we will learn by
observation what the sustainable consumption ratio is, without the
government doing anything directly to bring it about, except to put its own
house in order.
Nor is there any reason to suppose that governments are very good at
improving performance by forced savings and investment. In the former
communist world, investment and savings ratios were far higher even than the
Japanese ones, but this did not prevent their economies from becoming basket
cases.
Even a crude look at the charts suggests that the supposed relation between
economic progress and a low consumption ratio is highly fallible. The US,
for instance, has a higher private consumption ration than the UK. But its
growth rate has been consistently as high as, or higher than, Europe's since
1975, or during any reasonable sub-period in the intervening years. (UK
experience has been too dominated by the last recession to be much of an
indicator on its own.)
These observations are supported by a thorough econometric study entitled Is
Fixed Investment the Key to Economic Growth? by Blomstrom, Lipsey and Zejan
(Centre for Economic Policy Research). The authors accept some modest
correlation between growth rates and the share of fixed capital formation in
GDP. But they then go on to examine successive five-year periods between
1965 and 1985 in 100 countries, and they find far more evidence that
increases in growth precede rises in rates of capital formation, rather than
the other way round. In other words, high investment ratios reflect high
growth rates rather than cause them. This study, of course, is not the only
reason for being sceptical of the anti-consumption school, but it is useful
to have support from a sledgehammer regression analysis with no economic axe
to grind.
Let us suppose, however, that we accept the anti-consumption analysis. What
can the government - that blessed abstraction - do about it? Not all that
much. It can raise the tax burden and devote the proceeds to cutting the
budget deficit. It has indeed carried out at least part of the prescription.
Taxation and social security contributions as a proportion of GDP (excluding
the North Sea sector) are expected to rise from a recession low of 34 1/4
per cent in 1993-94 to 38 1/2 per cent by 1998-99. By the late 1990s the
projected ratio will be nearly 4 percentage points higher than the level at
which it was running during the last year of the last Labour government.
Moreover, much of the increase will come in the next two financial years.
The talking classes who proudly proclaim at dinner parties that they are not
being taxed enough will soon not know what has hit them.
But the strategy could backfire. An attempt by the government to increase
the national savings ratio by raising taxes may not lead to more private
investment at all. If the result is a slower recovery of demand and output,
there may easily be less investment as a result. There is a danger that the
over-contractionary pair of British budgets introduced in 1993 will have
this effect. One can only hope the Gatt accord will offset this contraction
by boosting 'animal spirits' - which means that there will be a higher rate
of investment for a given level of final demand.
An increase in intended savings may thus not boost investment. On the other
hand, an increase in investment does not always require an increase in
domestic savings, if it is mirrored by overseas capital inflows. In a
rational world, savings are determined by people's preferences between
present and future consumption; and investment upsurges are financed by
tapping world savings and not merely the domestic variety.
Adam Smith said: 'Consumption is the sole end of all production . . . The
maxim is so perfectly self-evident that it would be absurd to attempt to
prove it.' Yet some late 20th century economists have tried to forget it.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Much scope for UK in Delors proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICK MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The government's initial response to the Delors white paper on the
economic regeneration of Europe is disappointing. In its proposals for
infrastructure investment ('Paper calls for big new investments in
'info-highways' and infrastructure', December 8) the white paper offers the
potential for a prosperous future based on a competitive European economy.
The white paper contains plans for the development of a common European
information area, a concept that was set out at the Copenhagen summit in
June.
The plans represent a much-needed response to the US proposal to create a
national information infrastructure and the Japanese intention to build a
telecommunications network that will enable them to make the most effective
use of information in the next century.
What makes the government's response so disappointing is the fact that
Britain would benefit more than most European countries from the investment.
Not only does Britain have some of the strongest telecommunications
companies, it also accounts for the largest part of the information services
sector in Europe.
In the 19th century, Britain had the vision to invest in the development of
a railway network. It is ironic that, at the end of the 20th century,
short-term preoccupations are preventing the government from responding to a
similar need for investment in the information infrastructure.

film
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COLIN ROSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Nigel Andrews's review of the film The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb
(December 9) contains an allegation against the BBC which has no basis in
fact.
'Having funded the project,' says Mr Andrews, 'Auntie then shelved it in
horror until the film got loose and started to win festival prizes.'
I commissioned The Secret Adventures as a development of a 10-minute pilot
film made in-house at BBC Bristol, and I maintained a close relationship
with it through script development, production and post-production.
In June, I accompanied the production team to the film's premiere at the
Annecy Animation Festival and shared their pleasure at its enthusiastic
reception.
We are very pleased with the film and at no point has it been 'shelved'. It
was always intended for a prominent transmission placing, and, having waited
just six months for an appropriate slot in the schedules, it will be
broadcast on BBC 2 at 9.30pm on December 23.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Arts: Playboy of the West Indies - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plays do not cause riots like they used to. At the opening of The Playboy of
the Western World in Dublin in 1907, the cast sent a telegram to WB Yeats
saying 'play great success'. At the end of the performance, there was a
second telegram: 'Audience broke up in disorder'.
Quite why the audience should have reacted in that way to JM Synge's macabre
comedy is hard to understand today. Possibly it was because it took a few
pot shots at Irish mythology. The characters make a hero out of a man who
kills his father: then it turns out that the father is not quite dead, the
son tries again, still cannot quite bring it off, and in the end father and
son go off happily together. In a word, atavism. Pity we do not have a few
Synges around in 1993, poking fun at the IRA.
It was a brilliant idea to transplant the original piece from Ireland to the
Caribbean. Mustapha Matura's Playboy of the West Indies is not new. The
production at the Tricycle is a revival to celebrate the 10th anniversary of
the play's first performance at the same theatre. And what a joyous work it
is]
Matura's version remains remarkably faithful to the old Playboy. Many of the
lines are identical. Synge specialised in catching the speech rhythms of
English spoken by Irish; Matura does exactly the same with English spoken by
West Indians. Note the way how people speaking in a dialect tend to fall
into it more deeply when talking to their own kind. The dialect becomes a
language in its own right. The Tricycle programme includes a glossary which
tells you, for example, that 'san-e-man-e-teh' means 'without humanity'.
Clearly the original settlers were not all English.
There is no great problem in adjusting the geography. Where the patricide in
the original is offered a ticket to the western states to get him out of the
way, here the ticket is from Trinidad to Venezuela - just across the water.
Everything else falls into place. The Irish like racing; so do the
Trinidadians. There is a background of colonialism, and also a contrast
between those who live in towns or villages and those who live in the
country. In these island cultures there is a similar belief in ancient,
perhaps surviving, gods.
The direction is by Nicolas Kent just as it was 10 years ago. He avoids
social comment, but teems with social observation. The Tricycle nowadays
tends to have excellent casts: see especially Cecilia Noble as Peggy (Pegeen
in the original) and Cyril Nri as Ken. It has very good sets as well,
designed this time by Adrianne Lobel. She provides a wonderful rum bar,
which is where the action takes places. This is a production worth going out
of your way to see.

ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS (PG) Mel Brooks
CINEMA PARADISO: THE SPECIAL EDITION (PG) Giuseppe Tornatore
KING OF THE HILL (12) Steven Soderbergh
DESPERATE REMEDIES (15) Stewart Main and Peter Wells
This is a time of year that begins with great questions of life, death and
religion and ends with an entire hungover hemisphere clutching onto trivia.
By Boxing Day, the Western world's enquiring mind has usually slid from
'What does Christ's birth mean to us?' via 'Is commerce spoiling Christmas?'
to that final all-parties SOS: 'What do we do with the turkey leftovers?'.
Sprinkle it with metaphor, though, and even that last question can provide
food for thought: especially for the world's movie division. What do
directors do with all the stuff they cannot find room for in a movie's
Version I? Sometimes, as in Cinema Paradiso: The Special Edition, it is used
as re-launch material. The studio cellars are swept for missing footage;
once-plucked scenes, even whole subplots, are grafted back on; and lo] an
arthouse favourite is back in bigger, perhaps better, form.
Then again - worst news first - there are films that consist entirely of
turkey leftovers: unimproved and unreconstructed. Mel Brooks's Robin Hood:
Men in Tights is a scarce-warmed-over spoof on the Sherwood Forest movies
that came and went two years ago. This is a long time between source
material and mickey-take - two years hence do we get Christopher Columbus:
Crackpot in Codpiece? - but it is just one lateness among many. What dismays
is that time and fashion continue their erosion of Brooks's talent to
surprise and outrage. Yet even after Spaceballs and Life Stinks he is still
hitting us with the same old jokes like a jester who has lost control of his
bladder.
We end on a gag about black sheriffs (see Blazing Saddles). We begin with a
whole lot of gags about movie-making (see Blazing Saddles): from the Saxon
villagers complaining that their cottages are torched whenever a new Robin
Hood film is made to the white-lettered 'England' sign perched
'Hollywood'-style on the cliffs. And in between we feel like starved
house-guests being led through a larder full of mouldy offcuts, gnawed bones
and corn-fed funny names. There is Will Scarlet O'Hara, Rabbi Tuckman
(Brooks), the Sheriff of Rottingham and Marion of Bagel, named to match
Robin of Locksley. (Lox? Bagel? Get it?) As for Robin's black friend from
the crusades, guess what everyone says whenever the name Ah Choo is
pronounced.
Let us be quick and merciful. I liked two jokes, maybe three: the
horse-lock, the brink-of-battle exchange between Robin and his Merry Men
('Are you with me, yea or nay?'; 'Which one means yes?') and Dom DeLuise's
turn as a Brando-style Mafia godfather. And let us pat Cary Elwes's Robin on
the back for looking handsome and heroic and seeming gamely unembarrassed by
the jokes.
If Robin Hood: Men in Tights is a turkey pre-dismembered by its own
director, Cinema Paradiso: The Special Edition is a nobler-looking bird, but
not without its own odd history of dissection. It seems fresh and
all-of-a-piece now; but we know that once-missing bits have been stuck back
on while we were not looking. You recall the plot. Young Toto grows up in
Southern Italian village; falls in love with movies and befriends old
projectionist (Philippe Noiret); gets to be played by three different actors
(Salvatore Cascio, Mario Leonardi, Jacques Perrin).
The film's first version, we now learn, dumped an entire romantic coda in
which greyhaired Perrin re-meets the lost girl of his dreams, now grown into
actress Brigitte Fossey. Restored, these scenes plump the film out to 2 3/4
hours, inject some emotion into the hitherto stick-like Perrin (he could do
with still more) and makes the story in all senses 'grow up'. If the earlier
film was a retarded, runaway charmer that never recovered from the
disappearance of Toto 1 - chipmunk-faced scene-stealer Master Cascio - the
new film dares to bring in subjects like Sex, Age and Disenchantment.
Indeed the restoration of two hitherto excised love-making scenes adds a
whopping irony to the whole Cinema Paradiso history. The first movie, you
recall, made rude noises about Catholic censorship in the character of a
priest who insisted on removing all kissing scenes from the films shown in
the village. The film's pay-off was that old Noiret had collected them,
spliced them together and saved them as a deathbed gift for the grown-up
Toto.
Now we learn that Cinema Paradiso 1 was itself 'unsexed': if not through
Catholic prudishness, then through a sentimental desire not to let Toto be
seen losing his innocence. The new version allows the middle Toto (Leonardi)
to wrestle with the agonies/ecstasies of adolescence, from deflowerment on
the cinema floor (with the village's ageing goodtime lady) to a touchingly
surreal chat session with the image of his beloved, her face caught on his
movie-camera and projected on his bedroom wall.
An opening title-crawl lists the startling number of prizes this movie has
won. It also came top in a British newspaper's recent poll of the Ten Best
Films since 1980. But now we have two Cinema Paradisos, so what will future
polls make of that? The two movies, far from being pocket- and family-size
versions of the same drama, seem like two different creations. Both are
good, but Cinema Paradiso 2 looks more like the masterpiece for the
history-books.
If you wore a blindfold through the credits of King of the Hill (opening
next week), you would swear on removing it that you were watching a film
directed by Robert Redford. Here is a young Depression kid (Jesse Bradford)
growing up in St Louis, amid images washed in radical humanism with a cupful
of 'Nostalgia' fabric-softener throw in. One almost hears the director's
voice. 'Actors in their places] Insert golden lens-filters] Action]'
Actually the director is Steven Soderbergh, whose career took off with the
prize-winning sex, lies and videotapes and then nosedived with the
unreleased Kafka which almost no one has seen. (I have seen it and can
confirm its strange bastard identity: part Gothic thriller, part existential
whimsy, part film crew's holiday in Prague.)
King of the Hill is clearly Soderbergh's bid to get his career flying again.
But it bellyflopped on take-off in America and we see why. Too anxious to
please, too cutie-pie-elegiac, it resembles Billy Bathgate without the
gangsters, or possibly A River Runs Through It without the river. Drawn from
the memoirs of AE Hotchner, quondam Hemingway crony, it provides the peeling
boarding house, the feckless inventor Dad (Jeroen Krabbe), the
long-suffering asylum-bound Mom (Lisa Eichhorn), the mocking dog-day
afternoons of the 1930s, and the boy-hero who scampers about town using his
wits to bamboozle and breadwin.
No turkey leftovers on screen here; nothing so luxurious. Culinary tips
range from stolen hot dogs to tomato soup made from mixing ketchup with hot
water. But we never feel all this poverty. Suffering so pretty, sacrifice so
gift-wrapped, down-and-out supporting characters so cocky and colourful -
with a Depression like this why did that spoilsport Mr Roosevelt come in
with a New Deal?
Also bowing in British cinemas next week is Desperate Remedies. Order the
video now. The big screen is too big for this studio-bound, one-joke
mockudrama, in which two New Zealand directors, Stewart Main and Peter
Wells, take the cliches of romantic fiction and try to flog them to the
finishing post. But just like the joke 'horse' ridden by the
streaming-haired heroine - a wooden stand-in nag - the film makes a feint of
galloping comically along but never really seems to leave the starting post.
There are swirling fog-wreathed sets, a handsome hunk of a hero (Kevin
Smith) and much campy dialogue ('We are all strangers in this land called
love'). But the wit never keeps up with the invocations. Pity. A lovely
target - all that effulgent costume twaddle from Gainsborough movies to
Cartland novels - still waits to receive its well-aimed arrows.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Arts: Sumi Jo - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sumi Jo's star is very much in the ascendant - front-rank opera houses
(Covent Garden among them) are competing for her services, leading record
companies are assiduously recording her, and, in London at least, the public
has fallen sufficiently prey to her charms to fill the Wigmore Hall on
Tuesday for her first song recital.
Both in the matter of presence and in exhibition of her exquisitely
cultivated soprano - with notes pearly-pure, exactly fashioned and placed,
and strung together with the most delicate art - the tiny Korean has up to
now made perhaps her strongest impression as the doll in Offenbach's Tales
of Hoffmann. At more than one moment during this recital, I began to wonder,
indeed, whether it were not being delivered, in character, by the Jo
Olympia: for, much of the time, the delivery had a curiously mechanical
quality.
All trace of human emotion and involvement was carefully expunged; all the
chosen music was delivered, simply and insistently, in terms of display.
This worked best, therefore, in the coloratura-canary display-items, such as
Arditi's Il bacio, in the first half, and the Shadow Song from Meyerbeer's
Dinorah, in the second. These were pealed off by Miss Jo with expertly
schooled facility and no less expertly supported by Malcolm Martineau, her
patient, tactful pianist. The skitterings-about high above the staff were
prettily done, the echo-imitations well placed; without being patronising,
one easily sensed that hereabouts the singer was on firmest, most secure
artistic footing.
But when it came to the songs by Rossini, Debussy and Strauss, her inability
to contrive a single shade, nuance or punctuation-point of anything that
could be appreciated, let alone described, as 'personal response' made for a
severe limitation on listening pleasure. Words were regularly turned into
mush, whether Italian, French or German; the notion that (for instance) in
Debussy's settings of Verlaine poems the verbal images might require equal
attention to the musical seems not to have entered Miss Jo's head.
In sum, a bizarre experience: I felt badly in need of Hoffmann's
rose-coloured spectacles in order to enjoy it the more.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Arts: Ayckbourn's Wildest Dreams - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the themes of Alan Ayckbourn's comedies is power: the power that some
people have over others, within a tight little nexus of neighbourhood
relationships. The power may be wielded generously and without malice - even
unconsciously; but upon those who fall under its influence its effect is
terrible. In Wildest Dreams (1991), now reaching London for the first time,
it is the newcomer Marcie who at once exerts her sympathetic and inquisitive
influence upon a group of four people. Manically ingratiating, tremendously
keen, and wholly fixated on whoever she is talking to, she has, within days,
changed all four lives - irrevocably.
These four are Stanley and Hazel Inchbridge (childless, in their early
middle age, sharing a house with Hazel's mini-Hitler brother Austen), Warren
(a lonely teenage boffin, convinced that he is a humanoid alien) and Rick
(an introvert in her early 20s, abused in the past by her mother's lover and
then left by both him and her mother). What links them is their weekly
meetings to play The Game.
This board game involves them in role-playing in a sub-Tolkien fantasy which
unites the four of them against the world (but into which Marcie enters
wholeheartedly for a while). This shared fantasy is one of Ayckbourn's most
wonderful comic constructions: ludicrous but dreadfully credible. And Marcie
herself is another of his master-strokes. She really is an alien; and we
never understand her.
But her four friends we quickly understand only too well; and some of
Ayckbourn's finest writing goes into entering their unhappy private worlds.
His most novel and least comic conception is Rick: butch and vulnerable,
probably lesbian but powerfully susceptible to male dominance. Her first
encounter with Marcie's husband is an extraordinary scene, in which he all
too easily slips into the role of the abusive patriarch who bullies and
molests her. Rick, like Stanley and Warren, falls in love with Marcie. Yet,
even though she comes far closer to Marcie than the men, she too is taken
over by her.
Everything else Ayckbourn visits with his characteristic blend of
psychological penetration and sociological satire. Hazel (who during the
play suffers the breakdown that so many of this playwright's married women
do) has a marvellous attack of depression early in the play: 'I sometimes
catch myself staring at myself in that bathroom mirror and I think - what
have you done with that body, Hazel? . . . Look at it. Shrivelling and
drooping and wasting away - covered in brown spots and warts and wrinkles
and what use have you ever made of it? Nothing . . .'
There are passages, especially in the later stages of the tale of Hazel and
Stanley, that feel too close to Ayckbourn formula; and the ending, though it
has poetic justice, lacks the dramatic tension that rules the first
three-quarters of the play. But, though there are umpteen ingredients
identifiable from other Ayckbourn, most of them do not feel familiar as you
watch.
Two features of this London staging have particular importance. One is that
this is the first time the RSC has performed an Ayckbourn play. The other is
that the play is being performed in The Pit, the auditorium that (among
London's theatres) most closely resembles the Stephen Joseph
Theatre-in-the-Round in Scarborough, for which Ayckbourn creates his plays.
All the cast do excellent work. Brenda Blethyn (Hazel), Barry McCarthy
(Stanley) and Peter Laird (Austen) create in detail the awful truths of the
Inchbridges' home. Gary Whitaker slightly forces Warren's boyish
unworldliness. As Rick, Jenna Russell is outstanding, playing this
untheatrical and subdued character with utter objectivity.
Playing the vivid humanoid Marcie, Sophie Thompson excels herself. She has
here an appalling nervous energy, and a whole musical inventory of nervous
laughs: scales and arpeggios upward or downward, mini-trills, and staccati
on one note. It is this nervousness which makes Marcie so alarmingly real.
How can someone so unrelaxed invade other people's lives and overwhelm them?
Yet she can, and does. 'And,' as Clement Crisp would say, 'we believe.'
At the Pit, 071-638-8891, until March 12; then transferring to the Swan
Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.

FT  16 DEC 93 / People: Raid on Paribas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss Bank Corporation and Union Bank of Switzerland have raided the London
ranks at Paribas, the French bank, as part of their efforts to boost their
presence in the buoyant fixed-income market.
Stephen West, who has run the Eurobond syndicate desk at Paribas for the
past seven years, has joined SBC where he will be co-head of the
fixed-income syndicate desk with Jonathan Vellacott.
The 34-year-old's appointment is part of SBC's ambition to re-establish
itself in the primary side of the ever-expanding Eurobond market, where the
volume of new issues has jumped to nearly Dollars 400bn this year from
Dollars 269bn last year.
In the early 1980s SBC was among the top 10 Eurobond underwriting houses but
it has slipped to around 15th position as a result of its decision to give a
higher priority to developing its derivatives business.
Meanwhile, four prominent members of Paribas's emerging markets team have
defected to UBS. They include Tom Priday, head of new issues and
syndication, Paul Crean, head of sales, Nick Blakey, trading, and Alexander
Mitcheson-Smith, research.
UBS has also appointed John Giannotti to its debt and treasury division as
head of origination in Europe; he joins from Bankers Trust International.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Technology: Ships bridge the danger gap - Andrew Fisher
concludes a series on transport safety with an investigation into
innovations that may help prevent sea disasters and give clues to their
causes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On an April night in 1991, an Italian car ferry, the Moby Prince, ran into
an oil tanker outside the port of Livorno and 140 people died in the blaze.
It was Italy's worst maritime disaster since the second world war. The crew
of the tanker, the Agip Abruzzo, survived. But the radio messages sent by
Moby Prince went unheeded, both by other ships in the vicinity of Livorno -
the accident occurred 2.5 miles out to sea - and on land. One sailor
escaped, but the passengers and the rest of the ferry crew died - the
lifeboats had been burned and the sea was covered in blazing oil.
The Italian courts are still trying to decide what happened and who was
responsible - many on shore and at sea were watching a televised football
match.
The judges are faced by a seemingly inexplicable tangle of negligence and
even possible sabotage. Evidence of explosives was found on the ferry, whose
victims were not discovered until the following day.
Fortunately, tragedies like this are uncommon. But they do emphasise the
need for the speedier introduction of advanced technologies and systems on
shore and at sea not only to prevent loss of life, damage and pollution, but
also to establish the cause of accidents.
Most accidents do not make headlines. Another that did was the sinking of
The Herald of Free Enterprise, a UK ferry, off the Belgian coast in 1987
with the loss of 193 lives. Oil-polluting incidents, such as the grounding
of the Exxon Valdez tanker in Alaska waters in 1989 or the sinking of the
Braer off the Scottish coast a year ago, also gain worldwide attention.
Because not all incidents are reported, statistics may understate the level
of casualties. Last year, 246 people were killed or missing at sea and 213
ships lost, according to Lloyd's Register. In 1991, lives lost were much
higher at 1,204, with vessel losses at 258.
Since the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster, in which the hold flooded
rapidly when the cargo door was not shut, tougher international regulations
are being introduced on internal strength and stability in case of damage
for roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) vessels.
Because of their cavernous cargo capacity, ro-ros - especially older ones -
can become dangerously unstable if not properly handled. There is no
evidence that the Moby Prince was defective. But it is proving hard to find
out what really happened. Captain Profeta Brandimarte, a marine consultant
involved in the investigations, says the response has been blank - 'no one
saw, heard or did anything'.
The investigation would be helped considerably if the ships had been fitted
with a recording device, similar to an aircraft's black box. The mystery of
the Derbyshire, a bulk carrier which sank in a typhoon off Japan 13 years
ago with the loss of 44 lives might also be capable of solution if the
events leading up to its disappearance were available on tape; no trace of
the ship was found.
Black boxes, or voyage event recorders - much bigger than those on aircraft
and able to float free - are among the array of advanced technological
equipment being introduced on worldwide fleets and on shore. Others include
electronic charts, one-man bridges, databases on the condition of ships (for
use by port authorities) and vessel traffic systems in busy areas like the
English Channel and Straits of Singapore.
Malek Pourzanjani, head of research at Southampton Institute's maritime
division, is a firm advocate of VTS. 'This is the way forward - local VTSs
are emerging and being formed into regional and perhaps national and
international centres.' Under forthcoming EU rules, vessels entering
European waters will be required to radio their approach and route ahead of
their arrival to make it easier for authorities to monitor their movements.
Since nearly all the world's cargoes go by sea, maritime safety is of
concern to most governments. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO),
a United Nations body based in London, is responsible for drawing up safety
and pollution conventions. But it is the 147 member countries which are
responsible for enforcing them.
Some are more effective than others. With more shipowners moving to cheaper
foreign flags and crews, implementing conventions such as Solas on safety
and Marpol on pollution has become harder.
Flag state control, in which governments control vessels flying their flag,
does not always work. Hence the increasing emphasis on port state control,
in which the port authorities do the job.
Apart from the proliferation of flags and ship classification societies  -
there are around 50 of the latter - another problem is the increasing age of
the world fleet. The shipping industry has had a rough time as a result of
over-capacity and the failure of freight rates to provide adequate returns.
This discourages new building and leads to vessels being kept in service for
longer than desirable.
The average oil tanker is 16 years old and the average bulk carrier 13
years. 'The market doesn't pay the appropriate return for transportation,'
says James Bell, permanent secretary at the International Association of
Classification Societies (IACS) representing 11 societies covering 90 per
cent of world tonnage.
But commercial and regulatory pressures on owners are increasing. 'It makes
good commercial sense to operate to the highest quality standards,' says
Peter Thomas, a director of Britain's P&amp;O Group, whose passenger and cargo
fleet is being fitted with voyage recorders. 'It affects corporate
reputation and profitability.'
Other western European fleets are also conscious of safety, both for its own
sake and as a part of their image. The recorders are being fitted by
Nedlloyd, the Dutch company, on its North Sea Ferries venture with P&amp;O.
Developed by P&amp;O's subsidiary Three Quays International and its Broadgate
electronics unit, they provide a 24-hour record of radar, position, engine
and other data, including conversations on the ship's bridge.
'This gives investigators access to the quality evidence that aircraft
have,' says Bruce Standring, Three Quays' managing director.
He hopes they will be made mandatory under IMO's safety convention. Also
under discussion within IMO is the issue of whether to build up a
comprehensive database on the quality of individual vessels for use by
ports. This would be along the lines of the one developed by the US
Coastguard.
Electronic charts, which are presented on screen and use positioning data
from satellites and information from ships' own sensors, are another
innovation which owners and seafarers are gradually coming to accept, though
international standards are still being worked out. 'Until about a
year-and-a-half ago, nine out of 10 mariners would have said 'why do we need
this?' It was the typical marine attitude - very conservative and
anti-technology,' says Helmut Lanziner, president of Vancouver-based
Offshore Systems.
Now, he adds, it is a Dollars 1bn a year business. Instead of having to
update charts by hand, with the delays this causes, the task can be done
digitally at extreme speed. This is especially important in confined areas
such as harbours and channels where most accidents occur. It also means
ships need fewer people on the bridge to collect and monitor information.
Hapag-Lloyd of Germany is one company which has adopted the one-man bridge
on its container ships. One specially trained person can run the ship,
surrounded in a cockpit-type enclosure by all the necessary instruments and
indicators.
Yet although the trend is clear, not all shipowners look to the
technological horizon. 'A casual look round the bridge of a ship shows
technology embraced in a piecemeal fashion,' Admiral Sir Julian Oswald told
a recent conference organised by the Southampton Institute.
'Big heavy levers mingle with microprocessors. It's an environment fit for
the ergonomist's black museum.' Unfortunately, all too many ships on the
world's oceans today still meet this description.

FT  16 DEC 93 / People: Sir John stays on
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Fairclough, a former chief scientific adviser to the government, is
to serve a further three years as chairman of the Engineering Council, the
umbrella body for the UK's professional engineering institutions.
The council said yesterday that Sir John's second term as chairman would
take effect from May 1994. His reselection, agreed unanimously by the
council, marks the first time that the chairman has served a second term.
In May, Sir John unveiled controversial proposals for a new relationship
between the council and the 42 professional institutions. This could lead to
a merger of the institutions into a single body in the second half of the
1990s, although the need for such a radical step is still disputed.
Sir John had indicated that he was prepared to serve a further term so that
progress could be made on the unification initiative, and on closely-related
moves to review the education and training of engineers.
He said yesterday: 'We have made a constructive beginning to develop a
proposal to unify the professional institutions and the council into a
strong, cohesive, more powerful organisation.'

Oliver Whitehead, chief executive of Alfred McAlpine since May, has moved to

company.
Richard Baldwin, previously managing director of GEC transmission and
distribution projects and former main board director of APV, has replaced
Peter Hulmes as managing director of McAlpine's important building division.
He also becomes a main board director.
In a separate move, two non-executive directors, Sir Alex Alexander, who
joined the board in 1978, and Sir Timothy Kitson, with the company since
1986, will retire after the agm in April. Bobby McAlpine, a former chairman,
is also expected to stand down next year.
The company had felt that the board was a little top-heavy and needed some
fresh faces; it thinks it has a good catch in Andrew Ronn, finance director
of Pilkington since 1989.
Garry Forster has been appointed company secretary in place of Gordon
Beaumont who remains corporate development officer.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Technology: Troubled oil on Europe's waters - Greek worries
over tanker building controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's shipowners have already had to accept tough new safety regulations
for tankers as the price of keeping access to the US oil transport market.
They are now worried that the UK or even the European Union may adopt
equally stringent measures to prevent disastrous oil spills.
Greek owners control 15 per cent of the world's oil tanker tonnage,
including a high proportion of very large and ultra large crude carriers
(VLCCs and ULCCs). The international tanker fleet amounts to fewer than
3,000 vessels, but its advancing age alarms environmental groups.
Sixty per cent of tankers are more than 15 years old, while most of the
VLCCs and ULCCS operated by Greek concerns were built in the mid-1970s.
The Greeks raise technical objections to the US Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of
1990, the law that could become a model for European legislators. Under its
provisions, all ships sailing in US waters and built after 1990 must have
double hulls, and shipowners face unlimited liability for accidents
involving gross negligence.
John Lyras of Granicos Shipping says: 'We have to live with the double hull
requirement. But the evidence is that it is of limited use in improving
safety, and it's costly.'
The US law resulted from the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989 which poured more
than 25m gallons of oil into Alaskan coastal waters. Many Greek owners
believe another disaster on the scale of the Braer wreck off Shetland or the
grounding of the Aegean Sea, a Greek-owned supertanker, off a Spanish port -
both earlier this year - would mean the introduction of the double hull
requirement in European waters.
The Union of Greek Shipowners argues that double hulls, with a cushion of
air between the inner and outer steel plating, can reduce oil leakages only
if a collision or grounding occurs at low speeds.
If two ships collide at normal cruising speed, the cargo tanks are likely to
be ruptured and the tanker is more likely to sink. Also, an explosion is
more likely aboard a double-hulled ship in an accident, as the gap is filled
with oxygen which reacts with vapour from escaping oil.
'The fact that the Aegean Sea had a double bottom made things worse. When
the ship grounded, oil got into the space in between and triggered an
explosion. Damage to the ship was more extensive and more oil was spilled
than if it had a single hull,' says George Banos of Moundreas Shipbrokers.
Fitting a double hull adds at least 15 per cent to the Dollars 120m (Pounds
80m) cost of building a supertanker, and cuts its carrying capacity by about
20 per cent.
Several large Greek oil carriers, among them the Onassis, Niarchos and
Livanos groups, have invested in double-hulled vessels. However, with the
shipping industry still in recession, there is little incentive for smaller
owners to switch.
The compromise solution advocated by the International Maritime Organisation
calls for tankers built after 1994 to have double bottoms and a series of
ballast tanks along the length of the cargo deck. But this would not
necessarily cut the risk of explosion as a fully-laden tanker would have air
in the ballast tanks.
As 80 per cent of tanker accidents are caused by human error, there is some
weight in the Greek owners' claims that higher standards of training for
both tanker crews and port officials would be as effective as shipbuilding
regulations.
Also, technologically advanced navigation assistance in congested
international waters could reduce the possibility for collisions and
groundings. 'What is needed is a shore-based electronic system, similar to
an air-traffic control system, that takes account of the limited ability of
a ship to manoeuvre in difficult weather,' Lyras says.

FT  16 DEC 93 / People: Simonds-Gooding - new campaign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Back in October, when Anthony Simonds-Gooding (right)joined the board of
Lilliput, one of the UK's leading manufacturers of miniature collectables,
he acknowledged that his non-executive post was 'intriguing' but hardly
stretching. He enigmatically told this column to 'watch this space'.
Today the space has been filled, with the news that he is joining the
advertising agency Still Price Lintas as its executive chairman, from
January 17. At the same time Richard Hytner, 34, has been appointed chief
executive officer of the agency, which is part of Lintas Worldwide, the
world's eighth largest advertising network. Chris Still, one of the agency's
founders, relinquished his chairmanship in April this year and left to form
another company.
Simonds-Gooding's connections with Lintas go back a long way. In his 13
years at Unilever he spent 18 months at Lintas working on Lever products. 'I
worked out when I met the Lintas board recently that when I last worked at
Lintas, the average age of the current Still Price Lintas board members must
have been about 10. So the board today is now a combination of beauty, youth
and wisdom,' says Simonds-Gooding, aged 55.
When in 1989 he resigned from Saatchi and Saatchi as group chairman and
chief executive, going on to be chief executive of the then British
Satellite Broadcasting, it seemed as though his connection with the world of
advertising might be over. And when in May 1992 he took over as chairman of
the Design and Art Directors' Association, some felt that it was an
indication of retirement, though with the sorry mess he found at D&amp;AD, he
certainly had a task on his hands.
D&amp;AD is now in much better shape and clearly he was looking for a more
demanding role. Still Price Lintas, which so far this year has achieved net
new billings of Pounds 25.15m, may well provide that.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Accountancy: Spectres linger at War on Want battleground -
Andrew Jack explains how faulty financial management almost resulted in
insolvency for the now healthy charity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An announcement last week from the accountancy profession's Joint
Disciplinary Scheme, its highest investigative body, has re-opened some
painful old sores in a landmark case of poor financial management and
auditing of charities.
The issue to be examined is the conduct of Somers Baker, a small
London-based accountancy practice, and its audit of War on Want, the Third
World charity which gained some notoriety for its financial difficulties
three years ago.
The charity has changed fundamentally since that time and now appears
relatively healthy. The robustness of some of the other organisations
involved and the degree to which the lessons raised by the case have been
learnt is more open to question.
War on Want was founded in 1959 by Victor Gollancz, the radical publisher,
and Harold Wilson, later to be prime minister. It aimed to be a campaigning
organisation, which courted criticism but allowed it to highlight issues in
development now far more widely discussed: such as the central role of women
and the issue of debt.
But the battles with the outside world were more than matched by bloody
internal feuds. Deep political rifts and personal rifts developed, financial
management was neglected, and War on Want was brought to the brink of
insolvency by early 1990.
The concerns led to an investigation unprecedented in scope by the Charity
Commission. It appointed two outside inspectors who battled with incomplete
records and inaccessible personnel members to compile a series of damning
findings.
Mr George Galloway, who was general secretary of the charity in 1983-87,
told the inspectors that War on Want 'seemed often at war with itself . . .
no two members of staff saw eye to eye on most things. (There was) deep and
almost unbelievable civil war'.
While Galloway himself received critical attention in the mid-1980s over
concerns about his expenses, the inspectors' report suggests these concerns
were minor compared with the wider conduct of the charity. The essential
difficulty was a failure to distinguish between War on Want's own 'general'
income and expenditure, and that pledged or 'restricted' to charitable
purposes.
In particular, there was confusion between the charity's accounts and those
of two groups set up to provide long-term relief in Africa: the Eritrean
Inter Agency Consortium and the Tigray Transport and Agriculture Consortium.
There were not, for example, separate bank accounts for these entities.
The result, according to the Charity Commission inspectors, was material
misstatement of the audited accounts in every year during 1985-89. The
general fund reserves in the audited accounts for the year to March 1985
were Pounds 485,256; adjusted by the inspectors, they were Pounds 352,256.
By the year to March 1988, the audited accounts showed Pounds 1,163,503; the
inspectors restated them as a Pounds 41,497 deficit.
The confusion led to the charity undertaking projects it may not have been
able to afford, and diverting money provided by donors to activities other
than those for which they had been solicited. Loans which should not have
been approved were also made from the charity to its trading subsidiaries.
Few escape unscathed from the scrutiny of the inspectors. The members of the
council of management, the officers, general secretaries, finance officers
and auditors all come in for criticism. Both the trustees and the auditors
appeared to place too much reliance on each other.
Hardly any of the elected council expressed any interest or possessed any
skills in financial or legal issues. As Galloway told the inspectors: 'No
one wanted to sit on any committees except the programmes committee . . .
which was talking about exotic places.'
As far as the Joint Disciplinary Scheme is concerned, the findings against
Somers Baker appear powerful. Mr Frank Weinberg, one of the two partners in
the firm and the one in charge of the audit, has since refused to comment
publicly.
The firm had been both accountant and auditor to War on Want since 1980, and
also took on the job as auditor to the consortia. It was involved in the
recruitment of a finance officer, an investigation into the general
secretary's expenses, a review of accounting systems, and a study into the
feasibility of relocating the headquarters. Its total fees during 1985-89
were Pounds 51,520.
The inspectors heard from Mr Weinberg, but were frustrated in their
examination because Somers Baker told them that many of its working papers
had been mislaid or destroyed in a fire.
They none the less determined that the firm failed to carry out proper tests
which would have revealed that the accounting system was not functioning and
material errors could result. 'We have to conclude that Somers Baker's
errors were serious; overall this was a poor auditing performance,' they
said.
The inspectors found no evidence of audit planning, partner review of
programme prior to audit, review of working papers at the conclusion, review
of post balance sheet events, or the appropriateness of the going concern
basis for the accounts.
For the two years to March 1987, no qualified staff worked with Weinberg on
the audit. Not all work was documented, and he confirmed that he sometimes
relied on his own long-standing involvement to make judgments without always
recording his decisions and actions.
Somers Baker has to some extent already paid the price for these omissions.
Faced with a writ claiming damages of more than Pounds 2m from the charity,
it settled out of court in October for Pounds 309,500. It appears that the
firm has also been twice visited by the Joint Monitoring Unit charged with
audit regulation to assess its capability to practice. It remains
registered.
War on Want went through a management transformation, with a new director
and trustees, changes to the constitution, separate bank accounts and
professional advice to improve its systems. Its accounts - which have
received an unqualified opinion - clearly label 'restricted' and 'general'
funds. They show a solvent organisation with rising donations.
Self-regulation within accountancy has again been called into question for
the glacial speed of action over the case. The inspectors' report was
published in February 1991. It will have taken more than three years before
any verdict is made some time in 1994.
Many in the charity sector have taken heed of the findings of the report
informally. But the ambitious recommendations made at the start of the
report by the Charity Commission inspectors - at a time when charity law was
under review for the first time in two decades - have been largely
neglected.
They suggested that for larger charities, the Commissioners should have
additional supervisory powers; that there should be a list of approved
auditors; and a requirement on auditors to report to the Charity Commission.
They argued for a minimum number of trustees with proven financial or legal
expertise and charity experience. They called for special rules dealing with
consortia. No such recommendations have been implemented.
In their absence, the report still provides an object lesson for those
involved in the management of charities.
As Mr Giampi Alhadeff, War on Want's director since the restructuring, puts
it: 'If there is a lesson, it is that the trustees are the owners and
guardians. There is no responsibility more onerous than on trustees.'

FT  16 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Campaign king cashes
in his contacts book - Lucy Kellaway meets Des Wilson, champion of causes,
who now works for the world's biggest PR company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
December is shaping up to be a triumphant month for Des Wilson, the
irrepressible campaigner. Last week he helped win British shoppers the right
to spend their Sundays in the supermarket.
This week he launched Richard Branson and Lord Young on their altruistic bid
for the National Lottery licence.
At his new office at Burson Marsteller, the public relations company, Wilson
is very busy, and is running late.
His secretary appears, bearing a Des Wilson fact file, containing lists of
his campaigning successes, and press cuttings with the most flattering
passages highlighted.
It appears that, since joining the world's biggest PR company less than a
year ago, he has established a thriving a public affairs department with
clients including the Training and Enterprise Councils, Mencap, and
Investors in People.
Wilson is in high spirits. 'I've gone from one success into another,' he
says. 'Every agency in London would have liked the lottery business'. He
claims that Branson and Young - like nearly all his other clients - were so
intent on having Wilson work for them that they did not even ask other
agencies to pitch.
The man who says this looks a little shambolic. He has twinkling eyes and
talks in a flat low voice, a bit like John Major with a New Zealand accent.
The combination of unassuming manner and bragging script is effective: you
listen to the tales and are inclined to believe them.
One of his latest stories is how the joint founder of Shelter, the charity
for the homeless, and the ex-chairman of Friends of the Earth, came to be
working for Burson Marsteller. 'I always said that when I reached 50 I would
move into the private sector. I had no pension and no savings and I had
reached the end of the road. You can't go on raising one cause after
another.'
He was just ready to move two years ago when he was invited to lead the
Liberal Democrat election campaign. 'It was like an athlete who thought he
was at the end of his career being approached by the Olympic committee,' is
how he puts it.
He took the job, declined payment, writing a couple of novels and doing a
bit of consultancy on the side to fund his nomadic existance in London
hotels.
The campaign may have lost him the support of those Liberal Democrats who
felt his ego had got in the way of their own, but it won him an award from
the magazine PR Week for his 'outstanding individual contribution' to the
industry.
It was when he picked up the prize at a black tie dinner last year that he
hatched the novel plan to auction his services.
The following day he called the bosses of the six biggest PR agencies. All
agreed to see him, and all, he says, expressed interest in his plan.
In selecting his future employer, Wilson says he took four things into
account: pay, a seat on the board, interesting clients, and a clause stating
that he could turn down any work that clashed with his campaigning past.
The last clause was a typical piece of Wilson media manipulation. He knew
that any employer would allow him to refuse accounts on ethical grounds, yet
he wanted the clause for his own personal PR. 'All the newspapers referred
to it,' he says. Burson Marsteller scored on all four counts, offering a
salary which he says makes him 'one of the highest paid public affairs
consultants in London'.
Des Wilson is in no doubt that he deserves it. 'I am selling 25 years of
making the political system produce the desired result.
'I also have an exceptional range of contacts. The reporters I knew when I
started at Shelter in 1966 are now editors. The back benchers are now
ministers. The people I knew in TV are now director generals. I know them
all.' He describes himself as an 'advocate in the court of public opinion',
and, on his own admission, works best when the case is a clear one.
On Sunday shopping he realised that the most important thing was to get
consumers to write to their MPs, and get store managers to persuade MPs to
come and see for themselves. He composed much of the advertising copy
himself, unmoved by the apoplectic reaction of the advertising agency.
For the National Lottery, he argues, the first task is to make the bid look
credible. So there will be no razzmatazz: this week's press conference was a
simple affair held round Richard Branson's hearth. 'The usual flamboyancy
attached to Richard's or my own campaigns will be lacking,' he says. Amid
all these triumphs, has anything he has ever worked on gone badly? He shakes
his head and looks apologetic. 'Sorry,' he says.
The growing client list is not merely the result of Wilson's skills and his
90-hour-plus working week. The market for public affairs is growing, and an
increasing number of ex-politicians are finding a good living to be made
there.
Yet Wilson claims he is feeling no chill wind of competition; instead he is
hatching some fancy plans for the future. This New Zealander would like to
sell a new idea of Britain, and make the country great again in the eyes of
the world. Needless to say, he believes he is just the man for the job.

Farming families living in the dusty village of Chajjahpur on the plains of
northern India only buy a few dozen bars of soap and packets of detergent a
week from Haresh Kumar's shop.
It is five miles from the dirt tracks of Chajjahpur to the nearest metalled
road and ten miles to the nearest town. But 700 miles away in Bombay a man
with a computer is keeping tabs on Mr Kumar's sales.
With a few taps on his keyboard, Rajendra Aneja can call up a map of India
on his computer screen. A few more taps and he gets a blow-up of a single
state, then a district, then a group of villages and the roads and tracks
which connect them. Points show the location of individual shops. If he
chooses, Mr Aneja can pick out Chajjahpur and the small store Mr Kumar
inherited from his father as a blob on the map.
As general sales manager of Hindustan Lever, India's largest consumer goods
maker and the local affiliate of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch combine, Mr Aneja
is putting the finishing touches to a system which he believes could
transform rural marketing in India - and in other large developing
countries. By displaying individual villages and roads on an electronic map,
he and his colleagues can plot the best way to supply and service a vast
network of rural outlets.
Hindustan Lever, which has developed the system over the past three years,
is gradually extending the use of computerised maps. Unilever group
executives are so impressed with the scheme's potential that they have
already offered it to Unilever affiliates elsewhere. 'Ours is the only
system of its kind in the world,' claims Mr Aneja.
Details of the mapping techniques are a commercial secret. But, in general,
the information for the maps is gathered mainly by the company's 2,300
stockists - self-employed wholesalers who often work exclusively for
Hindustan Lever. They file hand-written sales reports which form the basis
of the computer data. The crucial advantage of the map displays is that they
enable managers to see at a glance information which would otherwise be
buried in separate files.
If the network operates as planned, it will reinforce the crucial bridge
between head office managers and the customer - a link which is particularly
difficult to maintain in developing countries with large rural populations
and poor communications. It will also help Hindustan Lever to bring to bear
a formidable range of marketing techniques as - following the partial
liberalisation of the Indian economy - the company prepares for full-blown
competition with its international rivals, notably Procter &amp; Gamble of the
US. Rural markets are mushrooming in India for basic household goods such as
packaged foods, soaps, detergents, and cosmetics. In Chajjahpur, population
8,000, there are now 25 shops. With over 600m of India's 900m people living
in the villages, the potential demand is enormous. The actual demand is
growing fast as some 15m people a year are entering into the cash economy,
according to Hindustan Lever. The company estimates rural sales are growing
twice as fast as urban - or at about 15 per cent a year.
Hindustan Lever has the country's largest sales network, serving 40 per cent
of the population. By 1995 it hopes to serve 70 per cent - reaching every
village with a population of 1,000 or more, via its network of stockists.
The stockists visit outlets weekly in urban areas and once a fortnight in
the villages, bringing goods mainly by van or scooter. In remote roadless
districts, suppliers resort to donkeys, camels and even elephants. In urban
districts, marketing is mainly carried out through television, radio and
newspaper advertisements. But Mr Aneja estimates 400m people, mainly those
in small villages, have little or no access to the mainstream media. To
reach these people, marketing executives rely heavily on word-of-mouth. Mr
Aneja says that when Mrs Indira Gandhi was assassinated news of her death
reached even remote villages in six hours. Product information will not
travel nearly as fast, but it will be conveyed, for example, by shopkeepers
like Mr Kumar in Chajjahpur who travel frequently to buy goods from
wholesalers.
Hindustan Lever supports its retailers with direct campaigns in the
villages. The group has 1,200 promotion vans, mounted with loudspeakers and
painted with advertisements for its best-selling brands such as Lifebuoy
soap and Rin laundry soap. When one called in Chajjahpur recently, the
salesman's job was to promote Rin. He produced a dirty handkerchief and
proceeded to launder it in front of about 20 bored-looking villagers. When
he had finished he offered Rin for sale, with a free box of matches. He sold
about 10 bars and moved on.
Hindustan Lever also has a fleet of 115 cinema vans, each equipped with a
projector and screen. The vans show clips of Indian films interspersed with
advertisement films. Mr Aneja says these films are specially-made for rural
audiences. The 10-second long television advertisements are too short;
villagers need films of at least a minute or two if they are to get the
message.
A typical advertisement shows two village wrestlers grappling, one in a
snow-white loin cloth the other in a greyish one. Needless to say, the man
in white wins. The loser's wife scowls at the winner's and says: 'You must
have washed his clothes twice.' The winner's wife answers: 'No. I just used
Rin.'
Mr Aneja says rural advertisements must carry simple messages. He argues
that villagers, like anyone else, will quickly associate with familiar
images - scenes from popular cinema films, from religious stories, from
dances and folk customs, all work well.
Among the advantages of the new computerised maps is that Hindustan Lever
will be able to target its marketing campaigns more accurately.
Executives will be able to plan the routes for the promotional and cinema
vans more effectively and to judge the results more easily. As Mr Aneja
says: 'We have to combine twentieth century methods with the needs of
eighteenth century village life.'

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Thorp Go-ahead: Greenpeace set for court fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group which has most vigorously
opposed the licensing of the Thorp plant in Cumbria, was last night
preparing a final challenge by asking the courts for judicial review of the
decision to allow it to operate.
But Greenpeace's supporters are concerned that the move could jeopardise its
finances. British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, has made no secret of
the fact that it hopes costs will curb Greenpeace's ability to campaign.
Yesterday's announcement allows BNF to start full operation of the plant in
28 days, which allows time for legal action before the first load of fuel
makes the plant radioactive.
Greenpeace, whose headquarters in Islington, north London, has been
dominated by the Thorp campaign for more than a year, believes judicial
review will be granted within days. If granted a review, the pressure group
will argue that the government has acted illegally in not holding a public
inquiry, and in particular, that it has not taken enough account of health
risks.
The High Court judge's decision is likely to be final.
The risk Greenpeace is running in tackling Thorp through the courts is that
if it loses, it will face huge legal bills. In September Greenpeace lost a
court battle to prevent BNF testing the plant with uranium and was told to
pay all of the government's costs and two-thirds of BNF's costs.
Greenpeace says it has not yet received the bill from Freshfields, BNF's
solicitors. But it warned its supporters several weeks ago that the bill for
that round could be Pounds 250,000.
So far, Greenpeace has met its costs from its UK finances. Although
fundraising from its 400,000 UK supporters - 2,500 in Cumbria - has suffered
during the recession, Greenpeace UK's income last year was Pounds 4.1m net
of fundraising expenses, compared with Pounds 3.8m in 1991.
If it lost a further court action its campaigning might be seriously dented.
Lord Peter Melchett, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said he expected
to be able to meet the costs if Greenpeace lost, but that if necessary they
could be paid from international funds. Greenpeace's annual worldwide income
has hovered around Dollars 150m since 1990.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Thorp Go-ahead: Japan and Germany welcome launch

<TEXT>
The decision on Thorp was welcomed in Japan and Germany, the countries which
will be the plant's biggest foreign customers.
In Japan Mr Yasutaka Moriguchi, director at the Science and Technology
Agency's nuclear fuel division, said the decision meant the country could
now implement its nuclear policy as sched-uled.
Mr Kohji Kaneko, general manager of the Federation of Electric Power
Companies, said: 'We're glad that the government has decided as we had
hoped.'
The launch of Thorp would not lead to proliferation as long as the countries
which have contracts with it acted responsibly, he said. BNF's control over
the amount of plutonium reprocessed at Thorp would prevent the problem of
plutonium that is not needed leaving the plant.
But Mr Tadatoshi Akiba, one of the group of Japanese MPs opposing Thorp's
launch, regretted the decision and hoped there would be time to reconsider.
Japan already held more plutonium than it could use, he said, and the launch
would add to this.
In Germany the decision came as a relief to the electricity utilities -
including RWE, the country's largest electricity generator - which have
contracts for reprocessing at Sellafield. But it is a blow to the
anti-nuclear movement, which had hoped that blocking the recycling of
nuclear fuel would bring the entire nuclear power generation industry to a
halt.
Dr Thomas Roser, chief executive of the German Atomforum, the main lobby
group for the nuclear industry, welcomed the decision last night. 'I am glad
about that,' he said. 'Competition is always good for business,' referring
to the fact that France's Cogema will not now have a monopoly on
reprocessing. But he left open the question of whether German utilities
would place further orders for the second decade of Thorp's life. He said no
one knew if the alternative of direct disposal  - disposing of waste fuel
without reprocessing - would be cheaper.
German utilities have planned to reuse some of the reprocessed fuel by
converting it into mixed-oxide fuel elements (MOX). However, the Siemens
plant at Hanau has been prevented from operating by the local Social
Democrat-Green government. The utilities are likely to ask Cogema or BNF to
produce MOX.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Thorp Go-ahead: Ministers accept economic case for waste
plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Nuclear Fuels has gained the decision it wanted, although a year
later than it had hoped. BNF says the delay has cost it more than Pounds
100m.
In giving the go-ahead, ministers made clear that they accepted the
company's economic case for the plant.
The company has said that Thorp will earn the UK Pounds 900m in its first 10
years of operation. It also says it will make Pounds 500m profit in that
period, even after taking account of construction and decommissioning costs.
Mr John Guinness, BNF chairman, said yesterday's decision 'is a major step
forwards in allowing us to earn billions of pounds of overseas revenue for
the UK'.
BNF has stressed throughout the debate that it regards these estimates as
conservative. It points out that it has customer orders to run at full
capacity for 10 years, and has orders for more than 40 per cent of capacity
for its second decade.
The company says it expects to win more orders for reprocessing for the
second decade. Japanese utilities are among its main hopes - Japan's
reprocessing facility now under construction could be in operation by then,
but the country might not have the capacity to reprocess all of its spent
fuel.
In the longer term BNF hopes it can build on its expertise and reputation
from Thorp to sell nuclear waste management services internationally. It
might try to get work helping clean up US military sites, or decommissioning
and decontaminating eastern European and former Soviet reactors.
Critics say these hopes - short and long-term - are unlikely to be
fulfilled. They say that it will be difficult for BNF to win new business
for Thorp because cheaper alternatives to reprocessing have emerged. In
particular, utilities are likely to look to dry storage - storing used fuel
in concrete bunkers for 50 years to 80 years before a final decision on
disposal is taken.
Support for this view comes from the decision by Scottish Nuclear, the power
generator which is one of Thorp's UK customers, to opt for dry storage for
part of its fuel. Scottish Nuclear says it vigorously backs the start-up of
Thorp and will honour its reprocessing contracts with BNF. But it says dry
storage is between 30 per cent and 40 per cent cheaper than reprocessing and
it expects to save Pounds 45m a year from adopting that route.
Mr Gordon MacKerron, energy economist at Sussex University's Science Policy
Research Unit, said: 'I do not believe that there is any likelihood of more
contracts beyond the first 10 years - customers no longer see any economic
reason to reprocess because of its cost.'
The worst outcome for BNF is that it fails to get new customers, and that
existing customers pull out from contracts. In giving the go-ahead ministers
said there was no evidence that customers would try to pull out, although
critics have said there are political as well as economic reasons why they
would be tempted to do so.
In particular some economists have said that public hostility would make it
hard for foreign customers to repatriate uranium and plutonium as their
contracts require.
BNF's reply is that under tough penalty clauses customers would be obliged
to compensate it. But it has not disclosed the relevant details of the
contracts.
Critics have said that if customers started to withdraw, its profit
estimates could be rapidly whittled away.
As many of the responses to the second public consultation point out, BNF's
projections correspond to only one of many scenarios for the next decade and
beyond.
The company is now in a position to test its belief that more business is
out there. It may take years, however, to establish whether the fears of
Thorp's critics about the economics of the plant are justified.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: 'The most urgent issue is to
remove causes of conflict' - Aim to end cycle of violence - British have no
strategic or economic interest in province / Self-determination affirmed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Full text of joint declaration
1. The taoiseach, Mr Albert Reynolds TD, and the prime minister, the Rt Hon
John Major MP, acknowledge that the most urgent and important issue facing
the people of Ireland, north and south, and the British and Irish
governments, is to remove the causes of conflict, to overcome the legacy of
history and to heal the divisions which have resulted, recognising that the
absence of a lasting and satisfactory settlement of relationships between
the peoples of both islands has contributed to continuing tragedy and
suffering.
They believe that the development of an agreed framework for peace, which
has been discussed between them since early last year, and which is based on
a number of key principles articulated by the two governments over the past
20 years, together with the adaptation of other widely accepted principles,
provides the starting point of a peace process designed to culminate in a
political settlement.
2. The taoiseach and the prime minister are convinced of the inestimable
value, to both their peoples, and particularly for the next generation, of
healing divisions in Ireland and of ending a conflict which has been so
manifestly to the detriment of all.
Both recognise that the ending of divisions can come about only through the
agreement and co-operation of the people, north and south, representing both
traditions in Ireland. They therefore make a solemn commitment to promote
co-operation at all levels on the basis of the fundamental principles,
undertakings, obligations under international agreements, to which they have
jointly committed themselves, and the guarantees which each government has
given and now reaffirms, including Northern Ireland's statutory
constitutional guarantee. It is their aim to foster agreement and
reconciliation, leading to a new political framework founded on consent and
encompassing arrangements within Northern Ireland, for the whole island and
between these islands.
3. They also consider that the development of Europe will, of itself,
require new approaches to serve interests common to both parts of the island
of Ireland, and to Ireland and the UK as partners in the European Union.
4. The prime minister, on behalf of the British government, reaffirms that
they will uphold the democratic wish of a greater number of the people of
Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they prefer to support the union or
a sovereign united Ireland. On this basis, he reiterates, on behalf of the
British government, that they have no selfish strategic or economic interest
in Northern Ireland.
Their primary interest is to see peace, stability and reconciliation
established by agreement among all the people who inhabit the island, and
they will work together with the Irish government to achieve such an
agreement, which will embrace the totality of relationships.
The role of the British government will be to encourage, facilitate and
enable the achievement of such agreement over a period through a process of
dialogue and co-operation based on full respect for the rights and
identities of both traditions in Ireland. They accept that such agreement
may, as of right, take the form of agreed structures for the island as a
whole, including a united Ireland achieved by peaceful means on the
following basis.
The British government agree that it is for the people of the island of
Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise
their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and
concurrently given, north and south, to bring about a united Ireland, if
that is their wish.
They reaffirm as a binding obligation that they will, for their part,
introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to this, or equally to
any measure of agreement on future relationships in Ireland which the people
living in Ireland may themselves freely so determine without external
impediment.
They believe that the people of Britain would wish, in friendship to all
sides, to enable the people of Ireland to reach agreement on how they may
live together in harmony and in partnership, with respect for their diverse
traditions, and with full recognition of the special links and the unique
relationship which exists between the peoples of Britain and Ireland.
5. The taoiseach, on behalf of the Irish government, considers that the
lessons of Irish history, and especially of Northern Ireland, show that
stability and well-being will not be found under any political system which
is refused allegiance or rejected on grounds of identity by a significant
minority of those governed by it. For this reason, it would be wrong to
attempt to impose a united Ireland, in the absence of the freely given
consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. He accepts, on
behalf of the Irish government, that the democratic right of
self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be achieved and
exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the
people of Northern Ireland and must, consistent with justice and equity,
respect the democratic dignity and the civil rights and religious liberties
of both communities, including the right to:
Free political thought; freedom and expression of religion; pursue
democratically national and political aspirations; seek constitutional
change by peaceful and legitimate means; live wherever one chooses without
hindrance; equal opportunity in all social and economic activity, regardless
of class, creed, sex or colour.
These would be reflected in any future political and constitutional
arrangements emerging from a new and more broadly based agreement.
6. The taoiseach however recognises the genuine difficulties and barriers to
building relationships of trust either within or beyond Northern Ireland,
from which both traditions suffer. He will work to create a new era of
trust, in which suspicion of the motives or actions of others is removed on
the part of either community. He considers that the future of the island
depends on the nature of the relationship between the two main traditions
that inhabit it.
Every effort must be made to build a new sense of trust between those
communities. In recognition of the fears of the unionist community and as a
token of his willingness to make a personal contribution to the building up
of that necessary trust, the taoiseach will examine with his colleagues any
elements in the democratic life and organisation of the Irish state that can
be represented to the Irish government in the course of political dialogue
as a real and substantial threat to their way of life and ethos, or that can
be represented as not being fully consistent with a modern democratic and
pluralist society, and undertakes to examine any possible ways of removing
such obstacles.
Such an examination would of course have due regard to the desire to
preserve those inherited values that are largely shared throughout the
island or that belong to the cultural and historical roots of the people of
this island in all their diversity.
The taoiseach hopes that over time a meeting of hearts and minds will
develop, which will bring all the people of Ireland together, and will work
towards that objective, but he pledges in the meantime that, as a result of
the efforts that will be made to build mutual confidence, no Northern
unionist should ever have to fear in future that this ideal will be pursued
either by threat or coercion.
7. Both governments accept that Irish unity would be achieved only by those
who favour this outcome persuading those who do not, peacefully and without
coercion or violence, and that, if in the future a majority of the people of
Northern Ireland are so persuaded, both governments will support and give
legislative effect to their wish. But, notwithstanding the solemn
affirmation by both governments in the Anglo-Irish agreement that any change
in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of
a majority of the people of Northern Ireland, the taoiseach also recognises
the continuing uncertainties and misgivings which dominate so much of
Northern unionist attitudes towards the rest of Ireland.
He believes that we stand at a stage of our history when the genuine
feelings of all traditions in the north must be recognised and acknowledged.
He appeals to both traditions at this time to grasp the opportunity for a
fresh start and a new beginning, which could hold such promise for all our
lives and the generations to come. He asks the people of Northern Ireland to
look on the people of the republic as friends, who share their grief and
shame over all the suffering of the last quarter of a century, and who want
to develop the best possible relationship with them, a relationship in which
trust and new understanding can flourish and grow.
The taoiseach also acknowledges the presence in the constitution of the
republic of elements which are deeply resented by Northern unionists, but
which at the same time reflect hopes and ideals which lie deep in the hearts
of many Irish men and women north and south. But as we move towards a new
era of understanding in which new relationships of trust may grow and bring
peace to the island of Ireland, the taoiseach believes that the time has
come to consider together how best the hopes and identities of all can be
expressed in more balanced ways, which no longer engender division and the
lack of trust to which he has referred. He confirms that, in the event of an
overall settlement, the Irish government will, as part of a balanced
constitutional accommodation, put forward and support proposals for change
in the Irish constitution which would fully reflect the principle of consent
in Northern Ireland.
8. The taoiseach recognises the need to engage in dialogue which would
address with honesty and integrity the fears of all traditions. But that
dialogue, both within the north and between the people and their
representatives of both parts of Ireland, must be entered into with an
acknowledgement that the future security and welfare of the people of the
island will depend on an open, frank and balanced approach to all the
problems which for too long have caused division.
9. The British and Irish governments will seek, along with the Northern
Ireland constitutional parties through a process of political dialogue, to
create institutions and structures which, while respecting the diversity of
the people of Ireland, would enable them to work together in all areas of
common interest. This will help over a period to build the trust necessary
to end past divisions, leading to an agreed and peaceful future. Such
structures would, of course, include institutional recognition of the
special links that exist between the peoples of Britain and Ireland as part
of the totality of relationships, while taking account of newly forged links
with the rest of Europe.
10. The British and Irish governments reiterate that the achievement of
peace must involve a permanent end to the use of, or support for,
paramilitary violence. They confirm that, in these circumstances,
democratically mandated parties which establish a commitment to exclusively
peaceful methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic
process, are free to participate fully in democratic politics and to join in
dialogue in due course between the governments and the political parties on
the way ahead.
11. The Irish government would make their own arrangements within their
jurisdiction to enable democratic parties to consult together and share in
dialogue about the political future. The taoiseach's intention is that these
arrangements could include the establishment, in consultation with other
parties, of a Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to make recommendations on
ways in which agreement and trust between both traditions in Ireland can be
promoted and established.
12. The taoiseach and the prime minister are determined to build on the
fervent wish of both their peoples to see old fears and animosities replaced
by a climate of peace. They believe the framework they have set out offers
the people of Ireland, north and south, whatever their tradition, the basis
to agree that from now on their differences can be negotiated and resolved
exclusively by peaceful political means. They appeal to all concerned to
grasp the opportunity for a new departure. That step would compromise no
position or principle, nor prejudice the future for either community. On the
contrary, it would be an incomparable gain for all. It would break
decisively the cycle of violence and the intolerable suffering it entails
for the people of these islands, particularly for both communities in
Northern Ireland. It would allow the process of economic and social
co-operation on the island to realise its full potential for prosperity and
mutual understanding. It would transform the prospect for building on the
progress already made in the talks process, involving the two governments
and the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland. The taoiseach and the
prime minister believe that these arrangements offer an opportunity to lay
the foundations for a more peaceful and harmonious future devoid of the
violence and bitter divisions which have scarred the past generation. They
commit themselves and their governments to continue to work together,
unremittingly, towards that objective.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: Major goes extra mile for
peace

The nub of the deal - British recognition that Irish unity is a legitimate
aspiration in return for Irish recognition that Northern Ireland's future
should be decided by a majority of its people - may have been expected. But
Mr Major seems to have travelled further along the extra mile for peace than
his Irish counterpart.
In terms of tone and choice of language some passages of the seven-page
document were genuinely startling. Sinn Fein will have to think long and
hard before turning away from the open door to the democratic process the
two leaders have put before it.
The British government's language on the Protestant majority's veto over any
change in the province's status stands out when compared with past
statements.
The message yesterday was that Mr Major would 'uphold the democratic wish of
a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether
they prefer to support the union or a sovereign united Ireland'.
Two weeks ago the words he chose in Commons exchanges were: 'There is for us
one fundamental point: Northern Ireland's status as part of the United
Kingdom will not change without the freely expressed consent of the people
of Northern Ireland.'
Three years ago Mr Peter Brooke, then Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'The
Union is affirmed by the first section of the Northern Ireland Constitution
Act of 1973 which declares that in no event will Northern Ireland or any
part of it cease to be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of a
majority of the people of Northern Ireland. We stand firmly by that solemn
declaration and assurance.'
Mr Major's 'fundamental point' has not been conceded. But the language used
to convey it has been transformed.
Yesterday's declaration brings the government perilously close to joining
the 'persuaders' - those intent on pushing Ulster's people towards a
particular solution - as ministers recently indicated they would not do.
Britain's role will now be to 'encourage, facilitate and enable' an
agreement 'among all the people who inhabit the island' embracing 'the
totality of relationships'.
The declaration amplifies Mr Brooke's ground-breaking assertion in 1990 that
Britain had no 'selfish or strategic or economic' interest in the province.
The government's 'primary interest', it says, is to see 'peace, stability
and reconciliation'.
The passages on aspirations to a united Ireland are exceptionally tortuous.
But their meaning will be clear enough to set alarm bells ringing in the
minds of some union-ists.
The government now accepts that an agreement 'may, as of right, take the
form of agreed structures for the island as a whole, including a united
Ireland achieved by peaceful means'.
In view of the suspicion with which many unionists regard the development of
cross-border institutions, they may be particularly concerned about the
vaguely worded commitment by the two leaders to promote co-operation between
north and south 'at all levels'.
Early indications were that they viewed Dublin's intention to establish a
Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, involving democratic parties on the
island, with deep unease.
Nationalists will welcome London's acknowledgement of a 'binding obligation'
to pass legislation changing Northern Ireland's constitutional status if a
majority of the province's people so wish.
From the Irish perspective, the declaration acknowledges that imposing a
united Ireland in the absence of the consent of a majority of the province's
people would be 'wrong'.
But it avoids any direct reference to articles 2 and 3 of the Irish
constitution, which formalise its territorial claim, referring only to
'elements which are deeply resented by northern unionists'.
Dublin's hand may also be detected both in the gentle reminder that the 1985
Anglo-Irish agreement in any case recognised the need for majority consent
to any change in the province's status and in the near impenetrability of
some of the language recognising Northern Ireland's right of
self-determination.
But unionists will note that Dublin has pledged that it 'will' put forward
'and support' proposals for constitutional change in the event of an overall
settlement. Such proposals would 'fully reflect' the principle of consent.

After weeks of criticism from the opposition benches in the Irish parliament
over his approach to the Anglo-Irish peace initiative, Mr Albert Reynolds,
the Irish prime minister, yesterday basked in an unusual display of
cross-party support.
The three main opposition parties, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and
Democratic Left, have been concerned that Mr Reynolds, in pushing hard for
an accommodation of nationalist aspirations in the joint declaration, would
alienate unionist opinion in Northern Ireland and exacerbate political
tensions and violence there.
Ms Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats, who has been one of Mr
Reynolds' sharpest critics, described the declaration as 'fair and
balanced'.
Mr Prionsias de Rossa, leader of Democratic Left, paid tribute 'to the
drafting skills of some of the best brains in both the Irish and British
public services'.
Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, congratulated the two prime ministers
on reaching an agreement.
But he was concerned at a 'lack of clear timetables or mechanisms' for the
resumption of inter-party talks and hoped the formula for dropping the
republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland in the context of an
overall settlement 'would not be used as an excuse to defer all action on
constitutional reforms into the indeterminate future'.
The declaration invited the unionists to suggest topics which 'can be
represented as not being fully consistent with a modern democratic and
pluralistic society' and offered to discuss and consider 'ways of removing
such obstacles'.
Mr Bruton warned against establishing too many bodies for discussing issues
in the north. On the legislatively powerless Forum for Peace and
Reconciliation, which unionists are to be invited to join, he said there
should not be 'competing institutions trying to solve the same problem'.
Mr Reynolds indicated yesterday, however, that the real objective of such a
forum was to provide a further incentive for Sinn Fein to renounce violence.

<TEXT>
'It closes no doors except the door of violence and illegality - crucially
it opens the door to those who abandon violence.'
John Major 'A tortuously worded statement with many contradictions.'
James Molyneaux 'My appeal to all sections of our people is to read the
entire statement in full, and to have no knee-jerk reactions.'
John Hume 'We cannot have winners and losers if we want lasting peace. It is
fair to all and threatens nobody.' Albert Reynolds 'Ulster has been hung,
drawn and quartered by Mr Reynolds, Mr Major and his cohorts in the IRA.'
Ian Paisley 'It is one of those fairly broad-based declarations which rules
nothing out and rules nothing in and presumably causes minimum offence to
all parties, which will enable, perhaps, the more serious dialogue to follow
on from this point.'
Colin Parry, father of 12-year-old Warrington bomb victim Tim Parry

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: Declaration makes history but
no promises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Peace in our time' is what they did not say. 'I cannot promise you today
that the joint declaration will bring peace,' said Mr Major. Mr Reynolds
said: 'I have never spoken of peace before Christmas.'
But the solemnity surrounding yesterday's proceedings in and around Downing
Street made clear that witnesses believed they were watching history in the
making.
There was a real chance that the substance of the declaration would cut the
ground from under the terrorists' feet after 25 years' violence.
The first confirmation that journalists were to experience something special
came with the mobile X-ray machine that greeted them when they descended on
Downing Street for the taoiseach's 11am arrival.
Right on schedule came the roar of the motorcycles carrying outriders, and
four Mercedes limousines swept into Downing Street.
Mr Reynolds, Mr Dick Spring and at least a score of officials emerged to be
greeted by Mr Major and Sir Patrick Mayhew under Number Ten's weather-beaten
Christmas tree - diplomatically decked with orange and green fairy lights
for the occasion.
About 40 minutes later the two leaders emerged to make a brief statement,
primarily for the television cameras - all i's now being dotted, all t's
crossed.
Offstage a whip, armed with a mini camera, appeared to be capturing the
historic moment for posterity.
No sooner had the prime ministers gone back inside than a contingent from
the Democratic Unionist party appeared, accompanied by two apprehensive
police officers and a buzz of anticipation.
The party marched to the big black door to hand in a letter. Then the figure
of the Rev Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, delivered what was recognisable -
even from a distance - as a fire-and-brimstone tirade.
The phrases 'appeasement', 'lied', 'dirty deed', 'utterly failed' and
'Christian burial' were dimly perceptible through the crowd. Then off he
strode.
The media circus moved the other way, up the Downing Street stairs, past the
portraits of former prime ministers to the state dining room.
Within a couple of minutes of the press conference starting, Mr Major had
coined the phrase 'the Downing Street declaration' - a point Mr James
Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party's punctilious leader, was to return to
later.
Mr Reynolds, for his part, waxed poetical with his references to walls of
wilting flowers and an eternity of tears.
There was little inclination to spoil the prime ministers' momentous day by
taxing them with tough questions.
It was the same story - with one exception - in the House of Commons later.
As the House listened attentively, the loudest sound was the rustle of
declarations when the prime minister made one of several specific textual
references.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, welcomed the declaration 'with
enthusiasm'. Even Mr Molyneaux, an important figure in attempts to shape a
durable political settlement, offered his criticisms of the 'rather
tortuously worded' document 'in a constructive fashion'.
But of course Mr Paisley, resplendent in an immense grey cardigan, could not
resist the opportunity to have another go. Mr Major's invitation to the IRA
to take a seat at the negotiating table in return for an end to violence
went to 'the very gut of the resentment of the people of Northern Ireland',
he railed. 'This document never once mentioned the United Kingdom.'

<TEXT>
The UK-Irish declaration on the future of Northern Ireland was given a broad
welcome by MPs from all three main parties in the Commons yesterday.
Only a handful of MPs from mainland constituencies expressed reservations
about the declaration, and Mr John Major, the prime minister, was given
strong support by key backbenchers on both sides.
Conservative MPs cheered as Mr Major challenged Sinn Fein, the political arm
of the IRA, to accept the challenge to condemn violence and join the
political process.
Reaction from the Conservative back benches was largely positive, although a
handful of MPs suggested that the agreement represented a weakening of
Britain's commitment to Northern Ireland.
Others called for assurances that the fight against terrorism would
continue, and urged the government to insist on a surrender of weapons and
explosives by the IRA before entering into talks with Sinn Fein.
In Belfast last night Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary,
signalled on a television discussion programme that the IRA might be
required to surrender its arsenal of weapons before being accepted into the
political process.
Mr Andrew Hunter, the influential chairman of the Conservative backbench
Northern Ireland committee, said the declaration was 'a positive step
forward'. But there were cheers as he urged the prime minister to 'ensure
that there is no let-up in the hunt for those who perpetrate violence'.
Mr Peter Temple-Morris, a senior Conservative backbencher, said the
declaration was supported by the UK-Irish Inter Parliamentary Body, of which
he is joint chairman.
Mr Tom King, a former Northern Ireland secretary, said the declaration
contained nothing to seriously threaten the interests of any part of the
Northern Ireland community.
Few MPs expressed concern about the permanence of the links between Northern
Ireland and the UK. However, Mr Tony Marlow, the Conservative MP for
Northampton North, said there was 'a danger that people will say that the
prime minister of the UK is careless with regard to the integrity of the
UK'.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Conservative MP for Macclesfield, welcomed the
prime minister's commitment to peace, but urged him to go to Northern
Ireland to campaign for the union.
The declaration was welcomed 'with enthusiasm' by Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader, and by Mr Alan Beith for the Liberal Democrats.
Most Labour backbenchers also welcomed the declaration. Mr Doug Hoyle, MP
for Warrington North - in whose constituency two boys were killed by an IRA
bomb this year - said the terrorists would never be forgiven if they failed
to respond. 'It is time for all the paramilitaries to lay down their arms,'
he said.
The declaration was criticised by some Labour leftwingers. Mr Tony Benn, a
former cabinet minister, said public opinion in Britain would support talks
with Sinn Fein in advance of a cessation of violence.

</HEADLINE>

The Major-Reynolds agree-ment left Northern Ireland's non-violent political
parties deeply divided.
It was dismissed as a 'betrayal' by the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline
Democratic Unionist party, which accused Mr Major of 'appeasing the fiendish
republican scum'.
The government will be encouraged by the more moderate response of Mr James
Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party.
The agreement was welcomed by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP,
as 'the first step on a road that will remove the bullet and the bomb
forever from our small island'.
Mr Paisley told the Commons that it was 'offensive' that the IRA would be
allowed to join talks on the province's future three months after ending its
campaign of violence.
Mr Paisley was vigorously supported by Mr Peter Robinson, his deputy, but
there was little backing from other parties. Mr Major was cheered as he told
Mr Paisley the government had a duty to promote talks to end the bloodshed.
Mr Molyneaux, who was cheered by Conservative MPs as he rose to speak,
demanded reassurance from the government about the impact of the 'tortuous
document' on relations between Northern Ireland and the republic.
While he made no direct criticism of the declaration in the Commons chamber,
he said later that there were parts of it the UUP did not accept.
'We have not put our thumbprints or signatures to the document,' he said.
'There are parts of that document clearly written by Dublin hands and those
are unacceptable to us. But we have managed to set aside those
considerations for the time being to see what the effect of that bait
dangled by Dublin will have on the IRA.'
Mr Molyneaux said he shared hopes that it would lead to peace 'but knowing
the track record of the IRA, I have my doubts about it'.
He added: 'The IRA cannot pick and choose any more than we can . . . they
have got to either take it or leave it.'
Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, warned: 'If we are
suspending judgment today on this statement it is in the hope that it will
lead to a way out of the cul-de-sac that the people of Ulster have been
condemned to for the last eight years.'

<TEXT>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, signalled yesterday that the
Major-Reynolds declaration has sparked off an internal debate in the
republican movement which may take some days to resolve.
After a meeting of the party's leading officials and councillors at its
Belfast offices, it refrained from supporting or rejecting the declaration.
The only public comment on the statement came after the meeting from Mr
Mitchel McLaughlin, the party's Northern Ireland chairman. He said that the
party would 'study in depth' the joint declaration, and compare it with the
previous joint proposals of Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic
and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein.
Mr McLaughlin added: 'Already the general reaction among many nationalists
is one of disappointment. This is especially so because of the heightening
of expectations in the lead-up to the prime ministerial meeting.'
Reactions in the nationalist community appear to be mixed. This partly
explains why Sinn Fein yesterday failed to produce a more detailed response.
Mr Seamus Mallon, the deputy leader of the SDLP, which 12 weeks ago launched
its initiative with Sinn Fein, said: 'The declaration is very significant
indeed. I would ask those in Sinn Fein and the IRA to read this document
very, very carefully indeed.
'If they do then they would recognise there are changes of a pretty
substantial nature. On self-determination, if that had been agreed in the
1921 treaty . . . it could have actually prevented the civil war that
followed and the 25 years of violence we have had now.'
Mr Brendan Mulgrew, a political researcher working for Dr Joe Hendron, the
SDLP MP for West Belfast, said the declaration would put the IRA's sincerity
to the test.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: IRA volunteers face tough
choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA is facing unprec-edented political pressure to lay down its arms,
but the nature of its own military organisation means it is far from
guaranteed that it will agree to a permanent cessation of violence.
It is made up of 'volunteers', many of whom have remained on the sidelines
of political developments. They have been hardened and encouraged by their
'war' against the British.
Moreover, of all the statements made by the House of Commons yesterday, Mr
Major's rejection of an amnesty for IRA prisoners would have touched a
particularly raw nerve.
The IRA believes it retains the capacity to continue to conduct a successful
campaign of attrition against the British by attacking members of the
security forces and perhaps targeting the mainland.
Indeed, the latest peace process is viewed in the short-term as stemming
from the IRA's attacks on the mainland over the past two years and the way
they have focused government attention on the Irish question.
The terms of yesterday's declaration fall short of the IRA's historic idea
of victory, however - Irish unity and a withdrawal of British troops. In the
next few days the IRA will be reminding itself that previous experiences of
ceasefire led to a weakening of its morale.
The IRA leaders face pressure from their political allies in Sinn Fein to
weigh their options. But the men of arms see the question they face as what
kind of initiative can they take if they are not to be frozen out by the
climate of acceptance for the Reynolds-Major plan.
The IRA is likely to seek concessions from the British government to
mitigate any suggestion that a ceasefire amounts to a surrender. These may
include a withdrawal to barracks of the security forces to match any
ceasefire.
As far as the IRA is concerned the acid test of whether peace is really on
the cards will come nearer to Christmas Day, when the organisation will have
to decide on what terms, if at all, it declares its traditional seasonal
ceasefire.
The peaceful three-month period before talks with Sinn Fein is being viewed
in the republican movement as an attempt to put pressure on the IRA to
extend its ceasefire well beyond the new year.
It is not inconceivable that the IRA may be persuaded by Sinn Fein to
declare an extended - though not open-ended - ceasefire in order to put the
ball back in the government's court.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: Failed pacts litter
Anglo-Irish affairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tortuous path of Anglo-Irish relations is littered with failed
agreements and misunderstandings. In three decades the two countries have
been on the verge of deals a number of times only to see them founder on
interpretation.
The Anglo-Irish agreement, signed in November 1985, met intense unionist
opposition. the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, UK prime minister, entered into
the agreement 'to defeat the men of violence and to bring peace and
stability'.
Dr Garret FitzGerald, her Irish counterpart, saw it as a way to end problems
which the nationalist community felt had not been properly represented in
the past.
Moderate and hardline unionists believed the agreement betrayed their
historic right to veto any deal by giving the Republic of Ireland a say in
Northern Ireland affairs.
Unionists had shown their muscle before when they rejected the Sunningdale
power-sharing agreement in 1973. Hardliners interpreted it as a significant
concession to the nationalist community.
Renewed Westminster pledges over the next 12 years that Northern Ireland
would remain in the UK so long as a majority in the province wished it were
wrongly interpreted by unionists as a veto.
The constitutional convention set up in 1975 by Mr Merlyn Rees, then
secretary for Northern Ireland, was dismantled within months without being
able to agree on any alternatives to direct rule.
Efforts by Mr James Prior to set up an assembly foundered on the same rock.
An attempt at forging a new understanding with the republic fell apart when
Mrs Thatcher told parliament in 1982 there was no commitment to consult
Dublin on matters relating to Northern Ireland.
Yesterday's declaration depends on whether unionists interpret their right
to stay in the UK as giving them a veto over the right of the majority in
the UK - through the British prime minister - to make whatever agreement the
government feels desirable.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: Suspicion remains rooted in
opposing communities - The reactions of Protestants and Catholics in Belfast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Berlin Arms on the Shankill Road in loyalist west Belfast yesterday,
John, a 68-year-old retired postman and one-time Irish fusilier, turned his
back on the television image of a British and Irish prime minister and gazed
into his pint of stout with an air of disgust.
'This is a lot of eye wash. They're not being straight with us. We are ready
to fight here. And they had better bloody believe it.'
A sense of suspicion if not betrayal about what lies behind the declaration
appears to run deep through the unionist grassroots.
The Berlin Arms is just a block away from the scene of a recent IRA bomb
attack. The pub, protected by a security door, is a place of assembly for
Protestants who feel threatened not just by the IRA but by the concept of
Irish unity they suspect is the real purpose behind the complex wording of
the declaration.
Mr Major may seek to reassure this community with his constitutional
guarantees, but the Shankill's history has bred gut reactions rather than
political analysis.
John, who would not give his full name for fear of IRA reprisal, showed me
his Orange Cross - a loyalist identity card with the following statement: 'I
am a loyal British subject pledged to uphold the constitution of our country
against republicanism and subversion.'
Next to him, 30-year-old Mr Brian Warnock, a motor mechanic, admitted to
having 'some Catholic friends' and not being opposed to Sinn Fein being
brought into talks if the IRA renounced violence 'for ever'. But he echoed
the older man's deeper sentiment.
'I am suspicious because Dublin is involved. I think that means we could get
sold down the river.'
Elsewhere in Ulster, some Catholics were disappointed with the agreement,
and thought it might not persuade the IRA to stop.
One man admitted: 'When you see the unionists on television smirking and
telling us they're happy enough, you begin to think: 'Right, they are going
to screw us, aren't they?'
'I want the peace. I could take you to 10 houses right now, and nine of them
agree with me. They've had enough. It's the guy in the tenth house I worry
about. He may not be ready to pack in.'
Mrs Joyce McCartan, a 65-year-old Catholic who has lost 12 family members in
the violence, was more optimistic: 'We have a real chance here, and if
people like Paisley and Robinson keep their mouths shut, then we can get the
peace we all desire.'

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement: Sinn Fein delays full response

<TEXT>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, signalled yesterday that the
Major-Reynolds declaration has sparked off an internal debate within the
Republican movement which may take some days to resolve.
After the party had held a meeting of its leading officials and councillors
at its Belfast offices, it refrained from either supporting or rejecting the
declaration outright.
The only public comment on the statement came after the meeting from Mr
Mitchel McLaughlin, the party's Northern Ireland chairman. He said that the
party would 'study in depth' the joint declaration, and compare it with the
previous joint proposals of Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic
and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein.
Mr McLaughlin added: 'Already the general reaction among many nationalists
is one of disappointment. This is especially so because of the heightening
of expectations in the lead-up to the prime ministerial meeting.'
However, reactions within the nationalist community appear to be mixed. This
partly explains why Sinn Fein yesterday failed to come out with a more
detailed response.
Mr Seamus Mallon, the deputy leader of the SDLP, which 12 weeks ago launched
its initiative with Sinn Fein, said: 'The declaration is very significant
indeed. I would ask those in Sinn Fein and the IRA to read this document
very, very carefully indeed.
'If they do then they would recognise there are changes of a pretty
substantial nature. On self-determination, if that had been agreed in the
1921 Treaty . . . it could have actually prevented the civil war that
followed and the 25 years of violence we have had now.'
Mr Brendan Mulgrew, a political researcher working for Mr Joe Hendron, the
SDLP MP for West Belfast, said the declaration would put the IRA's sincerity
to the test. He said: 'They have said they want peace to come to Northern
Ireland. This offers them the best way of getting out of the violence.'
Mr Pat Magarth, editor of the nationalist Derry Journal, said: 'This is a
compromise which the IRA may find difficult to reject although it has the
capacity to go on fighting for another 25 years.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish government says it will not spell out in advance which issues it
considers might represent a threat to the unionist community's ethos and way
of life, or which 'can be represented as not being fully consistent with a
modern democratic and pluralistic society', as noted in paragraph six of the
joint declaration.
Dublin says it is prepared to discuss and consider 'ways of removing such
obstacles' but that it is for the unionists to present a list of concerns.
Apart from the clauses in Ireland's constitution that lay claim to the
province, the clause means that issues in areas such as divorce and abortion
are likely to be raised. Legalisation of the former and easing of
restrictions on the latter are due to go through the Dail next year.
The continuing strong influence of the Catholic church over school
curriculums in the Irish republic is also likely to prove a highly
contentious issue with Ulster's Protestants. Education reforms are under way
in the south, but the Catholic church hierarchy is fiercely challenging any
erosion of its power.
Unionist parties are also to be invited to join the proposed Forum for Peace
and Reconciliation, together with other parties in both parts of the island.
This is designed 'to be a consultative body but without any legislative
powers', according to a government spokesman.
However Mr Reynolds indicated yesterday that the real objective of such a
forum was to provide a further incentive for Sinn Fein to renounce violence
by offering it an early role in the negotiating process.
He said in his address to the Irish parliament yesterday that the forum
would be established 'after a real cessation of violence'.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement: Reynolds basks in unusual glory of
cross-party support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After weeks of criticism from the opposition benches in the Irish parliament
over his approach to the Anglo-Irish peace initiative, Mr Albert Reynolds,
the Irish prime minister, yesterday basked in an unusual display of
cross-party support.
The three main opposition parties, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and
Democratic Left, have been concerned that Mr Reynolds, in pushing hard for
an accommodation of nationalist aspirations in the joint declaration, would
alienate unionist opinion in Northern Ireland and exacerbate political
tensions and violence there.
Ms Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats who has been one of Mr
Reynolds' sharpest critics, described the declaration as 'fair and
balanced'. She added: 'Over the past number of weeks I and my party
consistently expressed our concerns that a peace formula might be attempted
to satisfy the men of violence at the expense of constitutional unionists in
particular. I am happy to acknowledge that my concerns have not come to
pass.'
Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, congratulated the two prime ministers
in reaching an agreement. Highlighting the British government's
acknowledgement of the right to self-determination in the island of Ireland,
he said: 'In view of this declaration, there can be no conceivable
justification for any organisation, like the IRA, to continue to attempt to
coerce the British people by arms into agreeing to something that they have
already plainly agreed to in this declaration.'
He was concerned at a 'lack of clear timetables or mechanisms' for the
resumption of inter-party talks and hoped that the formula for dropping the
republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland in the context of an
overall settlement 'would not be used as an excuse to defer all action on
constitutional reforms into the indeterminate future'.
Mr Prionsias de Rossa, leader of Democratic Left which in an earlier guise
was the political wing of the official IRA before the organisation split in
the 1970s, paid tribute 'to the drafting skills of some of the best brains
in both the Irish and British public services'. He said the British
government 'has gone as far as it is politically possible to go to meet
republican demands in regard to self-determination'. He added: 'If the IRA
spurns this opportunity, responsibility for the continuing violence will be
seen to rest totally with them.'
Mr de Rossa also said that Mr Reynolds 'has gone further than he or any of
his predecessors have been prepared to go in the past' by making a solemn
written commitment to drop the republic's constitutional claim to Northern
Ireland as part of an overall political settlement.
Mr Bruton warned against establishing too many bodies for discussing issues
in the north. On the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, he said there
should not be 'competing institutions trying to solve the same problem -
creating needless misunderstandings and misinterpretations'.

FT  16 DEC 93 / RAF fleet contract may go to Lockheed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain will ask Lockheed, the US aerospace group, to bid for a contract to
replace part of the RAF's tactical transport fleet, dealing a blow to a
multi-billion pound European project known as the Future Large Aircraft.
Officials said the UK might still purchase the FLA at a later stage but they
made clear that it would be an off-the-shelf deal, and ruled out any UK
financial backing for development of the aircraft.
British Aerospace has been pressing the government to rejoin the FLA
programme. The UK took part in the initial eight-nation plan in the
mid-1980s but withdrew its funding four years ago.
BAe, part of an industrial consortium engaged on feasibility studies for the
aircraft, said yesterday that it would be forced to leave the project if the
government stayed on the sidelines.
France, Germany and other partner nations have been trying to incorporate
Britain into the venture, which they regard as a military counterpart to
Airbus. They fear that if Britain buys a new version of the Lockheed C-130
Hercules transport other European countries will follow. They are hoping for
a market of at least 300 aircraft.
BAe's partners in the industrial consortium are Aerospatiale of France,
Deutsche Aerospace, CASA of Spain and Alenia of Italy, as well as associated
Belgian, Portuguese and Turkish companies.
The decision to invite a tender from Lockheed was announced by Mr Jonathan
Aitken, defence procurement minister, yesterday.
Meanwhile, Marshall of Cambridge is undertaking a study on refurbishment.
Officials told the Commons defence committee that the RAF needed to replace
or refurbish about half its fleet by the year 2000.

The Statutory Sick Pay Bill completed its Commons passage early this

will scrap the scheme under which the state reimburses companies for 80 per

The bill gained its third reading by 298 votes to 204, a government majority
of 94, and now goes to the Lords.

The Commons trade and industry committee is to examine the future of the
Post Office in the light of warnings from its management that the
corporation faces a growing crisis, Roland Rudd and David Owen write.
The committee plans to call Mr Mike Heron, Post Office chairman, to give
evidence and may seek to question ministers responsible for the corporation.
Committee members are understood to be concerned that the corporation's
investment plans and profitability are threatened by uncertainty created by
the government's review of the Post Office.
The move will put pressure on the Department of Trade and Industry to
produce its review early next month.
Ministers are understood to have rejected plans for full-scale
privatisation.

FT  16 DEC 93 / No sign of upturn in pay settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is still no sign of an upturn in pay settlements, with the median
settlement at 2 per cent in the three months to the end of October, the
latest pay bulletin from Industrial Relations Services shows, David Goodhart
writes.
The independent research organisation says that the 2 per cent figure is 0.2
points down from the median figure for the three months to the end of
September.
One sector where pay appears to be rising slightly faster is building
societies.
Recent rises have been significantly above inflation with a minimum pay-bill
cost of 2.5 per cent. The Yorkshire Building Society was the most generous
with an annualised increase of 4.6 per cent.
IRS says the average pay rise for the hotel and catering industry as a whole
this year was 1.6 per cent. Nearly one in three of the sample of 32
employers implemented a pay freeze this year.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Clark 'starved' of Iraq details
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister, yesterday told the Scott inquiry
he and other senior politicians had been 'starved' of vital intelligence
material relating to the manufacture of Iraqi arms.
He described how BSA Machines had been prosecuted for exporting automatic
lathes and grinders to make munitions in Iraq even though the company had
the covert support of the authorities.
'The machinery of government had been put into play to make a particular
exception on their behalf and they were later prosecuted,' he said. 'It was
like Kafka, really.'
Giving evidence for the third day to Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the
export of dual-use goods to Iraq, Mr Clark queried the whole basis of the
Customs case against three employees of Matrix Churchill, who were
prosecuted for illegal exports to Iraq.
The prosecution collapsed after Mr Clark revealed that the government knew
Matrix goods were going to munitions factories and had been encouraging
exporters to stress their 'general' or 'agricultural' use on application
forms. This policy tallied with a letter from Lord Trefgarne, the former
trade minister, to Mr William Waldegrave, the former foreign minister, on
March 30 1990.
Mr Clark said there 'must have been someone who would have seen that text
and 'gulped',' to have seen that the letter argued that the machinery was
for civil engineering purposes, because it was later found to have been
linked to triggers which were parts for the Iraqi supergun.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Food price falls help inflation to 26-year low: Steady
increase in volume of retail sales shows consumers pushing economy towards
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury's preferred measure of underlying inflation fell in November to
its lowest level for 26 years, led by lower prices of food, second-hand cars
and alcoholic drinks.
At the same time the volume of retail sales continued its steady rise,
confirming the view that consumers are slowly helping the economy to
recover.
The retail prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments, rose in the
year to November by 2.5 per cent, after 2.8 per cent in the year to October.
The headline inflation rate - the year-on-year rise in the RPI - was 1.4 per
cent last month, the same as in October.
The figures from the Central Statistical Office underline the weakness of
retail price pressures. This is caused by shops cutting prices in a bid to
build volumes and also by only muted rises in retailers' wage costs and the
prices of products bought from wholesalers.
Between October and November the RPI - which reflects the prices of a basket
of 600 goods and services bought by households - fell 0.1 per cent from
141.8 to 141.6. In the six months to November the index rose by just 0.3 per
cent.
A big factor behind last month's weak inflation was a 0.7 per cent fall
between October and November in prices of non-seasonal foods, the biggest in
any month since June 1963.
This was due largely to widespread price-cutting in supermarkets,
particularly on soft drinks, bread, milk, tinned fish and a range of
processed foods.
In the year to November non-seasonal foods rose in price by a weak 1.9 per
cent. In the same period all foods, including fruit and vegetables, affected
by seasonal changes rose 1.4 per cent in price.
Foods which have seen big reductions on the year include fresh fish, down 10
per cent, and pork, down 4 per cent.
The average used car cost 2.9 per cent less last month than in October,
which helped to push motoring costs including petrol down 1.4 per cent on
the month, the biggest one-month fall for three years. In the year to last
month motoring costs rose 3.5 per cent.
Alcoholic drinks fell 0.5 per cent in price on the month, partly because
many off-licences have cut prices in the hope of boosting pre-Christmas
sales. In the year to November prices of these items increased 3.6 per cent,
the lowest figure since 1988.
Household goods including furniture, carpets and electrical equipment rose
0.5 per cent in price on the month, for a weak 0.9 per cent increase in the
year to November. This was the smallest year-on-year rise since the CSO
started records in 1974 and illustrates how the lacklustre housing market
and pressure on disposable incomes is holding back demand.
Other figures from the CSO showed that last month retail sales climbed a
seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent from October, after a revised 0.3 per cent
increase the previous month.
Between September and November retail volumes rose 0.9 per cent compared
with the June to August period, after a 1.2 per cent increase in the
previous three months. In the year to the last three-month period volumes
were up a healthy 3.6 per cent.
The British Retail Consortium, a trade body, provided an element of festive
cheer by saying sales of Christmas decorations and crackers in recent weeks
had been 'well above' last year's levels.
It said shops selling footwear, medicines and do-it-yourself goods had
performed particularly strongly last month, while sales of electrical goods
and carpets had been disappointing.
Yesterday's inflation-adjusted figures underline how shop sales - which
account for about a quarter of gross domestic product - form one of the
strongest elements behind the UK's recent economic growth.
According to the CSO, mixed retail businesses selling food and non-edible
items had a fairly strong autumn, with sales volumes up 1.4 per cent on a
three-month basis. In the year to the last three-month period these stores
pushed up sales by 5 per cent.
Food retailers saw sales rise 0.7 per cent between September and November
compared with the previous three months. Over the year sales increased by
2.6 per cent.
Retailers specialising in household goods increased sales by 2.4 per cent on
a three-month basis and 9.5 per cent compared with a year ago. Clothing and
shoe shops did less well, with sales rising a muted 2.1 per cent on a yearly
basis and showing a 0.1 per cent decline over the past three months compared
with the June to August period.
The CSO said that, based on non-seasonally adjusted data, the average weekly

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 3m wave energy machine is to be installed off the Caithness coast
next year. The Osprey, a full-scale 2MW prototype, is designed to generate
'clean, safe power' in a wide variety of off-shore sites.
'This is the first wave power device that can be mass-manufactured,' said Mr
Allan Thomson, managing director of Applied Research and Technology, the
Inverness-based engineering company developing Osprey.
Osprey will be installed close to AEA Technology's Dounreay nuclear plant
and be linked to the electrical grid by power lines installed for the
Dounreay Fast Reactor which is due to close next year.
It is a partially submerged bell-shaped device containing a column of water.
As the water rises and falls, it pushes air through a turbine. The project
is backed by the European Union, Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, British Steel, GEC Alsthom, Scottish Hydro-Electric and AEA
Technology.

FT  16 DEC 93 / British Gas to shed 20,000 jobs by 1997
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas's restructuring plans will lead to the loss of 20,000 jobs -
almost a third of its workforce - in the next three years, the company said
yesterday.
The company confirmed the figure after Unison, the public services union,
warned that the restructuring plans could lead to the loss of 40,000 jobs.
Mr Dave Stirzaker, the senior Unison official for the gas industry, said the
other job losses might be expected in support industries - such as
appliance-makers, contractors and distributors - if British Gas continued to
cut its UK investment programme.
He said most of the British Gas job cuts were expected to come from 12
regional offices which the union believes the company plans to close in its
move to create a divisional structure for the business.
British Gas said yesterday it was not yet in a position to announce how the
restructuring would go ahead.
The Society of British Gas Industries said yesterday that support industries
had already seen a severe shake-out in jobs. Mr John Cull, last year's
society president, said 40,000 jobs had been lost in the manufacturing and
contracting sectors since July 1992 and more might be expected to go without
new British Gas investment.
Mr Cull said Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommendations on the
splitting of British Gas were delaying investment in the industry.
Unison, which is campaigning against the MMC proposals, claimed that British
Gas investment abroad was taking funds out of the UK economy. It said: 'It
would be insane for the government knowingly to put at risk 40,000 jobs by
breaking up a company which is profitable, safe and efficient and which
invests more than Pounds 750m a year in the economy.'
The union is meeting British Gas on Monday and will consult its members in
the new year to try to head off mass redundancies.
UES Steels, the European Union's largest producer of engineering steels, is
to cut a further 400 jobs. The division of Rotherham-based UES Holdings has
already cut 500 jobs this year, reducing the workforce to about 4,200.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Court puts curbs on Nissan UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strict controls have been placed on the future conduct of business by Nissan
UK, the troubled former importer/distributor of Nissan cars, under the terms
of a High Court order agreed yester-day.
The Inland Revenue, which is seeking repayment of up to Pounds 238m from
Nissan UK, issued a petition last month for the winding up of the company.
This was followed by the appointment of provisional liquidators.
Under yesterday's order, the appointment of the liquidators has been
withdrawn. But the company, which was at the centre of Britain's biggest tax
fraud, has agreed to onerous conditions.
The winding-up petition was sought by the Revenue to prevent the company,
which is headed by Mr Octav Botnar and is now largely involved in property,
from disposing of its remaining assets prior to the resolution of the
Revenue's tax claim.
The Revenue petition will now be postponed until:
The appeal by Mr Michael Hunt, a former Nissan UK director, has been heard
against his conviction and eight-year prison sentence for his part in a
conspiracy to defraud the Revenue of Pounds 55m in corporation tax.
The company's appeal against the Revenue's tax claims has been resolved.
Mr Hunt's appeal is expected to be heard early next year, and the company's
tax appeal may be heard late in the year.
It is understood that the company made payments in gold bars worth several
million pounds earlier this year to Mr Botnar and to Mr Hunt.
Under the terms of yesterday's order all Nissan UK 'books, records and
documents' are to be removed and lodged with Jeffrey Green Russell, the
company's London solicitors. The company's entire issued share capital is to
be transferred from Nissan UK Holdings, whose ultimate parent company is the
Panama-incorporated European Motor Vehicles Corporation, to the four
directors of Nissan UK. They will hold the shares as nominees.
The four directors, Mr Frank Haddock, who is the company's local solicitor
in Worthing where it is based, Mr Brian Groves, Mr Botnar and Mr Manfred
Weder, have given court undertakings. These include to inform the court and
the Revenue about any attempt to change the make-up of the company's board,
or to remove any assets or alter the company's bank mandate.
The directors cannot resign without the court's permission. The company has
also agreed not to issue any new shares.
Nissan UK last night accused the Revenue of trying to 'destroy' the company.
It said the Revenue's objective in trying to wind up the company 'was
nothing less than an attempt to deprive Nissan UK of its right to defend
itself and its ability to pursue its legitimate claims.'

FT  16 DEC 93 / Draft rules issued for acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scope for companies to create provisions in acquired businesses would be
reduced by proposals issued yesterday by the Accounting Standards Board.
Fred 7, the financial reporting exposure draft on fair values in acquisition
accounting, would curtail one of the most common devices for creative
accounting in the late 1980s.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board, said: 'In the past it has proved
very difficult to see how profitable a company is for two to three years
after a major acquisition.'
The draft's key elements are:
Fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities in the acquired company
should reflect its position at the time of acquisition, and changes
resulting from the acquirer's intentions.
Accounts should not include provisions for future operating losses or
reorganisation costs after the acquisition.
Non-monetary assets should be valued at the lower of replacement cost and
recoverable amount at acquisition.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Go-ahead for Nuclear Electric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear Electric yesterday gained permission to sell electricity directly to
large commercial customers. Until now the state-owned utility has been
restricted to selling into the pool, the wholesale electricity market, David
Lascelles writes.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, said the move
would increase competition. He was satisfied that the concerns of other
generation companies about Nuclear Electric, which benefits from a nuclear
levy, had been taken into account, though he would monitor the new
arrangements closely.
The utility has indicated that it will seek long-term, fixed-price contracts
with industrial customers.
The move follows complaints about the practices of the generators National
Power and PowerGen. It also anticipates the planned enlargement of the
non-franchise market in April.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Electricity regulator to force reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, said
yesterday that he would not need to refer the UK's two main generators to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission providing he could reach agreement
with them on plant disposals and prices.
He said he had decided to take some action after his inquiry into the
generators' margins and costs. He expected to be able to decide by
mid-January whether a reference to the commission would be necessary.
Prof Littlechild said he had written to the electricity pool, the wholesale
market through which power is traded in England and Wales, to urge early
examination of several reforms including changes to the pricing mechanisms.
Some analysts interpreted his statement as welcome news for National Power
and PowerGen, arguing that his choice of words implied that his preference
was for avoiding a referral. Others said the regulator and the companies had
to overcome considerable obstacles to reach an accommodation. The generators
are extremely reluctant to accept either price controls or plant disposals.
Yesterday, the regulator said steps needed to be taken to 'ensure that
customers are adequately protected in future'. He wanted to open the way for
voluntary sale by the generators of some plant, and said he wanted
'assurances on prices for a reasonable period until a more competitive
market is achieved'.
National Power said it hoped to find a mutually satisfactory way forward
with the regulator. PowerGen said it believed a reference to the commission
was unnecessary but would face it with confidence.
Prof Littlechild's suggested examination of pool price reforms included the
possibility of allowing electricity to be traded outside the pool. He also
urged consideration of a change in pricing mechanisms so that generators
would be paid the price they ask for. At present the pool price is
determined by the price of the most expensive plant.
He also proposed measures aimed at reducing the cost of administration in
the pool price. He wants National Grid to assume responsibility for these
services from April.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Never again, vow weary negotiators - Where
now?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The likes of the Uruguay Round, mother of all trade negotiations, may never
be seen again. In fact, the very idea of a future trade round has now been
ditched. There will be further talks on such issues as agriculture and
services, where many trade barriers remain. New issues, certainly the links
between trade and the environment, will be debated. But they will not be
harnessed to each other in a global negotiation.
Arguably, in 1986 the sprawling and unwieldy Uruguay Round agenda was
necessary to secure the support of all Gatt members to launch the talks,
from the US with its emphasis on new issues such as services and
intellectual property, to developing countries which wanted more open
markets for their exports of farm and textile products.
But the sheer breadth and complexity of the Round, coupled with the huge
number of countries involved (117 by the end), came close to being its
undoing. With 'nothing agreed until everything is agreed', the talks were
hostage to every blockage along the way.
Officials have vowed never to repeat the gruelling experience of the past
seven years. Throughout the Uruguay Round agreement, provisions exist for
further reviews and negotiations on fixed timetables in different areas,
none of them linked. In agriculture, the Uruguay Round deal is seen as part
of a continuing process to cut farm subsidies and protection. The present
agreement calls for cuts over six years, before which there must be another
negotiation to decide what happens next.
The services accord requires countries to begin a new round of talks within
five years of coming into force and 'periodically thereafter'. The present
accord is seen as the start of a long process of services liberalisation, in
the same way as Gatt has progressively reduced trade barriers for goods over
45 years.
All this will be welcome news to proponents of the many new issues now being
pressed onto the international trade agenda. They have less risk of running
into the sand because some other Gatt member has not got its own pet concern
on the slate.
Topping the list of the new World Trade Organisation's future concerns will
be the interaction of environmental and trade policies, and how to promote
sustainable development and ecological well-being without resorting to
protectionism.
Environmental groups have waged a noisy campaign to 'green the Gatt'; most
industrialised countries admit, with hindsight, this area should have been
tackled earlier. But the highly complex issues involved in the
environment/trade debate could not have been adequately tackled in a round
dangerously overloaded with other matters.
Gatt members have agreed to draw up a work programme on trade and the
environment to be approved by ministers next April when they sign the
Uruguay Round accord. The work programme will include the possibility of
changes to international fair trade rules to accommodate environmental
concerns.
Many other areas exist for possible action by the WTO, but a common theme is
'levelling the playing field' by requiring certain minimum norms in domestic
policies that impinge on economic competitiveness. This follows naturally
from the Uruguay Round which broke new ground by introducing rules covering
the previously sovereign area of domestic policy-making. Proposed new areas
include:
Competition policy: in 1992 Sir Leon Brittan, then EC competition
commissioner, proposed a strong role for Gatt in drafting and enforcing
international competition rules covering subsidies, cartels, merger policy
and public monopolies. This proposal was taken up more recently by Mr Karel
Van Miert, the EU's current competition supremo.
As tariff and non-tariff barriers are cleared away, these 'private barriers
to trade' are increasingly the most important obstacle to corporate
expansion, Mr Van Miert said in October. Like the new rules agreed on
intellectual property in the Uruguay Round, the idea would be to have common
minimum standards for handling restrictive business practices, effectively
enforced, with the WTO as an international forum for handling disputes.
'One should not even dream about a worldwide and independent competition
agency at this stage', Mr Van Miert acknowledged.
Investment: foreign direct investment now drives international trade flows.
Multinationals now account for a third of total world trade. The limited
Uruguay Round agreement on trade-related investment measures presages the
possibility of complementary rules on investment and competition more
generally.
A Gatt for investment would lay down basic fair trade principles and might
require countries to grant establishment rights to foreign companies. This
idea was anathema to developing countries when the Uruguay Round started but
they have since competed to attract overseas investment; some have become
big foreign investors in their own right.
Worker rights: the US has repeatedly and unsuccessfully pressed for
discussion of common international standards on worker rights, an idea
strongly opposed by poor nations who fear another excuse for protectionism.
France and Mr Jacques Delors, EU president, have voiced support for a Gatt
agreement on social issues. But confusion exists about whether such talks
would focus on economic standards such as minimum wages or basic human
rights ones, such as freedom to form unions and bargain collectively.
Developing countries: Poor nations are keen on new rules to help prop up
commodities prices. They want more liberalisation of trade in labour
services. Rich nations have so far agreed only to freer movement for
managerial and highly-skilled workers, but further talks will be held.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Public won over to Gatt cause - Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In recent weeks Japanese bureaucrats, business leaders, politicians and
media have shown unusual solidarity in rallying behind the cause of world
trade reform.
The message they brought to the Japanese public has been straightforward -
as a nation of few resources, Japan depends heavily on maintaining global
free trade and failure of the Uruguay Round could jeopardise the country's
economic foundations.
Japan's acceptance of the accord is a testimony to the success with which
that message has been delivered.
The benefits to be derived from the successful conclusion of the Round,
though substantial, will only have come at a high cost. The deal on rice
imports threatened to split the Social Democratic Party and topple the
coalition led by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, who was criticised for his handling
of the affair. The denial to the last moment by members of the government,
including Mr Hosokawa, that a deal on rice existed, could be a costly
mistake for the prime minister, who is sustained in power largely by his
high popularity rating.
It has long been agreed that the country's main industries will benefit from
tariff reductions for electronics, particularly in the EU, and lower tariffs
for construction machinery and other manufactured goods.
It has become increasingly clear in recent years that the advantages to
Japan of agreement on Gatt are not restricted to the substantial growth in
trade that might be expected.
As a country which not only depends on the free flow of goods for its wealth
but which has come under growing criticism from its trading partners, Japan
has much to gain from a strengthened international organisation which could
set the rules for global trade and arbitrate in disputes.
The importance to Japan of a multilateral trading organisation such as Gatt
has been underlined in recent years by its many trade disputes with its
major trading partners, in particular the US.
Demands by the US that Japan set quantitative indicators to boost imports of
foreign products, abuse of anti-dumping measures by its trading partners and
disagreements between the US and Japan threatening to lead to sanctions,
have highlighted the need for clearly defined multilateral trading rules and
a dispute settlement organisation to prevent damaging unilateral action.
The drive in Japan to support a stronger multilateral trade system has been
helped by its unfortunate experience with several bilateral trade
agreements, such as the semiconductor arrangement with the US under which
Japan is supposed to increase the foreign share of its semiconductor market
to 20 per cent.
Simultaneously and more fundamentally, a successful Round will help the
country take difficult steps towards restructuring its economy.
Public opinion has been increasingly won over to the need for reform to
Japan's outdated agricultural system or to the relationship between
government and the private sector. But the will to confront such sensitive
issues would probably not have arisen without outside pressure.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Europe and China stand to gain most - Winners
and Losers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD:
Estimates of the boost to the world economy from tariff-cutting on goods
range from Dollars 212bn-Dollars 270bn a year at the end of 10 years. These
figures underestimate the likely total gain because they do not include
benefits from services trade liberalisation, stronger trade rules and
greater business confidence.
A World Bank/OECD study says 90 per cent of the benefit of Dollars 213bn a
year comes from farm trade reform, with the rest reflecting tariff cuts on
industrial goods. OECD countries reap two-thirds of the benefit from trade
liberalisation in goods and almost all the gains from liberalisation of
services.
Most countries - rich and poor - will gain on balance but some, notably poor
food importers, will be worse off. Consumers and efficient producers will
benefit around the world but sectors losing trade protection, especially
farmers in rich countries, will lose. Fairer trading rules and better market
access will help countries in the process of economic reform, whether
developing or former communist nations, which have liberalised their trade
regimes to stimulate export-led growth.
THE WINNERS: The European Union is by far the biggest winner from the round
(gaining Dollars 80bn a year on World Bank/OECD figures). This is mostly due
to farm trade reform which will reduce farm subsidies and, by cutting food
prices, boost consumers' incomes. As the world's biggest exporter, the EU
will also benefit from more open markets for its goods and services.
The seven members of the European Free Trade Association also do well. They
now subsidise their farmers even more generously than the EU and are big
exporters of industrial goods and services.
China is the second largest winner, mainly from textiles liberalisation.
Though China is not yet a Gatt member, it is a member of the restrictive
Multi-Fibre Arrangement which will be phased out over 10 years. Other east
Asian economies will benefit from better market access for their exports.
Japan and the US gain from market-opening abroad and farm trade reform at
home, especially - for Japan - the opening of its rice market.
The 14-strong Cairns Group of agricultural exporters win big benefits from
better access to world markets for their efficient farmers.
THE LOSERS: 'Unequivocal losers,' at least in the short term, are poor net
food importers who will have to pay higher prices for food in world markets
as US and EU export subsidies are cut, and countries receiving trade
preferences in industrialised-country markets, the value of which will fall
as tariffs are lowered.
These countries include virtually all of Africa. Indonesia is also a big
loser as are Caribbean nations whose relatively high-cost exports of
textiles and bananas now benefit from preferences in the US and EU.
In the longer term, these countries, too, should gain from the Round - first
and foremost from better trading rules that protect the interests of small
nations against bullying by the giants, second because higher food prices
are likely to lift farmers' incomes and eventual food production, and third
because they should benefit from a rise in world prosperity.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Developing countries ponder the fruits of
trade accord - Third World
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only when the Genevan dust has settled, and the details of the Uruguay Round
agreement are finally available, will developing countries be able to assess
whether they have granted more trade concessions, on the Gatt's conventional
mercantilist calculus, than they have gained in return.
Late last month, the Gatt secretariat produced a report, which appeared to
suggest that developing countries had made substantially greater trade
concessions than their developed country partners. But trade sources in
Geneva report, however, that new tariff reduction offers were arriving right
up to the Round deadline and that the final outcome is likely to be
significantly more liberal.
Mr Balkrishan Zutshi, India's ambassador to the Gatt, is less sure. He
certainly believes that his country has given more than it got. He says that
India has cut its average trade-weighted tariff for non-consumer industrial
goods by 55 per cent, albeit from a high base, while the European Union cut
its average tariff to India by 22 per cent and the US by 18 per cent.
'As far as market access is concerned, there is a feeling that developing
countries have put in more than they've got in return,' he says.
In New Delhi, Indian deputies paralysed parliament yesterday in protest over
New Delhi's endorsement of the trade deal but agreed that there was little
they could do to reverse the decision.
The ambassador's sentiment seems to be borne out by early Gatt estimates.
Using figures based on offers made up to November 19, the secretariat
estimates that the percentage of developing country industrial exports now
subject to tariff bindings has risen from 21 per cent to 65 per cent, while
agricultural tariff binding has risen even more dramatically from 17 per
cent to 89 per cent as a result of the Round. Developed country binding
percentages remain higher but the increases are much less dramatic.
In return, developing countries appear to have got less in return than
richer countries from developed country liberalisation. The average
trade-weighted tariff on industrial imports to developed countries has
fallen, based on provisional Gatt figures, by 38 per cent as a result of the
deal. But average tariffs on imports from developing countries have fallen
32 per cent while the tariff on least-developed country imports has fallen
by just 19 per cent and remains some two-thirds higher than that on
developed country imports.
One reason for these rather dramatic figures, Gatt officials explain, is
developed country barriers to textile trade embodied in the Multi-Fibre
Arrangement, now due to be phased out over the next ten years. When the
effective tariff rates implied by MFA quotas are included, or textile and
fish imports excluded, the picture for developing countries looks
considerably better.
Moreover, Gatt officials point out, simple comparisons of tariff cuts fail
to appreciate the benefits to developing countries of the accord: the
strengthening of the rules-based world trading regime and the domestic gains
from cutting national trade barriers. A recent OECD study of the welfare
effects of liberalisation estimates non-OECD countries would gain Dollars
29.9m if OECD countries alone cut their trade barriers, but Dollars 86.4bn
if non-OECD countries also liberalise.
Indeed, the most dramatic change during the Uruguay Round has been the
switch in the attitude of developing countries, including India, from
opposing reductions in trade barriers to unilaterally cutting their own
tariff barriers in order to foster export-led growth. Ironically, it has
been developed countries which have dragged their feet over making the
concessions necessary to reach agreement.
'Back in 1986 we had two superpowers, the Berlin wall, developing counties
had not embraced the process of autonomous liberalisation and industrialised
countries were not in recession,' says Mr Balkrishan Zutshi. 'The Uruguay
Round has been completed in a very different world.'

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Gatt Deal: The people who made the Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner (above), and his American
counterpart, Mr Mickey Kantor, are both 54-year-old lawyers of Lithuanian
Jewish origin. But otherwise they have little in common.
Sir Leon, a former minister in Mrs Margaret Thatcher's cabinet, cultivates a
languid superiority that has not always served him well in Brussels, despite
his acknowledged intellectual gifts and prodigious hard work.
After a sticky start, he and Mr Kantor managed to put their relationship on
a workable footing.
Over the course of this year the two men met a dozen times to thrash out key
Uruguay Round issues, knowing that responsibility for the success of the
Round lay on their shoulders.
Sir Leon's insistence in tackling French trade obstinacy head-on could have
jeopardised united EU support for the Round and raised questions on his
political touch.
But Sir Leon finally persuaded Paris that he was an impartial and tough
champion of European interests, despite being British and therefore a
suspect 'Anglo-Saxon'.
Pulling off a Gatt agreement will do wonders for Sir Leon's reputation in
Brussels and will serve him well in his candidacy for the EU's top job of
Commission president when Mr Jacques Delors stands down at the end of 1994.
'In the beginning Mickey wanted to look dangerous, to show he was not afraid
of breaking some furniture,' says a US acquaintance of Mr Kantor, the US
trade repres- entative (left). Whatever the reason, early pronouncements of
this trade novice and former Clinton campaigner instilled anxiety around the
world.
Imposition of punitive duties on steel (though initiated by the Bush
administration) and sanction threats against the EU over government procure-
ment raised fears that, with Mr Kantor in charge, the Uru- guay Round was a
dead duck.
The pessimists were wrong. With completion of the Uruguay Round a key comp-
onent in President Bill Clinton's emerging geopolitical strat- egy, the
baseball-loving lawyer defined his job as securing the best possible
settlement for the US. He proved a flex- ible negotiator, if a tough one.
Mr Kantor and Mr Clinton have already proclaimed the Uruguay Round 'a
victory for the American people' and begun the necessary selling job to
Americans and their representatives.
Mr Bill Brock became US trade representative in 1982 and quickly became the
foremost advocate of a new trade round. He was first to insist the round
should include such issues as services, intellectual property and
investment, as well as traditional areas such as tariffs. This line, pushed
by his successor, Mr Clayton Yeutter, not only prevailed but has resulted in
more compreh- ensive agreements than Mr Brock can have dreamed of.
A spry septuagenarian and competitor for Gatt's top job this year, Mr Julio
Lacarte- Muro (above), could be called 'father of Gatt'. He was in on
negotiations which established Gatt in 1947, becoming deputy executive
secretary of the organisation at its inception. During three tours of duty
as Uruguay's Gatt ambassador in Geneva, he was chairman of Gatt's governing
council and of the contracting parties (members). He has taken part in all
eight trade-liberalising Gatt rounds, and was instrumental in persuading
Gatt members to choose Punta del Este - the fashionable seaside resort where
he has a holiday home - to launch the Uruguay Round in 1986. As Uruguay's
chief negotiator in the latest Round, he played an influential role in
securing the backing of Latin American countries for an open multilateral
trading system.
The wheel came full circle for him when this autumn he was made a 'friend of
the chair', mediating on Mr Sutherland's behalf in difficult negotiations on
creation of a World Trade Organisation. An International Trade Organisation
was centrepiece of the 1948 Havana Charter which he helped draw up, only to
see it vetoed by the US Congress.
Brazil's Gatt ambassador immediately before and after the Uruguay Round
launch in 1986, Mr Paulo Nogueira Batista (left) is remembered as the man
who tried on every possible occasion to sink the negotiations - and failed.
With his inseparable companion-in-arms, Mr Shrirang Shukla, India's Gatt
ambassador, Mr Batista fought tooth and nail to keep the new issues of
services, intellectual property and investment measures off the Uruguay
Round agenda.
A lawyer described as a 'relentless negotiator', Mrs Carla Hills combined
tough rhetoric with a tempering sense of realism as US trade representative
from 1989 to 1993. While threatening trading partners with the 'crowbar' of
unilateral action to open up their markets, she used these powers with
marked restraint. While frequently intoning that no agreement was better
than a bad agreement, she worked unfailingly for a Uruguay Round settlement.
Mr Peter Sutherland, a pugnacious former rugby player and EC competition
supremo, became Gatt director-general from July 1993. He used a potent
mixture of Irish eloquence and, in his own words, 'putting in the jackboot'
to cajole and bully governments into closing the Uruguay Round deal.
He criss-crossed the globe to meet political leaders, key officials and
opinion-formers in every important trading country.
In speech after speech he hammered home the message that the Uruguay Round
was essential to world economic security and that failure would be
catastrophic. Governments believed him.
Mr Sutherland has described his Uruguay Round role as a facilitator but this
scarcely does justice to his energetic 'hands-on' approach to securing the
final accord. He has also been an active champion of the interests of the
poorest developing countries.
Mr Sutherland can now look forward to becoming the first head of the World
Trade Organisation, on equal terms with his counterparts at the IMF and
World Bank.
'The Uruguay Round will remain his personal legacy to the world,' Mr Peter
Sutherland said of his predecessor in the job, Mr Arthur Dunkel (above). The
final package of Uruguay Round rules - on everything from textiles to
trademarks - follows in large measure the 'Dunkel draft' of December 1991.
The former Swiss trade negotiator was also instrumental in persuading
developing countries to fall in with US demands in the mid-1980s for a new
trade round and in ensuring a fair hearing for their concerns. When the
talks broke down over farm trade at the mid-term review in Montreal in 1988,
it was Mr Dunkel who got the show back on the road. Mr Dunkel once said that
one of his qualifications for the job was being Swiss - supposedly neutral
and not likely to offend anyone. Yet this chainsmoking workaholic proved a
shrewd diplomat, a skilful mediator and an able advocate of freer trade.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: US policy albatross turns into an eagle -
Clinton keeps eye on broader goal / United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
For their staff, all presidents mostly walk on water. Thus it was not
surprising to hear Mr Sandy Berger, the deputy national security adviser,
portray both the successful resolution of the Uruguay Round and the
ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement a month earlier as
the vindication of President Bill Clinton's determination to change some of
the underlying principles of the way the US looks at the world outside.
First, he said, both demonstrated that 'economic security is now on the
front burner of American foreign policy'. Second, they proved what Mr
Clinton had been preaching in last year's campaign, that the walls between
US domestic and foreign policy were going to be broken down.
Six short weeks ago there appeared the measurable risk that trade policy
would be the albatross around the neck of US foreign relations, not the
eagle leading it upwards.
The dark scenario had, in order: Nafta falling to defeat in Congress,
leading to an embarrassing Asian summit, followed by an inability to break
the Uruguay Round impasse mostly because of disagreements with the European
Union, spilling over into an acrimonious Nato summit next month - a sequence
in which the absence of US leadership would be widely condemned.
None of this has come to pass because the Clinton administration has shown
itself, in the crunch, willing to cut a deal, even when it said it would
not, in the pursuit of the broader goal. It was true of Nafta, which 60 per
cent of the Democratic party opposed, and of the Round.
Much of the individual credit on the US side must lie with Mr Mickey Kantor,
the trade representative and negotiator extraordinaire, who can never again
be accused by sniffy Europeans and Washington trade experts of not knowing
his brief. But he takes his instructions from his president - and, on both
Nafta and the Round, Bill Clinton was intimately involved in much of the
fine print.
This produces something of a paradox. A Democratic president, a suspected
mercantilist who is the titular head of a party with protectionist
inclinations, can claim credit for completing the Round where his two
Republican free trading predecessors failed.
He still has to get the Round approved by Congress, probably next spring,
but the lessons of the uphill Nafta campaign have been well learned and the
selling has already started.
Opposition can be expected from the anti-Nafta coalition, led by unions and
environmentalists, and from some industries dissatisfied with the Round, but
the political prognosis at this stage is generally favourable, especially
now Congressman Richard Gephardt, Democratic majority leader, has been
reassured by the anti-dumping agreement.
Yet, equally paradoxically, success does not resolve many of the doubts
about the direction of US trade policy. Indeed, it may even increase them.
If France has been able to claim success for its insistence on degrees of
protection, then the tight Clinton trade team, also now riding high, is
unlikely to be susceptible to theoretical arguments that its pursuit of what
it considers to be 'fair' or 'managed' or 'results-oriented' trade is
wrong-headed.
Whatever was ceded for good tactical reasons in the final negotiations -
reformulating Blair House, agreeing to disagree on audio-visual trade and
financial services - does not mean the US intends to be less muscular in its
approach. Nor has it surrendered many of the tools, in the shape of US laws,
to make its goals stick. It will continue to press, after the agreed
interval, for greater access for its banks and brokers, especially in Japan
and other Asian countries.
Having raised the stakes so high, it cannot again disappoint its Hollywood
backers by not seeking a better arrangement with the European Union in
audio-visual trade.
It will still lean heavily on countries such as Japan to obtain bigger
market-opening initiatives for a wide range of goods and services, and only
partly because there are lobbies in Washington with reservations about what
was achieved in the Round.
To be fair, Mr Clinton has never deviated from his promise to pry open
foreign markets for US exporters. It was the subject of one of his earliest
campaign speeches and he has consistently expressed the same view ever
since. As he has frequently put it, the choice is simple - either 'compete
or retreat.'
Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, repeatedly says that he
considers himself and the US diplomatic service to be representatives of US
commercial interest.
It may be ironic that trade policy, which featured, against some
expectations, so little in last year's presidential elections, should be the
area in which President Clinton has achieved so much in his first year. He
is unlikely to rest on these laurels, above all not now that the Japanese
trade surplus is showing signs of declining for the first time in three
years.

Union countries - Europe

Amid the euphoria in Brussels yesterday, it was easy to exaggerate the
immediate impact of a Gatt world trade deal on the European Union.
A conclusion of the Uruguay Round will not cure the worst recession since
1974. The number of people out of work in Europe will still rise to nearly
20m next year. Once member countries see the fine print of the text agreed
in the multilateral negotiations in Geneva, the bickering will begin again.
But to dwell on these points is to miss the big picture. After a period of
drift and paralysis, Europe has managed to settle its internal differences
and act coherently on the world stage.
A hard-fought Gatt agreement, in which Europe was seen to defend its vital
commercial interest, may come to be viewed as a psychological turning-point,
however much French brinkmanship tested the collective nerve.
Europe has been trapped in crisis for the past 18 months, starting with the
Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty in June 1992. This was followed by
the 'petit oui' to Maastricht in France, and, in August, the collapse of the
European exchange rate mechanism, and the continuing civil war in former
Yugoslavia.
Divisions over trade were, potentially, more explosive. In the run-up to the
December 15 deadline, diplomats in Brussels warned that failure to reach a
Gatt deal could crack the Franco-German alliance which remains the anchor of
the European Union, whatever its present strains.
Export-dependent German industry was adamant that no amount of concern over
5m French farmers should sabotage a successful conclusion of the Uruguay
Round. A Gaullist-led government in France, trapped by its aggressive
election campaign rhetoric, warned that it would not countenance a deal
which overrode its national interests.
The stand-off within the EU - and the ensuing complications in negotiations
with the US - risked a slide into 1930s-style protectionism and the end of a
common European trade policy. A de facto split beckoned between 'northern
liberals' including the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, and a
French-led protectionist-leaning rump including Greece, Spain, and Portugal.
French demands for stronger European trade weapons mirror this division. For
Germany and the UK, the principle that a free-trade leaning minority can use
their combined voting weight to thwart trade retaliation dates back to the
1958 Treaty of Rome.
For France and her allies, the question is whether Europe can punch her
weight in international trade not just against the US and Japan, but also
against the rising might of China and East Asia.
At yesterday's meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, a compromise on
aspects of the trade weapons debate appeared in sight. 'If we can get a
deal, it would end months of mutual suspicion,' said one diplomat.
For the European Commission, a Gatt deal marks a second triumph in less than
week, the first being the better-than-expected reception which heads of
government gave to the white paper on employment, growth and competitiveness
at the Brussels summit. For Sir Leon Brittan, the chief EU trade negotiator,
it marks the progression from intellectual heavyweight to deal-maker on a
grand scale and a serious candidate to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as
Commission president.
The difficulty now will be to keep up momentum. One senior EU official says
that the current state of play in international trade resembles the
political debate in Europe in the 1950s when states had to choose between a
free trade area and strong institutional mechanisms to manage the customs
union and harmonise economic policies.
In this view, today's gains must be translated into tomorrow's lasting trade
framework to cover exchange rate movements, the environment, competition,
and social policy, including low wage labour.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As President Bill Clinton tries to push the Gatt accord through Congress, he
might well envy the tactics of Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister,
who yesterday wrapped the controversial deal up with quite unrelated
promises of future tax cuts and aid to women and the aged.
Using the pecularities of French parliamentary procedure, Mr Balladur
yesterday ensured overwhelming support for the Gatt deal by tabling a vote
of confidence not only on the trade agreements but also in his government's
overall past performance and future pledges.
Nonetheless, he devoted most of his hour-long speech to the Gatt deal, which
he said was in the long-term interest of France, the world's fourth largest
exporter. It would not bring 'miraculous gains', but in opening markets 'in
agriculture, industry and services, it respects the fundamental interests of
France'.
Specifically, he claimed that France had won:
Tariff concessions for its exports, particularly in steel, chemicals,
pharmaceuticals and perfumes.
Protection of its copyrights in textiles, foodstuffs, luxury and
pharmaceutical goods.
Gains for its banks and insurance companies to expand abroad in the service
area, which accounts for 60 per cent of French exports.
Some protection for vulnerable sectors like aluminium and consumer
electronics.
The ability to go on funding aircraft-making.
On the two most controversial areas for France - audiovisual broadcasting
and agriculture - he claimed success for his own personal intervention with
President Clinton, warning him last Sunday night that 'France would sign no
agreement that jeopardised its cultural identity'.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Farm trade deal could lead to 10% price rise
 -Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Gatt farm trade deal could lead to a 10 per cent rise in world
agriculture prices in spite of expected increases in production, as it
limits the dumping of subsidised food exports on world markets.
Export subsidies by the US and European Union have depressed world prices in
recent years. The Gatt deal will mean 50m tonnes less subsidised wheat on
world markets from 1995 to 2000, changing the wheat trade from one almost
dominated by subsidies to one approaching free trade.
Reductions in farm income support will remove important distortions to world
farm trade. The deal also begins to open up more markets worldwide by
converting barriers to farm imports into monetary tariffs which are then
reduced.
The inclusion of agriculture in the Uruguay Round brings farming into a set
of international rules for the first time. It also sets important precedents
for future negotiations over farm trade - tariffs, for example, are much
easier to reduce in future than non-tariff barriers to trade.
Most analysis of the effects of the deal is hypothetical, but many
economists say world prices will rise as subsidised exports are reduced.
'Current world prices equal production costs minus the average of US and EU
subsidies. As subsidies are knocked off, prices will rise,' said Mr Brian
Gardner, director of EPA Associates, the farm consultancy in Brussels.
Outright winners from the deal will be farmers in Australia, Argentina and
to a lesser extent, New Zealand - among the so-called Cairns group of
negotiating countries - which can produce more and will enjoy wider access
to previously closed markets. Australia estimates it will raise agricultural
exports by over Dollars 1bn.
These exporters will not necessarily be looking to target directly the US
and European Union, since countries need only guarantee access for up to 5
per cent of the market for a particular product. But they will be looking to
ship to huge markets in Russia and China which were previously supplied by
subsidised products from the US and EU.
The value of subsidised exports must be reduced over six years under the
terms of the now-infamous Blair House accord by 36 per cent below a base
period of 1986 to 1990. At the same time, the quantity of these subsidised
exports must be cut by 21 per cent.
These are the provisions which almost brought the entire agreement to its
knees when the French government called for modifications, fearing their
farmers would lose export markets.
The US and EU later agreed to stage the cuts from a higher 1991-1992 base
line, allowing European farmers to export an extra 8m tonnes of cereals over
the six-year period.
Europe has managed to preserve direct payments to farmers as compensation
for falling prices. Although income support for farmers must be reduced by
20 per cent in developed countries over the life of the deal - 13.3 per cent
in developing countries - the EU gained exemptions for some direct payments.
This means farmers can still be paid for growing less and for structural
adjustment which is an important part of reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy.
The EU farm industry will see its income decline in the short term, although
this can be attributed more to CAP reform than to the Gatt settlement. In
the long run, farmers can make up for reductions in their artificially high
support prices by increasing output or improving productivity.
At the same time, introduction of tariffs to imports rather than non-tariff
barriers will afford European farmers even greater protection than they
enjoy now. But these tariffs will be reduced by 36 per cent over six years
for developed countries - 24 per cent for developing countries over 10
years.
The tariff issue has caused great controversy in Japan and South Korea -
where governments have for years enforced bans on all rice imports, a
non-tariff barrier which is difficult to convert into a monetary levy.
Canada's supply management system will also have to be altered.
The wider effects of an overall Gatt deal are expected to boost incomes in
many countries, leading to rising demand for food products. This in turn is
likely to feed through into higher prices. But developing countries which
are largely dependent on food imports will lose out because they will be
forced to pay more.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Dumping accord proved a watershed - Clearer
guidelines for deciding whether injury has been caused / Anti-Dumping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Settlement last Sunday of a fiercely fought row over a US attempt to dilute
international restraint on the use of anti-dumping laws was a watershed for
the Round, and a clear signal the critical compromises were at last being
made on all sides.
Negotiators then realised that if disagreements as apparently intractable as
those over anti-dumping could be resolved, the way was clear for other
out-tanding disagreements to be settled.
The gavel began falling almost immediately on the great majority of the
Uruguay Round agreement.
The new anti-dumping agreement provides for greater clarity and more
detailed rules for deciding whether a product is dumped.
It provides clearer guidelines for deciding whether injury is caused, and
the procedures for anti-dumping invest-igation.
It sets rules on how long anti-dumping actions can remain in force.
On deciding whether a product is dumped, the agreement sets new rules for
comparing the normal price of a product with the export price.
It aims to curb practices of arbitrarily creating or inflating dumping
margins.
Among the new procedures, it will be easier for interested parties to
present evidence in investigations.
Preliminary and final findings in anti-dumping actions will be notified to
interested parties promptly and in detail.
This was in answer to complaints that Gatt panels were too secretive, and
never revealed how they reached a conclusion.
Labour unions as well as companies will be able to bring complaints to the
attention of governments.
But investigations will be terminated immediately if a dumping margin is
found to be de minimis (defined as less than 2 per cent of the export price
of the product) or if the volume of dumped goods is negligible - generally
when the volume of dumped goods from an individual country account for less
than 3 per cent of the imports of the product in question.
Gatt panels estab-lished to examine the results of a dumping investigation
will not be allowed to re-examine the facts of the case - the US was
adamantly opposed to this power - but will be able to look at how the case
was handled.
Careful fudges have been needed to ensure that lobbies back home see the
gains, rather than losses, that have been involved in the process.
Of the changes demanded by the US to the text of the Uruguay round
anti-dumping agreement, US negotiators will tell their domestic audience
that it has scored eight out of 11.
Its key 'victory' has been to win agreement over 'standards of review',
where the US had been protesting at proposed new Gatt powers to re-examine
not just the handling of a dumping case, but the facts presented to it.
For opponents of the US proposals, there will be relief that demands for
stricter anti-circumvention rules have been rejected, and that the 'sunset'
clause forcing a dumping duty to expire after a certain number of years
would be protected.
The US will no longer be able to retain dumping duties indefinitely. Over 10
per cent of US dumping duties have been in place for more than 20 years.
'Trying to read this agreement is rather like reading goat's entrails,' one
dumping negotiator commented.
'We will all be looking at the same thing, but the US will tell its domestic
audience one thing, and others will tell their domestic lobbies another. He
insisted that the compromise outcome 'is at least less ambiguous than the
original US proposals'.
For Gatt negotiators, the compromise is historic: 'Every previous deal has
had to be imposed on countries with unreconciled disagreements,' he said:
'This is the first agreed text ever achieved in the area of anti-dumping,'
one said.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: WTO, a new name heralds new powers - US gets
its own back on the European Union / Disputes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The US knows how to play a mean game of poker. It formally agreed only
yesterday to the establishment of a new, more powerful, world trade body
which will take trade in goods, services and ideas under its wing.
Then, just as everyone was breathing a sigh of relief, it said it would do
so only on condition the name was changed, from the Multilateral Trade
Organisation to the World Trade Organisation.
It is hard not to see this as the US getting its own back on the European
Union, and particularly the French, which proposed the original MTO name.
But World Trade Organisation it is.
Washington's reluctance to sign up to a WTO reflected anxiety by US
negotiators that it might pose an unnecessary difficulty in pushing the
Uruguay Round package through Congress, always suspicious of a threat to its
sovereign powers in trade policy.
This has been a sensitive issue ever since Congress vetoed the International
Trade Organisation, which was to have been the third Bretton Woods pillar
alongside the IMF and World Bank.
Withholding US consent to the WTO also proved a useful bargaining chip in
negotiations with the EU which, along with Canada, put forward the WTO
proposal in 1990.
European negotiators, chivvied by France, had made establishment of a WTO a
key Uruguay Round objective, in order to place multilateral curbs on US
unilateral trade action.
The fact that the US has now agreed to endorse the WTO is thus significant
in two ways: it signals that, in the administration's view at least, it has
a good and sellable Uruguay Round accord in the bag; and it reflects an
acceptance of new curbs on its unilateral powers in return for a much
stronger multilateral disputes mechanism.
Under the agreement on disputes procedures, to be administered by the WTO,
countries agree to use multilateral remedies wherever are available.
This is already the case in Gatt but, since the WTO will now cover not only
trade in goods but also in services and intellectual property, the scope for
unilateral action will be considerably narrowed.
Washington has acknowledged that its controversial Section 301 trade law
authorising reprisals against unfair traders will not get as much use in
future, but say the new disputes settlement procedure will be a good
substitute.
It is particularly pleased to have secured the principle of
cross-retaliation - that countries can take reprisals against goods trade,
say, if a trading partner breaches fair trade rules on services.
The WTO will operate the same mechanism for settling disputes across the
trade spectrum, replacing the separate systems operated by Gatt and its
various voluntary codes.
In addition, 'dispute resolution will become more timely, automatic and
binding,' says a US factsheet issued on Tuesday. 'When we take a case to a
Gatt dispute settlement panel and win, we know that the report will be
adopted and that we can retaliate if the other country does not respond.'
The factsheet, perhaps deliberately, does not make clear that this
retaliation would be with WTO authorisation, if offending countries failed
to implement panel reports or pay adequate compensation.
Administratively, the WTO will be an umbrella organisation encompassing the
Gatt and sister bodies on services and intellectual property, and headed by
a ministerial conference meeting at least once every two years.
A WTO council at official level will run the organisation's affairs and turn
itself as needed into a body to arbitrate disputes and review members' trade
policies.
Membership of the WTO will mean accepting all the results of the Uruguay
Round without exception. The expectation is that most if not all Gatt's 114
members will join.
The WTO will operate, as Gatt now does, on the basis of consensus. The main
exception is dispute settlement where offending countries will no longer be
able to block adoption of panel reports.
Countries will have a new right of appeal against panel verdicts but, if
this fails, they will be required to put things to rights, pay compensation
to trading partners, or face authorised trade reprisals.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: The longest round of all
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
5 November: Geneva. Gatt members agree to establish a preparatory committee
to draw up an agenda for the new round, but arguments persist over inclusion
of services and the priority to be given to Third World interests. Paris
signals worries on farm export subsidies.
1986
July: Geneva. Preparatory committee ends with two draft agendas, one
compiled by OECD and the other by developing countries. Switzerland and
Colombia produce compromise 'cafe au lait' draft finally vetoed by France
over farm trade.
August: Cairns, Australia. Fourteen food-exporting countries set up a group
to represent their interests.
September: Punta del Este. Uruguay Round launched in a fashionable seaside
resort. US bulldozes services, intellectual property and foreign investment
restrictions on to agenda despite objections from developing countries led
by India and Brazil. EC reluctantly agrees to inclusion of agriculture as
part of 'global package'.
1987
January: Formal negotiations begin in 15 subject areas.
July: US tables audacious plan to scrap all farm subsidies within 10 years.
EC reacts with incredulity.
1988
December: Montreal. Mid-term review. Agricultural discord prevents
agreements on intellectual property, safeguards (emergency import
protection) and textiles. Ministers agree a negotiating framework for
services, lower trade barriers for tropical products, improved disputes
settlement and country policy reviews.
1989
April: Geneva. US backs down on farm subsidies, with final agreement
referring only to 'substantial progressive reductions' in trade-distorting
farm supports.
1990
January: Geneva. US blocks majority preference for 'formula' approach to
tariff-cutting across the board, which would have forced bigger reductions
in high tariffs such as US textile duties. Negotiators obliged to bargain
line by line, country by country. July: Houston. Leaders of the seven
biggest industrialised nations pledge to complete the Round by the end of
the year. This pledge will be repeated in 1991 (London), 1992 (Munich) and
1993 (Tokyo), stretching G7's credibility. December: Brussels. Ministerial
meeting. Trade ministers from 107 countries accompanied by several thousand
officials, journalists and hangers-on, acrimoniously fail to conclude the
Round. Discussions again founder over agriculture. Argentina and other Latin
American nations walk out.
1991
May: Washington. Congress grants President Bush a two-year extension of
'fast-track' negotiating authority. December: Arthur Dunkel, Gatt
director-general, attempts to force negotiators' hands by compiling a
complete draft package of accords - the 'draft final act'. France denounces
the agricultural text before it is published, and the EC later demands
'substantial improvement' to the Dunkel draft.
1992
May: Brussels. EC members agree plans for radical reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy, virtually to eliminate export subsidies and cut support
prices.
November: Washington. US and EC agree terms for reducing EC exports of
subsidised farm goods. The 'Blair House' accord paves the way for resumption
of the negotiations but is bitterly contested by Paris.
1993
January: Washington. President Clinton takes office after an unsuccessful
last-ditch attempt by the US and EC to patch up differences. June:
Washington. US Congress grants new 'fast-track' negotiating authority
requiring President Clinton to notify by December 15 his intention to sign a
Uruguay Round accord and submission of the final deal to Congress by April
16.
July: Geneva. Peter Sutherland, former EC competition commissioner, takes
over from Dunkel. July: Tokyo. G7 summiteers agree detailed tariff-cutting
package which, though the interpretation is later disputed, acts as platform
for country-by-country bargaining in the final months.
December 15: Geneva. Countries formally agree to submit the final Uruguay
Round package to their governments for approval. US negotiating authority
expires.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Textile changes given impetus - Textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round is likely to add impetus to the
structural changes that have swept textiles and clothing industries in the
post-war years.
International trade in the sector is worth Dollars 240bn (Pounds 160bn) a
year. With some exceptions, cheap and mid-priced goods, and commodities such
as thread, are today produced in south and east Asia, the fringes of Europe,
and Latin America.
Developed countries run trade deficits in clothing and textiles because
trade barriers and production costs limit both domestic and export markets
for their own goods.
Under the Gatt pact, tariffs will come down and quotas on clothing and
textiles will be abandoned over 10 years after 1995. Its central feature is
the phasing out of a set of bilateral quotas called the Multi-Fibre
Arrangement (MFA). This system, established in 1974, imposes ceilings on,
for example, the number of knitted garments exported from Hong Kong to
Germany.
These quotas will gradually be eliminated after 1995 and be abandoned in
2005. Textile exporters have complained that most cuts will come at the end
of the 10-year period.
Tariffs too will be reduced over the period. They will not disappear
entirely, however, and countries with high tariff regimes such as the US and
Australia will still have higher tax barriers than most of Europe and east
Asia.
The Textiles Monitoring Body will police the rules.
While the changes are the most important for almost 20 years, and are likely
to boost developing country exports, the impact on trade balances and
employment in developed countries may not be drastic. Some quotas and
tariffs have already changed. Since the creation of the single European
market Asian exporters have been able to sell more to countries such as
Germany and France by taking advantage of unused MFA quotas with countries
such as Greece.
Within Europe the effect will vary. The UK is in a relatively good position.
Many of its manufacturers have learned to live with high imports from Asia,
which are usually cheaper and of higher quality than those from east
European suppliers to Germany and from North African exporters to France.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Developing nations give way on patents -
Intellectual property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The intellectual property accord in the Uruguay Round package is a triumph
for Gatt negotiators. 'This is the most important international agreement on
intellectual property this century,' says one senior trade official.
The US secured as good a deal as it could reasonably have hoped for, and far
better than it imagined was possible when the multilateral trade talks were
launched in 1986.
From outright opposition the attitude of developing countries swung to
grudging acceptance of the need for tougher intellectual property protection
in Gatt, to attract foreign investors and avoid increasingly aggressive
arm-twisting by the US.
The result is an agreement encompassing all forms of intellectual property
that would strengthen and harmonise standards of protection and provide for
effective enforcement at national and international level. Among its main
features are:
Protection of patents for 20 years, regardless of place of invention or
whether products are imported or produced locally. The main permitted
exclusions would relate to animal and plant inventions and biotechnological
process for their production; thus the agreement does not require 'patents
on life'.
There will also be strict limits on compulsory licensing of patented
products by governments, often used for pharmaceuticals in poor nations.
Copyright will be protected for at least 50 years, to include computer
programs and data compilations. Authors of computer programs and films will
largely have exclusive rental rights, as will performers and producers of
sound recordings and broadcasts.
Trademarks and geographical indications, especially important for European
wine producers, will be given stronger protection.
Semiconductor layout designs will be protected for 10 years.
For the first time, trade secrets will be protected from unauthorised
disclosure.
All these rules will have to be implemented in national legislation,
observing the basic fair trade precepts of national treatment (equal
treatment for domestic and foreign right-holders) and non-discrimination
between trading partners. Intellectual property disputes will be handled by
the World Trade Organisation's disputes mechanism.
Least-developed countries such as Bangladesh have an extra 11 years to
implement the accord. Most developing countries, such as India and Thailand,
have been given five years and industrialised nations one.
Where no patent protection now exists of any kind, in areas such as
pharmaceuticals, developing countries have 10 years to put legislation into
effect. But for pharmaceuticals and agri-chemicals, the agreement requires
developing countries to permit the filing of patents from the time the
agreement comes into force in 1995 and to treat them 10 years hence as if
the legislation had been in effect from the start. Since drugs typically
require upwards of 10 years' safety testing, those invented now would be
protected at the point at which they came on the market. If they reached the
market earlier, the patent-holder would be given exclusive marketing rights
in the interim.
Not satisfied with this, the US pharmaceuticals industry wanted but failed
to get protection for drugs already invented but not on the market.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: The deal is done
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
UP TO NOW
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Industrial Tariffs
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The backbone of previous Gatt rounds. Tariffs on manufactures average 5
per cent in rich countries, down from 40 per cent in the late 1940s.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Agriculture
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
High farm subsidies and protected markets in Europe and US lead to
overproduction and dumping of cut-price surpluses, squeezing exports of
more efficient producers. Farm supports by OECD countries amount to
Dollars 354bn in 1992.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Services
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
No international trade rules cover services such as banking and
insurance, transport, tourism, consultancy, telecommunications,
construction, accountancy, films and television, and labour services.
Countries protect industries from foreign competition.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Intellectual Property
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Standards of protection for patents, copyrights, trademarks vary
widely. Ineffective enforcement of national laws a growing source of
trade friction. Trade in counterfeit goods reaches alarming levels.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Textiles and Clothing
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rich countries restrict since 1974 imports of textiles and clothing
through bilateral quotas under Multi-Fibre Arrangement. Countries
maintain high textile import tariffs. Protection raises prices but
fails to protect jobs.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Anti-dumping
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Countries allowed to combat dumping (exports priced below domestic
prices) with anti-dumping duties. Anti-dumping actions proliferate and
increasingly seen as disguised form of protectionism.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subsidies
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subsidised exports can be countered with countervailing duties but,
like anti-dumping duties, are cause of growing trade tension and
increased disputes.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Safeguards
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Safeguard actions protect domestic industry from sudden import surges
which threaten serious injury. EU and US especially bypass
non-discrimination obligation by pressuring countries to concede
'voluntary' export restraints and other measures of doubtful legality.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gatt Rules
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gatt remains much the same as when drafted in 1940s even though many
more countries have since entered world trading system. Trade patterns
have shifted, and new forms of protection have sprung up.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Barriers
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Product regulations and standards extensively used by governments to
ensure products are safe for consumers and the environment. Varying
standards can be disguised trade barriers.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Government Procurement
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Procurement covered by Tokyo Round agreement which opened many areas to
international competition: 12 signatories (EU counting as one).
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
World Trade Organisation
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gatt originally envisaged as part of the International Trade
Organisation (third pillar of Bretton Woods institutions alongside
World Bank and IMF). ITO not ratified and Gatt still applied
provisionally.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dispute Settlement
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gatt increasingly deals with intractable disputes. Procedures do not
cover some important areas such as intellectual property and services,
and countries increasingly ignore recommendations.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT'S TO COME
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Industrial Tariffs
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tariffs on industrial goods cut by rich countries by more than a third.
Over 40 per cent of imports enter duty-free. Key traders scrap duties
for pharmaceuticals, construction equipment, medical equipment, steel,
beer, furniture, farm equipment, spirits, wood, paper and toys.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Agriculture
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Trade-distorting subsidies and import barriers cut over six years.
Domestic farm supports reduced 20 per cent. Subsidised exports sliced
36 per cent in value and 21 per cent in volume. All import barriers
converted to tariffs and cut 36 per cent. Japan's and South Korea's
closed rice markets gradually open. Tariffs on tropical products cut by
over 40 per cent.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Services
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rules framework for basic fair-trade principles such as
non-discrimination. Special provisions for financial services,
telecommunications, air transport and labour movement. Individual
countries pledge market opening in wide range of sectors. Further talks
on telecommunications and financial services.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Intellectual Property
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Extensive agreement on patents, copyright, performers' rights,
trademarks, geographical indications (wine, cheese, etc), industrial
designs, microchip layout designs, trade secrets. International
standards of protection, and requirements for effective enforcement.
Extra time for developing countries to put rules in place.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Textiles and Clothing
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
MFA quotas progressively dismantled over 10 years and tariffs reduced.
Developing countries reduce trade barriers. Normal Gatt rules apply at
end of 10 years.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Anti-dumping
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Clearer rules for conduct of investigations and criteria for determining
dumping and injury to industry. Duties lapse after five years. Rules
covering circumvention of anti-dumping duties by relocating production.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subsidies
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition of which subsidies are legal or not: some prohibited, some
non-actionable (eg research or regional development). Others actionable
if they harm competitors. More leeway for developing countries. Further
talks on civil aircraft subsidies.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Safeguards
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rules for conduct of investigations laid down. Measures not to exceed
four years and progressively liberalised over their lifetime. Grey-area
measures phased out and future use prohibited.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gatt Rules
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Many revised, improved, updated. They include codes on customs valuation
and import licensing, and provisions on state-trading enterprises,
customs unions and free-trade areas, waivers from Gatt rules, and
measures allowing countries to raise trade barriers for
balance-of-payments reasons. Rules covering pre-shipment inspection,
rules of origin and trade restrictions on foreign companies.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Barriers
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Better rules to ensure technical norms, testing and certification
procedures do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade and to encourage
harmonisation around international standards but not preclude
governments opting for higher standards. Rules dealing with animal and
plant health and safety measures.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Government Procurement
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Enlarged coverage in separate accord to include services, public works,
procurement by regional and local governments and public utilities.
Separate telecommunications negotiations next year.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
World Trade Organisation
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gatt becomes permanent world trade body covering goods, services and
intellectual property rights with a common disputes procedure.
World Trade Organisation implements results of Uruguay Round.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dispute Settlement
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rules increasing automaticity and reduce delays in adoption and
implementation of reports. Provision for binding arbitration and
appeals. Single disputes procedure for all trade areas.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
MAIN IMPACT
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Industrial Tariffs
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Easier access to world markets for exporters of industrial goods. Lower
prices for consumers. Higher-paying jobs through promotion of
competitive industries.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Agriculture
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Restraint of farm subsidies war. Lower food prices for consumers in
currently protected countries. Better market opportunities for
efficient producers. Special treatment for developing countries, though
higher world prices could hurt poor food-importers.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Services
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boost for trade in services, currently worth Dollars 900bn a year in
crossborder trade and another Dollars 3,000bn in business of foreign
subsidiaries. Further liberalisation to be negotiated.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Intellectual Property
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boost for foreign investment and technology transfer, though poor
countries with weak patent protection fear higher prices for drugs and
seeds.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Textiles and Clothing
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Developing countries able to sell more textiles and clothing abroad.
Reduced prices for consumers worldwide because of fairer textiles and
clothing trade (worth Dollars 248bn in 1992).
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Anti-dumping
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
More difficult to use anti-dumping actions for trade harassment. Harder
to dodge duties by relocating.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subsidies
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tighter curbs on subsidy use, especially for exports. More difficult to
use anti-subsidy actions for trade harassment.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Safeguards
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lower prices for consumers and importers. Better access to markets for
efficient producers. Increased pressure on inefficient producers to come
up to scratch.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gatt Rules
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Greater transparency, predictability and security in trading policies to
promote respect for fair-trade disciplines.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Barriers
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reduction in costs of complying with different standards and
regulations. Environmental and consumer groups fear higher standards
than international norms may be discouraged.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Government Procurement
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Value of procurement contracts subjected to open international bidding
could rise from Dollars 32bn in 1990 to over Dollars 1,000bn.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
World Trade Organisation
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boost to the status of international trading rules, and more effective
advocacy and policing of the open trading system.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dispute Settlement
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Harder to block panel judgements. Speedier and more automatic procedures
to enhance WTO's authority in settling disputes. Restraint of US
unilateral action by inclusion of virtually all trade in the
multilateral system.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: 45 years of doing the rounds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
1947
Geneva (23 participants). Gatt's founding countries establish 20 tariff
schedules which become an integral part of Gatt. These cover some 45,000
tariff reductions relating to Dollars 10bn in goods trade, half the world
total.
1949
Annecy, France (13 participants). Some 5,000 tariff concessions exchanged.
1950-51
Torquay, England (38 participants). Some 8,700 tariff concessions exchanged,
equivalent to a 25 per cent cut in 1948 tariff levels.
1956
Geneva (26 participants). About Dollars 2.5bn-worth of tariff reductions.
1960-62
Geneva (26 participants): The Dillon Round. Only 4,400 tariff reductions
made, covering Dollars 4.9bn of trade. Agriculture and certain sensitive
products excluded.
1964-67
Geneva (62 participants). The Kennedy Round. Uses a formula approach to cut
industrial tariffs by 35 per cent across the board, staged over five years.
Tariff concessions cover about Dollars 40bn of trade. Separate agreements
reached on grains, chemical products and a code on anti-dumping.
1973-79
Geneva (99 participants): The Tokyo Round. Tariff reductions and bindings
cover more than Dollars 300bn of trade and lower the weighted average tariff
on manufactured goods in the world's nine biggest industrial markets from
7.0 to 4.7 per cent. The round also recognises preferential treatement for
developing countries and liberalises trade in many tropical products. It
revises the anti-dumping code and establishes Gatt codes on subsidies,
technical barriers to trade, import licensing, government procurement,
customs valuation, dairy products, bovine meat and civil aircraft.
1986-93
Geneva (115 participants): The Uruguay Round. Launched in September 1986 in
Punta del Este, Uruguay, the eighth Gatt round has been by far the most
complex and ambitious. Its 28 separate accords extend fair trade rules for
the first time to agriculture, textiles, services, intellectual property and
foreign investment. Tariffs on industrial goods will be cut by over a third,
and farm export subsidies and import barriers will be substantially reduced.
Gatt, the new accords on services and intellectual property, and the various
Gatt codes such as those on government procurement and anti-dumping, will
all come under the umbrella of a Multilateral Trade Organisation. Trade
disputes between members will be settled by a single streamlined disputes
procedure, with provision for appeals and binding arbitration.

FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Slender success in attacking barriers -
Services
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
One of the great breakthroughs of the Uruguay Round was intended to be its
assault on barriers to trade in services. In the end, achievements have been
modest.
Unbreachable disagreements between the US and the European Union over
financial services, audiovisual services and shipping have left the lion's
share of the agreement unresolved. Along with telecommunications, the
promise is to negotiate deals on these sectors over the coming two years.
Air transport was excluded from the outset.
The residual activity is far from insignificant, covering tourism,
construction, professional services, consultancies, and a limited easing on
movement of workers - but this is small by comparison with the sectors
blighted by dispute.
Only in recent years have governments come to appreciate the importance of
services in international trade. Last year, cross-border services business
was valued at Dollars 900bn, with the foreign operations of services
companies amounting to more than Dollars 3 trillion.
This knowledge led powerful business lobbies, in the US in particular, to
campaign hard in the early days of the Round for ambitious market-opening in
banking, securities, and insurance. But later, it became clear that
countries targeted for liberalisation - like Japan, Korea, the six Asean
states of Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Brunei, and a number of Latin American countries - were not willing or able
to open their markets as wide as American companies hoped, US negotiators
slammed the brakes on their own market-opening commitments.
Haggling over Europe's efforts to protect its film and television sectors on
the grounds of protecting local culture erupted over a year ago. US
audiovisual exports to Europe earned over Dollars 3.5bn last year, and the
US industry did not take kindly to EU plans to cap their access to the
market.
More recently, in financial services, the US decision to offer full
most-favoured-nation rights to just 20-odd industrial economies, following
disappointment over the offers coming from target countries, triggered
uproar among Gatt negotiators. The US has finally backed away from its
threat, but only to allow a further two years of negotiation aimed at
improving access.
Mr Larry Summers, US assistant treasury secretary, reflected the
frustrations of US services industries when he said this week: 'We have not
achieved what the US financial services industry was hoping to achieve in
1986.'
But other negotiators bring a different perspective. 'At Punta del Este
(where the Round was launched), we were talking only of a framework of rules
for services,' one said. 'It was only in 1990 that countries raised their
sights to the idea of getting commitments to liberalise. it is true that
most offers today give no more than standstills, but at least that is a
start. They provide a foundation for us to work from in future rounds.'

FT  16 DEC 93 / The Gatt Deal: Ringmasters who dramatically saved show -
Settling disputes / Uruguay Round's transformation from circus act to world
trade blockbuster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rufus Yerxa, the unflagging US trade negotiator, joked after a sleepless
weekend 'negotia-thon' with the European Union: 'I have tried and failed
over the past three Decembers to finish this Round. I'm damned if I'm not
going to get at least one success on my CV.'
At this point last year, when talk was of President George Bush and Mrs
Carla Hills, his US trade representative, making a last urgent push to
complete the Uruguay Round of world trade talks before Mr Bill Clinton
replaced him, Mr Yerxa took his son to the circus. Much has happened over
the past 12 months to transform the Uruguay Round from a wearisome butt of
jokes to a reality that is likely to provide a significant boost to
international trade.
The transformation was based on three men: Sir Leon Brittan, appointed on
January 1 to succeed the amiable but ineffectual Mr Frans Andriessen as EU
trade commissioner; Mr Mickey Kantor, appointed in mid-January as Mr
Clinton's US trade representative; and Mr Peter Sutherland, who replaced a
battle-weary Mr Arthur Dunkel as director general of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade in July.
Their first joint achievement was to set, and then keep in place,
yesterday's deadline for completion of Uruguay Round negotiations. Gatt's
reputation for missing deadlines had almost made it a laughing stock over
the seven-year life of the Round.
The chemistry between Sir Leon and Mr Kantor was important. While both are
Lithuanian Jews by origin, the two could hardly seem less alike: Sir Leon,
the patrician Englishman; Mr Kantor a lean, wiry street-fighter. But both
came to their jobs with reputations as non-nonsense 'deal-makers', and their
shared commitment to close the Uruguay Round deal was soon apparent.
At a time when the US had lost faith in any commissioner's ability to
deliver a deal from a fractious and hydra-headed EU, Sir Leon instilled
confidence that he could deliver what he promised. Mr Kantor compensated for
his slight knowledge of trade policy and of international affairs with his
unassailably close links with Mr Clinton. The trans-Atlantic shuttle of the
past 10 months, which has brought the two together at least a dozen times,
played a big part in concluding a deal.
But perhaps the key development of the year was Mr Dunkel's replacement by
Mr Sutherland. One Gatt ambassador recalled: 'Arthur can be credited for 85
per cent of the outcome of the Round. But by the time he had completed the
Draft Final Act at the end of 1991, he had exhausted all of his resources:
he just couldn't do the last 15 per cent.'
Mr Sutherland attacked the last 15 per cent with a vengeance. He was already
meeting ministers from leading industrial countries at the OECD summit in
July before being formally appointed, intent on ensuring that the Uruguay
Round was the main focus of the Tokyo Group of Seven summit.
He succeeded in this. The tariff-cutting proposals to emerge from the G7
summit - which included commitments to cut tariffs to zero on a number of
important industrial products - broke months of deadlock and gave other
countries involved in the Round a clearer sense of possibilities.
There followed two months of intensive global diplomacy in which Mr
Sutherland met leaders of all the main industrial powers, representatives of
the Cairns Group of 14 food-exporting countries, Latin American leaders in
Montevideo, Asean leaders in Singapore, leaders across eastern and central
Europe and leaders in India and Mexico.
At the end of this process he had convinced marginalised developing
countries that their patience would be rewarded, and their involvement
appreciated. He had also won commitments from leaders that they would not
allow the Round to collapse.
A crowning moment was his appearance at the IMF/World Bank summit in
Washington alongside the heads of these two other Bretton Woods
institutions. The elevation of trade policy to the centre of national
economic and foreign policy meant that perhaps for the first time in
decades, the head of Gatt was seen as being on an equal standing.
Behind the political theatre, Mr Sutherland revitalised a depressed and
war-weary Gatt staff. He was never reluctant to bark at recalcitrant
negotiators, nor to telephone world leaders for help in breaking logjams: 'I
didn't take this on to lose the thing,' he commented recently. Negotiators
have often been stunned by his bluntness - none more so perhaps than US
treasury mandarins who came to Geneva to lecture, but ended listening, and
diluting their demands.
As a Gatt ambassador commented: 'If we were worried about the occasional
fight, we would not have appointed an Irish rugby player as director
general.' During the scrummaging of the past week in Geneva, Mr Sutherland's
sporting talents have unquestionably been in heavy demand. As a Uruguay
Round success was confirmed yesterday, it will be the trading system that
emerges the true victor.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Compromise hope on Mideast peace
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON, GAZA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
appeared yesterday to be preparing the way for a compromise with Israel in
the deadlock over implementing the outline peace accord signed by the two
sides in September.
At the conclusion of a two-day visit to London, Mr Arafat expressed optimism
that a solution would be found and referred to his problems with Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, as 'a common misunderstanding'.
The two leaders failed at their Cairo summit meeting on Sunday to make
sufficient progress for Israel to begin its troop withdrawal on schedule
from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. Mr Arafat had earlier
insisted the December 13 deadline was sacred and the negotiations were at a
crisis point.
Mr Nabil Shaath, who heads the PLO team in the negotiations with Israel,
said yesterday Mr Arafat would meet Mr Rabin again in Cairo next Wednesday
or Thursday.
The PLO leader said before leaving for Dublin that he hoped the intervening
period would provide sufficient for them to reach a deal 'so that we are
capable of implementing the agreement very carefully and very honestly'.
The main sticking point has been the PLO demand that it should control the
crossing points between Gaza and Egypt and Jericho and Jordan. Mr Rabin has
insisted that the declaration of principles gives Israel full responsibility
for external security and this includes the border crossing points. 'We are
not going to give the keys to reach Tel Aviv to anyone but Israelis,' he
said yesterday.
Meanwhile, nearly 200 Palestinians deported last year to southern Lebanon
returned to the West Bank and Gaza yesterday. They were among the 415
expelled by Israel, amid international condemnation, for allegedly belonging
to extremist Palestinian groups.
On a visit to military bases in Gaza, Mr Rabin warned the returning
deportees against getting involved again in action against Israel.
In further violence in Gaza, Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian who
tried to attack a soldier and 10 Palestinians were wounded in other clashes.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, was due in Paris yesterday to
meet Mr Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), the PLO official who signed the peace
agreement in Washington.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Greenspan angry at banking plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, has launched a
scathing attack on administration proposals for overhauling US bank
regulation.
He says the plan to transfer regulatory powers from the Fed to a single new
banking commission would seriously undermine the Fed's ability to respond to
potential financial crises and reduce the quality of bank supervision by
removing important 'checks and balances' in the current system of multiple
regulators.
It would also make the Fed less sensitive to monetary conditions and thus
threaten the efficiency of monetary policy.
Mr Greenspan's criticisms are contained in a rare signed article in today's
Wall Street Journal.
The Clinton administration has proposed that a new Federal Banking
Commission should assume regulatory powers now divided among the Fed, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Comptroller of the Currency and
the Office of Thrift Supervision. Under the plan the Fed would lose its
regulatory authority over about 1,000 banks and 6,300 bank holding
companies.
Officials say consolidation of regulatory powers in one agency would
eliminate duplication and create a simpler, more consistent regulatory
system. The Fed would have access to all information collated by the new
commission.
Mr Greenspan says it 'is unrealistic and unduly hopeful to believe that the
knowledge and expertise the Federal Reserve needs to do its job properly can
be gained from studying the exam reports of another agency, having narrow
authority to examine the payments system, or having representation on the
board of a monolithic regulatory institution.'
He concedes the present regulatory system 'has not been functioning
efficiently in recent years' but says there are many alternative solutions.

FT  16 DEC 93 / US output jumps for November: Clinton joins interest rate
rise debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Reports of the biggest increase in US industrial production for a year
yesterday added spice to a vigorous debate about the desirability of an
early increase in US interest rates.
The Federal Reserve said industrial production rose 0.9 per cent last month
after a 0.7 per cent rise in October. The rise was broadly-based but was
especially strong in interest-rate sensitive sectors such as cars and
business equipment.
The surge in production follows a string of buoyant economic figures,
including a sharp fall in the jobless rate to 6.4 per cent last month.
Many Wall Street analysts believe the Fed should respond quickly to growing
evidence of accelerating economic growth by nudging short-term interest
rates higher.
They say the Fed should tighten policy before inflation begins to rise.
Others say inflation - 2.7 per cent in the year to November - is so subdued
that no increase in rates from the current level of 3 per cent will be
required for many months.
On Tuesday evening President Bill Clinton entered the debate, warning that
it would be a 'mistake' to raise rates because there was no sign yet of a
rise in inflationary pressures. He said the economy had already suffered 'a
false start or two' and the priority was more jobs and higher incomes.
Previous signals from the administration had been more ambiguous, with some
officials apparently unconcerned by the prospect of a small rise in interest
rates.
The Fed's policy-making open market committee meets next week to discuss
monetary policy.
Yesterday's figures showed across-the-board strength of production. The
largest gains were in car production, up 5.5 per cent. But output of
business equipment and construction supplies rose 1.3 per cent and 1.1 per
cent respectively. Overall manufacturing output was up 1 per cent with
output of durable goods up 1.3 per cent.
The rise in industrial output, which followed a 0.7 per cent increase in
October, lifted the rate of industrial capacity utilisation to 83 per cent -
a level that some economists fear could result in upward pressure on prices.
This was the highest level of capacity utilisation since 1989, when
inflation was rising, and compares with a long-term average of 81.9.

FT  16 DEC 93 / More investment from private sector: World Bank sees trend
affecting middle-income developing countries but not poor ones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private-sector capital is replacing government finance for the middle-income
developing countries, the World Bank says, but the poorest countries have
not benefited from this trend.
Both private-sector loans and equity investments in the developing world
climbed steeply last year to Dollars 102.1bn (Pounds 68.5bn), exceeding for
the first time government loans and grants, which fell to Dollars 54.6bn,
according to statistics compiled annually by the World Bank in its World
Debt Tables, published yesterday.
The Washington-based development bank projects a further increase in private
capital flows to Dollars 113.2bn, while official loans and grants are
projected to recover to Dollars 63.5bn.
'There has been a remarkable turnaround in private capital flows to the
middle-income countries,' said Mr Michael Bruno, the World Bank's chief
economist.
Mr Bruno's enthusiasm is tempered, however, by the much starker prospects
for the low-income countries. With the exception of China, which has become
the leading recipient among developing countries of private capital
resources with a projected total of Dollars 27bn this year, all of the
increase in capital flows has gone to middle-income countries.
While excessive flows of capital can create problems for policymakers in
developing countries - for example, by pushing up exchange rates - Mr Bruno
argues that the importance of private equity investment should make these
flows more sustainable than the loans that created the 1970s debt crisis.
Not only are equity investors more likely to remain long-term partners,
whereas bond investors might pull out if US long-term interest rates were to
rise again, but the principal reason behind the turnaround in private
capital flows has been the economic policy reforms carried out by the
developing countries, Mr Bruno argues.
While private-sector lending to the developing world bounced back to Dollars
41.7bn in 1992 and Dollars 43.7bn in 1993 - four times the average annual
rate in the previous six years - equity investment has risen even faster
over the same period.
Foreign direct investment in the developing world, in which the investor
acquires a long-term management interest in a company, climbed steadily from
Dollars 10.1bn in 1986 to Dollars 47.3bn in 1992, and was projected by the
World Bank to have risen again to Dollars 56.3bn in 1992.
Portfolio equity investment, in which foreign investors buy shares without
seeking management control, also soared from Dollars 600m in 1986 to Dollars
13.1bn in 1992 as new stock markets opened and investment conditions in the
developing countries improved. This category of capital flow is expected,
however, to flatten out to Dollars 13.2bn in 1993.
Low-income countries, except for China, are in a much worse position. Most,
especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, have no access to international
capital markets.
Government-to-government financing has also slowed for these countries,
although the World Bank notes 'a welcome shift toward grant financing',
paralleling the shift from lending toward equity investment in the private
sector.
For the 29 severely indebted low-income countries, with outstanding debts of
Dollars 204bn among them at the end of 1992, net flows of long-term capital
almost dried up to total Dollars 1.7bn in 1992 before recovering slightly to
a projected Dollars 2.8bn this year, but grants grew steadily through the
late 1980s to reach Dollars 14.9bn in 1992 and Dollars 15.2bn this year.
The difficulty Mr Bruno sees for these poor countries is not so much the
cash flow problem of servicing their debts as the overhang of accumulated
debt.
'The capitalisation of interest and the accumulation of arrears has
outweighed debt forgiveness,' he said, calling for renewed efforts by
creditor countries to reduce the stock of debt burdening the low income
countries.

<TEXT>
Mr Rafael Caldera, Venezuela's president-elect, has vowed to establish 'a
government of austerity' when he assumes power in February.
Mr Caldera, 77, speaking after he was proclaimed president-elect on Tuesday,
will take over an economy suffering annual inflation of around 44 per cent
and a fiscal gap estimated at Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) this year. The
government must also cope with declining receipts from oil exports, which
provide most of its revenues.
Mr Caldera said he would reduce spending by the presidential bureaucracy and
cut the 1994 central government budget. He also promised to minimise
spending carried out via secret government accounts. These accounts were the
undoing of Venezuela's last elected president, Mr Carlos Andres Perez, who
was forced to leave office this year to face charges that he improperly used
Dollars 17m from a confidential account earmarked for security and defence.
Venezuelans also voted for a new National Congress, but official results
have not been published. Preliminary tallies by the largest political
parties indicate that it will be split into four big factions.

<TEXT>
European Community environment ministers agreed new rules yesterday to
promote recycling of packaging materials and free trade in packaged goods,
Reuter reports from Brussels.
The deal fell short of what more pro-environment countries had fought for,
by placing the emphasis more on free trade than large-scale recycling of the
50m tonnes of packaging discarded each year.
The Danish, Dutch and German ministers were sidelined as the rest came to a
deal requiring each country to recycle a quarter of its waste packaging and
to ensure that no more than than half of all the waste is simply dumped.
Belgium, which ends its EC presidency at the end of the month, hailed an
agreement. 'We were in a situation of chaos,' the chairwoman, Ms Magda de
Galan, Belgian environment minister, told reporters. 'We've taken a step
together which will bring a note of serenity.'

FT  16 DEC 93 / European alliance sought for Eni
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government yesterday said it was seeking a European cross-border
alliance for Eni, the state oil concern, which is due to be privatised by
1995.
The announcement came during the presentation by Mr Paolo Savona, the
industry minister, of a policy document on industrial priorities.
The document says Eni's oil and gas interests need to acquire a bigger world
presence, and then says: 'To achieve this, the government backs
conversations in progress to find a European alliance which goes beyond
existing exploration and production agreements and deals with R%D
strategies, productive ventures leading if possible to share swaps.'
Eni is the world's eighth largest oil group with sales of L50,000bn (Pounds
2.8bn).
For the past two weeks rumours have been circulating of talks on a
share-swap between Eni's main operating arm, Agip, and France's
state-controlled Elf-Aquitaine. This followed the annual Franco-Italian
summit on November 26 in Rome.
Until now both Eni and Elf have declined to comment. Yesterday Mr Savona
said coyly: 'Conversations are going on with several prospective partners,
some bigger some smaller.'
Eni is in the process of re-organising its energy holdings round a new
company to be called Super-Agip as a preliminary to privatisation by 1995.
Rothschilds were recently brought in as advisers to Eni on the floatation
and are in the process of valuing the state holding.
Elf-Aquitaine is in the process of discussing share participations with
potential investors before its privatisation.
Elf, France's largest industrial group, is due to be privatised early next
year. It is seeking to find investors to form a hard core of long-term
stable investors to replace the state's 50.8 per cent holding. Industry
observers in Paris said Agip is a possible member of the hard core, or a
potential investor on a smaller scale, pointing out that the French and
Italian groups already co-operate in a series of projects.
Italian industry has already demonstrated its interest in France's
privatisation programme.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Yeltsin criticises Ukraine over nuclear disarmament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday condemned Ukraine's stalling on
nuclear disarmament as 'evil' in remarks which could signal a tougher
Russian foreign policy after ultra-nationalist gains in last weekend's
election.
'Ukraine is deceiving us all. It is deceiving the US, Russia, Europe,
deceiving the whole world and we are so helpless that we cannot deal with
this evil,' he was quoted by the Interfax news agency as telling visiting US
Vice-President Al Gore.
The unexpected electoral triumph of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist
who says former Soviet republics will beg to be re-absorbed by Russia, has
provided Ukraine with a powerful excuse to procrastinate on commitments to
give up nuclear weapons inherited from the Soviet Union.
In the face of strong international condemnation over its failure to ratify
the Start-1 treaty without conditions and to fulfil its May 1992 promise to
go non-nuclear, Ukraine is insisting on security guarantees and financial
compensation for the 2,760 short-range nuclear warheads it transferred to
Russia last year and for its 1,656 remaining warheads.
The electoral success of Russia's far-right parties has prompted fears Mr
Yeltsin will be tempted to play the nationalist card in foreign policy,
while, at best, sticking to unpopular market reforms at home.
As the pro-western reformist camp awaits a public signal of support from Mr
Yeltsin, Mr Boris Fyodorov, finance minister, flies to Paris today for talks
with officials of the Group of Seven industrial countries to discuss
continuing western support for economic reform.
'The signals I'm getting are that reform is still on track,' Mr Fyodorov
said. 'The prime minister is still committed. The president looks committed
but we're still waiting for him to speak up. Maybe I'll have a better
picture before the meeting (with the G7).'
Mr Gore, describing the views of the neo-fascists who did so well in the
elections as 'reprehensible', predicted after meeting Mr Yeltsin at the
Kremlin that he would form an 'effective' coalition government.
While reformist parties have been consulting on a possible anti-fascist
coalition, Mr Yeltsin appears to be hedging his bets until the full election
results are available.
An unofficial counting of results including both seats determined by party
lists and by a first-past-the-post system for candidates without explicit
party affiliations, showed the reformist Russia's Choice as the largest
single group in the 450-seat state Duma (lower house of parliament) with 74
seats.
A Kremlin official said that in the 209 out of 225 first-past-the-post
constituencies so far counted, 24 per cent were Russia's Choice, while only
4 per cent went to Mr Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic party.
In the other 225 seats determined by proportional representation, Mr
Zhirinovsky is in the lead.
Jurek Martin adds from Washington: The US believes Russian reformist parties
could still form the largest single bloc in the Duma, with Mr Zhirinovsky's
ultra-nationalists finishing up no better than fourth.
President Bill Clinton yesterday used this more optimistic reading to stress
again that US policy supporting reform needed no changing. He suggested that
Mr Zhirinovsky's strong showing was mostly a 'protest vote' from Russians
largely unfamiliar with his extreme views.
Mr Clinton wrote to Mr Yeltsin on Tuesday. The Russian response, delivered
to Mr Gore in Moscow, emphasised Mr Yeltsin's strong commitment to economic
reform and continued respect for the territorial integrity of Russia's
neghbours, both apparently threatened by Mr Zhirinovsky.

Japan's coalition government yesterday pushed through a 45-day extension to
the current session of parliament, giving Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa
extra time to keep his promise of reforming the scandal-stained political
system before the year's end, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo.
The opposition Liberal Democratic party boycotted the parliamentary sitting,
but four members of the party in favour of political reform disobeyed a
party directive to stay away and sat in the otherwise empty opposition
benches. The extension was approved with less than an hour remaining of the
parliamentary session.

FT  16 DEC 93 / French in human genes 'map' race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French scientists have won the international race to produce the first
comprehensive 'map' of the genes in every human cell. It will guide
researchers towards the genetic causes of thousands of diseases, ranging
from diabetes and asthma to rare forms of cancer.
The 'physical map of the human genome', unveiled by the Centre d'Etude du
Polymorphisme Humain (Ceph) in Paris yesterday, is a landmark in genetics
research. Scientists can now move more quickly to identify all of the
100,000 genes that provide a blueprint for human development.
Dr James Watson, who was in the team that discovered the double-helix
structure of DNA, in which the genetic code is stored, and is still a
leading US genetics researcher, acclaimed the achievement. 'By identifying
these genes, we can begin to develop drugs to cure rather than treat
disease,' he said.
Dr Daniel Cohen, director of Ceph, acknowledged yesterday that the map still
had gaps and inaccuracies, and its resolution needed to be improved. 'Like
any first map, it requires further study and refinement, but it can be used
immediately for genetic research,' he said.
He says 'a final, complete map of the genome will take two to five years
more of international collaborative work.'
Researchers looking for the cause of an inherited disease search first for
'genetic markers' present in patients but not in other people's DNA. Now,
they should be able to find these markers like landmarks on the new map -
and home in quickly on the gene responsible. They can then decode the gene
and, depending on its function, develop a drug to block or enhance it.
The Ceph map is described briefly in today's issue of the journal Nature.
The full data will be available on the global Internet computer network -
without patent protection. If printed out, it would form a pile of paper 300
metres high.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Worth keeping in the glove box: Commission's Strategic
Programme for the Internal Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's 65-page Strategic Programme for the Internal
Market, published yesterday, launches the next phase of the barrier-free
single European market.
There is no doubt about the European Union's commitment in principle to the
single market - which is still the most successful legislative and public
relations exercise it has ever undertaken. In the communique issued after
last week's Brussels summit, EU leaders described the internal market as 'a
major asset of the European economy' which 'must be fully exploited'.
But as the Commission itself admits, successfully maintaining the impetus of
the market will be more difficult, and less rewarding than the first phase,
in which Brussels proposed 282 to set up the single market. Phase two could
also prove more expensive than phase one, with the European Union having to
pay for constant monitoring, enforcement and evaluation, to prevent member
states lagging behind or undermining benefits of the market.
The most detailed part of the strategy document deals with the development
of the single market. The Commission stresses that this is not a new
legislative programme. That would risk intimidating EU citizens, who became
suspicious of the quantity of legislation in the 1985 strategy. The
Commission says it will legislate where necessary, but only after full and
open consultation with the interested parties.
Among its suggestions, the Commission is promising to look at how to
eliminate obstacles to EU-wide protection of intellectual and industrial
property; to examine how to improve the legal framework for companies which
set up in several EU countries; and to produce, by the end of next year,
proposals for a definitive system of value added tax, and for the
elimination of double taxation on companies.
The Commission also pledges to publish during 1994 measures to lighten the
administrative burden on small companies and to improve after-sales service
for cross-border shoppers. Separately, the Commission is promising a green
paper on how to co-ordinate EU legislation on advertising, marketing and
sponsorship.
Finally, the Commission is to look in detail at how to encourage private
investment in trans-European networks, the extensive and expensive telecoms,
energy and transport infrastructure projects backed by last week's summit.
For certain groups - including consumer associations and the European
Parliament - the strategic programme may not be tough enough. It promises
much reflection, and little immediate legislative action. Its more ambitious
proposals, such as continuing liberalisation of energy monopolies, can be
easily diluted or blocked by member states.
But the Commission does not want to be tough for the sake of it. The
strategic programme describes itself modestly as a 'road-map' of the future
development of the barrier-free Europe. Like most maps, it is not a
thrilling read. Unlike most maps, many of the routes which it describes have
yet to be built. But the programme should be worth keeping in the glove
compartment, if only to measure the Commission and the Union's progress in
achieving some tough goals over the next two to three years.

Promising 'not to be held hostage' to the C-17, Mr Les Aspin, defence

dissatisfied with the C-17, it will consider adapting wide-bodied commercial
jets or reviving the C-5 production line.

FT  16 DEC 93 / W European new car sales fall by 9 1/2 %: UK the November
exception in steepest post-war decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New car sales in west Europe fell by 9.5 per cent in November to 875,000
from 966,000 a year ago, the 11th monthly decline in succession.
According to industry estimates new car sales in the first 11 months of the
year fell by 14.7 per cent to 10.7m, the steepest decline in the post-war
period. Around 1.8m fewer new cars have been sold in west Europe in the 11
months compared to the corresponding period a year ago.
The steep decline in sales has plunged much of the industry into loss, as
carmakers have been forced to take drastic action to reduce production and
cut jobs.
The outlook remains depressed for next year, and sales are forecast to stage
only a weak recovery.
According to the French automobile makers' association, new car sales next
year in west Europe will rise by only 0.8 per cent to 11.5m from 11.4m in
1993.
New car sales in November were lower than a year ago in 11 of 17 markets
across west Europe, with demand growing only in the UK, Scandinavia and
Switzerland.
In the first 11 months of the year sales were lower than a year ago in 15 of
17 markets across west Europe, with demand growing only in the UK, and
marginally in Norway.
There were signs last month of the recession easing in some of the large
volume markets, however, and demand in the UK is continuing to grow
strongly.
New car sales in Germany fell by an estimated 17.1 per cent in November
compared with the decline of 18.3 per cent in the first 11 months.
In Italy sales fell by only 7.8 per cent in November compared with a decline
of 21.1 per cent in the first 11 months of the year, while in Spain a
decline of 17.1 per cent in November compared with a drop of 24.5 per cent
in the first 11 months.
The pace of decline in France slowed to a drop of 11.7 per cent year-on-year
in November from the decline of 16.7 per cent in the first 11 months.
The UK remains the only significant market in west Europe where new car
sales are rising - albeit from a depressed level - with an increase
year-on-year of 19.4 per cent in November and of 12.6 per cent in the first
11 months.
The rate of decline in new car demand across west Europe is expected to
accelerate again this month. Demand a year ago was boosted artificially by a
series of special factors, which pulled sales ahead from January.
Many carmakers were forced to register cars not equipped with catalytic
converters ahead of changes in legislation, while sales were also boosted
ahead of tax increases in several countries.

<TEXT>
Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former Christian Democrat prime minister, has been
interrogated for 12 hours by Palermo magistrates about his alleged links
with the Mafia, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
Media leaks have suggested Palermo magistrates had been able to corroborate
evidence from Mr Balduccio Di Maggio, a former member of Cosa Nostra, the
umbrella organisation of the Sicilian Mafia.
Mr Andreotti was first warned in April he was under investigation for
alleged links with the Mafia. In previous interrogations, he denied all
contacts.
Magistrates have uncovered evidence of Mr Andreotti meeting two Mafia
figures, the Salvo cousins, linked to Mr Salvo Lima, his chief political
representative in Sicily, murdered in 1992. Mr Andreotti has denied knowing
the cousins.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Call to scrap more EU steel aid: Firm political declaration
ending subsidies will be sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
European Union industry ministers will be asked to renounce further
government subsidies for their state-owned steelmakers at tomorrow's crucial
meeting on restructuring of the EU steel industry.
A firm political declaration putting an end to state aid will be the
condition for other member states to approve subsidy plans submitted by the
east German, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese governments.
'(It will say) that if this package doesn't work then there will be no
second helping for the companies concerned,' one British official said.
National and Commission officials believe such a declaration will not pose
problems, although it would not necessarily be legally binding. The main
difficulty will be forging unanimous agreement on the detail of
controversial restructuring plans, particularly for Ekostahl, the east
German producer, and Ilva, the Italian steelmaker.
Commission officials are concerned that if a deal is not struck tomorrow,
private steelmakers will not make the necessary production cuts to allow an
overall restructuring of the west European steel industry to take place. It
is now more than a year since the steel industry called for EU measures to
relieve overcapacity, a slump in demand and competition from cheap non-EU
imports.
The British, French and west German steel industries this week stepped up
the pressure on their governments to resist an unsatisfactory compromise on
state subsidies. Under the plans tabled for tomorrow's meeting, approval of
Ecu6.8bn (Pounds 5.18bn) of subsidies to publicly-owned steelmakers would be
offset by an overall reduction in capacity of 5.5m tonnes.
Mr Heinz Kriwet, chief executive of Thyssen, Germany's largest steel group,
said yesterday the German government would be paying 'an extremely high
price' if it agreed huge subsidies for other manufacturers, in order to win
approval for the Ekostahl plan.
Writing in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, he warned that
Germany could not afford a private steel industry when 'politicians in the
German federal states, in Bonn and Brussels do not want it or are not able
to introduce fair competition'.
The British steel industry is particularly unhappy about the Ekostahl
restructuring, because it could involve both operating subsidies and
subsidies for new capacity. Britain is likely to insist in Friday's meeting
that guarantees are written into any accord strictly limiting the capacity
increase.
British industry sources have also criticised last Friday's deal between the
Commission and the Italian government on the privatisation of Ilva, which
they say is worse than earlier plans submitted by the Commission. But UK
officials said yesterday that the Ilva plan was 'on the right lines'.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Single market rigour pledged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday promised 'decisive action' to force
members of the European Union to implement all legislation on the
barrier-free single European market by the end of next year.
The Commission also launched a strategic programme of evaluation,
consultation and legislation designed to maintain the momentum of the
original 1985 internal market project.
Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, internal market commissioner, said: 'It's no
longer a 'softly softly' approach: there's balance, but there will be very
decisive and very severe action (to enforce) the application at national
level of this legislation.'
When they meet in Brussels today for their last meeting of the year,
internal market ministers will be told they face European Court action if
laws are not implemented. Under new Maastricht treaty powers, the Commission
can also recommend fines for such infringements.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi also said the Commission was prepared to press ahead
next year with legislation aimed at ending all controls at internal
frontiers. Britain, Denmark and Ireland have maintained certain passport
controls at borders with other EU countries, while the other nine EU members
have pledged to end all checks on February 1 next year.
The strategic programme sets as a priority the implementation and adoption
of legislation already proposed for the single market. But it also lays out
a legislative and regulatory programme for the next two to three years, and
seeks to counter criticism from some industry and consumer lobbies that the
single market has not gone far enough.
The Commission promises full consultation on new measures, which will
include proposals to ease the administrative burden on small companies,
introduce a definitive VAT system, and encourage private investment in
trans-European infrastructure projects.
But the document also contains a warning to member states not to question
the Commission's powers to act in areas where it has 'a precise and
indisputable obligation' to do so.

FT  16 DEC 93 / French industry output increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French industrial production increased in November and should rise further
in the next few months, according to a survey of company chairmen by the
Bank of France which was published yesterday.
The survey supports the government's claims that the economy has stabilised
after a sharp downturn at the end of last year and during the first quarter
of this year. But it also reflected economists' forecasts of a slow and
fragile rise from recession.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, yesterday told the National Assembly
the government's forecast of 1.4 per cent growth in GDP next year was 'a
reasonable estimate'.
Recovery would be at 'a slow rhythm'. But he pointed to some encouraging
signs, including the Bank of France survey.
The survey showed rises in production in the farm and food sectors, the car
industry and intermediate goods industries. In the consumer goods sector,
companies reported a stabilisation in output.
The survey showed strong demand for exports, especially to south-east Asia,
the US and Latin America. Order books increased during the month.
'Despite persistent uncertainties, most business chiefs expect growth in
activity for the coming months and say they are ready to revise upwards
their investment,' the Bank of France said.
There were, however, some pessimistic elements in the survey. Employment in
industry continued to fall in November, adding to the 3.2m jobless total
recorded at the end of October.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Gatt chief brings down the gavel on world trade treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Delegations from 117 countries yesterday approved by consensus an ambitious
world trade liberalisation treaty aimed at slashing tariffs and opening
markets.
Seven years of tough negotiations came to a successful finale when Mr Peter
Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
declared: 'I gavel the Uruguay Round concluded.' Delegates at Geneva's
International Conference Centre came to their feet, cheered and applauded.
Officials broke open bottles of champagne.
Mr Sutherland brought down the gavel after European Union foreign ministers
in Brussels removed the final obstacle by approving the accord. The French
national assembly later gave a vote of confidence to prime minister Edouard
Balladur, who had dropped French objections to a deal.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the agreement was a good one even
though the US did not get all it wanted. He would notify Congress before the
midnight deadline that he would sign it.
A few hundred bedraggled farmers demonstrated in Paris and Brussels,
branding the deal a US plot to cut European farming. In South Korea, prime
minister Hwang In-sung submitted his resignation to President Kim Young-sam
shortly after police arrested hundreds of students protesting against the
country's acceptance of rice imports.
The 550-page trade pact will result in tariffs being cut world-wide by an
average of 40 per cent and will bring trade in agriculture, services, and
textiles and garments under multilateral discipline for the first time. It
also creates a more powerful body, the World Trade Organisation, to replace
Gatt.
The agreement will take effect in 1995 after governments have ratified it.
Mr Sutherland said the accord was 'a momentous and historic achievement'
that would mean 'more trade, more investment, more jobs and larger income
growth for all'.
EU foreign ministers, approving the deal, partly met French demands for
strengthened trade defence mechanisms. They also agreed to satisfy
Portuguese insistence on aid to modernise its textiles industry. An Ecu900m
(Pounds 690m) package, including Ecu400m drawn from the existing structural
funds budget, is to be made available over the next six years.
Amid the euphoria, there was disappointment that the agreement was marred by
US reservations on financial services, and irreconcilable US-EU differences
over access to Europe's film and television sectors and over shipping and
telecommunications. It is hoped these disputes can be settled in the next
two years.
Many developing countries were also disappointed by the modest
market-opening offers from industrial countries.

FT  16 DEC 93 / China accuses UK of wrecking co-operation on Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING, HONG KONG, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China last night accused Britain of destroying co-operation on Hong Kong and
appealed to the territory's residents for support in the deepening
confrontation over the 1997 transfer of sovereignty from London to Beijing.
The government in Beijing issued a stern statement in response to
yesterday's tabling in the Hong Kong Legislative Council (Legco) of a
partial reform bill aimed at broadening the franchise for elections due in
1994 and 1995. China says the bill violates Sino-British agreements.
Although it did not explicitly close the door on further discussions, the
statement said Britain had 'demolished the foundation of Sino-British
co-operation'.
The Beijing government said: 'We welcome the people in Hong Kong . . . to
support and participate more positively in the work of the Preparatory Work
Committee for Hong Kong's smooth transition and for maintaining Hong Kong's
prosperity.'
Beijing established the committee this year to advise on arrangements for
1997. British officials fear China will use the body to undermine the
authority of the Hong Kong government.
Mr Alastair Goodlad, a British foreign office minister, said it had been
necessary to begin legislation to cover urgent issues and that that should
give time for discussion with Beijing on other matters. He insisted in a
parliamentary answer that Britain wished 'to co-operate with them in
securing a smooth transition'.
However, the Chinese statement made clear that a resumption of talks, which
foundered last month after 17 rounds since April, depended on Mr Chris
Patten, the governor, withdrawing his legislation.
It said that tabling the bill without Beijing's agreement was 'another
serious step' towards confrontation with China. 'In such circumstances, any
election bill passed by Legco will be against Sino-British agreements.
Therefore, it will not be acceptable to the Chinese side.'
The statement added: 'The British side's move indicates that the British had
unilaterally broken off the Sino-British talks creating man-made chaos . . .
and posing obstacles to the smooth transition and handover of power in
1997.'
In Hong Kong, Mr Michael Sze, secretary for constitutional affairs, told
Legco that time had run out for talks about 'straightforward' issues
relating to the colony's 1994 and 1995 polls. These include lowering the
voting age from 21 to 18 years and abolishing appointed officials in local
government.
Other proposals to broaden democratic participation will be tabled in a
second bill expected by the end of February. However, support for
yesterday's bill has weakened.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Anglo-Irish plan offers hope for peace in Ulster: Hardline
unionists condemn initiative as Sinn Fein expresses disappointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The boldest Anglo-Irish political initiative during 25 years of violence in
Northern Ireland was launched yesterday with a plea to the IRA to grasp the
opportunity for peace.
But praise for the Downing Street Declaration from across the political
spectrum was matched by initial 'disappointment' from Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, and condemnation from hardline unionists.
In a joint statement establishing the framework for a permanent political
settlement, Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds heralded an historic
opportunity for 'a new beginning' in the province. The prime ministers
pledged to accelerate all-party talks designed to restore devolved
government to Northern Ireland province and to intensify co-operation
between Belfast and Dublin.
Mr Major invited Sinn Fein to join the talks process within three months of
an end to violence. Speaking at a joint press conference with Mr Reynolds,
he said the declaration 'closes no doors except the door to violence and
illegality. And crucially it opens the door to those who abandon violence'.
Speaking directly to the IRA, Mr Reynolds added: 'This offers you an
historic opportunity to come into the political process.' He said Dublin
would establish an all-Ireland Forum to which Sinn Fein would be invited
after a cessation of terrorism.
In a television broadcast across the UK last night, Mr Major said: 'We
cannot go on spilling blood in the name of the past . . . the time to choose
peace is long overdue.'
Aides of both leaders were privately voicing hopes that the IRA's
traditional Christmas ceasefire, due to start shortly, could turn into a
permanent cessation of violence. But Mr Major and Mr Reynolds admitted that
while they hoped for peace, the initiative now lay with the IRA.
The declaration, entrenching the unionist veto over constitutional change in
Northern Ireland but balancing it with explicit recognition of the
possibility of a united Ireland, won grudging acquiescence from the Ulster
Unionists. Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader, asked a series of
pointed questions about the statement but refrained from open criticism.
Later, he said there were parts of the declaration the UUP did not accept.
But the party had set its reservations aside 'for the time being' to see
what effect the document had on the IRA.
The initiative was praised by Mr John Hume, the leader of the mainly
Catholic SDLP. Mr Hume said that he intended to resume his talks with Mr
Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, in an attempt to encourage a total
cessation of violence.
But Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionists, condemned
the agreement as a 'sell-out' to the IRA and an 'act of treachery' by Mr
Major.
In Sinn Fein's first reaction, a leading member said there was general
'disappointment' among nationalists, but Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, the party
chairman, said it would be studying the joint declaration in depth.
In the House of Commons, Mr Major won plaudits from opposition leaders and
Conservative MPs alike for what was variously described as a 'brave' and
'imaginative' initiative.
In an attempt to maintain the support of the Ulster Unionists, the prime
minister insisted repeatedly that the province's status would be changed
only with the consent of a majority of its citizens.
He said the declaration 'guarantees that for so long as a majority of the
people of Northern Ireland wish to remain a part of the UK, the government
will uphold their right to do so. That pledge remains 'rock-solid'.
But in the hope of coaxing Sinn Fein to the negotiating table, Mr Major
ceded significant ground to Mr Reynolds in agreeing language designed to
appeal to Irish nationalists. The declaration makes clear that the British
government will do nothing to stand in the way of Irish unity and will
consider the establishment of cross-border institutions to strengthen
cross-border links.
Adapting nationalist rhetoric, it said that the people of Ireland alone
should map out their own future through 'self-determination on the basis of
consent, freely and concurrently given, north and south'.
Mr Reynolds moved further than previous Irish leaders in offering explicit
recognition that the status of Northern Ireland could only be changed with
the consent of its people.
He told journalists in Downing Street: 'We cannot have winners and losers if
we want peace.'
Mr Reynolds, who won a standing ovation in the Dail after returning to
Dublin last night, also gave a commitment that the Irish government would
drop its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as part of an overall
political settlement.

FT  15 DEC 93 / New deal to balance calls on aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Richer governments responsible for most of the flow of official aid to
poorer countries yesterday came out with a new formula to balance
traditional needs of the third world and newer aid demands from eastern
Europe.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's development
assistance committee said it was putting eight of the poorest Caucasian and
central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union on its designated list of
countries receiving official development aid. This would count towards the
OECD governments' pledge to try to raise their aid budgets to 0.7 per cent
of their national output.
By contrast, the committee has decided to put central European countries,
the Baltic states, Russia, and some relatively richer ex-Soviet republics
such as Belarus and Ukraine on a separate list with some Gulf oil states
which no longer count formally as official-aid recipients. Assistance to
these countries would not count towards meeting the UN-approved 0.7 per cent
target for OECD members' aid budgets. This compromise is a response to the
worries of third world clients that aid flows will now be diverted to
eastern Europe.
So far, OECD officials said, there has been no diversion. Concessional
official aid to the former Soviet bloc has been running at Dollars 8bn
(Pounds 5.3bn) a year since 1991, while soft-term official aid to the third
world has stayed at around Dollars 60bn. Nor are central Europe, Russia, or
western ex-Soviet republics likely to be penalised by the new
categorisation, officials claimed.

Last week Iraq freed three Britons after a personal appeal by former British

But Ms Roselyne Bachelot, one of the French MPs who helped secure freedom

Ukraine's government called on parliament yesterday to save the economy from
collapse by approving an 'anti-hyperinflation' programme that mixes market
reforms with measures to strengthen state control, Reuter reports from Kiev.
Most deputies ignored the government's eighth attempt to push through an
economic reform plan in the two years since independence from Moscow. They
blamed ministers for the latest round of price increases that made staples
three to five times more expensive and cast Ukraine's 52m citizens deeper
into poverty. The acting prime minister, Mr Yefim Zvyagilsky, said Ukraine
had to introduce 'radical market reforms' to fight monthly inflation of 70
per cent, including rapid privatisation of 40 per cent of state property
over the next year.
The programme would grant President Leonid Kravchuk 'extraordinary powers',
but these were hardly mentioned in the debate.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eight people were killed and 10 were wounded in a heavy mortar and artillery
attack on central Sarajevo yesterday, the latest in a series of relatively
isolated but deadly attacks on the besieged Bosnian capital, Reuter reports
from Sarajevo.
Doctors at Kosevo hospital, the main casualty centre, said five women and
three men were killed when two mortar rounds landed near the Drvenija bridge
and near the barracks of the Egyptian United Nations brigade. A Bosnian
soldier was killed by a sniper in the Vogosca district.
The latest fighting has forced UN peacekeepers to close the airport, which
is under their control.
Fierce fighting was also reported in central Bosnia. According to Croatian
radio, Moslem troops launched a heavy artillery and mortar attack on Croat
positions around Zepce. The radio said the Moslem side used two helicopters
to drop explosive devices on Croat positions, in violation of a UN no-fly
zone over the whole of former Yugoslavia.
The radio also reported that special units of the 3rd Corps of the
Moslem-led government army, including some foreign Mujahideen, fired more
than 100 shells at the Zepce area in central Bosnia.
To the east of the Bosnian capital Serbs were reported by
government-controlled Sarajevo radio to have attacked two Moslem enclaves
that are supposed to be UN 'safe areas'. The radio said four people had been
killed and two wounded over the past few days in artillery attacks on
Gorazde, south-east of Sarajevo, and five people were wounded by shelling in
Srebrenica, north-east of the capital.
Meanwhile, the UN said yesterday that it had agreed to let Bosnian Serb

FT  15 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Kohl tries to calm German nerves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday warned against any 'over-dramatisation' of
the election results in Russia.
In an interview to be published in today's issue of Bild, the mass
circulation popular newspaper, he expressed his confidence that 'President
Yeltsin and the forces which support him will continue along the path of
reforms'.
He insisted that Germany would continue to support the Russian president,
and praised his success in winning electoral backing for his new
constitution.
The chancellor's words contrasted with a weak performance on the Frankfurt
stock exchange, as shares and bonds fell in afternoon trading over concern
about events in Russia. Germany is the largest western investor in Russia,
and the country's largest trading partner, in spite of a sharp reduction in
trade levels over the past 18 months.
Dealers reported a particular flurry of activity after an interview recorded
by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the far-right Liberal Democratic Party
in Moscow, was broadcast on German radio. In the interview, given well
before Sunday's election, but first aired yesterday, he threatened a nuclear
disaster in Germany if it sought to interfere in Russia's affairs.
'The Germans are interfering in Russia now, but if a German looks at Russia
the wrong way when I am in the Kremlin, you Germans will pay for all that we
Russians have built up in Germany,' he said. He would not hesitate to create
a 'Chernobyl in Germany' to prevent any interference.
Mr Kohl was, in contrast, as phlegmatic as possible. 'In spite of all our
concern at the developments, there is still no cause for
over-dramatisation,' he said.
'We want a democratic, a stable, and an economically healthy Russia, which
is a predictable partner. Whatever we can contribute to that we will
continue to do in the future.'
German industry is also maintaining an attitude of calm in the face of the
election results. Mr Michael Fuchs, president of the Federation of German
Wholesalers and Exporters, said the outcome would not cause any 'dramatic
influence on western economic activities in Russia'.
He said that approval of the new constitution would provide 'greater
long-term clarity', and the tendency of voters to support extremists would
diminish 'once the people can experience the success of a market economy'.
The German foreign ministry announced that Mr Klaus Kinkel, the Foreign
Minister, will fly to Moscow on Friday for two days of informal talks with
his counterpart, Mr Andrei Kozyrev.

FT  15 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Redland slides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A variety of reasons were put forward to explain the underperformance of
Redland, whose shares gave ground as other leading building materials stocks
made good progress.
Dealers described the loss of Mr Gerald Corbett, the finance director, to
Grand Metropolitan as a serious blow to Redland, but also focused on the
impact of the Russian elections on sentiment in Germany, where Redland has a
significant presence. There was also a worry that the much hoped for
reduction in German interest rates may be deferred until the new year.
Redland retreated 6 to 577p on turnover of 1.4m shares. RMC, also extremely
sensitive to economic trends in Germany, shrugged off the interest rate
worries, closing 5 higher at 904p. GrandMet also fell back, with talk of a
big US seller and reaction to Mr Corbett's appointment. The shares dropped
13 to 445p.
The recent welter of heavy interim dividend increases from the utilities
sectors continued apace, with the waters, recs and power generators
beneficiaries of some sizeable switching out of the market's cyclical areas
and into the relative safe havens of the utilities.
After Monday's bout of profit-taking, many of the recs returned to favour.
Northern, due to report interims this morning and expected to increase its
payment by around 18 per cent, advanced 10 to a peak 706p. Southern
Electricity, up 7 at 679p, announced the expected 20 per cent rise in
dividend.
Water shares outperformed the recs, however, still boosted by the recent
European Commission move to redefine its water quality standards. Southern
Water's dividend was up to best expectations and saw the shares rise 12 to
660p. North West was the front runner among the FT-SE 100 constituents,
finishing 12 stronger at 586p, while Severn Trent gained 9 at a peak 626p.
Anglian Water closed 7 up at 586p after 589p.
Lucas Industries was one of the most resilient performers in the motor
components area of the market, the shares creeping up almost imperceptibly
to a record 196p before ending a net 1 1/2 ahead at 195 1/2 p. Turnover was
an unremarkable 1.8m shares. Dealers reported plenty of keen buying interest
in the stock and noted a resurgence of takeover speculation involving the
likes of T&amp;N.
BP continued to attract the lion's share of activity in the oil sector, but
came under some determined selling pressure late in the session as Wall
Street lost ground.
The stock was given a strong boost on Monday as at least two of the market's
most influential brokers, NatWest Securities and Hoare Govett, were said to
have been keen buyers of the shares. Today BP hosts a presentation to
investment analysts at Britannic House.
Other analysts, however, were sceptical of some of the recent bullish
stories on BP. 'I will be very interested to hear how BP will manage to
achieve some of the more exotic profits figures that are said to be in the
market if the oil price continues around the current Dollars 13 levels,'
said one specialist. BP ended 2 1/2 firmer at 326 1/2 p, after reaching 334p
around midday.
Lasmo held at 107p. PDFM, the fund management group which has sharply
increased its stake in Lasmo over the past few months, announced that it had
lifted its holding in the debt-laden oil group by 6.4m shares in the past
two weeks. PDFM's stake was raised from 12.16 per cent to 13 per cent.
Granada Group added 6 at 501p, with UBS said to be positive. The
announcement that Granada target LWT was in talks with Yorkshire TV saw the
former fall back 12 to 576p. YTV put on 2 at 165p.
Composite insurers came under pressure shortly after midday, with one
marketmaker said to have been offering stock acquired in the previous day's
programme trade. General Accident fell 18 to 706p, Royal Insurance 12 to
311p and Sun Alliance 8 to 365p.
Radio shares were active following good results from Southern Radio, up 7 at
65p. Chiltern Radio climbed 14 to 116p, Capital Radio 5 to 254p and GWR 27
to 630p.

FT  15 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Stores weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were a variety of bearish stories doing the rounds in a muted stores
sector. Boots and Kingfisher were under pressure from talk that one of the
big supermarket operators was about to embark on a promotion of its
toiletries range which could lead the way to margin pressures similar to
those that have afflicted the food sectors.
Stores analysts were largely dismissive of talk of a 'cosmetic price war',
arguing that the supermarkets were unlikely to add to their already tough
margin pressures.
Kingfisher was also undermined by nervousness ahead of Darty's postponed
results on Friday. The shares slid 12 to 719p, although turnover was thin.
Boots was additionally pressured by a big seller. The stock fell 15 1/2 to
534 1/2 p.
Meanhwile, the stores sector continued to be plagued with rumours of dull
pre-Christmas sales. Signet, which has been one of the worst hit stocks,
yesterday managed a half-penny recovery to 17 1/2 p. But elsewhere, WH Smith
'A' dipped 3 to 507p, Storehouse 3 to 229p, Marks and Spencer 2 to 444p and
Dixons 1 to 284p.

FT  15 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Trafalgar rocked by results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of the dire warnings, results from Trafalgar House still managed to
shake the market as investors and analysts attempted to take in the scale of
the losses and provisions.
The final deficit for the year to September 30 was Pounds 347.2m, including
an exceptional charge of Pounds 397.3m. The dividend of 3.25p was as
forecast by the company at the time of its profits warning in October.
However, the company set the seal on the market's disappointment by stating
that the current-year dividend was unlikely to be above one penny.
All this, together with details of a Pounds 404m one-for-three rights offer
at 100p a share and a convertible issue as well, sent weary investors
rushing to sell. The shares came under immediate pressure and stayed that
way as talk of an angry post-results meeting filtered into the market. They
closed off the bottom but still 10 down at 77 1/2 p in heavy 30m turnover.
Dealers said the relative attractiveness of the convertible pointed to
further weakness ahead for the underlying stock.
It also raised the speculation further that Hong Kong Land, which holds a 25
per cent stake in Trafalgar, will embark on a full takeover.

FT  15 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early advance turned back in nervous
session - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A nervous stock market in London yesterday fell prey to a host of unsettling
factors, ranging from the implications of the Russian election results to
the prospects for interest rates in continental Europe and moves by the US
and the European Union towards a settlement of the Gatt debate. Adding to
uncertainty was heightened activity in stock index futures ahead of expiry
on Friday of the December future contract on the Footsie index.
An erratic trading session saw the FT-SE 100 Index travel through a range of
nearly 35 points before closing 6.2 down at 3,248.4. Traders sounded
uncomfortable at the close, pointing to weakness in other European bourses
after reported comments from Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky of Russia's Liberal
Democrats party, and to falls in UK bonds. Equity trading volumes increased
as share prices eased in the second half of the session. 'We've had all the
good news for a while. Now is the time to watch out,' commented the leading
dealer at a US house.
The session started well, with the Footsie soon ahead by 23 points at an
intra-day peak of 3,277.6 as firmness in the December stock index future
supported hopes that the domestic Retail Price Index, due this morning, and
the Bundesbank council meeting tomorrow, will open the way to a cut of at
least half a point in domestic interest rates before Christmas.
However, analysts and traders in the Continental markets were clearly more
cautious than London ahead of the Bundesbank meeting, and UK stocks began to
falter as currency markets moved nervously. Dealers said that buyers were
less willing to chase share prices until the stock index futures market
clears its expiry hurdle.
Record closes overnight in key US stock market indices had given London a
boost at first but the new session saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average
turning off from a firm start to show a fall of 10 points in UK trading
hours.
International blue chip stocks drew sustenance from the firmness of the US
dollar which helps their overseas sales and profits. Pharmaceutical stocks
achieved a scattering of gains which helped the Footsie Index.
Among domestic issues, Trafalgar House, the hotels and shipping group,
delivered the disappointments for which the stock market was braced. Higher
dividend payments continued to help some utility stocks and the expected
indications of further bid activity surfaced among in the television sector.
Trading volume, moderate at first, had increased by the close of business to
a Seaq total of 705.4m shares, compared with 654.1m on Monday, when retail
or customer trade was worth Pounds 1.4bn. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 6.7
ahead at another new peak of 3,614.3, but its gain had been halved in the
second half of the day. Trade in non-Footsie stocks increased to around 63
per cent of the day's total.
Optimism on the outlook for UK interest rates was helped by reports from the
Confederation of British Industry of increased retail sales. But the overall
market prediction is that today will bring news of a small rise in domestic
Retail Price Index in November.
With international funds unwilling to chase share prices in London this
week, the stock market is influenced by near-term and largely domestic
considerations, with Friday's expiry in derivatives markets in both London
and New York an important factor.

FT  15 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives markets remained preoccupied yesterday with expiry of the
December futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index, writes Terry Byland.
Investors, including both institutions and local traders, continued to roll
contracts over from the December position to the March contract, which will
take over leadership at mid-morning on Friday. However, in spite of high
volumes in both contracts yesterday, dealers warned that many positions
still have to be rolled over before the December expiry.
For much of the session, December showed a premium of 6 to 10 points over
cash - fair value is now zero. This provided good encouragement for
underlying equities which was also reflected in a spread of around 21
points, or 7 on fair value, between the December and March contracts.
However, the picture darkened abruptly towards the close on reports, later
questioned, of threatening comments from the leader of Russia's Liberal
Democrats. The premium on December quickly vanished, replaced briefly by a
two-point discount. The discount was recovered before the official close and
selling pressure abated in later trading.
Volume in the December future was nearly 19,000 lots and in March about
8,000.
In an active traded options sector, turnover jumped to 35,490 contracts from
Monday's 25,608. The Footsie option increased its share sharply, recording
15,626 lots against 9,486.
Among the individual options, the Euro FT-SE headed the list with 3,619
lots. Market nervousness towards BTR stock brought 1,613 trades in the
option.

FT  15 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Russian events and weak bonds
hit Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks retreated yesterday as a weak bond market and political
developments in Russia encouraged a round of profit-taking in cyclical
issues, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 21.80 down at 3,742.63, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.64 to 463.06. The American SE composite was
off 2.94 at 461.83 and the Nasdaq composite fell 8.25 to 751.47. New York SE
volume was 275m shares and declines led rises by 1,376 to 700.
Investors were largely indifferent to the day's economic news. As forecast,
the Commerce Department reported retail sales in November had risen 0.4 per
cent, following an upward revised 1.8 per cent increase in October.
If some investors were reassured by the steady growth in the sale of durable
goods, others saw grounds for pessimism in the moderating month-to-month
trend, even though it had been widely expected. For the most part, however,
the data were neutral.
By contrast, political developments in Russia, which appeared to threaten
the reform process, were clearly unsettling. A mid-morning downturn in the
US Treasury market further rattled Wall Street, even though bond act-ivity
was driven by technical factors.
As a result, stocks most likely to benefit from a buoyant economy gave back
some of their gains from the previous, record-breaking session. Alcoa
slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 72 3/8 , 3M Dollars  1/2 to 110 3/8 ,
Cummins Engine Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 53 3/4 and International Paper
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 67 1/8 . IBM was Dollars 1 1/4 lower at Dollars 56
1/8 , but General Electric gained Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 102 3/8 .
The Big Three car makers were weaker, led by Chrysler, down Dollars 1 5/8 at
Dollars 55 1/8 . Ford relinquished Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 63 1/2 and GM
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 55.
Brown-Forman surged ahead after offering to buy up to 4.2m of its shares in
a Dutch auction at Dollars 83 to Dollars 90 each. The distiller's 'A' stock
shot up Dollars 15 1/8 to Dollars 86 and the 'B' Dollars 11 7/8 to Dollars
85 3/4 .
Among other beverage stocks, Anheuser-Busch shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 49 3/8
on news of its plans to cut beer prices in a move to stem declining sales of
its premium brands. Philip Morris, which owns Miller Brewing, dipped Dollars
 5/8 to Dollars 54 7/8 .
Federal Express climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 71 1/2 after analysts
raised their ratings on the stock.
On the Amex, Medco Research jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 15 3/4 after its
Adensoscan heart disease detection drug moved a step closer to FDA approval.
Canada
Toronto moved sharply lower in busy trading amid further profit-taking after
reaching an all-time high last week.
The TSE 300 index ended 48.9 off at 4,244.4, the third decline in the past
four sessions. Falls outnumbered advances by 543 to 285. Volume was 75.5m
shares valued at CDollars 928m.
The transportation group retreated 3.1 per cent and the gold shares index
shed 1.4 per cent. Metals and minerals lost 2.2 per cent as metal prices
fell back sharply.

FT  15 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses lower after unhappy
afternoon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear threats to Germany and Japan made by the Russian right-wing leader,
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, based on an old interview according to North German
Radio in Hamburg, were reported as news early yesterday afternoon and not
clarified until later. Bourses ended the day much less buoyantly than they
began, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was marginally higher at one point but it saw the DAX fall 22.78
to 2,149.97 on the official session, and slide further to an Ibis-indicated
low of 2,128.07 at the end of the post bourse.
Turnover eased from DM9.4bn to DM9.2bn. Mr Thomas Nolten, of B Metzler in
Frankfurt, said that, at least in the morning and early afternoon, the
market was using the Russian elections as an additional excuse to mark
stocks down, and that short-covering in recent days had left the market with
little resistance to small investment selling from German holders.
US investors, said Mr Nolten, were out of the market, having driven the DAX
through the 2,000 and 2,100 levels. That said, foreign investment favourites
were particularly weak at one point or the other: Schering, the
pharmaceuticals stock, was DM47.50, or 4.2 per cent lower DM1.073 on the
session and Mannesmann, which peaked at DM401, closed DM8.50 below that at
DM391.50 in the London afternoon.
Elsewhere, profit-taking hit the banking sector with Commerzbank most
prominent, fall DM9.50 to DM382.50 on the session and another DM3 to
DM379.50 after hours.
PARIS blamed profit-taking ahead of the expected Gatt agreement, programme
selling from the US, and nervousness over Mr Zhirinovsky as the CAC 40 index
dropped 39.81, or 1.8 per cent to 2,156.50.
Mr Michael Woodcock, of Nikko Securities, was cautious over the Gatt deal
and the apparent French victory on the film and television front, noting
that Canal Plus, involved quite heavily in film production, fell FFr29 to
FFr1,270 on the day.
Big blue chips were hit later by Russia worries, Elf Aquitaine losing
FFr16.70, or 4 per cent at FFr410.10. Elf's fall also reflected the
government's decision to keep a golden share, and the veto, after its
privatisation.
ZURICH was unable to maintain its early momentum and the SMI index, which
had posted record highs for the previous four sessions, shed 9.1 to 2,864.8.
However, turnover was low, with a virtual absence of foreign demand.
Analysts commented that lower interest rates still held the key to the
market's further advance, suggesting that some investors were becoming
uneasy about the impact of the strong local currency on corporate profits,
particularly of the exporters.
Blue chips were mostly lower: Nestle, the most active stock dipped SFr2 to
SFr1,252.
A SFr12 rise to SFr730 in Swiss Re certificates was attributed to recent
changes in the capital structure.
Baloise registered shares firmed SFr25 to SFr2,585 in response to the
insurer's statement that it may raise the dividend.
Georg Fischer, planning to close a loss making German subsidary, added SFr40
to SFr1,030.
MILAN was subdued by technical considerations ahead of today's end of the
monthly account, but the the Comit index managed a 3.32 rise to 591.77. Fiat
continued in good form with a L41 rise to L4,355 attributed to investors
focusing on prospects for 1994.
Credito Italiano was steadier after Monday's profit-taking which followed
the sharp post-privatisation surge. The shares eased L8 to L2,342. A L59, or
3.0 per cent to L1,499 in Olivetti was attributed to profit-taking.
AMSTERDAM finished a quiet session at the day's lows in response to the
weakness of Wall Street's opening and Frankfurt's late trading. The CBS
Tendency index shed 0.6 to 139.3. ISTANBUL jumped 4.6 per cent in heavy
buying, reversing four days of falls. The composite index added 798.3 to
18,143.5 as buyers were drawn back by the lower prices, and in reaction to
an easing of lira overnight rates.
ATHENS continued higher, bullish sentiment following the success of recent
new issues continuing to feed the market: Aktor, the construction company
was 267 times subscribed last week. The general index added 13.84 to 936.90.

FT  15 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Dublin brokers celebrate buoyant year
for equities - Tim Coone looks at Ireland's high performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year, champagne corks will be popping at the Christmas parties of
Dublin's stockbroking community as never before.
After a gloomy 1992, the Irish market has mounted a sustained rally
throughout the year, rising by almost 50 per cent. Market turnover is
approaching the IPounds 6bn level, almost twice that of 1992, and some 40
per cent up on the previous record high of IPounds 4.3bn in 1987.
At this time last year, the ERM currency crisis and speculative assaults
upon the punt had driven up Irish interest rates to levels which cast a long
shadow over Irish corporate earnings and the domestic equity market.
Brokers sighed over their mortgages and their disappearing commissions.
But as every cloud is professed to have its silver lining, the 1992 gloom
made Irish equities appear very cheap by comparison with other markets.
The two main factors which, since then, have driven this year's bull market
are the 10 per cent devaluation of the punt last January and an
unprecedented influx of around IPounds 700m from overseas investors, nearly
matching the cash flow from domestic institutions. The latter has been
boosted by the inclusion of Irish stocks in the Morgan Stanley Capital
International Index last May, attracting more US funds to the market, and
the steady drop in Irish interest rates since the devaluation which has
boosted growth forecasts for the Irish economy over the next two to three
years, putting it near the top of the EU league table.
So can the rally be sustained into 1994?
Goodbody, the Dublin stockbrokers, anticipate a 20 per cent growth in Irish
corporate earnings in 1994 and a 10 per cent increase in dividends. A robust
domestic economy and recovery in the UK and the US, which together account
for around 90 per cent of the earnings base of the Irish market, are
expected to underpin further growth in market capitalisation into 1994.
But NCB stockbrokers in Dublin point out that the 1993 rally has done no
more than bring the market back into line, on a three-year basis, with other
markets (with the exception of Japan).
They, along with other Dublin brokers' reports published in the past month,
warn of the risk of overseas profit-taking in the not-too-distant future,
with the spring targeted as the market high.
While overseas interest in the Irish market has been welcomed by brokers and
corporate executives alike, as a counterbalance to Irish institutions
continuing to move into overseas markets with the final removal of all
exchange controls at the start of the year, there is a recognition that
overseas holdings of Irish equities are more speculative and therefore more
volatile.
Forecasts for 1994 vary between a more modest high of 20 per cent growth in
the ISEQ index from Davys stockbrokers, to a low of 12 to 14 per cent from
Goodbody. NCB come in between at 17 per cent. NCB expects Irish industrial
stocks to outperform financial issues in the second half of the year.
Riada, the stockbrokers, also opt for a 17 per cent growth forecast. Mr John
Clarke, an analyst with Riada, says: 'The growth in 1993 has been within
historical parameters and has come from a low base. On a price/earnings
ratio basis, the market still looks cheap. We have not run ahead of the
others.' The prospective 1994 for Irish equities, according to all these
brokers, is somewhere around the 13 mark.
Market forces at work during the coming year, counteracting lower overseas
interest, will be greater liquidity in the domestic market and fewer cash
calls from Irish companies. Fundings and placings of around IPounds 700m
this year have absorbed most of the domestic cash flow to Irish
institutions. But only IPounds 350m to IPounds 400m is expected to be called
for in 1994.
Brokers point out that Irish quoted companies are well capitalised in the
case of the banks and financial institutions, while the industrial stocks
are lowly geared and have a relatively healthy dividend cover - 2.4 for the
Irish market compared to 2.0 and below for many of the others.
While cash flow into institutional unit funds is still only at a trickle, it
is expected to increase through 1994 as interest rates fall to an
anticipated 5 per cent by the year-end.
So while market buoyancy is expected to result in a moderate demand for
funds for expansion and opportunistic reasons, this 'will not cause any
major digestion problems for the market', according to one of Dublin's
leading brokers.
That said, whether brokers will be breaking open the champagne a year from
now remains to be seen.

FT  15 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taiwan surges 3.5 per
cent to 21-month high
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Small-lot technical trading dominated activity as investors focused on
political developments, and the Nikkei average closed lower for the first
time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-share index lost 18.60 at 17,308.73 after moving within a narrow
range of 17,415.74 and 17,263.43. The Topix index of all first section
stocks shed 11.13 to 1,451.01. Volume was 200m shares, down from 221m.
Declines outscored rises by 565 to 391, with 199 issues unchanged. In London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.56 to 1,190.45.
With the government's decision over rice out of the way, there was a
perceived need for the Japanese prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, to
extend the current parliamentary session to allow for the passage of the
political reform bill. Investors are cautious over threats by Liberal
Democrats, the leading opposition party, to oppose such a proposal. If the
government and the LDP cannot come to an agreement, the decision will be
left to Ms Takako Doi, speaker of the lower house.
Concern over whether the supplementary budget bills for the current fiscal
year will pass through parliament by Wednesday, the last day of the current
session, also weighed on yesterday's trading.
The government's official acceptance of a compromise deal to open Japan's
rice market spurred buying in related stocks. Kamugumi, a port transporter,
gained Y10 at Y1,160 and Mitsubishi Warehouse and Transportation rose Y40 to
Y1,480.
Skylark, a restaurant chain, surged Y240 to Y2,280 on rumours that a leading
Japanese broker was promoting the stock; it posted the largest percentage
rise of the day.
Foreigners sold bank shares, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank declining Y50 to Y1,850.
Profit-taking hit high-technology issues, which gained ground on Monday,
while heavy electricals were also lower, with Hitachi down Y25 to Y815.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone firmed Y1,000 to Y736,000 while East Japan
Railway fell Y5,000 to Y417,000.
A rise in gold bullion prices in overseas markets supported mining shares,
with Sumitomo Metal Mining climbing Y26 to Y800 and Mitsui Mining and
Smelting adding Y12 at Y370.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 121.55 to 19,201.24 in volume of 29.6m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, advanced Y210 to Y7,100 on bargain
hunting.
Roundup
Hong Kong took a tumble after the recent bull run, but further records were
set elsewhere in the Pacific Rim. Bombay was closed as brokers boycotted
business to protest at Monday's ban on carry forward deals announced by the
authorities in a bid to restrain the sharply advancing market.
TAIWAN surged ahead 3.5 per cent to a 21-month high in turnover that rose to
its heaviest level since April 1991. The weighted index added 173.15 at
5,102.96 in turnover that expanded to TDollars 104.9bn from Monday's
TDollars 93.87bn.
The bullish sentiment was helped by media reports quoting Finance Minister
Lin Chen-kuo as saying the ministry's proposal to reimpose a stock capital
gains tax, expected by the end of this month, would not have a big impact on
the market.
The banking sector jumped 6.7 per cent as several brokers noted strong
foreign buying, especially in insurance issues. MANILA ended at its high for
the year, spurred by a rise in bullion prices. The market index peaked at an
intraday 2,618.95 before profit-taking left it finishing 4.28 up on balance
at 2,583.49.
KARACHI closed at a record peak for a second consecutive day, the KSE
100-share index jumping 36.98 to 1,909.60.
HONG KONG retreated 2.2 per cent as profits were taken, but sporadic bargain
hunting helped the Hang Seng index pick up from the day's low of 9,992.39 to
close 227.11 down at 10,021.48.
SINGAPORE encountered a wave of buying towards the end of the trading day
that helped to push the Straits Times Industrial index up 7.04 to its fourth
closing high in a row of 2,252.31.
AUSTRALIA paused after the recent strong rally and the All Ordinaries index
ended 7.9 easier at 2,086.6. Wall Street's overnight performance and a rise
in metal prices gave the market some impetus in early trade, but it petered
out after a sharp reversal in futures trading and a lack of buyer interest.
SEOUL overcame early consolidation as blue chip manufacturing shares
rallied. The composite stock index finished 7.17 higher at 857.20.
KUALA LUMPUR was mostly lower on profit-taking but strong gains in some
component stocks pushed the key Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange composite index
up 2.31 points to a new closing peak of 1,092.66.
BANGKOK encountered profit-taking that left the SET index 2.18 lower at
1,482.99 in robust turnover of Bt23.59bn.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 capital index weakened 18.58 to 2,087.54.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Russia dampens D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark weakened across the board on investors' increasing unease in the
face of Russian radical nationalism and continued speculation over a
possible cut in German interest rates this week, writes Conner Middelmann.
After initially shrugging off the strong gains of Russia's right-wing
Liberal Democratic party at Sunday's Russian elections, currency traders
mulled over the implications of right-wing leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
victory.
News agency reports that Mr Zhirinovsky was threatening Germany and Japan
with nuclear attacks caused market jitters. However, it later transpired
that the reports were based on comments he had made to a Hamburg based radio
station in 1991 which were repeated by that station in a programme last
Sunday.
'I was surprised the D-Mark did not react to the Russian news on Monday, but
(yesterday) it may have overreacted,' said Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior
economist with IBJ International in London.
'At this level, Germany is a buy,' said Mr Brian Hilliard, senior
international economist at SGST in London. 'The market reaction to the
Russian developments is understandable, but not really justified.'
Further undermining the D-Mark was continuing speculation that the
Bundesbank's central bank council would reduce interest rates at its meeting
tomorrow.
Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer's confirmation that the council meeting
would be followed by a press conference gave the dollar a brief fillip. Mr
Tietmeyer said the purpose of the briefing would be to announce the M3 money
supply target for 1994, but some traders were hoping that it would be taken
as an opportunity to announce a cut in interest rates.
The Bundesbank in its latest monthly report, published yesterday, said that
it had made increasing use of fixed-rate securities repurchase agreements to
quell excessive speculation of easing. On December 2 it announced it would
hold fixed-rate repos at 6 per cent until January 5, the day before the
first council meeting in the new year.
None the less, a survey by market analysis company IDEA revealed that some
40 per cent of market participants still expect the Bundesbank to lower its
5.75 per cent discount rate by 50 basis points on technical grounds to widen
the present 25 basis-point gap between the repo rate and the discount rate.
Ultimately, whether the Bundesbank cuts rates tomorrow or not should make
little difference to the markets. 'The important rate cut - the recent  1/4
percentage point cut in the repo rate - has already taken place; only a move
that will affect money market rates will have a lasting impact,' said IBJ's
Ms Niffikeer. With repos fixed at 6 per cent, even a cut in the discount
rate would have little affect on money market rates.
Nervousness over the Russian political situation and continued German rate
cut hopes pushed the US dollar to a high of DM1.7175. However, it eased back
on slightly weaker than expected US retail sales numbers to end at DM1.7135,
up from DM1.7050 on Monday. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose to
Y109.35, from Y108.95 on Monday. In New York the US currency finished at
DM1.7146 and Y109.37.
Comments from senior US trade representative Mickey Kantor that the US and
the European Union had resolved their trade differences, paving the way to a
Gatt world trade treaty by its deadline tonight, had little impact on the
currency markets. 'A Gatt settlement was pretty much priced in,' said a
senior currency dealer in London.
Dogged by the Russian worries, the D-Mark also lost ground against most
currencies in the ERM.
The French franc ended at FFr3.422 to the D-Mark, unchanged from Monday's
close but off the high of FFr3.4140 seen during the day. The Belgian franc
finished at BFr20.86 per D-Mark, up from BFr20.94 on Monday, while the
Danish krone climbed to DKr3.916, from DKr3.923 the previous day.
Among the southern European currencies, the Spanish peseta rose to Pta81.69
per D-Mark, from Pta81.91 on Monday, and the Italian lira ended at L987.1,
up from L989.4.
Sterling had another strong day, helped by the D-Mark's weakness but also
underpinned by a slightly bullish survey from the Confederation of British
Industry. The pound closed at DM2.5500, up from DM2.5425 after hitting a
high of DM2.5530. Against the US dollar it ended at Dollars 1.4885, down
from Monday's Dollars 1.4905.
Meanwhile, the sterling money market remained very tight, causing the
overnight rate to jump as high as 18 per cent in afternoon dealings, traders
said.
A senior money dealer added: 'The tightness from last week's gilts sale is
still overhanging the market.'
The Bank of England announced a shortage of Pounds 1.5bn which was later
revised to Pounds 1.6bn. In early operations it bought bills totalling
Pounds 200m for resale to the market on January 5 and 6 at 5 13/32 per cent.
In further operations it purchased bills amounting to Pounds 24m at 5 3/8
per cent, followed by Pounds 388m at the same rate. Finally, the Bank
provided late assistance of some Pounds 790m.
Traders will be looking to today's release of November retail price and
sales data for further clues of inflation trends and whether these might
permit base rate cuts.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price of cobalt up sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The free market price of cobalt has soared by more than one-third in the
past three days, traders reported yesterday.
Cobalt - a hard metal used in superalloys in such things as cutting tools,
high-strength magnets and jet engines, as a powder in catalysts for the oil
and man-made fibre industries and in radial tyres - had jumped from
USDollars 11 a pound on Friday morning to Dollars 15 by yesterday afternoon.
'In less than a week the whole wind direction has changed. What was a
buyers' market is now one where consumers are scrambling to buy,' said Mr
Nick French, a director of Wogen Resources, the London-based minor metals
trader.
He said the writing had been on the wall for some months because both
producer and consumer stocks were low, little cobalt was emerging from
Russia, and traders, who burned their fingers when they misjudged the extent
of the recent fall in price - it has come down from Dollars 30 two years ago
to a low between Dollars 9 and Dollars 10 a pound - had not had the
confidence to stock up.
Prices were driven down by the sudden appearance of Russia as an exporter
after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Cobalt is produced mainly as a by-product of copper and nickel.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: OECD report praises Hungary's
low farm subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A report on Hungarian agriculture by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development suggests that the sector is among the best
placed to benefit from a liberalisation in world trade that would follow a
successful conclusion of the negotiations in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
The study, the first such focused OECD report, finds that the level of
agricultural subsidy in Hungary is lower than in any of the 24 developed
states except New Zealand.
Hungary has a 'producer subsidy equivalent' of just 8 per cent compared with
an OECD average of 44 per cent, according to the latest 1992 figures.
Budapest's agriculture ministry said that the low level of support put
Hungary's farm sector in a strong position in the event of a Gatt
breakthrough that freed up world trade. While most countries would have to
cut subsidies, Hungary would be allowed to maintain the current level of
support and competitiveness would therefore improve, the ministry said.
A Gatt agreement would ease access to western European markets and, more
importantly for Hungary, curtail dumping by European Union countries in
third markets.
Hungary blames subsidised western European competition in part for the
decline in its food exports to the former Soviet Union and last week drew
attention to undercutting by German pork producers.
While praising Hungary for reducing agricultural subsidies, the OECD warned
that state support for farmers had bounced back in 1993 and that Hungary
risked following western Europe's bad example.
The release of the OECD report clashed with Hungary's announcement that
imports of dairy, sugar and pasta products would require licences next year.
The move reverses a long process of liberalisation that had freed up all but
10 per cent of Hungarian imports. In 1994, 12 per cent of imports will
require official permission.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuban oil production set to
soar 45%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   KINGSTON, JAMAICA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In an effort to ease a severe energy shortage that is crippling its battered
economy, Cuba's domestic oil industry has lifted output to 1.1m tonnes in
the year to November and is anticipating 1.2m tonnes for the full year, 45
per cent more than 1992 output.
The industry's hopes for even higher production have been raised by the
decision of a foreign consortium, led by Total of France, to drill
exploratory wells off the island's north coast early next year.
The domestic oil industry is being given more attention following a severe
reduction in oil imports after the break-up of the Soviet Union, which was
Cuba's main supplier. Imports once averaged 13m tonnes per year, of which
11.5m tonnes were consumed and the rest re-exported to western markets.
Imports last year fell to 6.1m tonnes, and will be less this year.
It was once cheaper for Cuba to import Soviet oil than to exploit its own
high sulphur deposits, mainly along the north coast.
The shortage has led to power cuts on the island, increased rationing of
petroleum products and has adversely affected transportation in the key
agriculture sector.
This year's output by the domestic industry will be the highest ever,
surpassing the 938,000 tonnes of 1986. The locally-produced crude is used in
some of the island's electricity generating plants, but these are running
below rated capacity.
The consortium led by Total includes Compagnie Europeanee des Petroles of
France, and Fortuna Petroleum of Canada. It was granted a six year contract
24 months ago by Comercial Cupet, a subsidiary of Cubapetroleo (Cupet), the
Cuban state company.
The consortium has been doing seismological surveys in a 1,800 sq km
concession in the Santa Clara region and the decision to drill the
exploratory wells is being interpretted in Cuba as an indication that the
deposits in the concession are commercially exploitable.
The Cuban authorities are hoping to attract more foreign companies to the
oil industry, following its invitation earlier this year to Canadian and
European companies to bid for concessions covering 11 blocks of between
1,400 and 6,000 sq km. Seven of the blocks are onshore, three are offshore
and one is both offshore and onshore.
US companies cannot be involved because of Washington's 30 year-old economic
embargo on Cuba. The island's government is offering 25 year contracts and
production sharing arrangements, while the foreign companies are expected to
provide their own capital and equipment.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentines angry over extension
of fishing zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A report in Argentina's press yesterday has thrown into confusion
negotiations over the presentation of the 1994 fisheries agreement with
Britain.
Argentina and the UK agreed in October substantially to raise next year's
catch of the prized illex squid, the most sought-after resource in the
waters surrounding the Falkland Islands.
Argentina will increase its catch by 70 per cent to 220,000 tonnes but the
Falklands will retain their 1993 quota of 150,000 tonnes.
However, Clarin, Argentina's largest-selling newspaper, yesterday reported
that the Falklands would open a sector of their waters closed to fishing
since 1990. It criticised this as a 'new step in the British government's
policy of faits accomplis' and implied that Argentina had been duped.
Argentina has not lifted its claim over the islands, despite its defeat in
the Falklands conflict of 1982. It resents British policy decisions in the
region as an affront to its sovereignty. President Carlos Menem says
Argentina will 'recover' the islands by the year 2000.
However, British officials say they told Argentina in October of their
decision to open the Falklands Outer Conservation Zone, a 50-mile-wide
sector of sea north-east of the islands. The zone, set up in 1990 in the
first fishing agreement with Argentina, had been renewed every year until
now.
London was able to defuse anger in the islands over the sharply increased
Argentine catch, by saying that opening the zone would make Falkland
licences more attractive to Asian fishing fleets.
Licence sales, the islands' largest revenue source, have fallen sharply in
the face of strong competition from Argentina. British officials say 1994
Falkland licence prices have increased by about 10 per cent.
A British official claimed that as a concession to Argentina, London had
played down the opening of the zone. He said: 'We are looking for ways to
give the Argentines a soft landing and make things presentationally helpful
for them'.
But in a statement yesterday, Argentina's foreign ministry portrayed its
agreement to opening the zone as a concession to Britain. 'It is not (our)
objective to generate economic problems for the islands'.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper recovery 'unlikely
before 1995'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The copper market will have to wait until 1995 before a substantial increase
in demand and a drawdown of stocks will cause a marked rebound in prices,
according to Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group.
Analysts Karen Foster and Angus MacMillan suggest copper supply will outpace
demand by 275,000 tonnes this year after a 75,000-tonne surplus in 1992.
They predict a further 150,000-tonnes surplus next year but a 200,000 supply
deficit in 1995.
This should take the average London Metal Exchange cash copper price, which
reached 104 US cents a pound last year, down to 88 cents in 1993 and to 80
cents in 1994. The analysts suggest the price will get back to Dollars 1 a
pound in 1995.
In a special copper market review, Billiton forecasts that copper
consumption in the western world will slip from 9m tonnes last year to
8.975m tonnes this year before climbing to a record 9.175m tonnes in 1994
and 9.75m in 1995.
Meanwhile, supply in the west is expected to grow from 9m tonnes this year
to 9.1m tonnes in 1994 and to 9.35m tonnes in 1995. The analysts suggest the
west will remain a substantial importer of copper from Poland and the
Commonwealth of Independent States - of 250,000 tonnes this year, 225,000
tonnes next year and 200,000 tonnes in 1995 - and this will help to create
the supply surplus.
They also point out that between the end-1992 and end-1996 nearly 900,000
tonnes of new smelting capacity is expected to come into operation,
representing an increase of roughly 10 per cent to western world capacity.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Closure threat removed from
Dutch zinc smelter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of closure hanging over the Budel smelter in the Netherlands,
which produces about 5 per cent of the western world's zinc, was removed
yesterday, only days before the year-end deadline.
Budel, which employs 610 directly and provides a living for at least 600
more people, was under threat because it was running out of space to store
cadmium-containing hazardous waste called jarosite - a product of
electrolytic zinc production.
But yesterday it reached agreement with both the national and the local
provincial governments for storage permits to be issued.
It also revealed that it is studying the viability of using zinc concentrate
(an intermediate material) with a very low iron content from a
recently-discovered ore body in Australia (believed to be a CRA deposit in
Queensland), which would eliminate jarosite from smelter waste.
Technical and economic studies about this project should be completed in
1995 and the new concentrate could be used from 1998 onwards - in line with
the Netherlands government's policy of having no chemical waste disposal
after the year 2000.
Mr Wim de Graaf, Budel's general manager, said that by the end of this year
Fl300m (about USDollars 160m) of provisions will have been provided by the
smelter's joint owners - Billiton, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, and
Pasminco, the Australian resources company - and this should cover all the
costs of storage and after-care.
During the past 20 years Budel, 2km from the Belgian border, which has a
capcity of 215,000 tonnes a year, has generated nearly 2m tonnes of jarosite
and continues to produce about 100,000 tonnes a year. Previously the
Noord-Brabant regional government said this could not continue - the three
artificial ponds in which the waste is stored cover 50 hectares.
By working flat-out since 1985 Budel, in co-operation with Outokumpu, the
Finnish metals group, developed a method of smelting (or burning) jarosite
to turn it into an inert material that could be used for construction and
road building. But this technology would raise the smelter's costs by 25 to
30 per cent and leave it unable to compete with other zinc smelters
world-wide.
Mr de Graaf said the governments were now convinced that permanent storage
of jarosite in ponds with after-care was just as environmentally acceptable
and much less costly than reprocessing.
The last-minute nature of the decision can be judged by the fact that Budel
will start filling a fourth pond - already built but which it was previously
forbidden to use - in the first quarter of next year.
Ironically, European zinc producers are at present negotiating a smelter
'shut-down' agreement where the industry as a whole would pay the cost of
closing one or two smelters. Mr de Graaf said: 'We are glad to disappoint
them. It would have been ridiculous to close Budel, which is one of the two
best zinc plants in the world'.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Russian results unsettle prices in
European sector

German bond prices led other European markets lower yesterday on concern
about the strong support for right-wing leader Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky in
the Russian elections, while the imminent conclusion of the Gatt world trade
agreement failed to enthuse dealers.
After showing little reaction on Monday, the markets were unsettled
yesterday by reports that Mr Zhirinovsky had threatened Germany with nuclear
attack.
However, the Reuters report was based on an old interview, according to
North German Radio in Hamburg, which ran the interview as part of a profile
of Mr Zhirinovsky.
News that a Gatt trade deal appears to have been concluded failed to boost
the bond markets, which had discounted an agreement, traders said.
'It's important for its symbolic impact rather than for anything it will do
to boost world trade; but failure to agree a deal would have been negative
for the bond markets,' said Mr Kit Juckes, an economist at S. G. Warburg.
Mr Michael Burke, an economist at Citibank, described the agreement as a
series of 'bilateral trade agreements wrapped up in a package'.
Dealers said they did not expect the sell-off in the German bond market,
where prices fell half a point yesterday, to be protracted, citing the lack
of reaction to fears about the political situation in Russia in the foreign
exchange market.
'The German market had a relatively good run last week and was running out
of steam,' said Mr Ifty Islam, bond strategist at Merrill Lynch. '(Mr
Zhirinovsky) helped tip the scales,' he added.
In the futures market, the March bund contract on Liffe had reached a new
high of 101.05, before selling off sharply to end the day at its lowest
point of 100.26.
Traders were also discouraged by the Bundesbank's emphasis that its press
conference tomorrow is to announce next year's M3 broad money supply target,
apparently suggesting there will be no interest rate cut.
Dealers will be keeping a close eye on the M3 target: if the upper end of
the target range is left at 6 1/2 per cent, this will be viewed as broadly
positive for the bund market, leaving the way open for further interest rate
easing in the first quarter of next year.
US Treasury bonds weakened yesterday in a thin but volatile session mainly
driven by technical factors, rather than inconclusive data on November
retail sales.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down a full point
to 99 9/32 , with the yield rising to 6.298 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 100, to yield 4.232 per cent.
The long end at first held up well after the release of November retail
sales data, which showed a 0.4 per cent uptick, as forecast. Traders
apparently brushed aside yet another indication of moderate-to-strong growth
in the fourth quarter.
Near midday, the 30-year bond began to slip. Its losses mounted during the
afternoon, in parallel with a rise in the CRB commodity index. But the
severity of the downturn reflected the low level of activity, which tends to
exaggerate any price swings, rather than any fundamental shift in sentiment.
The gilts market held up relatively well, easing back less than  1/4 point
at the long end, causing the spread between gilts and bunds to narrow.
Dealers said they would be focusing on today's November retail price data
for further confirmation that inflationary pressures are under control.
Italian bonds also ended lower, dragged down by pressures elsewhere in
Europe, despite the fall in yields at yesterday's BTP (Italian government
bond) auction. Dealers said there were still strong expectations of further
rate cuts soon.
At the sale, the Italian treasury sold L1,000bn three-year notes at a net
yield of 6.98 per cent, down from 7.79 per cent in the last auction, and
L1,000bn five-year notes yielding 7.24 per cent, down from 7.98 per cent.
French bond futures also fell sharply after reaching a new high on the Matif
in Paris. French Bond prices dropped about  3/8 point, outperforming
Germany.
Japanese government bond futures were little changed during Far East
trading, but fell 20 basis points in European trading following Mr
Zhirinovsky's comments.

FT  15 DEC 93 / International Equity Issues: Sterlite continues steady
stream of Indian borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterlite Industries, an Indian manufacturer of telephone cables, copper rod,
and aluminium sheet and foil, made its debut in the international capital
market yesterday with the launch of a Dollars 90m Euro-convertible bond
issue.
The deal, due to be priced later this week, is the latest in a string of
issues from Indian borrowers, all eager to raise finance from international
investors. This steady stream shows little sign of abating next year.
Indian companies have raised nearly Dollars 800m this year with an
assortment of international equity and convertible bond issues, compared
with a total of Dollars 240m in 1992, according to figures from Euromoney
Bondware.
This year's deals include a Dollars 140m convertible bond from Reliance
Industries, the textiles and chemicals group, and a Dollars 75m global
depositary receipts issue from Mahindra and Mahindra, the Indian truck
manufacturer.
But such deals are likely to be dwarfed by the launch - probably in the
first quarter of 1994 - of an international equity offering from Videsh
Sanchar Nigam Limited, the Indian state-controlled international
telecommunications network.
Investment bankers expect the offering to raise more than Dollars 500m,
which would be the biggest share offer by an Indian company and the first
from the public sector. Salomon Brothers and Kleinwort Benson are co-global
co-ordinators.
VSNL will be the first telecom issue to surface from this particular
emerging market, and so is expected to meet with considerable interest from
specialist India funds as well as from funds with a broader investment
brief.
'It's the telecom company . . . people have always viewed telecoms (shares)
as core holdings, such as Telmex or Singapore Telecom: if you're going to
hold something in this market, this is the one you hold because it's the
most visible stock which is going to reflect the growth in the economy,'
says one international equity specialist.
The Indian government's economic reforms have sparked considerable interest
among international investors in the market. While some of the international
equity offerings got off to a shaky start, recent launches have generally
been well received and have risen well above launch price.
Gujarat Ambuja Cement, the Indian cement company, issued a Dollars 75m
convertible bond issue at par at the end of November, which is now trading
at 130 according to Jardine Fleming, the lead manager.
Jardine Fleming said the Indian rally was being driven by liquidity from US
and UK investors who could put as much as Dollars 200m-Dollars 400m into a
range of Indian equities. 'These funds are still massively underweight in
India and want to raise their exposure,' the lead manager said.
Mr Roger Bade, emerging markets fund manager at Commercial Union, said:
'India is one of the more exciting emerging market stories. The political
risk has diminished since local elections.'

FT  15 DEC 93 / International Bonds: US investors indulge in Argentine
tastes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A seemingly insatiable appetite among US investors for Argentine bonds
ensured a successful debut yesterday for Transportadora de Gas del Sur
(TGS), Argentina's largest transporter of natural gas.
Lead manager Lehman Brothers said that TGS's Dollars 200m offering of
five-year Eurobonds was two times oversubscribed and that 60 per cent of the
bonds were sold into the US. The remaining 40 per cent was placed in Europe
and Asia.
Last week, strong demand from US investors, confident that the Republic of
Argentina would achieve an investment-grade rating before too long, enabled
the sovereign borrower to increase the size of its first offering of global
bonds to Dollars 1bn from Dollars 750m.
The strength of the demand also permitted Argentina to further tighten the
yield spread which it pays over government bonds, thereby establishing a new
benchmark for other Argentine borrowers raising funds internationally.
TGS's bonds were priced to yield 270 basis points over US treasuries which,
according to Lehman Brothers, represented a spread of 20 basis points over
the five-year area of the new yield curve for Argentine sovereign debt in
the international bond market.
When the bonds were freed to trade, they rose to par bid from a launch price
of 99.70. They later settled at 99 7/8 , giving a spread of 266 basis
points.
Syndicate managers expect a few more offerings from Latin American borrowers
to emerge before the Eurobond market closes down for Christmas.
Petrobras, the Brazilian state-owned oil company, is expected to launch its
first Eurobond offering denominated in yen later this week. The three-year
deal, via Nomura, is expected to set a new record for a Euroyen issue by a
Latin American borrower.
The largest deal to date is a Y20bn (Dollars 183m) three-year offering by
Telebras, Brazil's state-owned telecommunications holding company, which was
launched in late October.
At the launch, Telebras's bonds were priced to yield 445 basis points over
the No 91 Japanese government bond but the spread has since tightened to 421
basis points. Syndicate managers said the current spread on Telebras's bonds
would be taken into account during the pricing of Petrobras's bonds.
Elsewhere, investors continued to digest the terms of Fisons' offer to
exchange its recent Pounds 100m offering of 10-year Eurobonds for a new
offering of five-year Eurobonds in the wake of the company's restructuring
plans. The amount of Fisons' public debt outstanding would not change as a
result of the offer.

<TEXT>
National Mutual Life Association, the Australian financial services group,
has announced a return to the black for the latest year following a
turnround of more than ADollars 250m (USDollars 168m).
The group reported a net profit of ADollars 227m for the year to September
against a restated loss of ADollars 30.3m in the previous year. Mr David
Tomlinson, managing director, said the group's statutory reserves rose from
ADollars 1.08bn to ADollars 1.33bn in the year.
Mr Tomlinson said the improved results reflected tighter expense controls,
prudent underwriting and good investment results. He said the company's
listing of its Hong Kong insurance business had also contributed gains while
reorganisation of Australian and New Zealand insurance operations had
reduced expenses by more than ADollars 60m.

Volvo shareholders, whose revolt triggered the collapse of the Swedish

The meeting will be the first step in reshaping Volvo after Mr Pehr
Gyllenhammar, the former chairman, and four fellow board members resigned
earlier this month after bowing to shareholder and senior management
pressure to call off the controversial agreement with Renault.
Swedish institutional shareholders have signalled their intention to take a

FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Paramount opens sale contest to
highest bidder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Paramount Communications has formally opened an auction of the
film and publishing company to the highest bidder, signalling an end to
efforts over the past three months to conclude a friendly takeover by
Viacom.
However, the Paramount directors left the job of weighing up rival bids in
the hands of the full board, rather than setting up a committee of
non-executives to review offers.
The Delaware supreme court ruled on Friday that Paramount's board, led by Mr
Martin Davis, had been wrong to reject a rival offer from QVC Network
without considering it.
This forced Paramount to open the bidding, and led to suggestions that the
job of assessing bids should be taken out of Mr Davis' hands and given to a
committee of non-executive directors.
'The board saw no reason to set up a (separate) committee,' Paramount said.
Nor had the court ruling led to any changes in Paramount's financial
advisers, led by Lazards, it added.
Paramount said it would conduct a single round of bidding, with all offers
to be submitted by December 20. It said it would favour bids comprising cash
or fixed-income securities.
If shares are offered, the board said it would prefer bidders to provide a
floor under the price so the securities did not fall in value in future. It
was also looking for guarantees that former Paramount shareholders would not
be 'squeezed out' of the new combined company after the deal was completed.
The Viacom and QVC offers comprise a mixture of cash and shares at present.
Neither company would become heavily indebted under the terms of their
current offers, suggesting there may be scope for them to increase the cash
component or raise the overall value.
Paramount said it would select the bidder which provided 'the greatest value
to shareholders'. However, it said the shareholder rights' plan overturned
by the Delaware court would be waived for all bidders, leaving shareholders
free to pick which offer they preferred.
Paramount's after-tax profits in the three months to the end of October fell
to Dollars 96.8m from Dollars 102.4m in the same period of 1992 because of a
rise in its financing costs.
Operating income from publishing rose to Dollars 132.1m from Dollars 124.5m,
while income from entertainment fell to Dollars 45.3m from Dollars 53.9m
after a weak quarter for film releases.
Net interest and investment expenses climbed from Dollars 400,000 to Dollars
8.1m as a result of acquisitions and increases in working capital.

<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurance group, has
secured the government's consent to increase its equity by 5 per cent as
part of the payment for its acquisition of Colonia, the German insurer.
The additional capital will be given to Suez, the French financial and
industrial holding company with which UAP recently concluded months of
negotiations over Colonia's ownership. UAP sees the deal as a prelude to
privatisation.
UAP, which as a public-sector company requires the government's
authorisation for any capital increase, had for years been trying to use its
minority stake in Victoire, the French insurer controlled by Suez, to take
over Colonia.
The two groups eventually reached agreement in October by striking an
intricate deal whereby UAP will relinquish its Victoire shares, pay up to
FFr3bn (Dollars 515m) in cash and cede part of its own equity in return for
Victoire's controlling holding in Colonia.

FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder chief replaced
in shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The chief executive of Goodman Fielder, the Australian food group, has been
replaced in a shake-up of top management aimed at restoring investor
confidence.
Mr John Studdy, chairman. announced last night that the company's chief
executive, Mr Michael Nugent, would be replaced immediately by Mr Barry
Weir, formerly managing director of Goodman Fielder's European operations.
The announcement, which came after the close of Australian share trading,
surprised analysts although it continued an executive exodus from Goodman
which has sapped investor confidence in recent months.
Most recent resignations include the company's baking and milling chief, Mr
John Baird, and poultry and ingredients executive, Mr John Keniry.
Goodman's earnings growth has been sluggish in recent years, in spite of
severe cost-cutting exercises and the sale of a number of non-core assets.
Market perception is that the company has failed to recover sufficiently
from two failed takeover attempts in the late 1980s, a Pounds 1.3bn
(USDollars 1.93bn) tilt at Ranks Hovis McDougall, the UK food group, and a
ADollars 1.8bn (USDollars 1.17bn) move on Industrial Equity, the former
Australian corporate raider.
Despite recent market purchases of Goodman shares by potential acquisitors,
the company's share price has underperformed the Australian market this
year, raising speculation of a possible takeover or break up of the group.
GF shares closed 3 cents higher at ADollars 1.66 on Australian markets
yesterday.
A measure of the swiftness of yesterday's action by the board came with Mr
Studdy's announcement that Mr Weir had already assumed Mr Nugent's
responsibilities.
Other management changes include the appointment of Mr Cees Spoon as
chairman of the company's European operations and Mr Ken Green as operations
director for Europe.
Mr Weir said last night he believed GF could meet 'significantly improved
performance targets in the near term'. He said some of the company's
businesses exhibited brand bias and others commodity bias and they should be
managed accordingly.
'An early priority will be to develop a strong succession plan, with
particular emphasis at the most senior management levels,' he said. 'The
European group, which now accounts for 25 per cent of GF's turnover, is
becoming a very strong performer for the group, with continuing integration
benefits from the acquisition of Wessanen expected through 1995.'

FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Canadian province may float
utility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEWFOUNDLAND is seeking a new buyer for its Newfoundland Hydro utility after
Fortis, a private holding company, broke off negotiations. Alternatively it
may try to float Newfoundland Hydro through a public issue.
The talks between the province and Fortis had been under way since October
1, when Premier Mr Clyde Wells said the sale of the power generation utility
would reduce the province's heavy public debt.
Fortis, based in St John's, already owns Newfoundland Light &amp; Power, the
distributor for the electricity produced by Newfoundland Hydro. Fortis
wanted to merge both into a company with assets of nearly CDollars 2bn
(USDollars 1.5bn), nearly 2,000MW of generating capacity and annual revenues
of about CDollars 700m.
Fortis would not say why negotiations ended, but Mr Wells indicated the
company wanted more control over the merged company than the province was
willing to surrender.
Although faced with charges that privatisation of Newfoundland Hydro would
lead to higher power rates and job losses, Mr Wells said he would consider a
public flotation.
Ontario Hydro confirmed its 1993 loss would be significantly higher than the
CDollars 1.6bn estimate made a month ago, due to restructuring charges and
write-downs.
But the utility reported it would supply USDollars 270m of heavy water to
Korean Electric Power. South Korea has two Canadian-designed nuclear
reactors that use heavy water as a moderator.
Teck, the mining and metals group that controls Cominco, is raising almost
CDollars 105m for new copper investments with an issue of 4.5m shares at
CDollars 23.25 each in Canada and Europe.
It will use the money to meet its share of the USDollars 360m Quebrada
Blanca copper project in Chile and its share of the USDollars 300m
Louvicourt copper-zinc project in Quebec.

FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic to sell TriCon for

<TEXT>
Bell Atlantic, the US regional telephone group, plans to spin off its TriCon
Capital financial services subsidiary in a stock market flotation that could
raise as much as Dollars 350m.
The move is part a new strategy by Bell Atlantic to withdraw from financial
services and concentrate on its core telecommunications business, which
includes the cable television interests recently acquired in a Dollars 22bn
takeover of Tele-Communications Inc.
Two months ago Bell Atlantic said it wanted to sell off its financial
services divisions. Mr William Albertini, chief financial officer, then said
the group would focus its financial resources on its core operations, adding
that favourable conditions in the public and private markets meant the time
was right to sell its financial services businesses.
TriCon Capital, based in New Jersey, provides commercial finance and
equipment leasing services, and is an arm of Bell Atlantic Investments. Bell
Atlantic's other financial services businesses include diversified leasing,
computer leasing and real estate companies.
A total of 13.5m shares in TriCon will be sold in the initial public
offering, which will be underwritten by the Wall Street investment banks
Lehman Brothers and Salomon Brothers; 10.8m will be sold in the US, and the
remainder internationally.

Grupo Televisa, the Mexican media group, began trading on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday after placing Dollars 989m of stock in a secondary equity
offering.
GMD, Mexico's third largest construction company, also started trading on
the NYSE yesterday, after completing an initial public offering for Dollars
283m. It becomes the third Mexican construction company to be listed on the
NYSE after an IPO, following ICA and Tribasa.
The GMD offering was split 50 per cent in the US, 25 per cent in Mexico and
25 per cent the rest of the world. It was managed by Bear Stearns in the US.
Televisa's offering completes a complex stock restructuring that began when
Ms Laura Azcarraga sold a portion of her stake in the company earlier this
year to Mr Emilio Azcarraga, her brother and company chairman.
She also gave him the option to buy the remaining part of her stake between
1994 and 1996, and full voting rights over the shares in the meantime.
Mr Azcarraga sold some of his privately held Televisa stock in the public
markets partly to finance the purchase of his sister's stake.
Other leading shareholders in Televisa also sold some of their stock to
bring the total amount on offer to one tenth of the company's capital.

FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Cragnotti faces accusations over
Canadian deals
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Ontario Securities Commission has accused Mr Sergio Cragnotti, the
prominent Italian financier, of securities law violations involving Lawson
Mardon, the international packaging group controlled by Mr Cragnotti's
investment company.
The OSC said yesterday it expected Mr Cragnotti and one of his business
associates, Mr Roberto Marziale, to submit a settlement proposal at a
hearing in Toronto tomorrow.
Lawyers and OSC officials declined to disclose the terms of the proposed
settlement. But similar cases have involved payments totalling several
million dollars and a suspension of trading privileges.
Mr Cragnotti was arrested in Italy last month on suspicion of involvement in
the Enimont bribes scandal. He has subsequently been released.
His company, Cragnotti and Partners, recently agreed to tender its 52 per
cent voting stake in Lawson Mardon to Alusuisse-Lonza Holding, the Swiss
industrial group.
Alusuisse is in the midst of a due diligence examination before deciding
whether to proceed with a CDollars 555m (USDollars 417) offer for all Lawson
shares. Although Lawson's head office is on the outskirts of Toronto, about
four-fifths of its revenues come from Europe, mainly the UK.
An Alusuisse representative in Toronto said yesterday the allegations
against Mr Cragnotti will not affect the proposed offer. He said the Swiss
company has known 'for some time' about the OSC's investigation.
The commission alleged that Mr Cragnotti and Mr Marziale 'knowingly
participated' in the trading of Lawson shares through nominee accounts
during 1992 and 1993 'so as to create a false and misleading appearance of
trading activity and an artificial price'.
The commission also accused the two men of insider trading ahead of an
equity offering by Lawson in October 1992. It alleged they made
'misrepresentations' to the commission during the initial stages of its
investigation.

FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: DeBartolo calls off Dollars 690m
investment trust issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A planned Dollars 690m flotation that would have created one of the US's
biggest property investment vehicles was called off yesterday, the latest
sign that the market for such issues has become saturated.
The transaction was to raise cash for the heavily-indebted property empire
of Edward DeBartolo, one of the most prominent developers of shopping malls
during the 1980s.
In a statement, the DeBartolo Corporation said the deal had been delayed
'due to the current market conditions for publicly traded real estate
investment trusts'.
The decision comes at the end of a year in which cash-strapped private
developers have rushed to take advantage of renewed interest in public
property vehicles. More than Dollars 10bn has been raised so far this year
by real estate investment trusts, or reits, according to Mr David Kostin, an
analyst at Salomon Brothers.
Despite the congestion in the market, Merrill Lynch completed the
largest-ever reit offering yesterday, raising Dollars 839m for another mall
developer, Simon Property.
The Simon shares were priced at Dollars 22 1/4 , compared with an indicated
maximum price of Dollars 25 a share when the sale was first disclosed in
September.
At the issue price, the shares yield 8.54 per cent, compared with an
indicated yield when the issue was first announced of 7.25 to 8 per cent.
The increased yield needed to attract investors was due partly to the
congestion in the new issue market and partly to the rise in Treasury bond
yields since October, said Mr Thomas Davis, managing director of equity
capital markets at Merrill Lynch.
Shares in DeBartolo Realty were said by other market participants to have
been offered at a yield of 9 to 9.25 per cent, compared with the 7.7 to 8.2
per cent range it first indicated.
DeBartolo refused to confirm the figure, but said it had decided not to
proceed with the issue at what it called 'a heavily discounted price'.
The abandonment of the issue is expected to intensify talks between
DeBartolo and its bankers over a refinancing of the group's debts. The
company said it 'will monitor all . . . alternatives, including accessing
the public markets in the future'. The restructuring of its bank debt last
year extended the maturity of a large part of the company's debts to five
years or more, reducing the need for it to raise equity capital immediately.
Cash began pouring into the public property sector in the first four months
of this year as retail investors and mutual funds searched for higher yields
than those available in the equity and fixed income markets.
This pushed up reit share prices, contributing to a total return for the
sector in the first 11 months of the year of 18.7 per cent, said Mr Kostin.
The congestion caused by the rush of new reit issues has coincided with a
deluge of other new equity transactions in the past fortnight.
'We've got extraordinarily heavy supply, particularly given that it's the
middle of December,' said Mr Davis. The congested equity calendar is likely
to run into January and early February.
Around eight small reit transactions are believed to have been called off in
the past two weeks.

FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Austrian Airlines to resume
talks on alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Austrian Airlines (AUA) is to resume talks on long-term co-operation with
Swissair and Lufthansa following the collapse last month of the Alcazar
project. Alcazar was aimed at the merger of Austrian and Swiss carriers with
Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
The supervisory board of the Austrian carrier decided at a meeting on Sunday
to give a new impetus to negotiations with both the Swiss and German
airlines. It also wants to hold separate discussions with Lauda Air, the
private airline run by Mr Nicky Lauda, the former Formula One racing car
driver, in which Lufthansa has a 25 per cent stake.
'The failure of Alcazar has created a new situation and we don't exclude
anything,' AUA said yesterday. This could include a tie-up with Lauda Air,
though that would not solve AUA's main strategic concern, which is to find
an international partner.
The Austrian carrier held parallel talks with Lufthansa during the Alcazar
negotiations, and the German airline recently reaffirmed its interest in
co-operation with AUA. Such co-operation, however, would have to take into
account AUA's existing technical and commercial agreements with Swissair,
AUA said.
Earlier this month, Swissair said it was considering the possibility of a
smaller alliance with SAS and AUA as an alternative to the Alcazar alliance,
which collapsed after months of negotiations over differences on the choice
of a US partner.
The Austrian carrier has also been approached by Mr Lauda, who is reported
to be offering AUA a 30-40 per cent stake in Lauda Air.
The Austrian carrier expects operating losses to rise sharply this year, to
Sch700m (Dollars 58.5m), compared with a deficit of Sch437m in 1992. The net
loss is expected to be Sch460m after allocations from reserves.

FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Solid final quarter checks
Degussa fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A clear improvement in the final quarter helped Degussa, the metals and
chemicals group, to restrict the fall in earnings to just 14 per cent in the
year to the end of September.
The company, which reported pre-tax profits down 26 per cent after nine
months, said yesterday in an interim report income would rise in the current
year, even though there were still no signs of an overall improvement.
Earnings for the period under review totalled DM172m (Dollars 101.2m), on
sales up 16 per cent at DM15bn. The sales rise reflected a sharp increase in
precious metals trading and new consolidations. Excluding these factors,
turnover was unchanged.
The group attributed the new year's expected recovery to the effects of
restructuring measures, and was cautiously optimistic that the two-year
slump in the chemicals business was coming to an end.
In line with expectations, the 1992-93 dividend would be unchanged at DM7.
Mr Gert Becker, chairman, said last March the payout would not be increased
before the 1994-95 financial year.
Cost-cutting and the economic recovery in North America generated improved
earnings in the chemicals sector, which contributed 46 per cent to group
sales. The banking business also lifted profits.
However, losses in base metals deepened in spite of a 4 per cent rise in
sales. Precious metals trading, which boosted turnover 53 per cent, made a
smaller contribution to earnings than last year.
Turnover in pharmaceuticals rose 17 per cent, to DM2bn, on the strength of
first-time consolidations, but was unchanged after adjustment. Income was
'substantially below the very high previous year's figure'.
The effects of rationalisation showed up most clearly in the German parent
company, Degussa AG, where pre-tax earnings tumbled 65 per cent to DM32m on
sales up 4 per cent at DM6.9bn.
While the group workforce was reduced by 4 per cent and payroll costs
remained unchanged on the year, numbers employed at the parent were cut 14
per cent, and wage costs fell 12 per cent.
Overall capital expenditure was cut 18 per cent to DM498m, with spending at
the parent reduced 35 per cent.

FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Canal-Plus faces reduced profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canal-Plus, the French media group, yesterday warned it may face a sharp
reduction in net profits for 1994 because of an increase in investments in
its operations.
The company - in the 1980s one of the stars of the European media sector
after the success of its original French pay-TV station - said it was on
course to meet its profit forecast of around FFr1.2bn (Dollars 207m) for
1993. However, it expected a fall in net profits of up to 20 per cent next
year.
Canal-Plus last year faced its first setback by reporting static net profits
of FFr1.1bn on sales of FFr7.94bn. It recovered momentum during the first
half of this year, with a 33 per cent increase in interim net profits to
FFr676m from FFr507m.
However, the group faces a steep increase in investment during 1994. It is
concerned it may be forced by the government to invest in France's
struggling cable-television network as part of the terms of renewing its
French pay-TV licence.
Canal-Plus also expects increased investment in its pay-TV interests and its
thematic channels outside France.
Finally, it plans to protect its long-term position by adding to its library
of programming rights and by increasing its own production activities.
Canal-Plus strenuously denied recent speculation in the UK that it might
join a 'white knight' consortium to rescue LWT, the London television
company, now the target of a hostile bid by Granada.

FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Deutsche ABB unveils top-level
shake-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche ABB, the German arm of the world's leading power engineering group,
yesterday announced a top-level organisational shake-out designed to improve
efficiency.
The changes, which follow similar moves at the Zurich-based parent, unveiled
in August, include early retirement for Mr Manfred Simon, the director
responsible for the core power generation division.
His job will be taken by Mr Hubert Lienhard, 42, currently a member of the
three-man board of ABB Kraftwerke in Mannheim.
Mr Tom Sjokvist, 46, responsible for power distribution, is to move to group
headquarters in Zurich, where he will take charge of global operations in
electrical and mechanical installation and low-voltage apparatus and
systems.
Electricity distribution will be bundled together with the transmission
business and run as one division by Mr Sune Karlsson, in charge of
transmission alone.
Construction and installation technology are also to be combined under the
control of the current construction chief, Mr Georg Demling.
The industrial technology and automation sector will include robotics and
electric motors, and come under the control of Mr Michael Pohr, 51, who
takes charge as chairman of Deutsche ABB in May.
The current chairman, Mr Eberhard von Koerber, was named as group European
director in last summer's reorganisation of the main board. In that
reshuffle, the number of main board directors was reduced from 12 to eight,
and the six operating divisions were cut to four.
The organisational changes in Germany mirror those at group level, which
were introduced to help improve ABB's ability to compete for large-scale
integrated projects. According to Mr Percy Barnevik, group chief executive,
ABB needed a less 'parochial' management structure to better bring together
all its resources.
Deutsche ABB accounts for around 20 per cent of the group's DM50bn (Dollars
29.4bn) annual turnover.

FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: BNP chairman warns of big
first-half provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman of Banque Nationale de Paris, the
recently-privatised French banking group, yesterday warned the company may
need to make heavy provisions in the first half of next year.
BNP, like other French banks, has already been forced to make steep
write-downs for 1993 because of the sluggish domestic economy. Mr Pebereau,
speaking at a shareholders' meeting in Paris, said BNP was still under
pressure. He forecast another round of high provisions for 1994, mainly due
to the problems of its small corporate clients.
'The first half of 1994 will be another period of heavy provisions for small
and medium-sized firms,' he warned. Mr Pebereau said it was too soon to
estimate the level of provisions for the second half of next year. It was
unlikely to be good news, he said.
Mr Pebereau secured shareholders' consent at the meeting for the BNP board
to take action against hostile takeovers. The board will be empowered to
issue shares with or without voting rights, enabling it to stave off
predators. The chairman said BNP 'wouldn't hesitate to use' its poison pill
if necessary.
BNP, which was privatised in October in a highly successful issue, had
previously predicted a poor performance for 1993, with net profits of around
FFr1bn (Dollars 172m), against FFr2.17bn in 1992. It has already reported a
sharp slide in interim net profits to FFr522m in the first half from
FFr1.33bn in the same period last year.
Although the main problem facing BNP has been the financial strains on small
French companies, it has also been affected by the precarious state of the
property market, and by the need to raise provisions on its loans to
developing countries.
Mr Stephane Arrouays, banking analyst at BZW Securities, said he expected
further problems from all three areas in 1994. He expected net profits of
FFr2.2bn for the group in 1994, although he might slightly downgrade his
forecast following Mr Pebereau's remarks.
However, Mr Pebereau yesterday sought to quash concern about the fate of
BNP's loans to Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group now trying to
restructure its finances to avoid bankruptcy.
BNP is one of the largest banks in the Euro Disney syndicates and, together
with Banque Indosuez, heads the steering committee representing the banks in
the restructuring talks. Mr Pebereau said he was 'convinced' that Walt
Disney, its US parent company, had 'the capacity to find a solution'.

<TEXT>
AEA Investors, a secretive investment company run by senior figures from the
US corporate world, is to pay Dollars 565m to acquire two up-market cruise
liner companies from Vard, the loss-hit Norwegian group.
Vard said its Miami-based subsidiary Kloster Cruise had signed a letter of
intent with AEA for the sale of Royal Viking Line and Royal Cruise Line,
which respectively operate two and three ships mainly on Caribbean cruises
for American holiday-makers.
The Norwegian group, which also operates two ferry lines in Europe, said the
move would enable Kloster to concentrate on strengthening its position in
the mass cruise market, through its remaining Norwegian Cruise Line
operation, in a bid to restore profitability.
AEA Investors is a privately-held New York venture capital and leveraged
buy-out investment group whose shareholders consist mostly of wealthy former
chief executives and chairmen of blue-chip US corporations.
Mr Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, is also reported to be a
member of the group.
Since the early 1970s, when AEA was formed as a private investment vehicle
for some of the wealthiest families in the US (including the Rockefellers,
Mellons and du Ponts), the group has been acquiring small and medium-sized
companies, mostly through leveraged buy-outs. It then ran them for a while
before selling or floating them on the stock markets, often for a large
profit.
AEA's most recent deal was the Dollars 315m acquisition in September of the
California-based Sola eyeglass lens business from UK group Pilkington.
Losses have mounted recently at Vard, hitting NKr149m (Dollars 20.1m) in the
first nine months of this year, compared with a loss of NKr3.23m in the same
period last year. Part of its problem has been exposure to the four- and
five-star segments of the cruise market, which have been the least
profitable parts of the cruise industry in recent years.
It intends to build on its present 12-15 per cent market share in the more
profitable three-star market by acquiring at least two new or used ships to
add to Norwegian Cruise Line's fleet of seven.
However, analysts said Kloster would continue to face stiff competition from
its bigger, better-capitalised rivals such as Carnival of the US, Royal
Caribbean, a US-Norwegian operator, and Princess Cruises, a unit of P&amp;O of
the UK.
The deal with AEA involves AEA assuming Dollars 60m in advanced ticket
sales, and a new ship commissioned by Royal Cruise due to come into service
in early 1994. It will replace an older ship, which is not included in the
sale. The restructuring of Kloster had been widely discounted in Oslo,
pushing up Vard's share price by some 50 per cent over the past two weeks.
It closed yesterday up NKr2 at NKr60.

<TEXT>
ING Bank of the Netherlands has agreed to take a 25.9 per cent share in the
Bank Slaski, one of the nine Polish state-owned banks being privatised.
The agreement represents the first significant investment by a western
commercial bank in an existing Polish banking institution. Earlier this year
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development took a 28.5 per cent
share in the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, the first bank to be privatised
under the government's programme.
The Bank Slaski, based in Katowice in Poland's industrial heartland, has
nearly 60 branches and a balance sheet worth 27,669bn zlotys (Dollars
1.32bn) at the beginning of this year. Its loan portfolio is weighted
towards the chemical, steel and coal mining industries.
The price of the equity is expected to reflect the figure of 500,000 zlotys
per share at which the 30.1 per cent of the bank's 9,260,000 shares were
offered last month to small investors.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Aukett Associates, the building services and architectural group,
were trimmed from Pounds 3.87m to Pounds 2.25m pre-tax for the year to
end-September.
The directors said the company was now 'on the road to recovery' and pointed
out that the deficit took account of a loss in the opening six months of
Pounds 2.06m on the disposal of discontinued operations.
Continuing activities moved back into the black in the second half and
enabled the group to swing from operating losses before non-recurring items
of Pounds 680,000 to profits of Pounds 135,000 for the full year.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 8.53m) of which Pounds 402,000
(Pounds 1.42m) arose from discontinued operations. Losses per share emerged
at 16.82p (20.77p).
However, after stripping out exceptional items, headline losses were 1.71p
(16.23p).

Sheriff Holdings, the Nottingham-based independent plant hire company, saw
annual profits advance strongly as it benefited from both organic growth and
acquisitions.
On turnover ahead from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 12.8m, including Pounds
846,000 from acquisitions, and after interest charges reduced to Pounds
90,000 (Pounds 312,000), pre-tax profits for the 12 months to end-September
amounted to Pounds 1.71m (Pounds 686,000).
Mr Richard Dunn, chairman of the USM-traded company, said the performance
had been aided by strong cash generation which would also enable it to carry
out investment plans in the current year. Gearing at September 30 was 18 per
cent, down from 48 per cent a year earlier.
A recommended final dividend of 2.5p lifts the year's total by 88 per cent
to 3.75p (2p), payable from earnings of 11.5p (6.7p).

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: KPMG Peat Marwick income up less than 1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, yesterday reported fee income in
the UK up by less than 1 per cent to Pounds 492m in the 12 months to
September 30.
In an indication of the effects of the recession, it cut the number of
partners by 9 to 594 during the year, and the number of professional staff
by 382 to 6,301.
Administrative and support staff fell slightly to 2,053, and it has reduced
its offices from 45 to 43.
Mr Colin Sharman, senior partner elect, said: 'I am satisfied that we have
done a good job against a hard economic background.'
Like other accountancy firms, KPMG refuses to disclose any information about
its profits. Mr Sharman said: 'We are happy with our profitability. We are
not suffering badly and we are not coining it.'
KPMG reported income from corporate recovery and insolvency work down 4 per
cent to Pounds 53.5m. Mr Sharman said that reflected a decline in the number
of insolvencies, and a number of large appointments the firm could not take
on for fear of triggering potential conflicts of interest.
Corporate finance income rose by nearly 21 per cent to Pounds 64.6m,
reflecting flotations and government privatisation and reorganisation work.
Income from tax advisory work rose by 2 per cent to Pounds 103.9m, including
boosts from fees for Inland Revenue investigations, value added tax advice
and tax work related to corporate finance.
Management consulting income fell by more than 7 per cent to Pounds 72.1m,
and revenues from audit and accounting work were down more than 1 per cent
to Pounds 197.7m.
Mr Sharman said that since the year-end, the prospects for the firm's
billings were still 'spotty', with continued pressure on audit income but
some further signs of recovery in corporate finance work.

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Boost from Glasgow as David Lloyd hits
Pounds 5.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scots like to eat and drink more after exercise than the English,
according to David Lloyd Leisure, the tennis court and health club group.
It made the disclosure yesterday when announcing results for the year to
September 30 showing that food and beverage sales were almost 20 per cent of
turnover. It added that the figures were ahead of forecasts made at its
flotation in March this year.
On September 1 the company opened a club in Renfrew, Glasgow, its first new
build outside its greater London base. To date membership is ahead of
expectations and matches those experienced at its London clubs at the same
stage of their development.
However, Mr David Lloyd, chairman, said: 'Customers at our new Glasgow
centre spend about Pounds 3 a head on food and beverages compared with an
average of Pounds 1.60 in Raynes Park, London.'
The opening is important as it is seen as the first of many throughout the
country.
Group pre-tax profits for the period rose to Pounds 5.67m (Pounds 3.08m),
against a forecast of Pounds 5.5m. Earnings per share were 10.85p (7.9p) and
as promised at flotation the board is proposing a single final dividend of
1.95p.
Advisers said food and beverages had grown as a proportion of turnover over
the 11 years of the company's history in line with the increasing
sophistication of club facilities.
He added that unlike many competitors the company did not contract out
catering because it could achieve pre-tax profit margins of between 18 and
20 per cent and wanted to protect the standard of staff.
'We are not selling ourselves as a yield stock. People buy us because they
see the growth prospects,' said Mr David Gray, finance director.
In the present year membership was ahead of the comparative period, as were
renewals. The company said 40 per cent of turnover was secure because about
80 per cent of customers would renew membership by continuing to pay monthly
subscriptions of more than Pounds 40 while new members paid a Pounds 250
one-off joining fee.
Turnover was ahead at Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 15.6m), including Pounds 3.5m
(Pounds 3.09m) from catering, with a full year contribution from three
centres added during the comparative period. Operating profit was Pounds
6.37m (Pounds 4.56m). Net interest charges were halved at Pounds 695,000
(Pounds 1.48m) resulting from the Pounds 13.3m raised by the float. Gearing
at the year-end stood at 12 per cent (80 per cent).

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Manakin proposes further distribution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Manakin Holdings, the investment trust which went into voluntary liquidation
in 1991, had a net asset value of 82p per share at October 15, against 68p
six months earlier and 100p at the previous year-end.
Since the appointment of liquidators in October 1991 five distributions to
shareholders totalling Pounds 70.1m (342p per share) have been made. A
further repayment of 8p will be made on January 21.
The net loss for the year was Pounds 435,445, against a profit of Pounds
22,067. Losses per share were 2.1p (earnings 0.1p).
The liquidator said that it was likely that losses would continue to occur
as it was not his intention to invest funds for income purposes, but to
distribute funds to shareholders as soon as possible.
He expected the liquidation to take another two years to complete.

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Protean expands through two acquisitions
for Pounds 9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Protean, the laboratory equipment and water purification specialist, is
continuing its expansion programme with the Pounds 9m acquisition of two
complementary companies, Techne and LIP.
Techne is a US-registered company but its controlled temperature equipment
activities are carried out in the UK by a subsidiary at Duxford,
Cambridgeshire. LIP, based in Yorkshire, makes medical and laboratory sample
plastic bottles.
The purchases are to be financed by raising some Pounds 9m cash through a
placing and offer to shareholders of up to 5.55m new shares at 180p on the
basis of one new ordinary for every 4.73 ordinary held. The shares closed 7p
higher at 199p.
Techne, which is to be purchased for Pounds 5.43m, made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 825,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.9m in the year to March 31.
LIP made a profit of Pounds 695,000, before tax and directors' remuneration,
on turnover of Pounds 4.4m for the year to end-September. The purchase price
is an initial Pounds 2.9m, plus further consideration linked to future
profits up to a maximum of 684,020 ordinary shares - equal to a maximum of
Pounds 1.3m.
Protean announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.73m (Pounds 1.38m) for the six
months to September 30, on turnover ahead at Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 15.3m).
Earnings per share rose by 13 per cent, from 3.74p to 4.21p, and there is an
increased interim dividend of 1.05p (0.9p).
The company bought Epsom Glass Industries and DA Baldwin, the water
treatment company, at the end of 1992, when it also announced that it was
seeking further acquisitions.
The latest purchases 'underline our strategy of complementing the continued
organic growth of our existing successful businesses with further additions
in closely related fields,' said Mr Peter Ryan, chairman.
He said they would serve to broaden the product ranges in the key areas of
laboratory equipment and consumables and also overseas.

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Southern Electric pay-out surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Southern Electric is lifting its interim distribution to shareholders by
19.7 per cent.
The Maidenhead-based utility, which serves central southern England, also
indicated yesterday that the full year increase would be in the 12 per cent
to 14 per cent range, in line with analysts' forecasts.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 were Pounds 89.2m. Last
year's outcome for the same period was Pounds 15.3m, but since then,
Southern has altered its accounting to reflect changes in the timing of
payments under the electricity industry's new contracts with British Coal.
On a comparable basis, last year's result would have been Pounds 77m,
suggesting a profit increase of some 16 per cent.
Turnover for the six months amounted to Pounds 764.9m, against Pounds
760.6m.
Mr Henry Casley, chief executive, pointed to three reasons behind the
profits rise:
Subsidiaries and associated companies had performed better, more than
doubling their contribution. The contracting business transformed a Pounds
600,000 loss into a Pounds 1.7m profit. The retailing side reduced its share
of the losses of a joint venture with Eastern and Midlands Elec-tricity from
Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 600,000.
Interest charges were lower thanks to the repayment of Pounds 184m of
government debt. Gearing has fallen from 17 per cent to 0.3 per cent.
Costs are still coming down. Controllable costs fell by 3.5 per cent during
the period. Manning levels in the electricity business are expected to fall
from 5,276 at the beginning of this year to about 4,000 by 1995-96.
The interim dividend is 6.7p, against 5.6p, payable from earnings of 24.8p
per share. Mr John Deane, finance director, said Southern was not aiming to
rebalance its dividend split like some other regional electricity companies.
COMMENT
Although Southern did not match the highest dividend increases produced by
the recs this season, the market liked the result and pushed the shares up
7p to 679p. At this level they show a prospective yield of just under 4 per
cent, using Mr Deane's indications, putting the group at the low end of the
sector. Southern's drive against costs is yielding results, and the low
level of gearing is underpinning progress on the financial side. With
indications that housebuilding in its region is picking up, the potential
looks good, particularly if progress can be maintained in the contracting
and retail businesses.

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Birse to bolster balance sheet via Pounds
24m placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birse Group, the building and civil engineering company moved yesterday to
strengthen its balance sheet through a share placing to raise Pounds 24m.
The move was supported by Midland, its banker, which will take a minimum
stake of 15.1 per cent in the company. This could rise as high as 26.2 per
cent depending upon how much of the 125m share placing is taken up by
existing shareholders.
Under clawback arrangements shareholders will be offered 1.89 new shares at
20p each for every share held.
The shares rose 4p to 27 1/2 p.
Bilfinger &amp; Berger, the German construction group, is subscribing for Pounds
1.8m of new shares. Even so, its stake will fall from 14.45 per cent to 9.7
per cent. Family interests of Mr Peter Birse, chairman, are subscribing for
Pounds 2m shares, reducing the family stake to 21.3 per cent (46.4 per
cent).
The restructuring was supported by investment institutions which previously
had no holdings in the company. These will now be left with a stake of
between 16.9 and 29.3 per cent depending on the extent of the clawback.
It is the second time this year Birse has reorganised its finances with the
aid of Midland. In February it announced it had rescheduled its borrowings
'on a committed three year basis to May 1996'.
Its borrowing position has deteriorated since then. At end-November net debt
stood at Pounds 46.5m, compared with shareholders' funds of just Pounds
12.4m. After the placing the company will have net borrowings of Pounds
22.5m with shareholders' funds increased to Pounds 36.4m.
Mr Birse said borrowings, which were Pounds 27.2m at the April 30 year-end,
traditionally peaked at this time of year.
Nonetheless, the pressure on the balance sheet had made it difficult for
Birse to persuade customers it had the necessary financial strength to
undertake large projects and break into new markets.
'The equity injection should alleviate this problems. With increased
opportunities to tender for work we should be able to turn down some of the
lower margin jobs we have been required to take,' Mr Birse said.
COMMENT
Yesterday's share placing, together with the debt rescheduling announced in
February, should end speculation about Birse's future. The seriousness of
its situation is emphasised by the decision of Midland to take a stake in
the company. Birse, to have continued as it was, ran the risk of withering
away as customer confidence evaporated. It can take comfort from the fact
that institutions which previously did not hold the stock now feel
sufficiently confident to take a stake in its future. UK contracting
margins, however, are likely to remain meagre and new and old shareholders
may still have to wait some time to see a return on their investment.

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Exports behind 24% advance at Halma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong export performance helped Halma, the safety and environmental
technology group, increase pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 10.1m in
the six months to October 2.
Turnover rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 61.9m. Direct exports increased by 34
per cent to Pounds 18m and overseas sales by 37 per cent to Pounds 33.7m.
Mr David Barber, chairman, said overseas sales now comprised 54 per cent of
group sales, the highest proportion ever.
The chairman said he was delighted with the results, which had been achieved
even though the group's markets in the UK and in the EU remained relatively
depressed throughout the period.
Despite this, many of the companies had produced very satisfactory results
with outstanding performances recorded by Apollo Fire Detectors and by
Memco, which makes electronic sensors for elevator doors. The American
division also reported excellent results.
Mr Barber said: 'The group can look forward to continuing growth and the
second half should provide further evidence of this.'
Earnings per share rose 21 per cent to 3.43p (2.83p) and the interim
dividend is lifted to 0.933p (0.777p).

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Southern Water rises to Pounds 64.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Southern Water yesterday reported a 7.5 per cent rise in interim pre-tax
profits to Pounds 64.5m and at the same time attacked the water industry
regulator over its approach to pricing.
The company warned that it would appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission if it was unhappy with the outcome of next year's review.
'We believe the underlying mechanics on which the methodology is based are
flawed,' said Mr Martyn Webster, managing director. 'There are equally valid
and alternative methods which should be considered.'
These included the approach taken to pricing at British Gas, where the MMC
recommended a rate of return on assets of between 6.5 per cent and 7.5 per
cent. Ofwat has suggested it will seek to reduce this for water companies
from a 7 per cent level to the lower end of the 5 to 6 per cent range.
Southern was particularly unhappy with Ofwat's approach to initial capital
valuations and replacement expenditure.
Mr Webster said Southern would not hesitate to approach the MMC if it was
unhappy with the final settlement. 'We should lose our jobs if we did not go
to the MMC,' he said.
The improvement in profits for the six months to September 30 was achieved
on the back of a 7 per cent sales rise to Pounds 171.9m.
The interim dividend is increased 8.5 per cent to 7.7p - the largest rise so
far declared in this season's water sector results. Earnings were 7 per cent
higher at 36.9p per share.
Southern enjoyed a 12 per cent increase to Pounds 61.9m in trading profits
in its core utility water business.
The company's non-regulated businesses stood out in a sector which has
reported a series of disappointing results from diversification. Profits
rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 4.9m. After interest, the non-regulated
businesses contributed Pounds 5.9m.
Mr Webster also announced the acquisition of an environmental research lab
in Manchester for less than Pounds 1m.
COMMENT
Southern begins to get more attractive just when water companies are falling
out of favour. The group has in its favour a successful non-regulated
business, a better than expected cash position, and a sterling record on
customer service. It is also not afraid to put its head above the parapet on
the forthcoming price review, unlike some of its sector colleagues.
Nevertheless, it cannot avoid the uncertainty in the light of that very
review. Ofwat's recent statements leave much up in the air. Full-year
forecasts were held at Pounds 127m, but 1995 moves ahead on the back of the
diversified businesses. If you are one of the few looking to plunge into the
sector, this may be one of the more attractive.

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: SEET deficit reduced to Pounds 23,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SEET reported a reduced deficit of Pounds 23,000 for the half year to
October 31, on turnover, from continuing operations, of Pounds 2.69m.
In the comparable period the textile company incurred pre-tax losses of
Pounds 249,000 on turnover of Pounds 4.54m, including a contribution of
Pounds 1.69m from Kenneth Mackenzie, the Stornoway-based Harris Tweed
manufacturer sold in October 1992.
The outcome was struck after interest charges reduced to Pounds 17,000
(Pounds 119,000) and an exceptional credit of Pounds 35,000 (debit of Pounds
220,000).
Losses per share were reduced to 1.15p (7.68p).
Mr Jock Mackenzie, chairman, said that borrowings represented some 11 per
cent of net assets at end-October. 'We are confident that during 1994 SEET
will start to expand,' he added.

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BTG makes Pounds 1.13m buy and seeks Pounds
3.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business Technology Group, the office equipment supplier, is making an
acquisition, a disposal and seeking Pounds 3.1m in an underwritten placing
and open offer, writes Nigel Clark.
The proposals mark the first reorganisation moves since three former
Securiguard executives took over the management of BTG in October and
follows a review of the group's activities.
The company is paying up to Pounds 1.13m for Automatic Business
Communications, a London photocopier and facsimile machine supplier. In the
year to September 30 1992 ABC's service revenue was Pounds 1.04m.
The consideration is made up of an initial Pounds 500,000 cash plus 1.25m
shares and a maximum profit-related payment of Pounds 200,000 in cash or
loan notes and Pounds 250,000 for stock.
The company is placing 28.3m shares at 12 3/4 p with an open offer to
existing shareholders on a 4-for-7 basis. The proceeds will be used to fund
the cash part of the purchase, and provide working capital.
Mr Alan Baldwin, chairman, said the review indicated a need for additional
capital.
BTG is also pulling out of the vending equipment market with the disposal of
Ultimate Vending Systems.

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: First Technology doubles to Pounds 1.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recovery in the US helped to increase interim profits at First Technology,
which makes crash dummies and safety sensors for the car industry.
Pre-tax profits more than doubled, from Pounds 807,000 to Pounds 1.76m, in
the six months to October 31, while sales rose by 42 per cent to Pounds
16.1m.
Mr Fred Westlake, executive chairman, said the improvement in trading had
prompted the board to pay an interim dividend of 1p. The group, which
restructured its balance sheet last year after extensive disposals, did not
make an interim payment last time.
The shares, which plunged from 500p in 1990 to 20p within 18 months,
yesterday rose by 14p to 292p.
Mr Westlake said the group's automotive electronics business had experienced
strengthening demand in both its main markets of the US and Europe.
In North America, new car sales were higher, while in Europe the turnover
increase was due more to gaining new customers such as Honda and Fiat.
Mr Westlake said consumer awareness of safety issues was increasing, as
manufacturers advertised features such as the group's fuel cut-off device. A
kit to enable the device to be fitted to existing cars would soon be on sale
throughout Europe.
First Technology said two European motor manufacturers had ordered its
recently launched crash-activated seat belt unit, which uses a sensor to
tighten seat belts on impact.
The US-based automotive safety operation, which makes crash dummies, had a
satisfactory six months with both sales and profits up to expectations.
Mr Westlake said: 'Sales to Japan were marginally lower than for the
comparable period last year, reflecting the economic downturn in Japan.
However, this shortfall was compensated by increased sales to South Korea.
Indeed, South Korea is expected to become an important market as its car
industry increases in importance.'
Earnings per share increased by 75 per cent from 4.2p to 7.36p.

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 425m rights rebuilds Trafalgar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 425m rights issue and placing announced yesterday by Trafalgar
House underpins the new management's efforts to rebuild the group's battered
balance sheet, and demonstrates its determination to fund the expansion of
the core engineering and construction businesses.
Trafalgar's existing shareholders are being asked to provide Pounds 355m in
new capital through a 1-for-3 rights issue of convertible preference shares
at 100p each.
A further Pounds 70m is being sought through a placing of shares on the same
terms to bring more institutional shareholders back on to the register.
The new shares are expected to begin trading on January 10.
They will pay an annual 6p dividend beginning in January 1995 and will be
convertible into ordinary shares at 112 per cent of the average share price
over the next three days beginning today.
Once converted they will represent up to 36.3 per cent of the group's
enlarged capital.
Hongkong Land Holdings, which owns a 25.3 per cent stake in Trafalgar, has
confirmed it will take up its rights in full.
The issue and placing, underwritten by Swiss Bank Corporation and Flemings,
will raise about Pounds 404m. This will help transform Trafalgar's balance
sheet and considerably strengthen its negotiating position with its banks.
Under the terms of its banking covenants, the group, which had net
borrowings of Pounds 395.1m on November 12, including guarantees of
associates's borrowings of Pounds 51.7m, is required to maintain net worth
in excess of Pounds 500m.
Yesterday's write-downs would have caused the company to breach that
condition.
However, the banks have suspended the covenants until the end of February,
subject to the rights issue being completed. Following the rights issue the
group will have pro forma consolidated net assets of Pounds 694.2m
In the meantime Trafalgar's board has negotiated a new Pounds 200m facility
and additional bonding facilities of Pounds 100m from Midland Bank - a
subsidiary of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank; Jardine Group, of which Hongkong
Land is a part, has banked with Hongkong Bank for more than a century.
With the benefit of these facilities and the support of its other lenders,
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Trafalgar and Hongkong Land, said the group
intends to further restructure its borrowing and bonding facilities on more
favourable terms.
'Our negotiating position will be very strong,' he said.
In addition to strengthening the balance sheet and repaying some of the
group's more costly debt, the proceeds of the rights issue will be used 'to
provide a strong equity and liquidity base to support the engineering and
construction businesses'.
These operations were identified in the group's recently completed strategic
review as being 'central to long term profitable development'.
In the year to September 30 the engineering and construction businesses
reported a 'good performance' although operating profits before exceptionals
were down for both divisions.
Operating profits from the engineering division fell to Pounds 67.6m (Pounds
90.3m) on turnover of Pounds 2.36bn (Pounds 2.37bn). The order backlog stood
at Pounds 2.22bn at end-September, ahead Pounds 178m.
The construction division reported operating profits of Pounds 8.3m (Pounds
11.3m) on turnover of Pounds 850m (Pounds 847.9m), and the order backlog was
Pounds 75m ahead at Pounds 1.13bn.
Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive, said no progress was envisaged in the
engineering and construction businesses before 1995 because they benefit
late from any economic recovery.
Property operations bore the brunt of the year-end asset write-downs. They
reported full year losses before exceptionals of Pounds 9.6m, compared to a
Pounds 200,000 operating profit last time. Turnover was flat at Pounds 332m
(Pounds 333.1m).
As a result of the strategic review the group said it intends to remain in
the UK commercial property business, but to continue to change focus from
speculative development to creating income producing assets. Trafalgar also
confirmed its decision to 'disengage' from the US commercial property
market, for which further provisions have been made.
Because of uncertainties over the value of long term developments such as
Paddington Basin and Chiswick Park in London, their value has also been
written down. The group made Pounds 87.2m of provisions to cover the
write-down of wholly owned developments and Pounds 48.9m for its share of
associates's developments.
The group also made a year-end provision of Pounds 22.3m to cover
write-downs in the value of property it occupies itself, together with a
Pounds 14m provision to cover its interests in investment and development
properties and a Pounds 5.4m provision to cover its share of associates'
investment property portfolios.
The value of the group's hotels, which were carried in the balance sheet at
Pounds 124.1m a year ago, has been written down by Pounds 51.5m, of which
Pounds 11.7m was charged to the profit and loss account and Pounds 39.8m to
the revaluation reserves.
The division had, as expected, a better second half, but the year as a whole
was disappointing with operating profits of only Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 27.6m)
on turnover of Pounds 322.7m (Pounds 316.7m.)
Trafalgar said the recent level of passenger bookings for the Cunard fleet
was encouraging. Part of the proceeds of the rights issue will be used to
fund a substantial refurbishment programme.
A provision of Pounds 16m was also made to cover fleet disposals and Pounds
4.6m to cover cargo aircraft.

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: A North Sea hot potato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL

<TEXT>
The Emerald Producer, the floating oil production platform written down by
more than Pounds 42m by Trafalgar House yesterday, has consistently proved a
problem child for its owners.
Most spectacularly it was behind the effective demise of Davy Corporation,
founded in 1830, as the UK's largest independent engineering contractor.
It was originally a drilling rig, owned by Midland &amp; Scottish Resources,
operator of the Emerald oilfield east of Shetland. Midland sold it to Davy
in 1989, at the same time awarding Davy a contract to convert it into a
production platform.
Davy was then to sell the platform back to Midland for a fixed price of
Pounds 118.8m in August 1990. But Davy had difficulties managing the
conversion. Losses on the contract eventually ran almost as high as the
contract price at Pounds 114m.
Trafalgar then took Davy over and agreed in May last year to lease the
platform to Midland for Dollars 65,000 a day. Midland, which is still
operating the platform in the Emerald field, found that production failed to
live up to expectations.
Initial estimates suggested that the field would produce 30,000 barrels a
day for the first two years of its life. It kicked in with a peak of 25,000
b/d in August last year, but this has dwindled to 16,000 b/d.
As a result Midland in August wrote off the entire value of the Emerald
Field development. The provision of Pounds 97m put the company Pounds 113.6m
in the red for 1992 on turnover of Pounds 28.1m.
In September the company defaulted on its charter payments to Trafalgar. Mr
John Hawksley, managing director, said yesterday that the company was in
discussions with Trafalgar to rearrange the charter to fit in better with
the likely production and economic life of the field.
Trafalgar said the Emerald Producer had been carried in the balance sheet at
September 30 at Pounds 66m, a figure supported by independent valuers.
Following the default and reduced life expectation of the field, it is
writing the value down by Pounds 42.1m and making a Pounds 9.5m provision
for costs pending its redeployment or sale.
The results show that turnover from the platform fell from Pounds 16.9m to
Pounds 15.8m for the year to September.

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Vaux up to Pounds 27m but no full recovery
yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Difficult trading conditions in the hotel and brewing industry held pre-tax
profits at Vaux Group to Pounds 26.6m, compared with Pounds 20.4m, in the
year to September 30.
Although the switch to FRS 3 suggested profits had increased by 31 per cent,
the regional brewer, hotels and nursing homes operator said that, excluding
income from property disposals and the sale of its Blayney's off-licence
chain in 1992, profits increased by a more sluggish 7.1 per cent from Pounds
24.8m.
Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of the Sunderland-based company, said operating
profits had improved in all divisions despite the lingering impact of the
recession.
Trading profits rose 8.6 per cent to Pounds 42.9m (Pounds 39.5m) on turnover
5 per cent lower at Pounds 234.9m (Pounds 247.3m).
But he warned: 'A full recovery is not yet in prospect. Profits so far this
year are only marginally ahead of last year's levels.'
Group profits were also depressed by a sharp decline in interest receivable
from Pounds 4.45m to Pounds 384,000.
This was due mainly to the group's decision to withdraw cash from short-term
deposits and increase borrowing from Pounds 122m to Pounds 132m.
Earnings per share showed an adjusted increase of 9.9 per cent from 13.93p
to 15.31p.
A recommended final dividend of 6.25p (6.1p) gives a total for the year of
9.5p, against 9.35p.
Capital expenditure fell by 58 per cent to Pounds 31.5m (Pounds 75.3m) as
the group consolidated its existing property portfolio rather than continue
with rapid expansion of the hotels business.
Vaux and Ward Breweries, accounting for 44 per cent of group turnover,
achieved a 10.2 increase in profits from Pounds 19.5m to Pounds 21.5m.
Vaux Inns - comprising the group's 127 managed houses - saw profits rise 3.4
per cent to Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 4.7m) on turnover of Pounds 37.4m (Pounds
36.6m).
For the first time since embarking on an expansion drive in 1987, Swallow
Hotels reported better than expected results.
Profits rose 10.5 per cent to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 12.5m) on sales of Pounds
79.8m (Pounds 77.9m).
In spite of the improvement, Sir Paul said recent bookings had been
disappointing.
St Andrews Homes, the nursing home operator and smallest part of the group,
saw profits increase from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 4.6m on turnover of Pounds
14m (Pounds 13m).
COMMENT
Inclement conditions in Vaux's trading area have not dented the group's
conviction that it is well placed to profit from a recovery. That confidence
was reflected yesterday by a dividend increase ahead of market expectations.
A lower than forecast tax charge of Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 5.99m) also
surprised analysts. But in the absence of an imminent recovery, profits next
year are not expected to exceed Pounds 30m on a forward multiple of 15.6,
making the shares seem expensive.

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Whessoe slips 11% to Pounds 7.14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After four years of steadily increasing profits, Whessoe, the
instrumentation and control and piping systems group, saw pre-tax profits
slip almost 11 per cent, from Pounds 7.98m to Pounds 7.14m, in the year to
September 30.
Turnover expanded to Pounds 99.7m (Pounds 79.7m).
Mr Chris Fleetwood, chief executive, said the profits decline was mainly the
result of 'severe market trading conditions', and consequent pressure on
margins, in certain of the group's markets.
Specifically he said that there had been a certain lack of activity at
Connex and Aiton, the group's US and UK piping systems businesses
respectively. He suggested that the government's pit closure programme had
adversely affected Aiton by depressing UK demand for power station piping
systems.
Further, he said that Varec, in the liquid instrumentation and control
division, had a 'mixed year' with a second-half downturn in the US.
Mr Fleetwood added that the project engineering division had still not been
sold.
In October Whessoe gained the approval of the Norwegian government for the
Pounds 21.8m acquisition of Autronica, the marine instrumentation and fire
detection company which was part of the group's move away from dependence on
the contract-based business of its pipework activities.
Consequently only two months of Autronica's trading results have been
included: it made profits of Pounds 397,000 on turnover of Pounds 8.61m.
However, Mr Fleetwood said the sharp increase in group net operating
expenses to Pounds 17.8m (Pounds 12.8m) was due to the consolidation of
Autronica.
A pension surplus of Pounds 977,000 was all but offset by a provision
against the discontinuation of Whessoe Projects and interest receivable fell
