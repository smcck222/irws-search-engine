FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Eximbank signs India deal - US takes
aggressive line on export finance

<TEXT>
The US Export-Import Bank yesterday signed a Dollars 60m (Pounds 40.2m)
financing arrangement with India signalling its determination aggressively
to match subsidised export financing by foreign governments in support of
domestic industries.
The beneficiary of the tied aid deal is Raytheon, which will provide air
traffic control equipment to India's National Airports Authority.
Some 45 per cent of the financing will be provided by a grant from a
multi-million dollar 'war chest' established for the purpose. The rest of
the financing, provided by Eximbank, is a loan carrying an interest rate of
6.6 per cent.
The last two Republican administrations were reluctant to employ tied aid,
mingling commercial credit and government grants, and often failed to use
the various 'war chests' provided by Congress. The Clinton administration
has vowed to be more aggressive.
However, it was the Bush administration which first offered the financing in
1991, in an ultimately successful effort to get industrialised countries to
curb the use of tied aid. A year later it 'improved' its offer, boosting the
grant component from 35 to 40 per cent.

<TEXT>
British Steel Track Products, based at Workington in northern England, has
won its biggest ever European order from Norwegian State Railways, which is
buying 25,000 tonnes of rail.
The order is understood to be worth about Pounds 10m, and took two years to
negotiate. It will run to the end of 1995, and could be extended to the end
of the century.
The rails are to be used in NSB's expansion programme. It is upgrading
strategic routes to take trains capable of 120mph. The Workington plant has
changed production to make the 40-metre rails for NSB, four metres longer
than it had be able to make.

<TEXT>
Mickey Mouse may be in trouble in the cultural fortress of France, but Bugs
Bunny isn't bothered - he is planning to hit the ground running in
neighbouring Germany, in the unlikely surroundings of the industrial Ruhr
region.
Warner Brothers, the US entertainment arm of the Time-Warner media empire,
and the Nixdorf family, who made their money from Germany's leading computer
company, yesterday announced plans to open a DM350m (Pounds 138m) 'film
leisure park' and studio complex at Bottrop, once the heart of a thriving
coal mining industry.
Now Bugs Bunny, Batman, and the Gremlins, not to mention the stars of
Germany's biggest international war film spectacular, The Boat, will seek to
bring some good cheer - and jobs  - back to the depressed industrial area.
The leisure park will be on a smaller scale than the troubled Euro Disney
theme park outside Paris, but it still amounts to Germany's biggest film
industry investment ever, according to the delighted state government of
North Rhine-Westphalia.
The idea is to combine both a leisure park, with roundabouts, shows and a
funfair, with a studio complex for both film and television productions, on
the lines of Warner Brothers' Movie World complex in Australia.
The venture is intended to provide 900 jobs in a region badly hit by the
collapse of coal mining. Unemployment at Bottrop alone is 12.3 per cent.
Mr Kurt Schmitz, mayor of the town, greeted yesterday's announcement of
'provisional agreement' on the investment with enthusiasm.
The North Rhine-Westphalia government, hit by rounds of redundancies in coal
mining and steel, has promised big subsidies to promote the project. Money
will come from the state's mining industry development fund, says Economics
Minister Gunther Einert.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Martelli admits receiving funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Claudio Martelli, former Socialist justice minister, yesterday admitted
illicitly receiving L500m (Dollars 300,480) from Mr Carlo Sama, the former
managing director of Ferruzzi-Montedison, for Italy's general elections in
1992.
The admission came while Mr Martelli was giving evidence on the 15th day of
the trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, an influential consultant close to the
Socialist party. Mr Cusani is accused of bribery and corruption and helping
to falsify Montedison group accounts.
According to Mr Martelli, Mr Sama said as he was given the money: 'Oh,
Claudio, look, this money is mine and from the family, we are like
brothers.' Mr Sama is married to Alessandra, one of the Ferruzzi founder's
daughters.
Mr Sama, who also testified yesterday, admitted for the first time he had
given money to Mr Martelli, although the two men gave different accounts of
the events.
Mr Martelli, who was justice minister at the time, admitted he should have
declared the funds but insisted he thought the money was from the family,
not Montedison.
Mr Martelli is now the second former minister to admit illicitly receiving
money in the Cusani trial. Neither has been asked to say how the money was
spent.
Mr Sama also surprised the court by saying he had given L5bn to L7bn to Mr
Bettino Craxi, the then Socialist leader, for the 1992 elections.
In another development, Mr Alfredo Vito, a former Christian Democrat deputy
for Naples, has become the first member of parliament to be sentenced in the
corruption scandals. As a result of plea bargaining and an agreement to hand
back L5.5bn, he got a two-year suspended sentence. Some L4bn will go to a
children's fund run by the Naples city council and the rest will be
deposited in the Bank of Italy at the discretion of the public prosecutor's
office.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hungarian Democratic Forum, Hungary's governing conservative party, last
night named Mr Peter Boross, interior minister, to succeed Mr Jozsef Antall,
the late premier, Nicholas Denton reports. Mr Boross won the nomination by a
surprisingly comfortable margin and it now remains for President Arpad Goncz
to formally propose him for premiership and parliament to approve the
choice.
Political continuity is indicated by the fact that Mr Boross, aged 65 and
formerly an executive at a catering company, came to high political office
under the sponsorship of Mr Antall. But the nominee's blunt rhetoric places
him to the right of his predecessor.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jozsef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister who died of cancer on Sunday
at the age of 61, was a man rooted in his country's history.
That is most trivially true in his training and earlier profession as an
historian. More meaningfully, he drew strength from an abiding faith in
Hungary's democratic traditions inherited in part from his father, a
minister in the post-war government, who opposed both Nazis and communists.
His background led him to participate as a young man in the 1956 uprising
against Soviet and communist rule. It made almost inevitable his entry into
Hungary's political scene when democratisation began in the late 1980s.
In 1989 Mr Antall became leader of the centre-right Hungarian Democratic
Forum and in 1990 took a conservative coalition to victory in free
elections.
He brought to the premiership impeccable credentials as a democrat of the
old school. Politics was in his blood. The prime minister, although not an
inspiring leader, was a consummate politician: a master of the subtle
manoeuvre and the political balancing act.
But he took with him from his earlier career a tendency to lecture on
Hungary's traditions and that opened him to the charge that he was not just
old-fashioned but backward-looking.
Indeed he found it difficult to communicate with the post-communist,
materialist Hungarian whose Holy Trinity, it was said, was car, video and
weekend cottage. He was far happier meeting west German politicians and
playing the statesman.
Nor was he ever comfortable with economic policymaking during a hectic
period of free-market reforms. His response to the modern media's aggressive
role was prickly at best.
But Mr Antall's historical orientation gave him surer bearings than most
other post-communist politicians.
His grounding in Hungary's democratic and western traditions gave him a firm
sense of direction during the transition from one-party to multi-party rule
and from Warsaw Pact membership towards Nato and the European Union.
Above all, acute awareness of Hungary's 20th century trauma made Mr Antall
prize stability. And stability, which seemed an unambitious goal at the
euphoric start of the decade, looked a more impressive achievement over
time.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union signed an agreement with the United Nations yesterday to
streamline humanitarian aid operations and approved about Dollars 130m
(Pounds 87.2m) in aid, most of it for ex-Yugoslavia, AP reports from
Brussels.
'The agreement is an important step forward,' said Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees. It would allow the two organisations to
avoid costly overlap and speed up operations.
On Monday, the European Commission approved Ecu59m (Pounds 45m) in emergency
aid for Bosnia, which will be spent in co-ordination with the UNHCR. The
Commission also approved aid to the other republics, bringing overall aid to
Ecu86m.
David Gardner adds: According to EU diplomats in Brussels, a number of
foreign ministers from the 12 member states were last night and today due to
go to different parts of ex-Yugoslavia to prepare the ground for peace talks
planned for Brussels on December 22.
The diplomats said the decision was taken at yesterday's EU foreign
ministers' meeting in Brussels. They said Germany had floated the idea at
last weekend's EU heads of government summit of using the influence that
different member states had with contenders in the Bosnian war to try to
achieve peace terms.
The EU insists Serbia give up a portion of the land that it has conquered in
Bosnia.
Diplomats said it was likely the Netherlands would send its foreign minister
to Sarajevo, that Bonn would send its foreign minister to Zagreb - where
Germany wields influence  - and that several foreign ministers would
intercede with Belgrade.
Among the latter group Greece and possibly the UK and France were likely to
send representatives.

<TEXT>
The populist Northern League led by Mr Umberto Bossi has decided to break
out of its political isolation and work for a 'liberal-democrat' alliance
that includes Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate.
This is the main upshot of a League congress at the weekend during which Mr
Bossi imposed his full authority.
In the run-up to the congress, Mr Bossi had been criticised both for his
autocratic leadership style and for failing to see the need for alliances in
the recent local elections. The League, the party winning most votes in the
north, campaigned alone and lacked support to win vital mayoral seats in the
biggest cities of Genoa, Trieste and Venice.
The Italian media have been speculating on a link-up between the League and
Mr Berlusconi's nascent political ambitions for several months, but the
matter has now been taken one stage further. Over the weekend Mr Berlusconi
was perfectly happy to let his name be linked openly to the League in what
appeared a well orchestrated initiative.
Mr Bossi admitted the League had to change tactics to ensure it maintained a
voice in Italy's fast changing political scene. He proposed the League as
the hard core of an electoral alliance to fight the progressive one formed
to good effect at the local level by the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) to contest the municipal elections of November 21 and
December 6.
'In Mr Bossi's speech (to the congress), I found significant overtures
towards the idea of a broad liberal-democrat alliance,' Mr Berlusconi was
quoted as saying. 'I hope we can come close enough to form a coalition
capable of representing a majority in the country and blocking the PDS's
conquest of power.'
Mr Berlusconi's supporters indicated the League's federalist ideas were a
potential source of friction. The League congress called for reform of
Italy's constitution to introduce a federal structure dividing Italy into
three - Padania (north of the river Po), Etrurira (the centre) and the
south.
More importantly Mr Berlusconi could put his TV network licence agreements
at risk by active involvement in politics. In the past three weeks he has
used his networks, which control more than 80 per cent of Italy's commercial
TV, for self-promotion that goes against the spirit of the licences.
Mr Berlusconi's political judgment has already been exposed with his
under-estimation of the consequences of associating himself last month with
Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader of the neo-fascist MSI.

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal's opposition Socialists yesterday emerged clear victors from
Sunday's nationwide municipal elections, inflicting a sig-nificant defeat
over the ruling Social Democrats of Prime Minister Anbal Cavaco Silva.
Mr Antonio Guterres, the Socialist leader, said the victory would help
establish his party as a viable alternative government.
But he reiterated his pre-election pledge that the Socialists would not call
for an early dissolution of parliament based on the municipal results.
The Socialists increased their share of the vote to 36 per cent from 32 per
cent previously.
The Social Democrats also increased their share of the vote from 31 per cent
in 1989 to 34 per cent.
But Mr Cavaco Silva acknowledged that the party had fallen short of its main
aim of wresting control of a majority of the country's 305 municipal
councils from the Socialists.
Mr Jorge Sampaio, a Socialist, was re-elected mayor in Lisbon, at the head
of a coalition with the hardline Communist party.
This has raised the prospect of a broader Socialist-Communist coalition,
which President Mario Soares, a Socialist, is reported to favour.
The Communists polled 12 per cent of the total vote, the same result as in
1989.
During the campaign, Mr Cavaco Silva had said he was alarmed by indications
that the president might call an early general election before the next
scheduled ballot in October 1995, if the opposition gained a major victory.
The Socialists dismissed the prime minister's concern as scare-mongering.
The Socialists strengthened their hold over Portugal's second city, Oporto,
where they won with a majority of close to 60 per cent, and maintained
control of several other major cities.
The Socialists dominated in industrial areas, whereas the Social Democrats
fared best in rural regions.
The prime minister acknowledged that the results from Sunday's poll
reflected mid-term dissatisfaction with the government, which is struggling
to bring about economic recovery after an estimated 0.5 per cent decline in
output this year.
Unemployment and labour unrest are also rising, and reform legislation has
brought the government into conflict with doctors, teachers, students and
other professional sectors.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Andorra, the tiny principality wedged on the mountainous Franco-Spanish
border, emerged yesterday from its first constitution-based election after
more than 700 years of feudalism but found little changed, Reuter reports
from Andorra la Vella.
Though Sunday's poll produced no outright winner, the outgoing head of
government, Mr Oscar Ribas Reig, was confident the Pyrenean state could
pursue reform with a coalition.
Eighty-five per cent of the population of 60,000 is foreign and was
ineligible to vote under the new constitution.
Mr Ribas's centre-right Agrupament Nacional Democratic won the largest share
of the vote. It gained 26.4 per cent of valid votes in a turnout of 81 per
cent, giving it eight seats in the 28-member Consell General de les Valls,
Andorra's parliament. Unio Lliberal with 22 per cent, and Nova Democracia
with 19.1 per cent gained five each. Coalicio Nacional Andorrana (17.2) and
Iniciativa Democratica Nacional (15.3) shared the rest with independents.
Mr Ribas, who had 17 supporters in the outgoing Consell, did not view the
situation as a vote of no confidence in his government, comparing Andorra
now to Spain in the transition when more than 20 parties contested the first
election after General Franco's death in the mid-1970s.
Andorra is seeking to win international acceptance and modernise its
anachronistic institutions. It joined the United Nations in August and has
applied for membership of the Council of Europe. Key issues facing the new
government include a deepening economic crisis. Mr Ribas said the budget
deficit this year will reach Pta15.4bn (Pounds 75.5m) but so far no one has
suggested introducing direct taxation as a remedy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Statements made by Mr Zhirinovsky. . . (unless marked otherwise, all quotes
were made in election campaign)
'Russia's soldiers will once again stand guard over the 1975 border of the
Soviet Union and once we have put them there they will not move back a
single step.'
'We took Berlin in 1945 and then gave it back. Now the Germans live well and
we live badly. What was the point of taking Berlin? We should have forced
millions of Germans to work for us. Then we Russians could have taken things
easy.'
'Although we're not anti-Semitic we won't tolerate an increase in the
strength of Jews.'
'The world should think twice before opposing us - after all, is it really
desirable to have a third world war?'
'Why should we create suffering for ourselves? We should create suffering
for others.'
'The Russian people have three choices. We can either choose that which we
have now by voting for Gaidar and Yavlinsky, which does not suit many
people, or we can choose to go backwards by voting for the Communists, which
also does not not suit many people. My party represents the third choice.'
'Less democracy] More economy] That is our slogan. Look at China. I admit it
was not very democratic to use tanks against the students but the main thing
is that the country itself still exists. And they do not have shortages of
food and medicines as we have.' May 1992
'Never shall anyone humiliate the Russians' (on his posters.)
'You will all be fine with me' (campaign slogan)
'I am waiting in the wings. My moment has nearly arrived.' March 1993
'You are going to defend Iraq, a victim of reckless aggression by America
and Israel. . . You should know you should die for a noble cause. . . We
will blow up a few Kuwaiti ports and aircraft plus a few American ships in
the Gulf.' Speech to armed volunteers he sent to defend his hero Saddam
Hussein, January 1993
'I would bomb the Japanese. I would sail our large navy around their small
island and if they so much as cheeped I would nuke them. . . and we Russians
haven't forgotten English treachery during the war. You are a small island,
so you watch out, too,' January 1993, when asked by an English reporter what
he wanted to do about the long running battle over the Kurile islands.
'Give me a billion dollars and I will become president of Russia.' January
1993.
'Seventy or 80 per cent will vote for me in the next elections. Mr Yeltsin
is not ready - he is afraid of the people. I am not afraid. I am ready for
the next election.' May 1992, after last elections.
'If I don't rule, then no matter, let the military. In any case, they would
be better than Yeltsin's democrats.' December 1991.

Early parliamentary election results from regions in Russia's far east
yesterday showed a late surge for Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal
Democrats, pushing the party ahead in areas distant from power yet suffering
the effects of economic reform.
In these regions, separated from Moscow by nine time zones, the nationalist
LDP was running at more than double the strength of Russia's Choice - 25 per
cent of votes cast as against 12.
The Communists were just behind at 11 per cent and the Agrarians, Yabloko
and Women of Russia each at 7 to 8 per cent.
However, as results were coming in from further west, the vote for Russia's
Choice and the rural Agrarian party was rising, at the expense of the
Liberal Democrats and the Communists.
Results for the first 53 of the 89 regions suggested that the Liberal
Democrats had won 24.53 per cent; Russia's Choice 14.46 per cent; the
Communist party 11.31 per cent; and the Agarian party 8.83 per cent.
Nationally, the results are likely to favour the pro-reformists further,
because of the stronger support for reform in European Russia, where
two-thirds of the population live.
Exit polls in both Moscow and St Petersburg, the largest cities in Russia,
showed Russia's Choice was significantly ahead, though elsewhere Mr
Zhirinovsky was reported to be in the lead.
Mr Nikolai Ryabov, head of the Central Electoral Commission, yesterday
refused to give a 'general picture' of the voting patterns.
But he said that about half of the 13 blocs contending for 225 seats in the
lower house elected by party lists would not achieve the necessary 5 per
cent qualifying total.
He said that 'in a range of regions' the LDP was leading, while in 'several'
others it was in second or third place. The new parliament, he said, would
show 'a sufficiently wide spectrum of political forces'.
The constitution, which required a 50 per cent turnout to be valid and a
majority of those voting to be passed, scraped through the first of these
barriers, and appeared to have attracted the support of 60 per cent of those
voting.
However, in a significant number of regions and republics, the 50 per cent
barrier was not passed.
Though that has no significance for the passing of the constitution, it will
be a future point of conflict with those areas which are claiming
'sovereignty' under their own constitutions.
The 'hot spots' will be the North Caucasian republic of Chechnya, where no
voting was allowed; the Republic of Tatarstan, where only 13 per cent voted
and where no members were elected to the upper house of the parliament; and
the region of Sverdlovsk, where Mr Eduard Rossel, the former governor, had
attempted to change the region into the Urals Republic and where fewer than
50 per cent voted on the Russian constitution - though Mr Rossel was himself
elected to the upper house.
Other important regions where a 50 per cent vote on the constitution was not
achieved were the republics of Ingushetia, Udmurtia and Komi; the regions of
Kemerovo, Khabarovsk, Chelyabinsk and Perm; and the autonomous district of
Khanty Mansisk.

FT  14 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: One-man band strikes a familiar note
 -Zhirinovsky's rise has strong parallels with pre-war Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND

<TEXT>
The remarkably strong showing of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's neo-fascist
Liberal Democratic party yesterday prompted Mr Yegor Gaidar, architect of
Russia's economic reforms, to make a historical comparison which is looming
large in the minds of many frightened observers of the country's political
scene.
In a domestic radio broadcast Mr Gaidar, who once dubbed Mr Zhirinovsky 'a
little Hitler', drew parallels between Russia's tenuous political and
economic climate and the situation in inter-war Germany which propelled the
Nazis to power.
The similarities are certainly striking. Like Adolf Hitler, Mr Zhirinovsky
has benefited from his country's simultaneous collapse of political muscle
abroad and living standards at home. And like the Nazis, Mr Zhirinovsky's
strictly hierarchical, well-organised party, adept at producing rhetoric
which appeals to many Russian people, has capitalised on the internecine
quarrels among Russian democrats and their failure to woo tired voters with
the promise of quick-fix solutions to Russia's woes.
The Liberal Democratic party is very much the creature of Mr Zhirinovsky,
its leader. Party enthusiasts sometimes go by the name of 'Zhirinovsky's
eagles' and the main party broadsheets all bear their chief's name rather
than the party's official title. None of the other members are prominent
figures in their own right in Russian politics.
However, far from apologising for his organisation's focus on a single man,
Mr Zhirinovsky sees it as one of the secrets of his success. 'A party should
have a single leader, with whom no one can quarrel. This is crucial to party
discipline and to our strength,' he said in a pre-poll interview.
Unlike the Communist party, which could draw on the extensive network still
in place from the days when it ran the Soviet Union, or Russia's Choice,
which was effectively the party of government, the Liberal Democrats have
had to create a structure from scratch.
Building on the supporters Mr Zhirinovsky first rallied to his side in his
unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1991, the Liberal Democrats swiftly
assembled an organisation depending less on a strong network throughout
Russia's regions than on their leader's charismatic message.
The Liberal Democrats' principle campaign weapons were highly emotive paid
television advertisements and Mr Zhirinovsky's extensive personal
appearances at rallies throughout the country.
Party officials yesterday said they had spent Rbs1bn on the campaign which
the party treasurer last week said had come from 'God himself'. He later
explained that the funds were entirely based on small contributions of
Rbs2,000 and Rbs3000 each from individuals.
Mr Zhirinovsky has benefited, in particular, from pockets of intense support
in areas, such as the break-away Abkhazian region in Georgia, where ethnic
Russians or small minority groups feel threatened by one of the newly
independent post-Soviet states. In places like these his promise to protect
ethnic Russians everywhere is compelling.
The remarkable electoral success of the Liberal Democrats is likely to test
how a political structure so closely tied to a single man - so effective on
the campaign trail - will adapt to the more formal challenges of
parliamentary politics.
In marked contrast to the outrageous statements Mr Zhirinovsky issued with
evident relish during the campaign, the morning after his unexpected victory
was taking pains to position himself as a reasonable man, willing to work
within Russia's existing political framework.
Best known for taking unashamedly extremist positions (he promised last week
to shoot the presidents of Russia's 5,000 commercial banks), Mr Zhirinovsky
is now portraying himself as the great conciliator who can weave a
compromise out of the patch-work of Russia's political parties.
In this somewhat incongruous role as Russia's centrist force, Mr Zhirinovsky
said his party would be willing to form a government to serve under
President Boris Yeltsin or to take up two or three ministerial posts within
a coalition.
Alternatively, his confusingly named party would be willing to act as 'a
constructive opposition'.
The soul of compromise, Mr Zhirinovsky - who makes no effort to conceal his
ambition to become president one day - said he would not oppose Mr Yeltsin
if he chose to postpone presidential elections until 1996, nor would his
party object to Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin's continued tenure as prime minister.
The only post the Liberal Democrats - are scoring between 20 and 26 per cent
in projections of the election results - say they will insist upon is
chairmanship of the lower house of parliament, the State Duma.
With Mr Yeltsin's chief spokesman yesterday telling Interfax that parts of
Mr Zhirinovsky's platform 'quite correspond to the social aspects of the
president's policies - that is the social policy of the state, patriotism,
making Russian great', Russia's beleaguered democrats must now ask
themselves who is more dangerous: the demagogic Zhirinovsky of the campaign
trail, or the victorious parliamentarian, extending a hand in co-operation.

Former Soviet republics reacted with concern yesterday to the strong support
given to the neo-fascist leader, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has said
Russia should occupy all the territories of the former USSR.
From Ukraine and the Baltic states on Russia's western flank to the Central
Asia republics on the south-eastern rim of the Russian Federation,
republican leaders expressed their worries about Mr Zhirinovsky's showing.
However, all tempered their fears with hopes of a united, anti-fascist
alliance of Russian democrats and a firm rejection of Russian expansionism
by the western powers.
The toughest response came from the Baltic states, whose large ethnic
Russian minorities make them particularly vulnerable to Mr Zhirinovsky's
pledge to defend Russians no matter where they live.
Leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia plan to meet in Tallinn, the
Estonian capital, tomorrow, to develop a common strategy on how to deal with
Russia in the aftermath of the elections, a spokeswoman for the Latvian
president said.
Adopting strong language laced with references to inter-war Germany, Baltic
leaders urged the west to take a firm stance in the face of the possible
resurgence of Russian expansionism.
In Kiev, Mr Viktor Stelmakh, a spokesman for the Ukrainian president, said:
'Zhirinovsky's success does not portend well for Ukraine.
'In his election campaign, he used demagogic slogans about recreating the
Russian Empire and made direct territorial claims on Ukraine.'
Foreign ministry officials in Kiev said Mr Zhirinovsky's electoral triumph
would make the Ukrainian parliament less likely to give up the nuclear
weapons stationed on its territory. Failure to surrender the weapons has
become a source of mounting concern in the US and threatens to jeopardise
the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT).
'Parliamentarians have said there will be no ratification of Start while
there's a threat (to Ukrainian independence),' the Ukrainian official said.
'Here's concrete proof of a threat from our neighbour. For them it is proof
of why we should hold on to the weapons.'
Officials from Kirghizia, which was caught up in a domestic political crisis
that culminated yesterday with the ousting of the entire cabinet, said they
were worried by the Russian election results but would wait to see how the
parliament shaped up. Officials in Belarus, one of the most conservative of
the former Soviet republics, also expressed concern, while Georgian leaders
took comfort in Russia's approval of a new constitution.
The Russian poll result coincided with Kazakhstan's formal accession to the
NPT. The Kazakh parliament, which had already agreed to give up the portion
of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal on its territory, joined the accord in
a session attended by visiting US Vice-President Al Gore.

FT  14 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Voters reveal a weariness with
politics
</HEADLINE>

Lenin killed off Russia's last attempt at democracy when he sent sailors to
dissolve the 1918 Constituent Assembly, saying the 'guard is tired'. In
Sunday's election, it was the voters who told Russia's democratically-minded
politicians of their weariness.
This, at least, is the message behind the crushing electoral victory of Mr
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist leader who promises to restore Russia
as a great power, to end crime and corruption among selfish officials, and
to give every citizen of Russia guarantees of economic well-being.
Rather than an indication of Russians being a nation of war-mongering
extremists, the result is a snapshot of a sharply divided society with real
grievances that need addressing, if not with deeds at least with words.
It shows a society split among the losers and winners of reforms conducted
so far - or at least between those who have already lost faith in them and
those who are still patiently awaiting their fruits.
Some of the new categories of society, such as entrepreneurs, are more
clearly in a single camp than others.
But interviews with dozens of Mr Zhirinovsky's supporters over the past few
days show little support for his talk of invading neighbouring countries and
reabsorbing former Soviet republics. Most frequently they express a longing
for law and order, panic over Russia's economic crisis, a feeling of
national humiliation as a result of the Soviet Union's collapse, and a
belief that their interests are not being pursued by officialdom.
They range from soldiers and simple-minded workers with low levels of
education to educated professionals, such as engineers at defence
enterprises, drawn by Mr Zhirinovsky's promises to restore their previous
importance to the economy.
One distinct constituency for Mr Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats has been
the military. Freed of the Communist era obligation to vote as their
commanders told them, the army has been strongly attracted by promises to
make Russia great again and to give each homeless officer a flat.
For some of the more educated, supporting Mr Zhirinovsky was a calculated
protest vote against the ruling authorities. 'I know Zhirinovsky means war,'
says Mr Yuri Bolshakov, the courteous and educated chief designer at a major
shipyard. 'But only Zhirinovsky will provide genuine opposition which
Yeltsin needs.'
Some, probably a minority, are motivated by a more distilled chauvinism,
like Vladimir, a prosperous waiter at St Petersburg's plush Astoria Hotel
which caters mainly to even richer foreigners. He said he believed Mr
Zhirinovsky would restore Russians' prestige in their own country. Nikolai,
a visiting officer in the Ukrainian army, even said he was happy about Mr
Zhirinovsky's success because it might mean Ukraine would be reabsorbed by
Russia.
For the pro-reform elite, which once considered Mr Zhirinovsky a joke or a
nightmare, the result is a direct threat to their aspirations - but also a
sign of the need to defend them better.
'It is no doubt a sign of people's lack of education that people believed in
Zhirinovsky's simplistic solutions,' said Mr Mikhail Vinchel, a consultant
who has invested in privatised Russian enterprises. 'But at least now the
democrats will have a powerful stimulus to unite.'
Mr Andrei Chuguevsky, a Russian entrepreneur, said: 'We get what we deserve
as a society. . . . Big reforms are always difficult, especially when
conducted in the absence of political culture. This means society can be
manipulated however you like.'
As Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister responsible for
privatisation said: 'We thought our work would speak for itself.'
Not a single reformist leader held a television debate with Mr Zhirinovsky
to point out to voters the flaws in his arguments. Nor did TV journalists
fill that gap. The result was that Mr Zhirinovsky's assertions went totally
unchallenged and he is now reaping the benefits of a brilliant campaign of
systematic, consistent, clear, disciplined and entertaining manipulation.
For a nation so professedly weary of politicians, the fact that so many
people were sufficiently credulous to believe in Mr Zhirinovsky's promises
is also a sign of the heritage of seven decades of communism.
Mr Yuri Vdovin, one of the defeated Russia's Choice candidates in St
Petersburg, puts his finger on the reasons for this paradox: 'We have been
brought up to believe in things like Stalin, communism, and the party - but
not to understand them'.

The German government yesterday put a brave face on the election results
from Moscow, congratulating both 'the Russian people and President Boris
Yeltsin on the good result for the new constitution'.
There was obvious concern, however, over the big vote for both Russian
nationalists and communists, with Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister,
admitting the result was 'surprising'.
'It shows that people were exploiting both social protest and doubtless also
the identity crisis in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union,' Mr
Kinkel said, reflecting an unease felt across western capitals at the poor
performance of the reformist parties - a concern only partly tempered by
relief at that Mr Yeltsin's constitution was adopted.
As the news of the scale of the nationalist and communist vote trickled in,
Scandinavian countries became the first to voice their alarm. Mr Johan
Hoergen Holst, Norwegian foreign minister and potential future secretary
general of Nato, warned that the results were a 'sign of danger' for many in
Europe, with the progress of the nationalists 'very frightening'.
Mr Carl Bildt, Swedish prime minister, said the results were 'disturbing',
although he insisted that Russia's progress towards democracy was now
'unstoppable'.
Meanwhile, Mr Thomas Pickering, US ambassador to Moscow warned the strong
support given to Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky in the elections could provide a
long-term political disruption to President Yeltsin, though the approval of
his constitution had given Mr Yeltsin a 'legal basis to move ahead'.
Mr Kinkel warned the result could slow Nato expansion, and Nato officials
were wary. Uncertainties about its relationship with Russia were a factor in
its decision to slow the pace of Nato expansion, they said.
Finland and Japan, which have been the target of Mr Zhirinovsky's
territorial claims, carefully maintained a muted reaction. Far-right parties
in France and Germany sent a message of congratulations to Mr Zhirinovsky.
With Mr Zhirinovsky's future role in any government still unclear, the hope
in many diplomatic quarters is that the extremist statements made during his
election campaign might be toned down in the aftermath of the election.
Meanwhile the international money markets and western business community in
Moscow remained philosophical. Businesses already operating in Moscow were
accustomed to considerable uncertainty, businessmen said.

FT  14 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Former satellites fearful of renewed
imperialism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strong showing of the neo-fascists, Communists and anti-western
proponents of a new Russian Empire, backed by a powerful military, has sent
a frisson of nervousness through the recently liberated states of central
Europe and the Baltic region.
Only three months ago the Polish electorate felt sufficiently self-assured
to vote back into power parties with their roots in the communist past. But
foreign and defence ministers of the former Warsaw Pact states have since
been urging the west to resist what they see as signs of resurgent Russian
imperial designs in central Asia and the Caucasus and the dangers of leaving
an ill-defined 'buffer zone' between Russia and Germany.
Mr Geza Jeszensky, Hungarian foreign minister, has even spoken against what
Budapest perceives as a western policy of 'appeasement' of Russia. He called
on the Nato powers not to be conditioned by Moscow's restored hostility to
any future extension of the Nato security umbrella to the Visegrad 4 states
of central Europe.
Such fears were temporarily eased by President Boris Yeltsin's dissolution
of the communist-era parliament and storming of the building. But they have
re-emerged with the strong showing of anti-reform forces in the new Russian
parliament and the approval of a constitution tailor-made for Mr Yeltsin but
whose wide powers could conceivably be wielded in the future by Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky or others like him who emerged strengthened from the weekend
poll.
Signs that the Russian military voted strongly in favour of Mr Zhirinovsky
and other communist/nationalist candidates are particularly disturbing for
Latvia and Estonia who received a pledge from the former government that the
last remaining former-Soviet troops would be withdrawn next year. However,
Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serb leader, has been encouraged by the electoral
success of like-minded men in Russia as he himself looks forward to
elections next weekend. Serbia is a text book example of what unbridled
nationalism and an over-wheening military can do to destroy prosperity and
liberties.
The hope in central Europe last night, however, was that the final Russian
election results would still permit the formation of a government dedicated
to continuing the economic reforms required to create the prosperous social
base needed to underpin democracy. But central European governments know
better than most the difficulty of keeping reform on the tracks in the face
of the high unemployment caused by cutting back the old militarised,
socialist economy.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Clark fuels Iraq arms exports controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A change to the government's guidelines on defence exports should have been
announced to parliament, Mr Alan Clark, former minister of trade and
defence, said yesterday.
In evidence to the Scott arms to Iraq inquiry, Mr Clark said the change,
secretly agreed by ministers in late 1988, was used by officials to approve
additional exports of defence equipment to Iraq.
His statement will further fuel the arms for Iraq controversy and represents
the first serious crack in an otherwise solid ministerial defence of the
government's role in the affair.
Mr Clark said he was in favour of announcing the change in the guidelines to
MPs, but allowed himself to be overruled by the Foreign Office.
'I think (had we announced it there would have been a row that would have
flared and blown over . . . you would have needed a blow torch to get it
alight again,' Mr Clark said.
His comment contradicted the position taken by his former ministerial
colleague at the Foreign Office, Mr William Waldegrave, who justified
withholding the change from parliament and the media because it served the
'overriding public interest'.
Mr Clark compared Mr Waldegrave's attitude to an 'Alice in Wonderland
situation where because something hadn't been announced it hadn't happened'.
It was Mr Clark's admission to an Old Bailey judge last year that he had
misled customs officials about the extent to which he had encouraged British
exporters to Iraq that contributed to the collapse of the trial of three
executives of the Midlands machine tools company, Matrix-Churchill, who were
accused of illegally exporting arms to Iraq.
The trial was abandoned after ministers had attempted to suppress classified
documents showing the extent Whitehall had circumvented export controls.
Mr Clark said there was an understandable reluctance within Whitehall to
stir up parliament.
He described the government's use of the guidelines as 'improper' and
'tiresome' and Foreign Office use of intelligence as 'confused and
alarmist'.
Mr Clark also cast doubt on Lady Thatcher's evidence at the Scott inquiry
last week.
Lady Thatcher said that as prime minister she had not been made aware of the
change to the guidelines. But Mr Clark said that ministerial decisions had
been copied to Downing Street and circulated to Lady Thatcher's personal
foreign affairs adviser, Sir Charles Powell.
Mr Clark said Lady Thatcher's parliamentary answers on the subject of arms
to Iraq indicated that she had been informed of the change to the
guidelines.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Fisons ousts chief and cuts dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Fisons, the troubled UK pharmaceuticals and scientific
equipment group, has ousted its chief executive Mr Cedric Scroggs.
The company is now looking for its third chief executive in as many years.
The group also announced its third profits warning since 1991, the
resignation of its finance director and a cut in its dividend.
Mr Patrick Egan, chairman, said he had expected the group to make a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 100m this year. But because of restructuring provisions and
a change in trading policy for the drugs division, it expected only to break
even. He promised results would improve from 1994, compared with what would
otherwise have been achieved.
The final dividend has been cut from 5.4p to 1p, making a total dividend of
4.3p (8.7p). The group said this would save Pounds 37m in cash next year.
Fisons' shares closed down 24p at 113p.
Mr Egan said: 'Cedric was offered the opportunity to resign, which he
refused. He was, in effect, sacked.'
The primary cause of Mr Scroggs' unexpected departure was the collapse in
operating profits of the scientific equipment business for which he held
board responsibility. The operations will report a loss this year of Pounds
16m compared with a trading profit of Pounds 12m last year.
Mr Egan said the business had been hit by the recession, but a Pounds 28m
turnround was unacceptable. 'There have been clear managerial weaknesses,'
he said.
The collapse in profits in this division exposed some accounting practices
in the drugs operations which, according to Mr Mike Redmond, pharmaceuticals
managing director, were unwise but not illegal.
These included boosting sales and profits by offering customers discounts at
the year-end. In 1991, when the practice was at its peak, it generated
nearly a fifth of the division's sales.
Mr Roy Thomas, finance director, scheduled to leave shortly, has resigned.
Mr Redmond said his early resignation was not related to the discounting
policy.
The discounts have been stopped. The drugs division's trading profits would
be Pounds 28m less than they would have been, said Mr Redmond. Operating
profits this year would also be hit by a charge of Pounds 3m for
restructuring and Pounds 5m for stocks write-offs. A further Pounds 15m
would be charged over the next two years.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Gaidar calls for anti-fascist front: Russia's reformists
suffer severe setback as far right makes sweeping election gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Russia's reformist parties, shocked by the sweeping gains in Sunday's
elections by the neo-fascist Liberal Democrats, begin urgent talks today on
forming an 'anti-fascist front' to save reforms.
Early results from far eastern regions and estimates from European Russia
last night showed Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's neo-fascist Liberal Democrats
with a commanding lead. Mr Gaidar's Russia's Choice came second in some
regions and, in others, third behind the communists.
Although voting in European Russia may redress the balance somewhat, early
indications of a surge in support for Mr Zhirinovsky have been more than
confirmed.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister and leader of Russia's Choice,
the main reformist bloc, said the 'widest democratic coalition' was
necessary 'to influence changes in the government which must take place in
the next few days'.
He said: 'It would be a danger to all of humanity if there was the slightest
chance of this man (Zhirinovsky) becoming president.' Even communists, he
said, would be welcome to join a coalition.
He called for reforms to continue to stop the extremist bandwagon - and said
he was 'confident' that the democrats could muster a majority in the new
parliament, due to convene on January 11.
If he proves wrong, the pace of reform will rest entirely with President
Boris Yeltsin, who has been given the power by the new constitution to form
the government and dissolve parliamentif it disagrees with his choice.
Mr Yeltsin's aides said that the constitution had been approved by about 60
per cent of the electorate.
Mr Gaidar's warning reverberated through former Soviet republics, territory
Mr Zhirinovsky has threatened to occupy. The Baltic states announced they
will hold a summit tomorrow to discuss the result.
In Washington, President Clinton said he was pleased at Russia's adoption of
a new constitution and 'not particularly surprised' at the strong showing of
ultra-nationalists.
The German government congratulated 'the Russian people and President Boris
Yeltsin on the good result for the new constitution' although there was
concern over the big vote for both nationalists and communists.
Mr Yeltsin issued a statement saying that the elections had 'established the
conditions for an honourable and democratic expression of the will of
Russian citizens'.
He greeted the adoption of the constitution as the basis for 'our common
hope in the resurrection of a great and strong Russia'. He pledged that 'as
president I will stand strongly on the basis of the new constitution, so
that, relying on your constitutional choice, I will do all I can to
guarantee the irreversibility of the democratic processes, to put a
constitutional barrier for all citizens against a reversal of your
democratic choice'.
Earlier, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, Mr Yeltsin's press secretary, had suggested
that Mr Yeltsin was prepared to work with the Liberal Democrats - saying
that they had a common interest in social protection, patriotism and the
revival of Russia.
Mr Zhirinovsky said: 'If Yeltsin asks us to form a government, we are ready.
If he asks us to join the government, take up two-three ministerial
positions, we are ready. If he offers us nothing, we are ready to remain as
the largest opposition party and help constructively.'
He appeared anxious to moderate his previous hard-line positions - even
going to the length of denying previous statements that he intended to
repossess Finland.
Mr Zhirinovsky's success is bolstered by the election of such leading
conservative figures as Mr Sergei Baburin, former leader of the Unity
nationalist bloc in the former parliament, standing in Omsk; and Mr Anatoly
Lukyanov, former speaker of the Soviet-era parliament jailed for allegedly
taking part in the coup attempt against Mr Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991,
standing in Smolensk.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Israeli and PLO leaders admit peace deal faces crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and MARK NICHOLSON

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM, CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation faced a potentially serious
setback to their peace deal yesterday when they failed to implement the
first stage of their agreement.
Both sides admitted facing a crisis as Israeli troops remained in position
in Gaza and Jericho, ignoring the first day of the timetable under which
they are to withdraw by mid April.
Israeli troops were due to begin pulling out of Gaza and Jericho yesterday
under the accord signed in September.
Three Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli troops in Gaza
yesterday. One attempted to drive an ambulance packed with explosives into
an Israeli patrol.
Colonel Shuki Shichrur, deputy military commander of Gaza, said his troops
were ready and waiting to withdraw from the strip and could do so within
five weeks. However, Israel made not even a symbolic gesture yesterday to
mark the start of the process.
Both sides conceded that serious difficulties remained after Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organisation, failed toagree in Cairo on Sunday. The
two have agreed to meet again in 10 days.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, told Reuters: 'It is a serious
crisis . . . It is not the first, it is not the last. Negotiation is, in a
way, a chain of crises you have overcome.'
Mr Arafat said in the Hague: 'Definitely there are serious problems,
otherwise why the delay for 10 days?' The PLO leader warned that any further
delay would seriously damage the credibility of the peace process. Mr Rabin
said it would be difficult to iron out outstanding differences between the
two sides within 10 days although 'matters of principle' could be resolved
in that period.
Three key issues have yet to be agreed: the size of the Jericho area,
control over the Gaza-Egypt and Jericho-Jordan border crossings, and the
size and role of an Israeli military presence around Jewish settlements in
Gaza. Mr Rabin said he would allow a Palestinian presence at the crossings,
but would not concede control as this would involve fundamental issues of
security and sovereignty.
Some political analysts in Israel believe Mr Rabin is playing a dangerous
game of brinkmanship by increasing the pressure on the PLO at a time of
spiralling violence by extremists on both sides opposed to the peace
process.
They also believe Mr Rabin is playing the security card to win back waning
public support for the government's peace drive after a growing number of
attacks on Israelis.

<TEXT>
The people of Kaliningrad were yesterday voting to an agenda more polarised
than elsewhere in Russia, thanks to the city's unique history and location.
Cut off from the world for 50 years, and now cut off from Russia by three
borders, the former cold war fort has offered a stark example of the power
struggle between a rising business class and a declining military elite.
The residents of Russia's westernmost district, for centuries better known
as East Prussia, are sharply split between pro-reform parties advocating an
aggressive turn to the west, mainly Germany, and conservative groups
hankering for a reconstituted Soviet Union.
Around 200,000 military personnel live among the city's population of just
1m, offering a strong constituency of support for Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party.
'Power is in the hands of enemies and with them you can only talk through
the barrel of a gun,' grunts an older military officer strolling down the
main Lenin Prospect, giving voice to the anxieties that have been putting Mr
Zhirinovsky's party into third place in local polls.
But Kaliningrad has also developed a clear liberal tint in the last two
years: Mr Boris Yeltsin got less than 40 per cent of the presidential vote
in 1991 but over 60 per cent, which was higher than the national average, in
April's referendum.
That shift, according to local politicians, has been caused by the opening
of Kaliningrad to German tourists visiting the ancient city which they know
as Konigsberg - destroyed first by war and then by Soviet bulldozers - as
much as by the proximity of the west itself. The arrival of the tourists has
brought around Rbs1.2bn (Dollars 923,000) in direct investment.
'Peoples' mind-set has changed faster than in other regions,' claims Mr
Nikolai Tulaev, who retired as a navy captain to run in the elections on the
Russia's Choice list for the State Dunma, or lower house of parliament. A
poll by the Kaliningrad Sociological Centre last week showed his party
running neck-and-neck with Yabloko, another reformist group, at around 14
per cent of the vote.
The region's liberally-inclined administration hopes the new parliament will
get Moscow to loosen the bureaucratic noose while, simultaneously,
increasing subsidies.
Reform groups see the first step, needed to let Kaliningrad develop its so
far disappointing free economic zone, as having already been taken. Custom
duties were eliminated this year, although export quotas on amber, oil and
fish - the region's staple products - reflect what local officials call
cumbersome meddling from the centre in the periphery.
'Give us less money, fewer products, but give us economic rights,' says Mr
Tulaev. 'We'll make the money ourselves.'
Such an attitude contrasts sharply with the interest of the city's
conservative forces, which seek a strengthening of central control. Focusing
on Kaliningrad's significance as Russia's last western war prize, Mr
Zhirinovsky's supporters identify their mission as explicitly rejecting any
German designs on the city, and, more symbolically, on maintaining the glory
of the past.
'Strengthening defence is our number one concern. Kaliningrad must stay a
strong Russian bastion in the west,' says Mr Defermoev Dovzhenko, the
Russian Communist party candidate, who rejects pressure from neighbouring
states and reformers to demilitarise. Mr Dovzhenko is even ready for 'Nato
agitation', he says.
Both sides blame much of the city's economic hardship on the region's
appendage status. Disputes over transport rights with its troublesome
neighbour, Lithuania, have slowed the trickle of much-needed supplies, such
as oil. But stores are full of expensive consumer goods brought from Poland.
Drug abuse and organised crime have left the police flustered, with
Kaliningrad the area hub for stolen cars.
The younger generation sees salvation to the west: Berlin is closer than
Moscow. 'Yes, it's better here than in Russia,' said Svetlana Lekismnaya, a
19-year-old student, 'but I've never been there.'
But for the older generation, and especially war veterans who captured
Konigsberg in 1939, the prospect of increased German involvement plays to
their fears: indeed, the Communist party has been renamed the Patriotic
Party in Kaliningrad.
Mr Dovzhenko, its constituency candidate, blames 'the threat of
re-Germanisation' on 'the fall of the USSR'.
Such voices are loud. But Ms Olga Krupina, director of the Immanuel Kant
Museum, hopes reason will win out in the German philosopher's former home:
'The elections are needed to wipe out the old ideology.'

FT  13 DEC 93 / Russian Elections: Folks back home tire of Yeltsin -
President's vision for Russia's future fails to convince his home village,
which has found a new leader
</HEADLINE>

   BUTKA, SVERDLOVSK REGION
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin can have found little comfort from his birthplace
during yesterday's watershed in Russia's political development.
Voters in the isolated village of Butka, 5,000 people nestled in the heart
of the Russian Urals, are deeply disillusioned with their most famous native
son.
'I was a student in Moscow when Yeltsin left the Communist party, and at
that time I was so proud to be from his home town,' said Mr Oleg Sanochkin,
the strapping 32-year-old agronomist who works at Butka's state farm.
'But now I am bitter about Yeltsin. I do not like his recent decisions. He
has given the Russian village nothing.' Like many in the town, Mr Sanochkin
cast his vote for the conservative Agrarian party, because he believes it is
the only force that will speak up for the countryside.
In the sub-zero weather, Butka's log cabins with sky-blue trimmings make a
pretty picture against a landscape of frost-encased forests and snow-covered
fields. But the villagers of Butka, who must endure a gruelling four-hour
drive over bumpy roads to get to Ekaterinburg, the capital of the region,
have no running water in their homes and have seen their purchasing power
shrink as the prices of industrial goods have risen.
For these reasons, the villagers say they are looking to a new leader, in
the form of Mr Eduard Rossel, who yesterday stood as an independent
candidate for the upper house of parliament. The popular former governor of
the region, he was ousted by Mr Yeltsin in November.
'Our region has found a new hero - Rossel,' Mr Sanochkin says. That is bad
news for Mr Yeltsin. The main source of contention between the two men is Mr
Rossel's campaign for greater regional autonomy for the Urals, a political
objective at loggerheads with Mr Yeltsin's draft constitution, also put to a
vote yesterday.
But the differences between the two local heroes run deeper. An ethnic
German, descended from the Volga Germans, Mr Rossel was left to fend for
himself when his mother and grandmother were imprisoned in a Siberian labour
camp at the outset of the second world war.
The homeless four-year-old boy survived by begging, but Mr Rossel says his
memories of a stomach swollen by starvation make him wary of a radical
approach to market reforms. Sympathising with these views and full of
personal admiration for Mr Rossel, the disgruntled villagers of Butka, and
like-minded voters in the region, are likely to elect him to parliament,
where he could become a painful thorn in Mr Yeltsin's side.
However, the president can take solace from the attitudes of the urban
electorate.
In heavily-industrialised Ekaterinburg, where Mr Yeltsin reigned as the
regional communist boss, voters appeared inclined to support the democratic
parties in parliament. According to an exit poll conducted by Interfax at
one polling station - which may not be representative - Russia's Choice
received 35 per cent of the vote, followed by the Yavlinsky group.
Even at a polling station in one of the city's working class neighbourhoods,
voters seemed willing to give the democrats a second chance.
'I voted for Russia's choice,' said Andrei, a blue-eyed, 26-year-old
chauffeur. 'They have already begun to break things up. We should let them
finish doing that and then maybe they will build something new and better.'
Decked out in the tracksuit and leather jacket which are the uniform of
Russia's nouveau riche, Andrei, who quit his job at a troubled state factory
to work for a thriving private concern two years ago, says his life has
become better since Russia began the difficult process of shedding its
communist skin.
Mr Yeltsin will be counting on urban voters like Andrei, who have begun to
benefit from reforms, to drown out the discontented voice of the countryside
and the pensioners.
But, no matter how the parliament shapes up, Mr Yeltsin can take solace from
the fact that, if his native Urals were representative of the country as a
whole, the crucial referendum on the constitution would go through.
On this issue, paradoxically, the impoverished villages are proving to be a
trump card for Mr Yeltsin. While voting in some of the cities was sluggish,
the more conservative rural areas, where the Soviet tradition of enforced
voting has been slower to die, appears to be coming to the constitution's
rescue.
In Butka for example, election day was a high point in the slow provincial
life of the village. A concert was held in the room adjacent to the polling
station and, in typical Soviet fashion, foods unavailable on the bare
shelves of Butka's only grocery store were on sale at a booth just a few
feet from the ballot boxes.
Moreover, displaying the contrary impulses of voters the world over, even
though they are not too keen on Mr Yeltsin's policies, the people of Butka
like the strong-man constitution he has drafted.
'Yeltsin is right. In these times of troubles, Russia needs a strong hand,'
says Mr Sanochkin, one of the president's local critics. But, aware of the
contradiction in his views, he adds: 'Of course, the only thing Mr Yeltsin's
strong hand has done so far is to sack our leader, Rossel.'

FT  13 DEC 93 / Praise for Hungary's farmers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Hungary's farmers are among the best placed to benefit from a liberalisation
in world trade following a successful conclusion of the Gatt Round,
according to a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-op-eration and
Development.
The study finds that the level of agricultural subsidy in Hungary is lower
than in any of the 24 developed states bar New Zealand.
Hungary has a 'producer subsidy equivalent' of just 8 per cent compared with
an OECD average of 44 per cent, according to 1992 figures.
Budapest's Agriculture Ministry said that the low level of support put
Hungarian farming in a strong position in the event of a Gatt breakthrough.
While most countries would have to cut subsidies, Hungary would be allowed
to maintain the current level of support and competitiveness would therefore
improve, the ministry said.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Portugal Socialists sense poll victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Portuguese voted yesterday in nationwide municipal elections in which
the opposition Socialists were expected to inflict a significant defeat over
the ruling Social Democrats of Prime Minister Anbal Cavaco Silva.
Mr Cavaco Silva accused opposition forces of trying to push the vote beyond
local issues into a national verdict on government performance in the hope
of persuading President Mario Soares, himself a Socialist, to dissolve
parliament and call an early general election before the next scheduled
ballot in October 1995.
Mr Soares would consider calling an early election if the Social Democrats
suffered successive defeats in yesterday's poll and a ballot for the
European parliament in June, according to those close to the president. He
would also take into account the economic and social climate.
The Socialist party distanced itself from the threatening signs coming from
Mr Soares. 'We will not call for a dissolution of parliament even if we win
every council in the country,' guaranteed Mr Antonio Guterres, the Socialist
leader. Instead, the Socialists accused the government of deliberately
dramatising the issue.
'Aware that they face an overriding defeat, the Social Democrats are trying
to convince the country that the municipal elections could affect the
stability of the government in the hope that this will play in their
favour,' said Mr Guterres.
Opinion polls were unanimous in forecasting that the Socialists would extend
the majority of the country's 305 municipal councils that they already held
after a backlash vote against the Social Democrat government in the previous
elections in 1989.
Social Democrat campaign managers say the party should improve its position
in the Alentejo plains of southern Portugal, a traditional Communist
stronghold, and in the south coast Algarve region, until now solidly
Socialist.
But the Socialist and Communist alliance ruling Lisbon is expected to renew
its mandate and Socialist domination of Portugal's second city Oporto is
unlikely to be dented.
Social Democrat officials also admit privately that the Socialists and
Communists are likely to win most other large cities.

FT  13 DEC 93 / End near for US pit strike
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the United Mine Workers of America look set to ratify an
agreement this week to end the seven-month US coal strike. The nation's
biggest coal companies and union leadership agreed on a new five-year
contract in Washington last week.
Both sides have won concessions, although the prolonged strike was costly
for all parties, and particularly for the midwestern coal industry, which is
in a long decline, industry analysts say.
The union appears to have achieved some guarantees that union miners will be
hired when coal companies or their subsidiaries open new mines, said Mr
Rafael Villagran, a Lehman Brothers analyst.
He said the companies gained more flexible work rules, including the right
to schedule seven-day weeks and in some cases 10-hour days. 'The settlement
will certainly be taken positively by investors,' said Mr Villagran, 'and it
should make the UMWA a little stronger. Their representation in the industry
has been dropping, and they needed to stop that. This could help.'
Less than half of the coal in the US is mined by union workers. UMWA
membership has declined from a peak of 400,000 in the 1950s to about 65,000
today. The union risked the strike to gain job security for its members and,
to some extent, a future for itself. Its strategy, a selective strike which
targeted companies with the toughest bargaining positions, split three coal
producers from the employers' bargaining group, the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association.
The strike settlement, however, does not change a fundamental shift away
from the high-sulphur coal mined in the Illinois basin, where the union is
most active. Mr John Mead, director of the Coal Research Centre at Southern
Illinois University, said more midwestern mining jobs were bound to be lost
as utilities, under pressure from environmental constraints, switched
contracts to low-cost, low-sulphur non-union coal mined in Wyoming and other
areas of the west.
'Will the terms of the agreement protect miners in the face of these
changes?' said Mr Mead. 'We don't know.'
The strike had a severe impact on 1993 profits of Peabody Coal, a subsidiary
of Hanson. It also affected Consol, co-owned by DuPont and Rheinbraun,
Ashland Coal and privately-held Zeigler Coal.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (5): Liberalisation pays off
 -Latin American attracts more investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BATTMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many oil companies are taking a renewed interest in Latin America, where the
trend is towards liberalisation of oil sectors and encouragement of foreign
investment.
Mr John Browne, managing director of BP Exploration, confirmed recently that
'investment has come to Latin America because the resource base exists and
because the countries of Latin America have established a very receptive
fiscal and regulatory climate. If that situation is maintained, there is no
obstacle to the fulfilment of Latin America's potential in terms of
production and export capacity'.
But the transformation of Latin America into a region with a unique blend of
foreign private and state involvement is not yet fulfilled. It is not yet
clear that the changes effected can be serve as a model for other regions
seeking to expand their oil and gas sectors.
Its production potential has never been in doubt. US companies in particular
have long been involved in exploration and production, along with several
European oil majors.
The oil shocks of the 1970s and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 served
as a reminder to the US of the strategic importance of alternative fuel
sources, particularly when they are so much closer geographically.
But political risks (in the region which invented oil nationalism) proved
unacceptably high for many companies in the 1970s and 1980s.
Latin America's turnaround started with the spread of economic orthodoxy
which followed the debt shock of the mid-1980s. Governments sought to open
up their economies to make them more competitive, reduce spending and
control inflation as requirements for the restructuring of foreign debt and
to secure much-needed foreign capital investments.
Key aims of the oil and gas industries have been to secure foreign capital
and technological injections not easily available domestically, and
generally to work in partnership with the state company.
Mexico and possibly Brazil are opening up some areas to foreign involvement
while retaining overall control. Other main regional producers are showing
greater flexibility.
Partnership represents the most viable path for Latin America and
potentially for other developing areas. For example, the Venezuelan Congress
recently approved the development with Shell, Exxon and Mitsubishi of
offshore gasfields and export of LNG to the US, at an outlay of Dollars 7bn.
Agreements have also been reached with Conoco and Total, Ituchi and Marubeni
to produce extra heavy crude, with investment outlays of Dollars 3.5bn.
Interest in exploration in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia and
Argentina is currently high.
The Ecuadorean government is shortly to issue exploration licences for 2.2m
hectares. So far, 100 foreign oil companies have expressed interest and 50
have bought detailed documents on the Oriente (Amazon) and offshore blocks.
Oil and gas pipeline contractors ware seeking to benefit from major
construction projects in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela.
At the other extreme, Argentina in 1993 privatised its state oil company
YPF. But this is unlikely to serve as a model for the rest of Latin America.
Although YPF is said to be the oldest state oil company in the world, it has
never been the kind of nationalist symbol that Pemex was for Mexico.
Full privatisation of state oil and gas companies would, if desired, prove
nigh-impossible in most countries. For this reason, Mexico insisted on
retaining Pemex's privileged status when signing the North America Free
Trade Agreement (Nafta). The position of Mexican President Carlos Menem is
also stronger than that of most of his contemporaries.
Success in attracting foreign companies will therefore depend on the terms
of the contracts offered and on governments' willingness to stick to them.
Latin America petroleum specialist Dr Chris Brogan says that if Latin
America is to attract the finance necessary to develop its oil potential,
'it must ensure that contractual terms on offer are as good if not better
than those being offered elsewhere in the world'.
He adds that investors who their fingers badly burnt in the past must be
convinced that contractual terms, once agreed, are not subjected to sudden,
unilateral change.
The need for Latin America to provide the best contracts possible becomes
more acute given difficult operating conditions in many countries.
Governments remain over-bureaucratic and occasionally corrupt, while
exploration and production sites can be in remote areas with poor
communications.
There are high security risks in Colombia, where ultra-leftist guerrillas
prey on the oil and gas sector, and Peru, where Shining Path guerrillas are
not a beaten force. Two failed coups in 1992 in Venezuela did not directly
affect the oil and gas sector but destabilised the country. In Venezuela the
lead-up to the December 3 elections indicated a popular opposition to
neo-liberal solutions which is likely to be echoed elsewhere in Latin
America in 1994.
It is unlikely that this mood change will result in attempts markedly to
change oil and gas policies, though it may limit the extent to which
governments such as Colombia can implement plans to make existing and future
association contracts more competitive.
Furthermore, the extractive industries are under pressure from environmental
and indigenous groups. In Ecuador, the allocation of new oil exploration
blocks in January is prompting increased controversy over the environmental
impact of oil operations, particularly in Amerindian areas. Amerindian
representatives began legal proceedings against Texaco in New York on
November 3 in a bid to win Dollars 1.5bn-worth of compensation for
environmental damage. This has implications for the region as a whole, and
companies can help themselves by strict environmental controls and good
relations with the grassroots in their areas of operation.
In general, nothing succeeds like success. The reawakening of interest in
Latin America was guaranteed in 1992 when a British Petroleum-led consortium
discovered a big field in eastern Colombia, since identified as one of the
Western Hemisphere's largest finds for 20 years.
BP hopes to reach production of 150,000 b/d from Cusiana by the end of 1995
(this would represent a third of national production at today's levels),
rising to 600,000 b/d thereafter. More such oil and gas finds would have a
galvanising effect in the country concerned and sustain interest in Latin
America as a whole.
Under these circumstances, oil and gas companies will continue to tolerate
difficult operating conditions if host governments behave supportively and
avoid arbitrary actions.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (6): Taking the long view -
US majors make the best of a tough situation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like tankers moving calmly over choppy waters, the giant US energy groups
pretend that they float serenely above the turbulence of the world's
troubled oil markets. In reality, their progress is not so smooth.
True, the latest dip in the oil price is unlikely to interrupt the
companies' long-term exploration and production plans - as long as it proves
short-lived. But it will force the oil majors to give a further painful turn
of the screw to the extensive cost-cutting they have already undertaken. And
it will make more unattainable the goal of achieving a satisfactory return
on capital.
Most say their investment plans, while based on an oil price somewhat higher
than the current level, are tested against prices of Dollars 15 a barrel or
less. That makes them able to withstand troughs in the oil market. Nor do
the big oil groups believe prices will stay at present levels for a
sustained period.
'We don't see any deep fundamental change in our view (as a result of the
recent price fall),' says Mr Ken Haley, manager of energy forecasting at
Chevron. 'The market is at the lower end of its long-term sustainable
level,' which Chevron puts at Dollars 18-Dollars 23 a barrel. Mr Alfred
DeCrane, chairman and chief executive of Texaco, also expresses optimism
about the price of oil: 'We haven't bet the store on it going up - but I
haven't sold my stock.'
He adds, though, that in the short term, lower prices mean 'we won't be
getting in the front door what we thought we would be getting'.
The fall in upstream earnings as a result of lower oil prices will put the
energy groups under even greater pressure to husband their cash resources to
support the investments necessary for long-term success. For two reasons,
those investments are likely to get bigger rather than smaller.
First, exploration and development spending is being ploughed into
ever-bigger ventures outside the US in pursuit of the sort of massive
discoveries which will provide long-term returns. Most mature US fields are
no longer worth developing for big companies with large overheads to cover,
while potential new large finds in Alaska or beyond the US's continental
shelf are put out of reach by environmental concerns.
A falling oil price has further reduced the attractions of exploring for oil
in the US. Tax rates on oil production in the US are lower than in most
overseas areas: this means that, when prices fall, the producer suffers
more. In overseas markets, more of that pain is born by the taxpayer (the
opposite is true when prices rise.)
Not surprisingly, with the exception of a handful of giant fields in deep
water areas of the Gulf of Mexico, all the talk in the US now is of the
development work in the former Soviet republics, the East China Sea or the
North Sea. Investment budgets have followed this change in emphasis.
Texaco's capital spending in the US has averaged Dollars 1.77bn a year over
the past five years and is projected to continue unchanged at this level for
the next five. Investment outside the US, by contrast, is expected to rise
from Dollars 1.45bn a year to an average Dollars 2.12bn. Likewise, Chevron
says three quarters of its Dollars 2.6bn capital investment on upstream
activities this year has been spent outside the US.
To support this move overseas, and at the same time cut costs, most US
groups have disposed of marginal on-shore US fields. Texaco had 1,000 US oil
and gas fields three years ago: by the end of next year, the number will be
down to under 500.
The second significant need for cash is in the US, where ever-more demanding
environmental standards are forcing companies to upgrade their refineries
both to produce cleaner fuels and to cut their own emissions.
Few companies think they will be able to recover through higher fuel prices
much of what they spend on revamping their refineries. Chevron, the largest
refiner in the US, has put two refineries up for sale, representing around a
quarter of its US refining capacity.
'It may not make sense to invest in all sites,' says Mr Donald Schmude of
Texaco, which is also reviewing whether it can afford to upgrade all its US
refinery facilities.
In part, the refinery sales are part of a broader rationalisation of the US
refining and marketing system. A flat gasoline market has forced companies
to rethink their marketing strategies, concentrating their service stations
into regional groupings close to their own refineries in an effort to cut
costs and build market share. Service stations or refineries that do not fit
into this pattern have been sold first.
So far, refineries have changed hands rather than close down altogether.
That could change, though, when the next phase of federal rules on gasoline
standards comes into force at the beginning of 1995, says Mr DeCrane of
Texaco: 'the need to spend to keep those refineries open will rise, and
there will be closures of refineries in the US.'
Against a domestic background of shrinking exploration and production and a
downstream business facing significant (and probably irrecoverable)
investment, it is not surprising that the US energy industry is living in
reduced circumstances. By building reserves abroad, though, US oil is laying
down the foundation for a more significant international presence well into
the 21st century.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (2): From China to Mexico -
Explorers target new and old territories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE

<TEXT>
The Tarim basin in northwest China, the Caspian Sea and Azerbaijan are among
the exotic locations which have drawn the attention of the world's oil and
gas companies during the past year as they seek to secure new reserves for
the 21st century.
They and dozens of other remote areas figure prominently in the 'frontier
strategies' under which a growing number of companies are ranging beyond
their traditional operating areas. But the focus on trying to find very
large oil and gas fields in frontier areas has diverted attention from a
surge of renewed interest in mature regions, such as the Gulf of Mexico and
the North Sea.
Advances in both exploration and production technology combined with the
desire to maximise the heavy investment in the infrastructure of such areas
is driving the trend.
It has been most evident in the past year in the Gulf of Mexico, where oil
production began more than 40 years ago. Exploration of the area dropped
sharply in the late 1980s as some of the bigger companies began to look
abroad for new reserves. But buoyant US natural gas prices have attracted a
large number of independent companies to the region.
Their success rate has been enhanced by their ability to gain relatively
cheap access to three-dimensional seismic data. This technique, combined
with the much greater power of the latest generation of computers, has
enabled geologists to 'see' through structures such as salt domes. These
structures had blocked views derived from the earlier two-dimensional
seismic techniques.
The new seismic technology has also helped in the discovery of smaller
satellite fields close to existing platforms. Many of these can then be
tapped by horizontal drilling from an existing platform. The technique can
reach reservoirs as far away as 6km, eliminating in many cases the need and
cost of building a new platform.
Other new technology, such as tension leg platforms, is allowing companies
to move into deeper water. The Mars field, described by Shell and British
Petroleum as the largest discovery in the Gulf of Mexico for the past 20
years, lies in 2,933 feet of water.
Technology has also played a key role in maintaining production in the North
Sea where early fields such as Ekofisk, off Norway, and Brent and Forties in
the UK are being re-engineered to prolong their production life. The
re-engineering of the Brent field, the UK's largest oil producer, by Shell
and Esso, includes a shift in emphasis to gas production. The work, which
will cost Pounds 1.3bn and take five years to complete, will add 10 years to
the field's production life.
Mr John Browne, managing director of BP Exploration, believes the life of
North Sea production could extend well into the next century 'even if prices
never rise again in real terms'. He says that new technology could push
recovery rates as high as 70 per cent of reserves within 20 years, compared
with the 50-55 per cent achieved in only a few fields at present.
Companies are only now beginning to realise the full scope for cost
reductions in the North Sea. The UK Offshore Operators Association, whose
membership includes all 36 companies producing oil and gas in the UK sector
of the North Sea, believes savings of up to 30 per cent in capital costs of
offshore platforms could be made if more attention was given to
standardisation of designs and equipment. A recent report contained a series
of recommendations detailing new codes and practices. It predicted that
substantial cost savings were possible within two or three years if the
basic proposals were implemented.
Mr Browne believes that a 30 per cent cut in capital costs and a 50 per cent
cut in operating costs over the next 20 years 'could raise the total volume
recoverable from the North Sea by 25 per cent - from around 60bn barrels of
oil equivalent to around 75bn'.
The way in which technology and higher productivity can prolong the life of
mature areas is unlikely, however, to lead to any sharp falloff in oil
company interest in frontier areas. But their sheer distance from the
world's main markets and lack of local infrastructure make them a long-term
proposition.
China's Tarim basin, for example, is 2,500 miles from the coast. Studies
suggest it could cost as much as Dollars 6 to move a barrel of oil through a
proposed pipeline to China's main markets. A similar level of transportation
charges is likely in other promising but landlocked areas, such as
Kazakhstan.
The political uncertainty surrounding the future of such countries and the
need to move oil or gas across sometimes unfriendly borders complicates
their development, even if the per barrel cost of producing oil or gas is
attractive.
The growing competition among countries for foreign investment to help
develop their petroleum resources is also likely to exert a strong influence
on where oil companies look next. Much of the interest in the world's more
remote areas can be traced to the withdrawal or exclusion of many western
oil companies from Middle Eastern and Latin American countries as a result
of nationalisation.
There is no prospect that the old concession system in the Middle East will
be revived, but some of the barriers to western oil companies in the region
are being lowered. There were reports this year that Kuwait was discussing
exploration prospects with western companies, while French companies in
particular are positioning themselves to take advantage of opportunities in
Iraq once United Nations sanctions are lifted.
The prospect that western oil companies could become more deeply involved in
the Middle East in years to come has been boosted by the fact that many
countries in the region cannot afford to develop on their own the new
reserves needed to maintain, let alone enlarge, their capacity. The
relatively low cost of much oil in the area has obvious appeal to western
companies, but the political risks of the region remain relatively high
despite the peace agreement between Palestinians and the Israelis.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (3): The pressure rises -
Natural Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Natural gas is undergoing a metamorphosis. Within just a few years it has
shed its status as a nuisance by-product of oil and has donned the mantle of
being the 'noble' fuel.
Shares in oil companies rich in gas reserves have enjoyed stock market
premiums in the past year. Gas distributors in industrialised countries are
increasingly moving into international markets. Deregulation of the industry
in the US has boosted prices and set off a mini-exploration boom in the Gulf
of Mexico. Growing markets in the UK have resulted in mature North Sea oil
fields, such as Brent, being re-engineered as gas producers.
Further afield there has been a proliferation of proposals to build new
pipelines to link remote reserves found in Russia, other former Soviet
states and the Middle East with markets in Europe and Asia.
The rising interest in gas across the world begs the question, however, of
whether companies can actually develop a global strategy for gas along the
lines of the international oil business. For unlike oil, the gas business
varies widely by region. In addition it is not an internationally tradeable
commodity in the sense of oil, which can be easily transported to a variety
of markets in relatively small amounts. The high costs of gas require a
direct physical and contractual link between the production site and
consuming area.
But there is no shortage of companies, mainly from the US and Europe,
chasing the growing list of opportunities. They form three main groups: The
development of specific gas fields for use in power generation schemes. The
number of such projects has grown steadily, with many companies focusing on
Asia, where gas consumption has risen by 126 per cent in the past 10 years
and where electricity shortages have emerged because of rapid economic
growth. The linking of large remote reserves to the main industrialised
consuming countries, especially in Europe and Asia through long,
high-capacity pipelines or by deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The
high cost of such projects usually results in the formation of a consortium
to spread the risks. A good-sized LNG scheme can cost Dollars 5bn to
develop. Pipeline projects can cost even more - the Troll project linking
North Sea gas fields off Norway with six European consuming countries will
cost Dollars 11bn.
The refurbishment of ageing domestic gas supply systems, a number of which
are being privatised.
British Gas, the biggest Western integrated gas company, has decided that
its best growth prospects lie in applying its experience in both upstream
and downstream areas to less regulated international markets.
The company recently sold its Consumers Gas subsidiary in Toronto, the
largest single element of its international holdings grouped under Global
Gas, the international transportation and distribution division. The sale
did not reflect a scaling back of British Gas' international ambitions,
according to Mr Russell Herbert, head of Global Gas. It merely reflected a
change in strategy to concentrate on less mature markets.
A model for future projects, says Mr Herbert, is British Gas's current
refurbishment of the privatised Buenos Aires and Berlin gas supply systems.
Asia looms large in British Gas's expansion plans, with a variety of
exploration and production projects and power generation schemes in
Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Pakistan.
Its largest single project is the Karachaganak field in Kazahkstan, which
could cost British Gas and Agip, the Italian oil company, as much as Dollars
6bn to develop.
A number of other companies known mainly for oil production are significant
forces in global gas markets. Shell, for example, has large gas businesses
in the US, Europe and Asia. Its concentration has been on exploration and
production rather than distribution, a trend which is likely to continue.
Natural gas forms 68 per cent of the proven reserves of Total, the French
company, which is particularly strong in Asia and Europe. US companies such
as Mobil, Exxon and Amoco are also keen to build on their strong gas
reserves.
A number of national gas supply companies, such as Gaz de France, are
seeking to profit internationally from their domestic expertise. The
perceived need to be able to compete internationally was one one of the main
factors behind the deal earlier this year in which Gas Natural, Spain's
national domestic gas distributor 45 per cent owned by Repsol, the state
controlled energy group, bought Enegas, the monopoly industrial gas
supplier, which is fully owned by the state.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (4): Power with
responsibility - Security and moderation are the Saudi aim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the short-term pressures on Saudi Arabia's oil policy, the kingdom
appears determined that these shall not divert the world's biggest oil
exporting country from its longstanding goals of enhancing market stability,
increasing integration of its upstream and downstream operations and
pursuing a strategy designed to assure security of supplies at generally
moderate prices.
But with prices dipping in late November to a five-year low, these pressures
have never been greater on the kingdom since the Gulf war, during which
Saudi Arabia boosted production from 5.4m barrels a day to nearer 9m b/d to
fill the void left by lost Iraqi and Kuwait production. Since then, Saudi
Arabia has stubbornly clung to its expanded share of total Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries output and, despite the recent weakening of
prices, refused to consider cutting output below 8m b/d, its present
production.
At the last ceiling-setting Opec meeting in October, however, the kingdom
held its production level at 8m b/d even while allowing other members to
raise their allocations to meet an expanded official level of 24.52m b/d.
Some analysts interpreted this as the kingdom resuming its pre-Gulf war role
as the organisation's swing producer. But Saudi officials resist the thought
resolutely. 'That is not right at all,' says one. 'No short-term action on
our part should be interpreted as a change of policy.'
While the burdens of Saudi Arabia's budget deficit problem and the intense
pressures of hard-pressed Opec colleagues have combined recently to raise
the importance of price in the calculus of Saudi oil policymakers - 'it's an
important, key issue', says a senior official - Saudi Arabia remains
committed more fundamentally to assuring that the world receives secure
supplies of oil at prices which will not discourage its use in favour of
other energy sources.
Accordingly, the kingdom has proceeded apace with expansion plans at Saudi
Aramco which will see the world's biggest integrated oil company capable of
sustained production of 10m b/d by the middle of next year. Present ceiling
capacity, according to Aramco staff in Dhahran, lies at around 9.4m b/d.
Much of the initial de-bottlenecking which allowed for the expansion was
undertaken during the surge to boost output during the Gulf war,
accelerating plans laid before the conflict. Costlier work to bring on
stream new fields south of Riyadh, notably the super light crudes in the
Hawtah field, will be complete by next year. The total cost of the expansion
will be around Dollars 15bn-Dollars 17bn according to Aramco staff.
Exploration is also continuing, with Aramco concentrating on areas around
the western province and the Red Sea coastal plain. 'We're essentially going
back to areas explored first in the 30s and 40s with better technology,'
says an Aramco official.
But it was another event this year which consolidated Aramco's position as
perhaps the world's biggest oil group. The company could already boast being
the world's biggest exporter and its custodianship of the kingdom's 258bn
barrels of recoverable crude gives it unchallenged reserves - more than a
quarter of the world's known oil. In June, however, the government announced
Aramco's merger with Samarec, which was then the state-run refining and
marketing arm.
Although the act was entirely consistent with the kingdom's long professed
policy of integrating its oil industry, both to achieve cost efficiency and
to assure greater market stability, it nevertheless took industry executives
by surprise.
In particular, many wondered why Mr Hisham Nazer, the oil minister, took a
step which essentially eliminated Samarec as a distinct entity after having
made such efforts to define the group's corporate identity. Saudi officials,
however, prefer to characterise the step as simply one in a natural
progression towards a fully integrated oil industry, saying that the timing
was 'irrelevant' and that Samarec had always been viewed as a provisional
entity.
But many oil executives in the kingdom believe the move was designed to
impose on the kingdom's refining and marketing operations what is
universally considered to be Aramco's tighter and more efficient management
ethos. 'Samarec was run like a government department not a top-notch
corporation,' says a US oil official.
Six months into the merger and the administrative union appears almost
complete. Aramco has subsumed most of Samarec's operations into a new
'business centre' headed by Mr Abdelaziz Hokail, who headed a 100-strong
task force which managed the dovetailing in July. So far, very few of
Samarec's 11,000 staff have lost their jobs and those who have, say Aramco
staff, have gone voluntarily.
The result is to endow Aramco with a considerable addition to its refining
capacity, which before the merger lay solely in the Aramco-managed 300,000
b/d Ras Tanurah refinery north of its Dhahran headquarters. Now Aramco
manages the 394,000 b/d capacity at the kingdom's three domestic refineries
in Riyadh, Jeddah and Yanbu and the kingdom's interests in the joint venture
Yanbu (250,000b/d) and Jubail (240,000b/d) export refineries. It also
assumes the state's interest in the 325,000 b/d Rabigh plant, jointly owned
with Mr John Lakis, the Greek businessman.
Aramco staff sought to stress throughout the merger that none of Samarec's
current operations would be affected - a promise oil executives outside the
group say has been largely honoured. However, the stamp of new Aramco
management has already had a marked effect on what had been Samarec's
ambitious future planning.
A Dollars 4bn multi-stage plan to upgrade quality at all the previously
Samarec-run refineries was immediately placed under review by the Aramco
managment, and there it has remained for the time being. Foster Wheeler, the
US engineering consultants who had been hired to oversee the Samarec plan,
were released. Aramco officials have said only that an upgrade of some form
will eventually proceed, something many in the industry agree is necessary.
But to date the sole specific upgrading project is that being overseen by
Brown and Root, the US engineers, to enhance quality at the Ras Tanurah
plant - a Dollars 1-Dollars 1.2bn project which will be under way early next
year.
Meanwhile, Aramco's ambitions further to integrate its international
operations took a knock in early November when long publicised plans for a
Dollars 10bn joint venture refining project with a trio of Japanese oil
companies fell foul of internal disagreement among the Japanese partners and
was cancelled.
The project would have further consolidated Aramco's aim of securing
supplies of its crude to refining contracts close to its main consumer
markets. The policy began in 1988 with Aramco's 50-50 venture with Texaco,
creating Star Petroleum to serve markets in the US eastern seaboard. A 35
per cent share in Ssangyong, the South Korean oil group, followed in 1991
with the same intent. The Japanese deal had been seen as the next natural
step.
However, Saudi officials say that talks are advanced with two southeast
Asian oil companies to replace the cancelled project with one of equivalent
scale and scope. One of the potential partners is understood to be Nippon
Oil, one of the three Japanese groups in the original consortium.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (1): Gas becomes the jewel in
the crown - Oil prices, which fell 20 per cent this year, may suffer even
steeper falls once Iraq comes back on stream. But gas, once the oil
industry's poor relation, is now the star performer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mood swings are nothing new to the world's oil and gas industry. Its history
is writ large with extreme movements in prices and a supply situation that
can fluctuate rapidly between shortfalls and surplus.
To some observers the 20 per cent slump in oil prices this year may be seen
as merely a temporary blip. Advocates of this argument say demand and supply
is nearly in balance, and that oil prices are likely to edge back up to
average Dollars 17-Dollars 18 next year. The most recent price falls, they
believe, reflect over-nervous financial markets, which have reacted badly to
persistently low demand in the main consuming countries at a time of
particularly plentiful oil supplies.
But others warn that today's depressed prices may be just the first phase of
a deeper collapse.
They note that crude oil prices have fallen by an average of 9 per cent a
year since 1991, with few positive factors on the horizon.
Traders are beset with reasons why oil prices could fall further. There is
the prospect of even greater amounts of oil becoming available next year
from a resurgent North Sea and other producers outside the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
There is also considerable scope for market volatility in the run-up to the
re-emergence of Iraqi oil exports, possibly as early as the second half of
1994 if Baghdad meets United Nations demands over the long-term monitoring
of industry with military potential.
Pessimistic observers say such conditions could even prompt the benchmark
Brent Blend to fall below Dollars 10 a barrel - a level last seen in the
price collapse of 1986 - although in real terms prices are already at those
levels.
The major oil companies had been scurrying off in search of new supplies of
relatively cheap oil. That search has been fuelled by the opening up in
recent years of large parts of the world previously out-of-bounds to the
industry, including the former Soviet Union and China.
But much of the industry's current capital spending is still concentrated in
well-known areas.
This is due in part to the application of new seismic and drilling
technology. This is occurring both in new areas, just being opened to
exploration, as well as in mature regions such as the North Sea and the Gulf
of Mexico, whose original development can be traced to earlier periods of
high oil prices.
Such techniques are being used by both the major companies and a growing
band of independents to add substantially to the life of many existing
fields and producing regions.
Such strategies have the added benefit of maximising the investment made
over the years in costly infrastructure such as platforms, pipelines and
terminals. For the big integrated oil companies, however, the recent decline
in oil prices and the knock-on effect on their share prices has taken much
of the gloss off such achievements.
Suddenly the themes put forward by both the US and European majors and which
so impressed the markets earlier this year - successful reductions in
overheads and a renewed focus on core businesses - no longer seem so
convincing. Sceptical investors wonder what will happen to the majors' cash
flow if average prices next year are closer to the current level of Dollars
14 a barrel, rather than the Dollars 18-Dollars 20 a barrel to which a
number of companies have successfully adjusted.
Weak oil and share prices would also affect the search for ever-cheaper and
bigger reserves in the world's frontier areas.
Exploration efforts in remote areas of China and the countries of the former
Soviet Union are in their early stages. The majors have committed large
amounts of skilled manpower, but their capital costs are so far relatively
small. That could soon change, however, as projects in those areas become
serious competitors for scarce development funds, say analysts.
The scale of such undertakings is illustrated by a recent estimate by Chase
Manhattan Bank that western companies could be spending more than Dollars
5bn a year on exploration and development projects in the former Soviet
Union within a 'couple of years, and much more in five to 10 years'.
The integrated majors have downstream profits to fall back on when prices
weaken, a factor much in evidence in third quarter results. But chronic
refining over-capacity in Europe threatens to undercut margins, while the
recession in Europe and Japan continues to dampen final demand.
The independent exploration companies have no downstream buffer to fall back
on. A prolonged period of price weakness could not only cut into new
exploration and development spending. It could also trigger off an
acquisition hunt by bigger cash-rich companies keen to secure sound assets
at bargain prices.
The financial pressures imposed on the corporate sector by low oil prices
are nothing, however, to those being felt by the 12 members of Opec. The
extent of the potential damage is highlighted by the fact that for every
annualised dollar fall in the oil price, member states lose a combined
Dollars 5bn in annual revenues.
Opec's overall oil revenues have fallen steadily in the first three quarters
of this year. The most recent price falls mean they could reach a level not
seen since before the Kuwaiti crisis of 1990, according to a recent study by
the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies. Even Saudi Arabia, the
dominant producer, is experiencing a budgetary crisis.
The failure or inability of many Opec members to diversify their economies
and reduce their dependence on oil revenues has compounded the pain induced
by the price falls.
It also raises the spectre of possible social unrest in the most vulnerable
Opec countries, such as Iran and Nigeria, whose non-oil domestic economies
are performing poorly.
The oil industry is looking to Opec to stabilise the market with production
cuts. But the organisation faces a dilemma, according Gulf Arab officials. A
modest cut from its current output ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day might
send a positive signal that Opec can fine-tune production to suit very
short-term demand. But it would also cause some members to cheat on their
individual production quotas, say the Gulf officials, thereby triggering
further price falls.
Opec's decision in November to maintain the present production ceiling into
the new year was also based on a belief that the demand will increase,
either through bad weather in the industrialised world or as a result of
cheap prices encouraging the greater use of oil in those economies which are
growing.
But the decision also reflected Opec anger that independent producers are
nibbling away at the organisation's market share.
Opec no longer wants to play the role of swing producer, say officials, and
a production cut would simply hasten the gains being made by non-Opec
producers.
The decision not to budge was also a reflection of the reluctance on the
part of Saudi Arabia and other large Opec states to cut quotas in advance of
Iraqi exports being readmitted into the production ceiling, probably by the
second half of next year.
An emergency meeting will be called as soon as the UN gives the go-ahead for
renewed Iraqi exports. It could prove to be one of the most contentious in
Opec history given the antagonism between Iraq and its Gulf neighbours.
Iraq, which has the world's second largest reserves, is adamant that it
should be allowed to return to the export markets with a large quota. But
that would require deep cuts in the quotas of other members, most notably
Saudi Arabia, at a time when their need for oil revenues is rising.
The pessimistic mood which has gripped the oil industry has shown no signs
of infecting the gas sector. Gas is increasingly being viewed as the most
environmentally benign fuel, a label which is ensuring a high degree of
interest in developed markets such as Europe.
In October the first gas was delivered to continental Europe from fields off
Norway under the Troll agreement, the largest commercial contract in the
history of the petroleum industry.
A number of pipeline proposals are under consideration to link continental
Europe with new reserves. These include the possible construction of an
inter-connector between the UK and Belgium, as well as additional lines from
Russia and Norway.
In the US, newly-deregulated markets have resulted in higher prices, which
in turn have persuaded a number of companies to explore for new reserves.
Elsewhere, and especially in Asia, gas-fired power generation schemes are
seen as one of the fastest and cheapest ways to make up from shortages of
electricity.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Risk and Reward: Joy on hold until December contract expires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Christmas looms, a fund manager's thoughts often turn to locking in
profits. End-of-year bonuses always set pulses racing - especially this
year, when dividends and share price rises in the London market have
provided a combined return of around 20 per cent. If anything untoward
happens between now and the end of the year, it will be too late to repair
the damage, and investors and traders are beginning to feel the need to
squirrel away their gains.
Consequently, there will be a sigh of relief after this week's all-important
expiry of the FT-SE 100 futures contract for December. By 10.30am on Friday,
the quarterly miracle will have occurred: the price of the contract will
match the price of the underlying stock market and the contract will expire.
However, four full trading days before expiry, some dealers feel a real
miracle will be needed. The December contract has experienced sharp rises, a
surge of overseas buying, and big movements in technical factors such as
premiums and open interest.
The futures market operates either as an easy way into the stock market or
as a hedge against potential losses. Institutions such as pension funds or
insurance groups buy a basket of shares representing the FT-SE 100 index,
and marketmakers who sell those shares will buy futures to cover themselves.
In a perfect world, the futures contract has a nominal value slightly above
the FT-SE 100 index. This 'fair value premium' represents the interest that
would have been earned from having funds in the bank, minus the cash that
would have been lost in terms of dividends. If the premium moves away from
fair value, arbitrageurs will capitalise on the spread. For example, if fair
value is 10 and the futures contract moves to a premium of 20 the 'arbs'
will sell the futures contract and buy the cash market.
Large UK institutions have discovered the appeal of buying futures first and
picking up the shares later.
Also, US investors have poured money into European markets this year and
have often used the futures markets as their point of entry. Dealers
estimate that US institutions, which are much more aware of the potential of
derivatives markets than their UK counterparts, represent half the business
in the London contract.
The appeal of the futures market was underlined after the Budget. Investors
funnelled cash into the London stock market. Such was the demand that buyers
were unable to obtain equities and bought futures contracts instead. When
there should have been no premium, according to most dealers' calculations,
the futures contract was some 30 points higher than the stockmarket.
Mr Nigel Croft, derivatives analyst with Kleinwort Benson, says: 'We haven't
seen the futures at such a high level for the whole of this year and most of
last. Once it starts to go we could see it fall very quickly.'
The demand is highlighted by the exceptionally high level of open interest,
a figure that represents both the number of long positions and the number of
short positions in the market. By the close of dealing on Friday there were
still around 45,500 open positions.
That figure must be closed out by Friday morning. Long-term investors will
let the contracts expire and collect stocks.
With the stock market near its record high, it could take astute
salesmanship to persuade some funds to add to their weightings, and the
pressure to settle is expected to result in a volatile market. There is
still a lot of shuffling to be done.

FT  13 DEC 93 / International Company News: Nynex to reduce staff by
'several thousand'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nynex, the Baby Bell telephone company serving the north-eastern US, plans
to cut 'several thousand' jobs within three years. However, it denied
reports that up to 22,000 of the 69,000 in its telecommunications division
would go. It has already shrunk its payroll by about 13 per cent in the past
two years.
Nynex said the company had made it clear that it intended to reduce its
costs by between 30 per cent and 40 per cent before the end of 1996. The
company has yet to put a figure on reductions required.
Most national and regional telephone companies have been cost-cutting or
restructuring to survive an increasingly competitive environment.
Nynex is likely to face opposition from telecommunications unions over its
plans to reduce its workforce. Yesterday, the president of the
Communications Workers of America said the union would not tolerate any plan
which forced employees off the payroll. In 1989, a dispute over wages and
benefits led to a strike at Nynex that lasted 17 weeks.

FT  13 DEC 93 / International Company News: S Korea instructs telecom
bidders to form consortium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South Korean communications ministry has ordered competing bidders for
the nation's second cellular telephone project to form a single consortium
to operate the system.
Foreign partners will be allowed a 20 per cent stake in the consortium,
which will compete against the state-owned Korea Mobile Telecom (KMT).
But the government also decided last Friday to privatise KMT. The
state-supported Korea Telecom, the country's leading telecommunications
operator, will reduce its 64 per cent interest in KMT to 19 per cent by
selling its shares to domestic companies.
The Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), the country's main business
organisation, has been appointed to select consortium members within two
months.
The second cellular telephone project was announced in 1991, and the
government last year held a licence bid that involved six competing Korean
consortia and 11 foreign partners, including British Telecom.
The licence was awarded to a consortium led by Sunkyong, the country's
fifth-largest business group. Other leading contenders included Pohang Iron
and Steel (Posco) and Kolan, a textile group. The Sunkyong bid was supported
by the UK's Vodafone, GTE of the US and Hong Kong-based Hutchison.
But the government then rescinded the decision because critics charged that
nepotism was involved in the selection process, since the son of the
Sunkyong chairman is married to the daughter of South Korea's then-president
Roh Tae-woo.
Controversy may continue over the new contract award since the FKI is headed
by the Sunkyong chairman, Mr Chey Jong-hyon.
Analysts also believe the competing bidders may find it to difficult to
co-operate on the project. If it proves impossible to form a consortium, the
government will then select applicants and allot equal equity.
Telecommunications companies will be barred from participating in the
consortium as part of an anti-monopoly policy. An independent management
team will be appointed to operate the carrier without interference from the
consortium's shareholders.
In privatising KMT, the government said that it would allow any one company
to buy one-third of the carrier, which would give it management rights.

FT  13 DEC 93 / International Company News: Ford promotes founder's
great-grandson Edsel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford has appointed Mr Edsel Ford II, the great-grandson of the auto group's
founder, Mr Henry Ford, a vice-president of the company.
Analysts said the promotion of Mr Ford, 44, and currently president and
chief operating officer of Ford Motor Credit, the group's finance unit,
suggests the management may be grooming him for the top job at Ford.
However, analysts said it was unlikely Mr Ford would succeed the current
chairman, Mr Alexander Trotman, who is due to retire in the late 1990s. This
was because of his lack of experience in senior management.
Mr Ford joined the company in 1974, and worked in product planning and
marketing before taking over at Ford Credit in 1991.
Mr Ford has a good chance of becoming chairman because 40 per cent of the
company's voting stock is controlled by the Ford family, and three members
of the family sit on the board of directors. Fords have run the company for
all but 13 years of its 90-year history.

Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of the country's leading banks, following
the strong domestic demand for shares in Credito Italiano.
The Credito Italiano deal involves the privatisation of the 67 per cent
stake owned by the IRI state holding company. When allocations for the
transaction, expected to be up to seven times oversubscribed, are made on
Wednesday, retail applicants will be pared back to a maximum of 2,500 shares
each.
Meanwhile, investors who sought to buy shares in the latter part of the
application period, which closed ahead of schedule on Wednesday, are not
expected to receive any stock.
The call to bring forward the BCI sale has been influenced by the strong
interest in Credito Italiano and the pace of political developments in Rome.
The original timing for BCI's privatisation at the beginning of April has
been overshadowed by the growing chance that general elections will be held
in late March.
Bankers have warned against scheduling the privatisation in the immediate
aftermath of the poll. The election is likely to return a highly divided
parliament and trigger a period of considerable uncertainty in Italian
politics in the short term.
As a result, the government is thinking about bringing forward the deal to
the second half of February. That would leave insufficient time for the
planned simultaneous listing of BCI stock in the US, but would otherwise be
technically feasible, according to one banker.
'The US listing could be done subsequently, and the likely reduction in US
demand as a result will probably be immaterial in view of the strength of
domestic retail interest in privatisations shown by Credito Italiano,' he
said.
The biggest obstacle to the new timing could come from a clash with the
scheduled sale of Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the big Rome-based financial
services group.
The treasury is planning to sell up to 30 per cent of IMI's shares in early
February 1994. Although BCI and IMI have markedly different specialisations,
and the two privatisations are expected to appeal to differing investors,
any attempt to sell the two banks almost simultaneously, 'could be more than
Italy's privatisation programme could bear', said one banker.
Surprisingly, neither the government nor IRI appears to have considered
bringing the IMI deal forward, or swapping it in the privatisation queue
with BCI, which is likely to raise considerably more cash for the
hard-pressed treasury. However, Mr Luigi Arcuti, IMI chairman, indicated at
the weekend the bank might try to bring forward its privatisation.
Separately, IMI announced that net profits in the first nine months of this
year were L376bn (Dollars 224m), while total assets at the end of September
amounted to L72,430bn.

FT  13 DEC 93 / International Company News: Ambroveneto to control Sicilian
bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), a leading Italian bank, is extending
into southern Italy by buying control of Societa Banche Siciliane, a small
Sicilian bank.
Ambroveneto is paying about L85bn (Dollars 51m) for 69.2 per cent of SBS,
held by Istituto Centrale di Banche e Banchieri. It will purchase a further
9 per cent from the minority shareholders who own the rest of the stock.
The acquisition will allow Ambroveneto, which is concentrated in northern
Italy, to break into the underdeveloped Sicilian market. SBS has 29 branches
and 300 employees across the island.
This purchase follows the acquisition last year of Citibank's retail banking
operations, concentrated in the Naples area. Milan-based Ambroveneto has
grown rapidly in recent years, and now has 500 branches nationwide.

booking row ends

<TEXT>
Canadian Airlines International and American Airlines have settled their
dispute with the Gemini computerised reservations system, bringing the two
carriers within reach of a long-delayed alliance.
With the threatened litigation no longer an issue, the link between American
and Canadian now appears virtually assured of being consummated early next
year. A Canadian Airlines official said that 'it's down to the final details
on Gemini'.
Under the proposed alliance, which was first mooted two years ago,
American's parent company, AMR, will inject CDollars 246m (USDollars 186.3m)
into Canadian in return for a 25 per cent voting interest. A key condition
of the deal is that Canadian sever its links with Gemini, and instead join
the Sabre reservation system owned by American's parent, AMR Corp.
Canadian's attempts to withdraw from Gemini have, up to now, been strongly
resisted by the other shareholders, Air Canada and Covia, a unit of United
Airlines. They have contended that Gemini would be fatally weakened, leaving
Sabre with a virtual monopoly of the Canadian travel market.
Mr Paul Nelson, Gemini chief executive, said yesterday many travel agents
who use the system had urged it to settle its litigation against Canadian
and AMR. The parties have agreed to keep details of the settlement secret.
Canadian and Air Canada last month appointed a mediator to help negotiate
the terms of dissolving Gemini. The deadline for completion of the talks was
extended earlier this week to December 20. Air Canada is expected to drop
its objections to Canadian leaving Gemini in exchange for an agreement to
rejig the two carriers' international routes.
Mr Ben Mikula, analyst at Midland Walwyn in Montreal, predicted that
'there'll be a series of quid pro quos', with Air Canada gaining access to
some of Canadian's lucrative trans-Pacific routes, and a rationalisation of
the two airlines' trans-Atlantic flights.
AMR originally set a December 31 deadline for the deal with Canadian, but
numerous delays have forced Canadian to request an extension. The
financially-strapped airline also plans to ask governments and creditors for
bridging finance.

FT  13 DEC 93 / International Company News: Sale of Renault to go ahead as
planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of Renault will go ahead as planned in spite of the
failure of its merger with the car and truck activities of Volvo of Sweden,
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said yesterday.
In an interview on French television, Mr Longuet said the privatisation date
would be set by the cabinet, but that it could still take place in the
second half of next year.
The timing of the privatisation of the combined group was one of the
principal concerns of Swedish investors, whose opposition to the deal forced
Volvo to abandon the merger.
Mr Longuet said the collapse of the merger did not threaten Renault and that
the state-owned car group 'can live on its own'. However, he added that
Renault would continue to seek international alliances to strengthen its
position in the world car market.
The development of Renault's strategy was a matter for the car group's
management, said Mr Longuet. 'It is up to the company to establish its
projects.'
Mr Longuet also said the state was likely to retain between 10 and 15 per
cent of the shares in Elf Aquitaine, the oil group due to be privatised
early next year.
In the case of Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer manufacturer, Mr
Longuet said the government would consider privatisation 'when the horizon
is clearer'.

Creditanstalt, the Austrian bank which has invested Sch2bn (Dollars 1657m)
in developing its eastern European banking network since 1989, has opened
Poland's first foreign-owned stockbroking house.
Mr Guido Schmidt Chiari, the bank chairman, said yesterday Creditanstalt
thought Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics and Hungary would be 'the
growth area in Europe for the next few decades'.
Sweden's OM group has agreed with a consortium of Czech companies to set up
an options and futures market in Prague. It is the company's second venture
into eastern Europe since establishing a futures and options exchange in
Bratislava in Slovakia earlier this year, writes Christpher Brown-Humes in
Stockholm.
The new market will be called the Prague Options and Futures Exchange, and
will allow investors in Czech companies to manage the risks associated with
equity investments. The Czech Republic has a stock market with a daily
volume of Kcs460m (Dollars 15m).

FT  13 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hanson indicates the next chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson's annual report has spelt out for the first time that Mr Derek Bonham
is expected to succeed Lord Hanson as chairman.
In his statement, Lord Hanson said 'the appointment of Derek Bonham as
deputy chairman indicates the board's succession plans'.
Mr Bonham, chief executive since April 1992, was made deputy chairman last
month, and the stock market had taken this to mean that he would succeed
Lord Hanson, who is 71 and due to retire in 1997. Mr Bonham is 50.
Lord Hanson received a modest pay increase, from Pounds 1.35m to Pounds
1.36m, after suffering a cut from Pounds 1.38m in 1992.
The group also referred to a 'tentative agreement' between the mineworkers
union and the coal producers in the US, reached on December 7. It said,
'hopefully this will lead to an end to the US coal strike'. The strike,
which began in February, cost Hanson Pounds 125m in the year to
end-September.
The accounts show Hanson made provisions of Pounds 481m on acquisitions,
most relating to Quantum Chemical Corporation which was bought on the last
day of the financial year.
This was a much lower level of provisions than was made for the acquisition
of Beazer in 1992 and Peabody in 1990, which required substantial provisions
for environmental and health related benefits. In 1992 provisions on
acquisitions totalled Pounds 1.69bn and in 1990 they were Pounds 2.1bn.
There was a rise of Pounds 956m in provisions to Pounds 5.82bn, with
exchange rate movements alone adding Pounds 823m to the total. Provisions
utilised totalled Pounds 530m, partly offset by Pounds 199m of provisions
set up during the year, most of which related to pensions and employee
obligations.
Hanson maintained its Pounds 100,000 contribution to the Conservative party
and Pounds 15,000 to the Centre for Policy Studies. It gave Pounds 3.3m to
charity around the world.

FT  13 DEC 93 / UK Company News: South African bank to invest Pounds 13m in
Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of South Africa's largest banks will today announce a Pounds 13m
investment in a Lloyd's insurance subsidiary, providing a much needed fillip
for the insurance market's initiative to attract corporate capital.
Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (Absa), a bank holding company with
insurance interests, will invest about Pounds 6.5m in Absa Syndicate
Investments (Absil), which will support about 12 syndicates with some Pounds
13m in capacity.
Mr Louw Van Wyk, managing director of Absa Financial Services, said the bank
already had a long-standing association with Lloyd's through its insurance
and broking activities.
Absil will work with the Wellington Members' Agency, one of the market's
largest, which looks after the affairs of 600 Names. Mr Julian Avery,
chairman of Wellington, said the Absa decision was particularly encouraging
following the recent failure of a number of capital raising efforts.
Last Monday Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, and Johnson &amp; Higgins,
the insurance brokers, announced the withdrawal of their London Market
Investors vehicle, which had aimed to raise Dollars 300m (Pounds 201m) for
Lloyd's.
Three UK trusts have also failed to gather support - Minories Investment
Trust, Nelson Lloyd's Trust and Johnson Fry Corporate Insurance Recovery
Fund.
Another US fund, Lutine Capital Corporation, has experienced difficulties in
persuading enough US investors to support another Dollars 300m initiative
and could fail to meet its minimum capital target of Dollars 200m by a
December 15 deadline.
Overall however, investment trusts and insurance companies have committed
more than Pounds 860m in capital to the Lloyd's market, with Lloyd's easily
exceeding its initial target of Pounds 500m.
Absa was formed in early 1991, following an agreement to merge the interests
of the former Allied, United and Volkskas banking groups.

FT  13 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sanderson scores 19% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sanderson Electronics' success by proxy was boosted last year as Sheffield
Wednesday, the football team it sponsors to the tune of Pounds 250,000 a
year, reached the finals of both the FA and Coca Cola cups.
Now the company, a software house specialising in open systems applications,
has scored a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.8m to
Pounds 3.32m for the year to September 30 as the group achieved its 10th
consecutive year of revenue growth.
Mr Paul Thompson, chairman, said the increase in profits had been achieved
despite difficult trading.
Earnings per share rose 6 per cent to 25.4p (24p) despite a higher tax
charge, and the dividend, already paid, is 9.9p (9p). The interim dividend
for 1993-94 is unchanged at 5.4p.
Turnover was 10 per cent higher at Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 21.4m).
The company has now reduced its shareholding in General Automation of the US
from 49 per cent to below 19 per cent and a further reduction is likely in
line with Sanderson's strategy of concentrating on its core UK business.
Gearing has been cut to 90 per cent (147 per cent); interest fell from
Pounds 461,000 to Pounds 267,000.

<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Corporation, the financial services and life insurance company,
yesterday announced that it was to more than double the funds earmarked for
venture capital investment to Pounds 500m.
The new allocation is a tiny proportion of the Pounds 60bn the Prudential
holds under management, but could provide a substantial boost to the total
funds available for investment in smaller companies as they emerge from
recession.
Mr Paul Brooks, head of Prudential Venture Managers, said: 'This probably
puts us in the number one slot for cash available for investment in smaller
companies. The Pru is saying we are open for business.'
He said he expected the Pounds 500m would be spent over the next three to
five years, and most would go towards management buy-outs in the UK. This
year Venture Managers has only invested about Pounds 50m in new funds in
capital venture.
Prudential currently has Pounds 210m of venture capital invested at cost,
mostly injected over the past six years. It realised Pounds 110m from Pounds
40m invested at cost in the year to date.
Mr Brooks said the money would be diverted from the proceeds of investments
across Prudential and would not be at the expense of any other single
activity. He said his only target was to outperform returns on the FT-A
All-Share index.
Venture Managers invests in companies capitalised within the Pounds 10m to
Pounds 500m range, with most in the Pounds 20m to Pounds 150m range. It does
not generally deal with start-ups, or with the insurance or property
sectors.

Winchester Multimedia, formed seven months ago by a team led by Mr Gary
Smith, is seeking to raise Pounds 1.34m by the issue of 2.5m new shares at
60p each.
The new shares will account for 32 per cent of the enlarged equity of the
company which, on the basis of the offer price, will be valued at Pounds
4.56m.
The issue is sponsored by Allied Provincial Securities and JP Jenkins will
make a market in the shares, providing deals on the basis of matched
bargains under Rule 535(2) of the Stock Exchange.
The company is trying to build up a portfolio of intellectual property
rights in the entertainment sector.

FT  13 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Contract problems hit Triplex Lloyd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Triplex Lloyd tumbled 11 per cent, from 144p to 128p on Friday
after the industrial engineering group announced reverses at ED Hinchcliffe,
the curtain walling company in its engineering division.
Losses of Pounds 2.3m at Hinchcliffe, caused by overshooting of costs on
three contracts, meant that group pre-tax profits for the six months to
end-September were cut by 56 per cent to Pounds 1.45m, against Pounds 3.31m.
The losses wiped out operating profits of the company's growing power and
automotive divisions. The overall figures were ameliorated by the inclusion
of property profits arising from the sale and leaseback of a Sterling
International Technology plant.
Earnings per share dropped to 1.6p (4.6p). Nevertheless, the directors are
maintaining the interim - and now uncovered - dividend at 2.5p, seeing the
Hinchcliffe loss as what Mr Colin Cooke, chairman, described as 'a setback
against otherwise steady progress.'
Problems at Hinchcliffe, detected as it reached the closing stages of the
contracts and likely to drag the second half results down by Pounds 800,000,
led to the postponement of plans for a new acquisition by the automotive
division.
Triplex Lloyd has been investing in both its automotive and power divisions.
With the disposal of Thermovitrine, a glass processor, it has started to
sell its building products companies. Offers have been received for all of
them except Hinchcliffe, where a severe restructuring is taking place.
Overall group turnover was virtually unchanged at Pounds 81.4m.

FT  13 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Fund managers shift investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fund managers are increasing their investment in UK and US equities at the
expense of Japan and continental Europe, according to the latest Smith New
Court/Gallup survey released today.
In a poll conducted last week of 85 institutions, 27 per cent said they
would be increasing their holdings of UK equities in December, compared with
none when asked in November.
The proportion planning to increase investment in US equities was 17 per
cent, the first positive figure since February this year. Those institutions
intending to raise their Japanese equity holdings fell from 17 per cent in
November to 8 per cent this month.
Just 1 per cent said they would increase continental European holdings,
compared with 21 per cent in November. Increased investment was most likely
in French equities, and least likely for German shares.
The fund managers on average believed there would be further improvements to
the UK economy over the next year, with the UK economy growing at 2.6 per
cent and 2.7 per cent in 1995.
They forecast inflation of 3.3 per cent by the end of 1994 and expected base
rates to be further reduced to 5 per cent in the same period. They predicted
earnings per share would grow by about 15 per cent in 1994.

FT  13 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Keller for market valued at Pounds 60m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Keller, the former engineering subsidiary of GKN, is planning to come to the
market next year in a flotation valuing the company at Pounds 60m.
The specialist underground foundations business, acquired from GKN three
years ago in a Pounds 26m management buy-out, aims to use the flotation to
finance overseas expansion.
Projects in North America and continental Europe already account for more
than 80 per cent of Keller's profits and the group wants to increase its
share of the international construction market, particularly in Germany.
Kleinwort Benson, which is handling the flotation, expects a market launch
in the spring, although the size of the share issue has not been decided.
Mr Jim Hamilton, head of corporate finance at Kleinwort Benson, said
yesterday that fresh finance would enable Keller to exploit construction
opportunities in east Germany, where large-scale infrastructure
modernisation is under way.
The company is also understood to be considering an acquisition in the US,
where it has a base near Chicago.
Strong international demand helped Keller to increase profits last year to
Pounds 7.3m, up 65 per cent in the three years since the buy-out.

FT  13 DEC 93 / William Hill debt refinance extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A meeting of the Brent Walker banks has given Standard Chartered and Lloyds
Bank more time to complete the refinancing of William Hill's Pounds 370m of
debt.
The lead banks have repeatedly missed deadlines to agree a refinancing of
the loans which are due for repayment on March 1. They are said to be still
a long way short of raising the money.
However, one hardened follower of the Brent Walker saga noted that the banks
had never met a deadline in the three years since the leisure and property
group began talks with banks about a refinancing of the group.
Lenders to Brent Walker fear that if William Hill were sold, the parent
company's future would be bleak. Brent Walker's refinancing, finalised in
March 1992, was based on the retention of two cash-generating businesses,
the Pubmaster pub chain and the betting shops. Disposals of other activities
have been slow to materialise.
The Brent Walker board is believed to be anxious to retain William Hill
rather than be forced by a failure to refinance into a float or sale of the
betting shop business.
Meanwhile, the merchant banks appointed in August to sponsor a possible
flotation of William Hill have been unable to begin the pre-marketing
process considered essential.
It is understood that advisers, who had earlier said a decision on the float
was necessary by the end of November, have now said it could be achieved if
they got the go-ahead at the beginning of next year.
The William Hill syndicate is in a strong position to demand repayment since
the business is worth considerably more than the debt.
Either a float, estimated to raise over Pounds 500m, or a trade sale for the
Pounds 470m offered by a group of venture capitalists, would comfortably
repay the loan.
While the William Hill lenders could be persuaded to wait a few weeks for
repayment, that deadline cannot slip far beyond the beginning of March.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Banks criticise new Basle committee plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading banks have stepped up their criticism of proposals from the
Basle-based committee of international regulators to make them set aside
additional capital to cover risks in foreign exchange, securities and
derivatives trading.
A report from the Institute of International Finance, the Washington-based
group representing 175 international banks, said the proposals would make it
harder to compare banks' financial soundness.
It is the strongest criticism of the proposals on market, foreign exchange
and interest risk which the Basle committee put forward this year to
complement capital adequacy rules for credit risk.
Produced by a group including several banks most heavily involved in
securities and derivatives trading, the report says a 'significant weakness'
of the proposals is that they could undermine the clarity of the capital
adequacy framework.
Under this framework, banks must hold capital equivalent to 8 per cent of
their assets weighted by credit risk. But the new Basle risk proposals could
vary this figure depending on an individual bank's exposures in areas such
as foreign exchange and derivatives.
The report suggests this problem could be eased either by banks disclosing
the capital they must hold for each risk, or by market risk capital
requirements being converted to the same formula as that for credit risk so
a single capital adequacy figure is retained.
The report says a number of changes are needed to satisfy the aim of
establishing a level playing field for banks trading in securities,
derivatives and foreign exchange:
Banks with better risk management systems than that proposed by the Basle
committee should not have to operate parallel systems.
Banking conglomerates should be allowed to consolidate risks and capital
requirements across their trading entities.
Banks should not have to report daily to supervisors on their risk exposures
and capital position.
Financial options should not be weighted by risk purely according to changes
in the price of the underlying asset.
Banks should not have to set aside capital to cover interest-rate risks
which are already covered by market risk capital.
Mr John Haseltine, the institute's deputy managing director, said banks
wanted to avoid having to duplicate risk management systems, which would
place them at a cost disadvantage to securities houses or unregulated
non-financial institutions.
The Basle proposals coincide with growing concern among bank regulators over
the potential risks in derivatives trading.

FT  13 DEC 93 / A chance to clean up in European white goods: The
Electrolux-AEG deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Electrolux of Sweden paid DM80m (Pounds 31.7m) last year for a 10 per
cent stake in AEG Hausgerate, the household appliances unit of Germany's
struggling AEG industrial group, it set a poser for observers of the
industry and rival manufacturers.
Was the purchase by Europe's largest producer of white goods - washing
machines, dishwashers, refrigerators and cookers - a prelude to a full
takeover of the AEG unit?
Or was it simply designed to cement a limited co-operation in manufacturing
and product development while preserving the German company's independence?
Whatever the original intentions, Electrolux was last week offered the
opportunity to buy the remaining 90 per cent of AEG Hausgerate, as AEG, part
of Daimler-Benz, launched a radical shake-up.
Less than 18 months after the original deal, a full takeover looks to be
programmed into the Swedish multi-national's wash cycle.
If a deal is agreed, analysts believe it could cost Electrolux a further
DM800m. The merger would be the most important takeover in the European
appliances industry since Michigan-based Whirlpool completed the two-step,
Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 730m) purchase of Philips' large domestic appliances
business in 1991.
In white goods alone, a takeover would enable Electrolux to challenge
Whirlpool, its most powerful rival, for the title of world's largest
producer.
Whirlpool's sales last year, excluding financial services, were Dollars
7.1bn, identical to the combined white goods sales for Electrolux and AEG.
Whirlpool, however, produces only white goods, and if appliances such as
vacuum cleaners are included, the combined Electrolux-AEG group would be
comfortably the world's biggest appliances producer with pro-forma sales of
Dollars 9.2bn last year.
Electrolux would also extend its leadership in the European white goods
market, with a share of as much as 30 per cent, against 15-19 per cent for
Bosch-Siemens of Germany, 11-15 per cent for Whirlpool Europe and 10 per
cent for Merloni of Italy.
The development of market shares and companies of this size is due in large
part to the rationalisation of the white goods industry over the past 20
years.
In 1970, 400 companies had 80 per cent of the European market, but soon only
six or eight will control 80 per cent, Mr Vittorio Merloni, chairman of the
Italian producer, said earlier this year.
The inexorable concentration of the industry has been driven by the need for
global or pan-European manufacturing efficiency. This 'behind-the-scenes'
rationalisation in humdrum areas such as component sourcing gradually frees
companies to spend more on their sophisticated brand strategies, and to
spread the heavy cost of product development over a wider sales base.
Electrolux foresees considerable benefits from a deal with AEG, in areas
such as purchasing, research and development, logistics and warehousing.
Electrolux will be able to supply AEG with compressors, for example, or
motor fan units for vacuum cleaners, both of which the German group
currently buys in. But the benefits of a takeover would go a long way beyond
manufacturing and distribution.
The big players in the European white goods business each have two or three
pan-European brands pitched at different types of consumers, and regional or
national brands where appropriate.
Electrolux would be adding a third pan-European brand, AEG, to complement
its Electrolux and Zanussi brands. While all three are well-known names
across Europe, AEG is strongest in Germany and neighbouring countries,
Electrolux in northern Europe and Zanussi in southern Europe.
In particular, the deal would give Electrolux an unrepeatable chance to
boost its market share in Germany, one of Europe's big four markets along
with the UK, France and Italy, to around 35 per cent.
Electrolux has about 20 per cent of the German market, but the majority of
its sales are through Quelle, the big mail order company. Owning the AEG
brand, along with the recently revamped Electrolux brand, ought to make it a
much more powerful challenger to Bosch-Siemens, the market leader.
Clearly, Electrolux can make a lot more of the manufacturing and marketing
synergies through a full takeover of AEG Hausgerate than if it was to retain
a 10 per cent stake - it has an option to acquire another 10 per cent, but
that will probably be subsumed in the wider deal.
As Mr Anders Scharp, Electrolux chief executive, said: 'Considering the
possible synergies between Electrolux and AEG, as well as AEG's very strong
position on many markets in the middle of Europe, we view an acquisition as
strategically correct in the long-term.'
And even though the AEG unit was profitable last year, it faces a better
chance of developing under the ownership of Electrolux than as part of a
company grappling with big losses in other businesses.
With a European white goods market share of about 6 per cent, AEG could
easily have found itself caught uncomfortably in the middle of a polarising
industry - between the increasingly powerful big boys and the many remaining
niche players.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Probe may change life insurance tax affairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK life insurance industry may be forced to change the way it handles
its tax affairs following a probe into the affairs of one of the largest
companies in the sector.
Allied Dunbar, a subsidiary of BAT, confirmed yesterday that it was to
present up to 20 separate reports to the Inland Revenue's Inquiry Branch at
the end of January on a range of internal tax matters.
Since the Revenue approached it at the start of the year, the company has
used six tax experts from accountants KPMG Peat Marwick on the
investigation.
Mr Bob Gill, corporate affairs director, said one of the central topics
covered is the treatment of 'soft commissions', the in-kind payments of
equipment and other goods made by stockbrokers and marketmakers in exchange
for business.
A second is the way its 400 branch managers report tax on their share of the
commissions paid to their sales teams, which can be up to 20 per cent of the
value.
Inquiry Branch normally examines serious cases of alleged fraud or
manipulation, but Mr Gill said this probe was on 'technical' matters.
He said Allied Dunbar had resolved with Revenue officials over the summer a
separate discussion on the way interest-free loans paid to its 4,500 sales
staff during times of low commission, and this did not form part of the
current investigation.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Electricity industry staff cuts to total 9,000 by end of
March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's electricity industry expects to have shed at least 9,000 jobs this
year as Nuclear Electric, the National Grid and regional electricity
companies increase efforts to improve efficiency.
The planned losses have emerged from the sector's half yearly reporting
season which ends on Friday. The 13 companies that have reported so far have
disclosed plans suggesting that at least 7,000 staff will have left their
jobs by the end of the current financial year, in March.
The six regional electricity companies in England and Wales that report this
week are likely to announce they are seeking job cuts of about 2,000, in
line with the job losses announced by the six that have already reported.
The four companies that comprised the pre-privatisation Central Electricity
Generating Board will employ 25,000 people by the end of the financial year,
compared with 48,000 in 1989 when the privatisation of the electricity
industry began, according to Nuclear Electric estimates.
Although opponents of privatisation will use the figures to try to embarrass
the government, ministers will argue that the staff reductions are proof of
the increased efficiencies produced by transferring public companies to the
private sector.
However, the company that is making the biggest contribution to the job cuts
total is Nuclear Electric, which along with Scottish Nuclear, is still state
owned.
Nuclear Electric, which is pressing strongly to be privatised, has already
cut 650 jobs from the 11,323 it had at the start of the year. It expects
another 1,300 to go by April.
National Power and PowerGen, the two English generators, which made swift
progress in cutting jobs after privatisation, have slowed down their
slimming programmes.
Nevertheless in the first half of the year National Power shed 600 jobs and
PowerGen about 150. Analysts say job losses at the two companies combined
could reach at least 1,300 by the year end.
The National Grid expects to lose 700 jobs by the end of the year, leaving a
total of 4,750.
The six regional companies that have already reported have plans for 2,300
job losses. Regional companies have a strong incentive to shed staff this
year because their distribution businesses are being reviewed by Professor
Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator.
The largest cuts have been made by Eastern Electricity and Seeboard.
Eastern, having cut more than 1,100 jobs last year, is expecting a further
850 reduction this year, reducing employee numbers to 6,300.
Seeboard has already cut 500 jobs in its core businesses in the first half
of the year and expects more.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the Bundesbank looks likely to overshoot its money supply target for
the third time in a row in 1993, it will doubtless take care to ensure that
next year's target - to be announced on Thursday - is one it can actually
achieve. That argues for at most a marginal tightening of the existing 4.5
to 6.5 per cent range, even though inflation has slowed and a fall in
investment has limited the economy's productive potential. The Bundesbank
has some room to juggle the numbers which go into the target. It is unlikely
to deviate from its medium-term inflation target of 2 per cent, but enjoys
discretion in the extent to which it allows for a slowdown in velocity.
Bonds might rally but the equity market would almost certainly react badly
if the bank decided to shave more than half a point off the target range. A
cut of up to that amount would do little to alter the pace of interest rate
cuts. At least the bank should find it easier to control M3 next year. There
should be no repeat of this year's ERM crises, while lower short-term
interest rates should encourage investors to move further out along the
yield curve. But being within the target may not in itself mean much. There
have been seven years since 1985 in which the aggregate overshot. In four of
them, the bank cut official rates just the same.

FT  13 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Coats Viyella
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent trading worries from Dawson International and Courtaulds Textiles
have worn a hole in the textiles sector, which has dropped 10 per cent
relative to the market over the past six weeks. Both companies have had
particular operational problems. But there also appears to have been a
general clothing sales glitch in the UK as consumer nerves frayed ahead of
the Budget. Groggy markets in mainland Europe have hardly helped.
Surprisingly perhaps, the sector's biggest stock, Coats Viyella, has held up
reasonably well, even though a recent enhanced scrip dividend flooded the
market with more shares. Coats is clearly not immune to the general forces
affecting textiles and will be vulnerable to any trading wobbles in the UK,
from where it derives 40 per cent of profits. Coats' business in mainland
Europe, accounting for a further one-fifth of income, will also be hard hit.
Yet Coats boasts greater defensive strengths than other UK textile companies
with a differing product and retail mix. Coats' thread sales should prove
more resilient than those derived from garments. It is also capable of
generating internal gains through integrating Tootal. An increasing exposure
to India, China and Russia adds a dash of long term growth appeal, while its
stock market reputation is still benefiting from the strides it has taken in
improving strategic clarity and financial respectability. Such factors
should ensure Coats' shares are not badly unpicked so long as it sticks to
its knitting while recession lingers.

FT  13 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rapid rise of Standard Chartered's shares, which have more than doubled
this year, prompts a second look at the fundamentals. Part of the increase
can be explained by the fact that Standard is a much more direct reflection
of the Hong Kong economy than HSBC since the latter bought Midland. Its
shares thus tend to track the Hang Seng index more closely. And earnings
look likely to bounce strongly over the next couple of years. But it would
be rash to rely too heavily on the third factor underpinning the shares: the
prospect of lavish dividend growth implicit in a yield of little more than 2
per cent.
Standard's dividend, which was cut to 20p from 35p in 1990, costs less than
Pounds 50m. The bank's tax rate is likely to fall as the Bombay provisions,
which were not deductible, drop away. Together with buoyant earnings in
Hongkong, that should ensure that the dividend is covered as much as four
times this year. Standard could afford a striking increase in its payout and
still retain the bulk of its earnings to fund future expansion. Bulls argue
that the case has become even stronger after last week's preference share
issue brought its tier one capital ratio close to 6 per cent.
Yet the mere fact that the bank is prepared to raise expensive capital in
this way is an indication of its need for capital strength. Not only must
Standard satisfy growing loan demand in Asia, where most of its profits are
generated, it also requires an ample cushion to absorb the occasional
accident that is bound to strike an institution with such extensive
operations in developing countries.
Different arguments apply to domestic UK banks whose profits are also rising
as provisions fall. With loan demand sluggish, they may not need much extra
capital. Their generosity to shareholders may be correspondingly greater.

FT  13 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Price is Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that QVC has managed to get on to equal terms with Viacom through the
courts, the struggle for Paramount is in the end game. In what is
effectively an auction, the battle will turn purely on the level of the bids
and the mix of cash and shares offered by each side. Yet spotting who is
prepared to pay the most is impossible at present. Both sides are
financially strong and have star-struck backers. Mr Barry Diller at QVC and
Mr Sumner Redstone at Viacom are heavily committed and will be loath to
flinch now. That suggests the bidding will go much higher, despite the giddy
price already being asked for Paramount's assets.
It is hardly reassuring that the deals are based on the kind of 'vision
thing' which can so easily lead companies astray. The vertical integration
of programme production with distribution channels is at least questionable.
True, it has formed the basis of Hollywood's historical success. But owners
of the much-touted information superhighways will need to pump as much
programming from as wide a range of sources as possible to make use of their
systems. Equally, programmes will need to be sold through several channels
to justify production costs.
A more complex web may thus ultimately emerge. This phase of the revolution
is primarily defensive, since distributors feel that they will be stronger
if they own at least some of the programming. Mr Rupert Murdoch's early and
economical purchases of Fox, BSkyB and Star thus look astute. But the risks
to later entrants could prove serious.

FT  13 DEC 93 / EU ministers to press ahead with 'action plan' on jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
More than 60 ministers arrive in Brussels today to begin enacting ambitious
plans for reviving employment and growth in the European Union and to
resolve internal differences over trade.
The plans were agreed at the Brussels summit which ended on Saturday with a
semblance of political unity and praise for Mr Jacques Delors, president of
the European Commission.
Leaders adopted Mr Delors' white paper on competitiveness, employment and
growth as an 'action plan' to pull Europe out of recession and tackle
unemployment.
But the summit was overshadowed by disputes over how to meet French and
Portuguese objections to a Gatt world trade deal under negotiation in
Geneva. Foreign ministers hope to settle these matters at a meeting today in
Brussels.
Mr Delors said the summit provided a 'relaunch' of the Union's credibility
and self-confidence similar to the spirit evoked by the earlier single
market programme of the 1980s.
EU heads of government have tilted in favour of deregulation, towards the
arguments which European industrialists have recently been putting forward.
The white paper eschews Brussels-led legislation in favour of a menu of
non-binding options which take into account each member state's national
needs, all within a framework of measured labour market deregulation,
macro-economic stability and spending on infrastructure.
Today, EU finance ministers will begin discussing the technical aspects of
the 'action plan', in particular the macroeconomic guidelines for the next
phase of economic and monetary union to begin on January 1.
The leaders charged finance ministers with assessing how to raise Ecu8bn
(Pounds 6bn) a year of additional finance to fund trans-European networks in
transport, energy and telecommunications.
The summit blunted European Commission hopes of being given the go-ahead to
raise the money through an issue of 'Union bonds'.
But Commission officials said the broad principle of spending on
infrastructure had been endorsed by all 12 member states, including Germany
and the UK.
EU leaders also agreed to hold a special meeting of foreign ministers on
December 22 in which to put pressure on the warring parties in former
Yugoslavia.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Trickery with capital gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The tax reforms of the 1980s did nothing to reduce the muddle that prevails
over the taxation of savings in Britain. Yet they did at least bring some
sense to the limited area of capital gains. The alignment of capital gains
tax with income tax rates removed distortions that arose from the natural
desire of taxpayers to transform income into lower-taxed capital; and the
introduction of indexation of gains and losses protected investors from a
hidden and arbitrary inflation tax. The decision in the Budget to scrap the
indexation of capital losses is thus a retrograde step. The manner in which
the change is being made has also given rise to justifiable irritation on
the part of investors.
In a move that has been presented in the budget as a tax avoidance measure,
the Treasury is proposing to abolish the indexation of capital losses, while
retaining the indexation of capital gains. The change is expected to raise
an additional Pounds 300m by 1996-97, which may prove optimistic given that
the entire yield from capital gains tax last year was put at a mere Pounds
1bn. The one thing that is clear about this measure is that by removing the
indexation of losses, and by doing it for transactions undertaken on or
after budget day, the government will in some cases impose real capital
gains tax rates of well over 40 per cent. The victims will not just be
sophisticated tax avoiders. Ordinary investors, who have been running losses
on individual shares in their portfolio on the reasonable assumption that
they could be indexed and then off-set against past and future gains on
other shares, will be hit. This is little different, in practice, from
retrospective legislation.
Capital erosion
At a stroke, a fully transparent top capital gains tax rate of 40 per cent
is being replaced by an opaque and arbitrary rate which will depend on the
composition of the taxpayer's portfolio. It will be theoretically possible
for investors to suffer losses of real wealth as a result of partial
de-indexation; and the risk of such capital erosion will become greater if
higher rates of inflation come back. Many taxpayers will also have to
re-work calculations of the base cost of their investments, going back to
1985 when the indexation of losses was first introduced.
These changes are technical and they affect only a small number of voters.
Yet they are symptomatic of the way successive chancellors have abandoned
all aspiration to continuity or principle in their approach to taxation. Mr
Norman Lamont's introduction of a new 20 per cent income tax rate was a sad
retreat from the earlier attempt by Nigel (now Lord) Lawson to simplify the
income tax and capital gains tax system. And his misleadingly presented raid
on the pension funds was a notably unattractive retreat into fiscal
opportunism. It undermined an entirely logical approach to the taxation of
pensions. As with an expenditure tax, the tax bill on deferred income is not
paid until savings are run down in retirement.
Retrospective penalty
Mr Kenneth Clarke can claim, not unreasonably, that his priority in his
first Budget was to deal with the huge hole in the public finances. Yet it
cannot be right to spring technical tax measures on the ordinary taxpayer
under the guise of an anti-avoidance measure and in a way that make a
nonsense of individuals' assumptions about how they should plan their lives.
While it may be difficult to retreat from the principle of partial
de-indexation announced in the Budget, Mr Clarke should think again about
the retrospective penalty implicit in making the new rules apply from
November 30th.
Meantime the review of the taxation of savings now being conducted by Mr
Stephen Dorrell provides the Treasury with scope to redeem itself on the
shape of the tax system. The financial secretary should seize the
opportunity to put the case for an expenditure tax on to the policy agenda.
Among the many advantages of an expenditure tax is that it works on the
basis of cash flow. It thus does not have to confront the impossible task of
distinguishing between capital and income. The need to index capital gains
disappears. A neat way, in fact, for Mr Clarke to confound the critics who
claim that economic sophistication is beyond our Ken.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Battle royal looms on health care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To anybody unfamiliar with Washington ways, it must seem baffling. In
September, the Clintons finally launched their long-awaited healthcare plan.
They were treated to standing ovations on Capitol Hill and rave reviews in
the press.
And then? An embarrassed silence. As analysts waded through the 1,400 pages
of text, doubts began to multiply. So did alternative proposals. To Mr
Clinton's chagrin, many moderate Democrats (including the reformist
Democratic Leadership Council) are backing a rival plan tabled by Mr Jim
Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee. Republicans, meanwhile, have put forward
at least three different 'market-oriented' proposals, based on the
prescriptions of competing conservative think tanks.
Some of the deepest misgivings concern the role of the proposed 'health
alliances' or regional purchasing co-operatives. The idea is that everybody
living in a certain area (except employees of very large companies) would
have to buy healthcare through one of these intermediaries. The alliance
would collect premiums from companies and individuals and use its market
clout to strike advantageous deals with competing private sector 'health
plans.'
If the alliances simply listed available health plans and acted as a
clearing house for premiums, they might not be feared. But under the Clinton
plan, these public or quasi public bodies would be local regulators of
healthcare. They would be able to ban health plans regarded as too costly,
set fee schedules for doctors and impose caps on the growth of insurance
premiums.
To many Americans, this seems suspiciously like socialised medicine by
stealth. Take the Washington DC area. Affluent K Street lawyers would not be
amused to find themselves in the same health alliance as welfare mothers,
especially as such an alliance would be a monopoly with vastly greater
financial muscle than local doctors or hospitals. Whatever the Clintons say,
people fear the alliances would give local bureaucrats too much power.
Controversy is also raging over the proposed 'employer mandate' - the
requirement that employers pay at least 80 per cent of the cost of a
standard package of benefits for employees. The Cooper plan and the
Republican alternatives are united in opposing such mandates.
The White House wants to make employers pay because most of the big increase
in health spending would then be 'off-budget'. Yet nobody is fooled: the
mandate is a tax by another name and would tend to price workers out of
jobs. When the principal goal of Clinton's economic strategy is to create
jobs, it seems foolish to increase taxes on employers. A Heath-Robinson
system of subsidies would lessen the burden on small companies, but only at
the expense of seriously distorting labour markets.
Then there is the question of cost. The US already spends 14 per cent of
gross domestic product on healthcare, against an average of 7.9 per cent in
other industrial countries. Given his rhetoric about the economic strains
imposed by galloping healthcare costs, you might have thought Mr Clinton
would be trying to reduce spending as a share of GDP or at the very least
prevent any further rise. By no means. The White House envisages the share
of healthcare rising to a mind-boggling 17.5 per cent of GDP. The
much-trumpeted 'savings' are produced by an old Washington trick: comparing
the reforms to 'baseline' projections showing spending soaring to nearly 19
per cent of GDP.
Providing health cover for the 37m without insurance will be costly. But Mr
Clinton did not have to aggravate matters by promising everybody a package
of benefits at least equivalent to those offered by Fortune 500 companies.
Nor did he have to propose new benefits, for example for mental health and
long- term care, that go beyond anything offered in the private sector.
The Clintons deserve credit for bringing healthcare to the centre of the
political stage. Few legislators doubt that reforms will be enacted next
year. But the Clinton plan is increasingly seen as a starting point for
detailed debate rather than a blueprint to be rigidly followed.
Given the concern about costs, congressional leaders are likely to insist on
a less generous package of minimum benefits. If health alliances survive,
they will probably assume a less threatening form. Legislators, for example,
could insist on a choice of at least two alliances in each area. They could
allow smaller companies to opt out of alliances, say those with more than
200 employees rather than 5,000 as specified in the Clinton plan. And they
could limit the power of alliances to regulate premiums or exclude health
plans. Such amendments would create a purer form of managed competition.
As for the employer mandate, many Republicans are urging Mr Clinton to place
the obligation to buy insurance where it belongs - on individuals. But while
smoothly articulating the logic of an individual mandate, few are willing to
countenance the level of personal subsidies (and hence new taxes) needed to
make such a law credible. Mr Cooper, supported by libertarians, rejects any
kind of mandate, arguing the goal should be universal access to care, not
universal coverage. The Clintons, however, adamantly oppose such
backsliding; their bottom line is 'healthcare that can never be taken away'.
Forget skirmishes like Nafta and the budget: next year Bill and Hillary will
be fighting the battle of their lives.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Leading Article: How to build Euro-networks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jacques Delors' plan for big investments in trans-European networks provoked
controversy at the weekend summit. Britain and Germany, in particular, do
not like the idea of so-called Union bonds to finance infrastructure when
member states are trying to curb budget deficits.
It is certainly possible to pick holes in Mr Delors' suggestions. The
section of the Commission's white paper on this subject is poorly argued,
repetitive and full of jargon. The bonds plan also suggests an effort by the
Commission to outflank the European Investment Bank, which was asked by
European leaders only a year ago to back infrastructure investment through
increased lending.
But it would be wrong to dismiss ideas to develop trans-European networks,
which are vital to the success of the union. European businesses and
individuals pay a large price for the fragmentation of transport,
telecommunications and energy systems.
No European can feel pleased at the delays in air travel caused by
incompatible and inadequate air traffic control systems. Nor is it
acceptable that it costs three times more to make a phone call across
national boundaries than it does inside them. Equally, British ministers
should be ashamed that trains will creep to London when the Channel tunnel
opens next year because a high-speed link on the British side has not been
built.
Sharp perception
Mr Delors' sharp perception of sickness in the European body is not,
however, matched by his remedies. The white paper rightly states that the
bulk of funding for information networks will come from private sources. It
points out, too, that in the transport and energy field - where public
sector involvement will necessarily be greater - private investor interest
needs to be encouraged. Yet it fails to resist the temptation to place
exaggerated emphasis on a central role for the Commission and Council of
Ministers in channelling Euro-cash to worthy projects.
Mr Delors also seems, at times, to think trans-European networks are
inherently desirable, rather than proceeding from an analysis of identified
needs. Too much faith in vague concepts such as 'mulimodal strategy' could,
combined with centralised planning, land Europe with a herd of white
elephants.
The main reason for the fragmentation of Europe's networks is that the
telecommunications, transport and energy industries are still mostly
national public sector monopolies. Because they are national, they rarely
look beyond their frontiers. Because they are public sector, they are
strapped for cash when state bud gets are tight. Because they are
monopolies, more efficient private enterprises are discouraged from
providing the missing links.
The priority is to open up the provision of infrastructure to competition.
This would provide extra sources of finance, while ensuring that investment
responds to commercial needs rather than political fancies. The Commission
acknowledges this, but its plans are too timid.
Cost-benefit analysis
It would, however, be naive to think that liberalisation can solve all the
problems, especially in transport. Many rail and road projects, which are
justified on a wider cost-benefit basis, are insufficiently profitable to
attract private sector support. Since national budgets are under strain,
innovative ways of marrying public and private finance are needed. Possible
methods include franchising services, electronic road tolls and earmarked
taxes (or even bond issues) for specific projects.
Trans-national coordination is sensible where the benefits of investment
spill over from one country to another. It is, for example, hard to see how
a single private enterprise could address Europe's air traffic problem.
Modernisation of transport links between the European Union and the
countries of central and eastern Europe will also require co-ordination.
The white paper pays lip-service to the need to combat monopolisation and
harness private finance, but it fails to state clearly that liberalisation
and privatisation are being held up by powerful vested interests. Unless
these can be overcome, with the aid of a vigorous campaign from the top, the
plan for improved networks is unlikely to travel far from the drawing board.

FT  13 DEC 93 / A new lightness to his touch: Lionel Barber examines the
reception given Mr Jacques Delors' white paper at the European Union summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors can afford to smile today. His white paper on employment,
growth and competitiveness received a better-than-expected reception at the
European summit in Brussels; and there was the added satisfaction of seeing
off most of his critics, including Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor.
Here was a rare victory for the president of the European Commission after
the setbacks of the past 18 months. Not for the first time, he carried the
day with a combination of intellectual force and political cunning which
papered over ideological divisions and produced a semblance of unity.
The test will come when EU leaders must deliver on the summit promise of an
'action plan' which aims to strengthen Europe's declining competitiveness in
relation to the US and Japan, while at the same time tackling the short-term
unemployment crisis.
What is clear is that EU leaders no longer treat the white paper as an
academic exercise. Last month, the number of people under 25 who were out of
work in the EU reached 15.2 per cent, with 28 per cent in Ireland, 30 per
cent in Italy, and 37 per cent in Spain. 'There is the risk of a social
explosion,' admitted a senior Brussels official.
A glimpse of the potential for unrest came on the first day of the summit
when thousands of Belgian trade unionists marched in the streets in protest
against the package of wage freezes and BFr75bn (Pounds 1.39bn) of social
security cuts put forward by the coalition government of Mr Jean-Luc
Dehaene. Similar protests have taken place in Italy and Spain.
The chief advantage of the white paper is that these fragile governments can
use it as 'political cover' for unpopular measures at home. Its central
message is that, while there are no miracle cures, there is safety in a
collective approach.
In fact, the white paper eschews Brussels-led legislation in favour of a
menu of non-binding options which take into account each member state's
national needs, all within a framework of measured labour market
deregulation, macro-economic stability and (relatively) modest spending on
new infrastructure projects.
On this hands-off approach, a previously hostile Mr Clarke declared on
Saturday: 'It is an impeccable statement.'
Mr Delors's new lightness of touch marks a further evolution in his
thinking, away from the centralising tendencies which marked his early years
as Commission president and which lay behind the drive for a single European
market by 1992.
It also signals a shift towards the right in the debate over what might be
called the future economic philosophy of the European Union. This debate
pits the Anglo-Saxon model of labour market deregulation, wage restraint and
curbs on trade union power against the more consensual model of social
partnership which has underpinned the post-second world war economic order
in Europe, but which is now under increasing strain.
By endorsing the white paper, EU heads of government have signalled a
decisive tilt in favour of deregulation, toward the arguments which European
industrialists have been putting forward with increasing firmness in recent
weeks.
Thus summit leaders endorsed a lifting of restricitons on hiring and firing
of workers. They recognised that wages for non-skilled workers must fall and
they conceded that employers' social security contributions must be reduced
in order to increase the attractiveness of hiring labour.
Two summit incidents point to a shift in attitudes. When Greek ministers
complained about wage restraint, they found themselves under attack from the
British, Dutch, Germans and no lesser figure than Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the
Spanish prime minister and one of Europe's leading socialists.
The second occurred in Mr Delors' own remarks, in which he noted the
compatibility between the contents of the white paper and Beating the
Crisis, the paper on competitivness put out by the European Round Table, the
forum for leading industrialists.
'The white paper is somewhat to the right of what Delors actually believes,'
said one aide, 'but he realised that he had to make the shift in order to
win support from the leaders.'
Yet it would be a mistake to assume the Commission president has compromised
on his core views. In the new age, he wants the right to permanent
re-training and education to be universal; and he demands 'solidarity' with
the 40m people living in poverty in Europe. As he said before the summit: 'I
can change my opinions, but I will not change my principles.'
This partly forms the background to the most divisive arguments on the white
paper: his proposal for borrowing up to Ecu20bn (Pounds 15.06bn) a year to
help to fund trans-European transport and energy networks costing some
Ecu250bn by the year 2000; another proposal for 'information highways' for
telecoms, priced at Ecu150bn; and one for Ecu174bn worth of environmental
projects.
In the Commission's view, the private sector alone cannot cover high-risk,
high-cost projects such as the high-speed train between Lyon and Turin; nor
can the European Investment Bank, without a likely increase in its capital
base. Hence the plan to raise Ecu8bn a year through 'Union bonds', to be
issued by the EU itself, with the EIB as agent.
The Delors proposal was an attempt to play on the heads of governments'
inclination to offer a sweetener to the bitter medicine elsewhere on offer.
Ever resourceful, he avoided following his French socialist colleagues calls
for Community loans to create a New Deal-type public works programme for
Europe. Instead he based his arguments on the Maastricht treaty's explicit
provisions for trans-European networks based on the need to improve European
competitiveness.
The argument that the development of trans-European networks has nothing to
do with the white paper's goal of creating 15m new jobs by the year 2000 did
not fool EU finance ministers, led by Mr Clarke and Mr Theo Waigel, his
German colleague. Peeved at not being able to 'fillet' the Delors paper
themselves, the finance ministers complained, too, that the proposals for
more EU-wide public borrowing ran counter to national efforts to curb budget
deficits.
Some summit observers identified a 'power-grab' by the Commission at the
expense of the EIB, which is often criticised for being too slow on
approving funding for major infrastructure projects. 'Delors is trying to
create a new investment bank in Brussels,' said one European treasury
official.
The compromise was to set up groups drawn from national governments and
industry to study trans-European network projects as well as the new
information technologies, while remitting final decisions to the ministers
of finance. 'All these projects of Mr Delors are a dead issue,' said a
German official.
This judgment may be just as premature as the political obituries which were
written for Mr Delors just over a year ago, before his native France voted
narrowly in favour of the Maastricht treaty which he had defended. However
much he may give the impression of carrying Europe's woes on his shoulders,
he remains as inventive as ever in spotting the political trends of the
future.
The question is whether, having unburdened himself of his magnum opus, it is
now time to depart the Brussels stage, either to enter the campaign for the
French presidency in 1995 or to take time off for the intellectual pursuits
which he claims he misses.
On Saturday afternoon, Mr Delors betrayed irritation when asked whether the
white paper was his 'swan-song'. If that was the case, he would have left
long ago, he declared.
Inside the Commission, however, there is a distinct fin de siecle
atmosphere. Mr Delors' authority is no longer what it was. With his final
two-year term expiring in a year, successors are dusting off their
credentials, including Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, who
could be on the verge of clinching a Gatt world trade deal.
The Brussels summit showed that Mr Delors has lost little of his prize
fighters instincts; but like all heavyweight champions he now must choose
the moment to go.

What a difference a handshake can make. From being the West's pet pariah,
Yassir Arafat is now getting the red carpet treatment in London this week.
The latest in a long line of former 'terrorists' to win recognition as a
world statesman, Arafat is the UK foreign secretary Douglas Hurd's lunch
guest on Wednesday.
The party continues with a meeting with John Major at No 10 Downing Street -
which, under Margaret Thatcher, remained firmly closed not only to him but
to his representatives. Further handshakes follow, with John Smith, Labour
leader, and the Archbishops of Canterbury and Westminster.
But the biggest surprise of all concerns - as usual - Lady Thatcher. When
the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's man in London, Afif Safieh, asked
if his boss could call on her the reply was positively gracious.
It would be more appropriate, she said, for her to call on him, at his
hotel. Which she is doing.

Tut, tut. When The Times asked Sir Adrian Cadbury, ex-chairman of Cadbury
Schweppes and Britain's 'Mr Corporate Governance', to take part in its
series on 'My Perfect Weekend', the industrialist made no bones about who
would be his least welcome guest - Patience Wheatcroft, a city journalist
who penned a not particularly flattering portrait of the great man a few
months ago.
But when asked who would be his perfect companion, all Sir Adrian would say
was that he was 'open to offers'. Presumably out of date now, given that The
Times carried the announcement of Sir Adrian's engagement to Susan Sinclair
a week before.

<TEXT>
At a time when the Conservative government has come under fire for its
generosity in paying golden handshakes of up to Pounds 8,000 to ministers
when they were forced to leave office, as revealed in the Commons last week,
one deposed minister has a rather different story to tell.
Peter Viggers was dismissed by the axe-wielding Margaret as industry
minister for Northern Ireland towards the end of July 1989. The following
day he was aghast to receive a terse letter from the Treasury asking him for
Pounds 27 by return post.
This was the amount, it transpired, that he owed for the four days to the
end of the month that he was unable to complete as a minister. To add insult
to injury, the Treasury sent him the wrong P45 - that of another minister
sacked at the same time.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The loss of all those first class air miles is especially hard luck for Huw
Evans, the affable 52-year-old deputy secretary for overseas finance at Her
Majesty's Treasury. He takes over as UK executive director at the IMF and
World Bank next February, replacing David Peretz.
Evans was in the European Commission for six months in the early 1970s, and
was the Hong Kong government's assistant economic secretary between 1973 and
1975. As under-secretary in the Treasury's overseas finance division, he was
responsible for IMF and World Bank affairs in the late 1980s.
But his real claim to fame dates back to his time as head of the Treasury's
forecasting and analysis division between 1980 and 1986. He won the 'golden
guru' award for sound economic forecasting - a plaudit that has eluded the
Treasury in more recent years.

Thank you Jacques Attali] If the ex-boss of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development had not enjoyed the good life so much, then
his colleagues at bigger multinational institutions might still be enjoying
one of the best perks of their job - first class air travel.
The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have decided that their
staffs will have to give up flying first class and make do with business
class. To prevent mutiny in the ranks, the executive directors, who
represent member countries, will also be downgraded to business class.
There are, of course, exceptions. The World Bank exempts only its president,
Lewis Preston, who is tall enough to need the extra legroom. At the IMF,
however, Michel Camdessus, the managing director, and his department heads
will still be allowed to travel first class.
So why did they do it? Preston and Camdessus are anxious not to be tarred
with the same brush that swept Attali from office. 'I think they both got
fed up with it being the first subject that came up in any conversation,'
moans one ex-first class flyer.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: The route to a European constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof ERNST STEINDORFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer's article on 'A pill to beat MF' (December 8) merits
praise. He discusses the proposal for a European constitution elaborated by
distinguished scholars and politicians. He mentions that this proposal is
disapproved of from within the European Commission. We may suppose that the
Commission envisages presenting its own draft for the 1996 discussions on a
Union constitution.
One of the reasons the Maastricht Treaty has encountered so much opposition
in quite a number of countries may be found in the fact that it was
influenced by the Commission's selfish interests to extend the jurisdiction
and the powers of the EU and, hereby, its bureaucracy. Europe can flourish
only under a constitution which makes citizens understand that specific
responsibilities have been transferred to the Union, because united
political action is necessary. Nobody would understand that powers and more
and more financial resources are handed over to Brussels only in order that
the Union and its institutions may thrive.
Such a constitution cannot, or must not, be drafted by those who want to act
for the Union and who may be eager to have their own importance buttressed.
Nor may it be created by those who, not unlike former central committees,
claim the knowledge of what is good for Europe and its citizens. That is why
any serious proposal from outside the European institutions merits
attention. There is a presumption that it is dictated by less selfish
bureaucratic interests and that it is more in accordance with the interests
of European citizens. Mr Mortimer, quite correctly, makes us aware of that.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Smoke gets in Europe's eyes: Divisions among EU health
ministers and advertisers over tobacco products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Mead is a 30-a-day smoker who thinks tobacco advertising should be
banned. He knows it isn't entirely logical, but he feels some degree of
reassurance every time he sees a cigarette advertisement. 'At the back of my
mind I have to believe the government wouldn't allow something that's going
to kill me to be advertised.' Mr Mead is chairman of Abbott Mead Vickers, a
top UK advertising agency which refuses tobacco company business.
Dominic Proctor, London chief executive of New York-based agency J Walter
Thompson, which has among its clients the tobacco company Gallaher, the UK
subsidiary of the US company American Brands, takes the rather less
exceptional line for an advertising man. 'There should be freedom to
advertise anything which it is legal to market,' he says.
In Brussels today the arguments which currently divide the advertising
industry will be reflected in a debate between European Union health
ministers. Under discussion is a European Commission draft directive that
would ban all tobacco advertising, apart from point-of-sale material, across
the EU.
The Commission's action has been prompted by research showing tobacco
products cause 430,000 deaths a year in EU countries. Among the middle-aged
population, tobacco products are responsible for at least a quarter of all
deaths.
The Commission also says prohibiting advertising will overcome the problem
of differing rules across member states preventing the free flow of, for
instance, magazines containing cigarette advertisments.
In response, the tobacco and advertising industries point out that the
keenest advocates of the plan - France, Italy, Portugal and Spain - either
have state-run tobacco companies or allow other companies to operate a
monopoly. It would be harder for others to compete against the dominant
players in these countries if they were not allowed to promote their
products.
They also warn that a ban could set a worrying precedent: today Brussels
wants to outlaw tobacco advertising, tomorrow it could be fast cars,
children's toys, pharmaceuticals or Black Forest gateaux.
For the moment, at least, it is likely that the Commission will be unable to
persuade EU states to support its directive, as it has been since the
directive was first put on the table in 1991. Realising that agreement is
unlikely, supporters of a ban will probably not push for a vote today.
In the past it has been Germany, Denmark, Holland, Greece and the UK which
have blocked a comprehensive ban. Greece, under its new Socialist
government, may have softened its stance. But the four remaining opponents
have enough votes under the qualified majority voting system to continue
blocking its progress.
The position of the UK could prove pivotal. It has been the most vociferous
opponent of an EU-wide ban and it is widely thought that Denmark and the
Netherlands would switch sides if the UK were to change its position.
So far the British have preferred a policy of a voluntary approach to
restricting advertising and high taxes on tobacco products - the duty on
tobacco was increased by 7 per cent in last month's Budget.
Tobacco advertisers in Europe believe they have won a reprieve - but no
more. Privately, many in the advertising industry see public opinion forcing
an end to tobacco advertising in Europe within three or four years.
An indication of the mounting pressure of public opinion is already being
seen in the UK. The government is expected soon to announce it will be
negotiating tighter 'voluntary' controls with the tobacco and advertising
industries.
Options include an end to poster advertising, a ban on tobacco
advertisements in womens' magazines, removing shopfront advertising, and
larger health warnings on packs. Proposals along these lines could help to
head off the threat of cross-party support growing for a private member's
bill introduced by Labour MP Mr Kevin Barron which the government is highly
likely to want to block. Such proposals would also provide something for
ministers to offer at a European level as an alternative to the proposed
ban.
The advertising sector accepts that such a move in the UK could presage an
eventual crumbling of UK resistance to a EU wide ban. And it is already
preparing accordingly even though the European Commission calculates that
tobacco advertising makes up less than 3 per cent of advertising for all
goods and services in the 12 member states. For example, Mr Russell
Gore-Andrews, chairman of More O'Ferrall, the hoardings company which has
operations across Europe says: 'The job of our marketing has been to broaden
the base of customer demand in all our markets, so that we are not too
dependent on one sector.'
While there is clearly movement towards further restrictions in Europe,
voluntary or otherwise, there is no definitive answer to one question which
ought to be central. Does a ban on advertising cut the number of smokers?
The Tobacco Advisory Council, the UK trade body, says that the sole purpose
of tobacco advertising is to promote competition and encourage existing
smokers to switch brands. It estimates that the value of business from
smokers who switch is worth Pounds 3bn a year. It denies that advertising
encourages smoking.
Not so, according to Dr Clive Smee, the department of health's chief
economist. Last year he reported that studies of Canada, Finland, New
Zealand and Norway, where tobacco advertising bans have been in operation,
showed 'a fall in smoking on a scale which cannot reasonably be attributed
to other factors'.
But his research appears to clash with a study by Michael Stewart, an
econometrician, in the May edition of the International Journal of
Advertising. That showed a slight increase in smoking in those countries
where there has been a ban. A possible reason is that banning advertising
also means no health warnings to put off smokers, except on packets. 'This
increase is not quite statistically significant, but clearly refutes the
belief that advertising bans have appreciably reduced consumption,'
concludes Mr Stewart.
As he points out, the space now devoted to the health warnings is the
'equivalent of millions of Ecus of ongoing anti-smoking advertising' across
Europe. If European health ministers decide that they want to impose a ban
on advertisments, they may need to seek some alternative ways of funding
those warnings.
But the niceties of this debate are unlikely to worry the tobacco companies,
although they will continue to lobby vigorously against any measure which
could affect sales. The companies already know that tobacco consumption in
western European markets is dropping as concerns about the health effects
spread and as smoking becomes less socially acceptable. The decline is not
sharp - about 2.5 per cent in volume terms in EU countries over the past
five years - but it is steady and shows no sign of slowing.
In contrast, new markets are opening in Asia and the Pacific Rim, and in
eastern Europe, where smoking is gaining in popularity and sales. In China,
for example, cigarette sales grew from 1,649bn to 1,705bn in between 1991
and 1992.
With such virgin territories to play for, the possibility of an ban on
advertising in Europe may ultimately appear to be a a small distraction.

Sir, Your story, 'Dinosaurs on the runway' (December 8), reported that US
airlines are questioning whether the hub-and-spoke concept is valid any
more, and that this system is one of the reasons big carriers have incurred
financial losses in contrast to small airlines which operate no-frills,
shuttle service between pairs of cities and make money.
This is not true at Delta Air Lines, originator of the hub-and-spoke system
in aviation. Through the years we have continued to perfect the concept and
today operate the most geographically balanced route network in the US. For
Delta the hub-and-spoke system is the most efficient way of offering the
most flights, to the most destinations, for our passengers and shippers,
while maximising our assets. Last year, Delta was the only airline in the
world to operate more than 1m departures. While many of these flights
operated to or from one of our hubs, we have plenty of point-to-point
flights where the market demands it, like the Delta Shuttle service between
Washington, New York and Boston.
The article stated that one of the big disadvantages of the hub-and-spoke
system was that staff were standing idle during non-peak times throughout
the day. In our Atlanta hub, the world's largest, we operate more than 500
flight departures every day and, like our other hubs, it is staffed
according to the demand. No Delta staff stand idle; they are among the most
competitive and flexible in the world.
If there are dinosaurs, Delta is not one of them. Delta relishes change and
that attitude will keep us around for a long time, providing value and
superior service for our stockholders and passengers. Carriers in the US
have lost money because of the recession, the Gulf War and the US bankruptcy
law, not because of the hub-and-spoke system and small no-frills airlines.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL BRACKEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Feldstein (Personal View, December 10) presented the opportunity
to boost jobs at no cost through the use of investment tax credits (ITC).
Basic economic theory should alert us to being offered a free lunch, and in
this case some of the consequences of ITCs were not spelled out.
Broadly speaking, the 'benefit' of an ITC is a tax incentive for the
companies making approved investments. The cost is higher taxation on all
companies not making approved investments. Professor Feldstein suggests that
approved investments would be money spent on equipment and possibly
construction.
The government is in no position to be the best judge of whether to
encourage expenditure by companies on investment as opposed to anything
else, or an arbiter of which types of investment are better than others.
Inevitably, ITC schemes have been used effectively to subsidise
manufacturing investment at the expense of service industry. Policymakers
should resist the temptation to meddle further in the allocation of
resources and concentrate on reducing the distortions within the current
taxation system instead.

FT  13 DEC 93 / The harmful myth of hidden state debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to an ancient sage there are three kinds of human ills: those
inflicted by providence, those inflicted by our fellow men and women, and
those we inflict on ourselves. The scare campaign to increase the size of
estimated government debt by adding in unfunded public sector pension
liabilities belongs to this last category.
The origins of the campaign are an innocent enough attempt to study the
increasing burden that state pensions will be putting on ageing communities
in the years ahead. The burden arises from the combination of falling birth
rates and increasing longevity. The EU dependency ratio - those aged over 65
as a proportion of those aged 15 to 64 - is expected to rise from 22 per
cent in 1980 to 40 per cent in 2040.
The error has been to project government pension commitments for the years
ahead, and (to the extent that they cannot be met from existing taxation) to
add their present value to the outstanding government debts as normally
measured. The effect of adding in these unfunded liabilities goes well
beyond accounting niceties. The result is to double the ratio of debt to GDP
on which so many governments focus, to make most countries seem even further
removed from the Maastricht guidelines than they are at present; and above
all - by persuading public opinion that government finances are even worse
than they are - to encourage hairshirt fiscal policies, involving an
increase in taxes at a time of uncertain recovery from long-running
depression.
Some economists are wont to replace crude government borrowing targets with
aims such as maintaining the net value of public sector assets. But if
government balance sheets are recalculated to include the supposed hidden
pension debt, then existing public sector balance sheets will look much
worse and appear to be deteriorating, thus encouraging the fiscal zealots
who look for any pretext to raise taxation. We need a more pessimistic
presentation of government balance sheets as much as we do a hole in the
head.
The latest pessimistic estimate to land on my desk is from CS First Boston
and is entitled Employment and Hidden Debt. It is indeed the estimate of the
debt which makes the employment prospects worse than they need be. I am
using this firm's estimates because they are particularly comprehensive and
carefully researched - and my spirits were raised when I read the quotation
from T S Eliot's East Coker, one of his Four Quartets, at the end of the
paper.
The study is devoted to 'unavoidable yet unfunded' public sector
liabilities, of which pensions form a large part. The result for most
countries is that hidden debt is higher than conventional debt. All EU
countries, bar the UK, have debt ratios several times the 60 per cent
Maastricht guideline. The combined debt-to-GDP ratio for the Netherlands is
blown up from nearly 80 per cent to over 225 per cent. The UK emerges far
better than any other country from these computations; but its debt ratio in
1990 is still increased from 40 to 74 per cent and would doubtless be much
higher now.
The fallacy of such estimates is to treat pension commitments differently
from other forms of public spending. The pay-as-you-go schemes, from which
the scare stories stem, are based on each generation of workers paying
through taxes and contributions sufficient to cover the cost of pensions for
those already retired. Thus pensions are, like any other form of rising
public expenditure, to be met from higher tax revenue or social security
contributions, or reduced spending elsewhere.
The hidden debt estimates assume that governments will either try to default
on their commitments or try to meet them by increased borrowing,
irrespective of the state of their economies. The CS First Boston authors
cite General Motors, where a new accounting standard, providing for the
inclusion of current and future healthcare liabilities, slashed 75 per cent
off the corporation's equity in 1992. The analogy is wrong because General
Motors - heaven be praised - does not have the power of a government to
raise taxes.
Since financial topics give rise to so much emotion, I must make some
disclaimers. Of course CS First Boston and other analysts are right to worry
about the burden of rising pensions. Alternatives, such as more private
pension provision, should indeed be considered. The point of disagreement is
the limited but important one of estimating national debt ratios. The
question is: do the European financial institutions really want to promote
fiscal policies which will make the present economic stagnation worse and
delay recovery still further?

FT  13 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Fewer ITV channels bad for
advertisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KENNETH MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am glad to be able to agree with one or two things in Greg Dyke's
letter (December 8), but I have to say that I disagree with rather more of
it.
Certainly,the TV airtime market is changing and, certainly, it is in
everyone's interest, including the advertisers, that ITV remains a strong
channel. No problems with either of these statements.
However, I must take exception when he says that 'advertisers already have
real choice in the TV market'. How can we say that a regional advertiser, or
a company with regional brands, has any choice at all? If Britain wants to
encourage medium-sized companies to grow, then we must make it more possible
for them to use television and the other dynamic media. These companies will
themselves all be operating in competitive markets, but they will not be
able to buy television air time in a competitive market. For example, anyone
who wants to advertise in Lancashire really has only one TV company
available. If they want to advertise in Merseyside alone (or the Birmingham
area alone, or south Yorkshire alone etc), then their choice is even less.
What advertisers need, therefore, is more commercial stations, offering
increased regionality - not less. Mergers will do nothing for advertisers -
and I suspect they will do nothing for viewers either.
For Greg Dyke to talk about 'ITV's fragmented advertising' is really to put
the cart before the horse. Where combined operation matters is in the
programming, and the existence of the ITV Network Centre should have taken
care of the need to have a national plan for ITV programming. Advertising
sales, however, remain an entirely different subject. While companies
sometimes want to buy advertising on a national scale, more often they want
to buy it regionally or with regional variations.
This is not 'fragmented' but 'realistic' and 'flexible'. In other words, the
sales arrangements are organised to look after the needs of the customers -
not to please the sellers.
What Greg Dyke appears to want is a sales regime which suits the ITV
companies, the sellers, but is quite prepared to ignore and override the
needs and wishes of the customers. Funnily enough, this is exactly how
monopolies and cartels normally behave. Kenneth Miles,

Not the most promising night's broadcasting. It is one of those days when
television seems to be determined to heap Pelion upon Ossa, and drive us all
into a deep depression. On Channel 4, Refugee Story visits Rada Kovacevic
who fled from Bosnia after returning home to find her husband and children
dead with their throats cut (7.50). Panorama is also concerned with Bosnia,
asking how the West came to ignore the lessons of history and allow people
to get away with 'ethnic cleansing', a process so similar to Nazi policies.
Steve Bradshaw talks to refugees and victims in Foca (9.30 BBC1).
Cutting Edge (9.00 C4) is another programme about a mental hospital from the
team that has exposed conditions in Greek mental hospitals and in Ashworth
Special Hospital, and the activities of one doctor in Broadmoor. Today's
programme is about Gartnavel Royal Hospital in Glasgow. It investigates a
number of 'untimely' deaths.
To mark the centenary of Maupassant's death Radio 4 begins a new Book At
Bedtime: 'Bel Ami' (10.45).

FT  13 DEC 93 / Arts: A monster that may ruin St Petersburg - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
St Petersburg is the most perfectly planned and impressively classical city
in Europe. I was overwhelmed by its beauty on my first visit in last week's
heavy snows. I had expected the huge scale of everything, the sense of
autocratic grandeur and the glorious use of colour, but I had not
appreciated that St Petersburg is more than a city of wonderful individual
buildings - it is itself a great architectural landscape.
The other surprise for me was not that the city reaches aesthetic perfection
as the apogee of the neo-Classical style, but that it is so romantic. Views
in the city are on such a scale that columns become like trees and groves,
with statues and trophies that catch the eye in arcadian scenes. Of course
the snow helped - and the silence at night, the lack of cars and the absence
of advertising. At night the city still has a romance that has been killed
in most west European cities. It is properly lit so that parts are dark and
there is no hideous overall sodium glow.
A permanent sense of political potency lingers in St Petersburg like no
other city on earth. It is not a part of the great semi-Asiatic continent to
which it is the Baltic gateway. Instead St Petersburg has a sense of
European 18th and 19th-century harmony that gives it an extraordinarily
enlightened and civilised face. Peter the Great founded the city in 1703 as
an act of will to demonstrate that Russia could be dragged out of the
medieval darkness into the glow of the enlightenment. He never saw the scale
of the city that we see now. But it is his dreams that have flourished upon
the wooden and stone piles that he drove relentlessly into the impossible
marshes.
This strange and violent founder of the city had his own son killed in the
Fortress of St Peter and Paul; Tsar Paul I was later strangled in the
magnificent Mikhailov Palace. Crowds were shot at outside the Winter Palace;
and no one in St Petersburg can forget the long Nazi siege and the longer
tyranny of communism. It is impossible for visitors not to sense the depth
and misery of the past while rejoicing at the visual riches of the city
today.
There is also the sense of bafflement for foreigners who have endured the
recent years of cold war to find a formerly communist country where the
Tsarist past has been both respected and rebuilt. The palaces of Tsars look
as splendid today as they ever have - and the work continues with the
rebuilding of Tsarkoye Selo and the accurate reinstatement of much of the
work of that great Scottish architect, Charles Cameron, who was employed by
Catherine the Great and her son. Evidence is everywhere of an incredibly
high standard of craftsmanship and a continuity of architectural and
decorative traditions.
I was particularly honoured to visit the Russian Academy of Fine Arts
Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in its huge, palatial
premises on the bank of Vasilyevsky Ostrov, designed in the mid-18th century
by Vallin de la Mothe, who was also its first professor of architecture. I
have never felt such a sense of cultural continuity as I felt in the halls
and corridors of this vulnerable palace. On its walls hang the diploma works
of its artist students in unbroken ranks from the 1750s. Life drawings and
paintings process in uninterrupted lines on the walls of the great rooms.
Although for more than two centuries the subject matter and approach has
hardly changed, it is possible to sense the precise dates when the work was
executed by the very atmosphere that they exude. Like the steps of classical
ballet the rigorous rules of the fine arts can be interpreted, once learned,
with originality.
This tangible tradition extends to the teaching of architecture, and the
display of great wooden models of some of the major buildings of St
Petersburg is a unique and inspirational three-dimensional archive. The
architectural students of today are well trained in the traditions but
uncertain which direction to follow. Their cultural isolation has, until
now, saved them from the barmier aspects of Modernism and the cruder efforts
of western commercialism. But terrible clouds lurk on the horizon.
At a recent Prince of Wales's Business Leaders Forum in the city the full
horror of one proposal for St Petersburg was unveiled. The proposal to build
a giant and pointless tower block on the western part of Vasilyevsky Ostrov
for offices, 'food-courts and a business centre', has been promoted by the
Corporation of The Twentieth Trust, a group that has grown out of a state
construction and contracting company and is now privatising itself.
The most shaming aspect of the whole absurd and damaging proposal is that it
is designed by a British firm of architects who should be hanging their
heads in shame. Wilson Mason and Partners may well have been chosen because
they have representative offices in Russia - as they have in the Middle East
and (God help us) in Prague. This scheme looks like a pathetic copy of
Canary Wharf and I am sure that Mr Oleg Kharchenko, the deputy mayor and
chief city architect, will refuse permission for this monster to rise and be
seen above the glories of the unsullied centre of St Petersburg.
It would be a terrible error for St Petersburg to copy the ludicrous mistake
of Canary Wharf and London's Docklands. Neither of these is an example of
commercial or architectural intelligence.
St Petersburg should advance slowly. An independent Anglo-Russian initiative
has been launched by the architect Robert Adam and Professor Semion
Mikhailovsky at the Russian Academy to hold a conference and exhibition at
The Hermitage in September next year. Why should yet another city be ruined
by inept commercialism and the adoption of bankrupt architectural ideas from
the west? St Petersburg deserves great thought and care before anything is
done that will make it exactly like everywhere else. The Peter the Great
Tower, as this proposed excrescence is called, is an insult to the city and
must not be built.

<TEXT>
The 1930s were the golden age of American comedy, on both stage and screen.
And numerous plays and films from that decade remain, not only classic
comedies but also classic expressions of the American spirit. You Can't Take
It With You, the most popular of the eight comedies co-written by George S.
Kaufman and Moss Hart, comes to us from 1936. Inasmuch as it is about an
eccentric family who carry on being eccentric when they are entertaining
polite guests, it is an American counterpart of Noel Coward's well-known Hay
Fever (1925). The differences between the two plays tell us much about
America and England.
In both Hay Fever and You Can't Take It With You, the eccentric family
submits its guests to party games with embarrassing results. But Coward's
play, for all its brilliance, is merely about bad social manners. The
Kaufman-Hart comedy goes far further, for it is about the complexity of
society itself. The Sycamore family may have its crazy sides, but it is also
a paradigm of the great American melting-pot. Gradually it exposes the
primness of the polite guests as a form of repression; whereas the sometimes
offensive hosts become a model of generous toleration.
If you, like me, are in love with the American dream, the values that
underpin this play will move you even as you laugh at its farcical
absurdities. Certainly the Sycamore family is absurd. Mrs Sycamore (who
began to write plays one day eight years ago when a typewriter was delivered
to the house by mistake) is given to declaim lines from her scripts in
mid-conversation - for example, 'Kenneth, my virginity is a priceless thing
to me]' She keeps nibbles in a skull. Mr Sycamore, a scientific
experimenter, keeps causing explosions in the cellar.
Their daughter, Essie, practises ballet in the living-room, and her husband,
Ed, shoves anarchist/Trotskyist slogans in his candy-deliveries because they
amuse him. Grandpa has been avoiding paying income tax by claiming to be
dead. Visitors include an alcoholic actress, a Russian ballet teacher and
one of those White Russian aristocrats who are currently earning their
livings by serving in restaurants. ('Who was that?' 'The Grand Duchess Olga
Katrina. She's just fixing the dinner.')
Amid all these crazies, Alice, the Sycamores' other daughter, is a jewel of
graceful normality. (In this context, she is as odd as the niece in The
Munsters.) And the polite/prim guests are her in-laws - who no sooner come
to call than they find themselves carted off, with everyone else, to jail by
the cops.
At the King's Head, Islington, the play is delectable - both funny and
touching. Nothing about Martin Connor's staging is perfect; the members of
the large cast are either miscast or limited or weak in American accents;
and, of course, the tiny stage is so cramped that the actors have to shift a
table before they can line up to take curtain-calls at the end. But so what?
The play is simply honey; and everyone performs it with such perfectly good
intentions that audience and players are caught up together in a conspiracy
of mirth and affection.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Arts: An accessible Elliott Carter - Broadcast music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Radio 3 listeners still on their way to work, with car radios or
Walkmans, on weekday mornings after 9 the 'Composer of the Week' is
generally a safe bet. The accredited Greats can be sliced into specialised
five-morning exhibits (Bach at Cothen, say, or Mozart's quintets, or
Stravinsky's choral pieces); other weeks can feature less familiar but
digestible composers - Chausson, or Biber, or the lesser colleagues in
Schumann's circle, nothing tougher than Britten or Bartok. All this week,
however, Radio 3 is treating innocent ears to a radical modernist, the
American Elliott Carter.
Just a day younger than the late Olivier Messiaen, he turned 85 on Saturday
(as Berlioz turned 190); but Carter is still formidably hale and genial, and
laden with new commissions. Yet between the reverence accorded to him among
serious musicians, and the bare acquaintance with his name that most
concert-goers have, the gap remains enormous. In the days when I still read
The Times, Bernard Levin used regularly to invoke Carter's name as the very
emblem of rebarbative modern music. Lutoslawski and Tippett, who are also
old enough to have published a body of more easily 'accessible' music before
they located their most original veins, enjoy much broader acclaim.
To any listener new to Carter, and with meagre experience of 'progressive'
musical developments since about 1950, the works of his splendid late
maturity may seem opaque thickets. There is a lot of intense polyphony, and
a lot of drama, but without standard, recognisable guidelines; not knowing
what you're meant to listen for, you may retreat baffled. It is like meeting
Beethoven's late quartets without knowing any Mozart or Haydn. But the
series devised for Radio 3 this week by Misha Donat (which really started
last Thursday night, with Carter's 1969 Concerto for Orchestra) has a
judicious, enticing virtue, and a further bonus.
The special virtue is that it enlists early, 'easier' Carter each day to set
us up for the denser stuff - something that would be difficult and expensive
within a live concert programme. The earlier pieces, all from the war years,
share an American breeziness (with notable ingenuity, but no very striking
individual voice) with the out-of-doors terms of Copland and Piston - but
also the rangy contrapuntal lines Carter developed whilst studying in Paris
with Nadia Boulanger.
From today to Wednesday, each programme culminates in one of the grand
transitional works which take the ideal of free-running counterpoint far
out: the piano and cello-and-piano sonatas, and the towering First String
Quartet of 1951. Those all trade upon just enough post-Romantic rhetoric to
give us reassuring signposts, but also attune us to constant
platform-hopping between one passionate line and another, simultaneous but
only loosely and fluidly - and yet most calculatedly - connected with it.
Though the intricate whole seems to teem far beyond what we can take in, it
draws us into ever closer listening, with ever-increasing rewards.
In Carter's music, as he himself declares in these broadcasts (his crusty,
sensible commentary is the special bonus here), the distinct voices 'are
free people; this is a world of free individuals joining together to do
something - in their own way, and not all marching in goosestep together,
the way they do in older music.' Deeply American, that; but the exercise
Carter gives it is vitally exhilarating, demanding a new, athletic kind of
musical attention. As the pubescent hero of the American TV series Soap
declared, after losing his virginity to his schoolmarm, 'It's like
discovering you've got a third arm]'

FT  13 DEC 93 / Arts: Newman and Baddiel - Comedy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Friday the comic duo, Newman and Baddiel, announced that they were
splitting up. Unfortunately they still went ahead with the final show that
evening. You can see why: it was the big one, Wembley Arena, where no
comedians had ever ventured before. A 12,000 crowd, a Pounds 100,000 plus
pay off.'
There was a definite air of excitement: this was a new experience. The stage
was set in the round, a vast space on which egos could easily be slain. But
the crowd, mainly young girls currently bereft of a worthwhile fantasy pop
star, was in a fever of excitement. Two and a half hours later, after the
last exposure of Newman and Baddiel's most famous sketch featuring two
bickering history professors, the audience faded away in silence.
It was bitterly disappointing. There is no physical chemistry between the
two 29 year olds (like many double acts they are not friends), and on the
rare occasions when they shared the stage there was an 'how many minutes
more of this stuff' feel to the exchanges. In the main they do solo spots of
mixed quality.
Of course neither Newman nor Baddiel tell jokes - where have you been. They
are staunch members of the 'quirky observations of the passing scene' school
of humour, with particular reference to private functions. David Baddiel is
the laddish one, with jokes about football, or, rather Graham Taylor, and
the perils of disco dating. He revels in the scatalogical, majoring in
pornography. Compared to Ben Elton or Frank Skinner it is all quite refined
but it managed to extract embarrassed shrieks.
In contrast Robert Newman is almost sophisticated, throwing words like
existential and conceptual into anecdotes about the problems of being a punk
in a small village. He also has the best character, a languid pervert in a
smoking jacket who positively boils over at the prospect of providing a bed
for homeless lads over Christmas.
Newman is also happy to be politically incorrect, with a sketch on
psychopaths released into the community, and the tease that in his blanked
out television utterances Gerry Adams is actually instructing the nation's
lip reading deaf to mix the Semtex.
In this tired performance Newman and Baddiel were not good enough for their
audience. It says much for educational progress that the most anticipated
spot is built around bickering dons. The idea is that their discussion on
the pagan origins of Christmas should be sidetracked into personal abuse at
the level of the infants playground.
Like much of Newman and Baddiel, like Friday night itself, it was one sketch
too far. The fact that they were being slowly revolved on the stage to give
everyone a view took away some of the intensity, but even so the exchanges
were as limp as yesterday's lettuce. An audience of a hundred in a pub
comedy club might have reckoned they had a fair evening. At Wembley Arena
this particular comedy bubble burst.

FT  13 DEC 93 / The Monday People Page: Modernising a monopoly - Cedric
Brown tells Lucy Kellaway that British Gas is his job and his hobby horse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Joanna Lumley, the leggy actress in British Gas commercials, loves being in
control. So does Cedric Brown, thecompany's chief executive. Yet control is
just what he lacks: the company's future rests squarely in Michael
Heseltine's hands. Any day now the trade secretary will decide whether
British Gas should continue to exist in its monolithic form, and whether it
deserves its monopoly of the domestic gas market.
Brown is getting impatient; he wants a quick decision so that he can get
back to running the company in earnest. The verdict is certain to force
British Gas to become more competitive; Brown will be faced with the
monumental task of turning a defensive gas monopoly into a modern,
international energy group.
He might seem an odd person for the job. Brown, who joined the company at
16, is steeped in the old utility culture and has little experience of the
outside world. British Gas has been his life, and he makes no attempt to
pretend otherwise. 'I'm not one for chit chat at cocktail parties. But if I
can get the conversation on to a subject like British Gas, then I'm OK. It's
rather a hobby horse of mine.'
The hundreds of people with whom he must have discussed gas at parties over
the years will have found him straightforward, modest and a good listener.
But this pleasant blue-eyed man is not the sort of person one would expect
to find leading the sixth largest company in Britain, as it faces its
biggest challenge yet.
So how did he get to the top? Some argue Brown was the best of an
indifferent bunch. Sir Denis Rooke, the abrasive chairman during the 1970s
and 1980s, did not encourage creativity and initiative among his underlings.
'Rooke was an admiral who wouldn't have any captains. When he went there
were only sublieutenants left to run the ship,' says one well known energy
consultant.
Brown's own account of his rise is so modest that if he believes it himself
he must occasionally wonder what he is doing in the executive suite at the
top of Rivermill House. 'It was a mixture of things . . partly luck, being
in the right place at the right time.' He admits to drive and to hard work:
he leaves his Buckinghamshire home at 7 am each morning and four nights a
week does not get back until after 11 pm.
He says his rise all started with the death of his disciplinarian teacher
father when he was 16. 'If my father had been alive he might have said I
ought to take a degree.'
Instead, the young Cedric joined British Gas as a trainee engineer and has
never looked back. 'I've had a fantastic time, and I've ended up doing a job
like this.'
Yet Brown's record so far challenges those who think he is not quite big
enough for the job. He has done more in his 16 months as chief executive
than Bob Evans, the outgoing chairman, did in his three years of combining
both roles. On the eve of taking the job Brown took the unusual step of
referring British Gas to the MMC, in a final attempt to end the war of
attrition with its regulator Ofgas.
To the outside world this marked a strategic shift from the utility's old
defensive way of responding to Ofgas' increasingly frequent and damaging
attacks. Was it a carefully stage-managed initiative by the new chief
executive?
This would have been a golden opportunity to blow his own trumpet; he missed
it. 'The timing was one of those coincidences,' he says bashfully.
Brown denies that his public service background is hindering his efforts to
'create a dynamic entrepreneurial style' at British Gas. He says he has got
himself 'mentally and attitudinally over a hurdle'. He now has to do the
same for the company's other 70,000 employees. 'I want people to have the
confidence to believe that they can make things happen. Forget looking
back.' He is bringing in senior people from outside, and appears to be
gently tackling the remaining dinosaurs within the company. 'I wouldn't call
them dinosaurs,' he says, as ever anxious not to offend. 'It is just that
some people in a company like ours may be concerned about change.'
In everything he does, Brown is resolutely optimistic. Ask him about the
good and the bad aspects of his job and he will list the good things twice.
'I never have nightmares,' he says.
He seems to enjoy things that would keep other chief executives awake at
night. He even saw something good in telling the company's employees that
20,000 could lose their jobs. 'When we made the announcement we found a lot
of anger and concern in the regions. I can understand that. I decided I must
get out and talk to them.' So he spent a month on the road holding mass
meetings. 'The only thing to do was to tell it straight. The response from
talking to people was absolutely fantastic. I enjoyed it.'
Despite his popular touch, Brown has not managed to get to the top without
making some enemies along the way. 'The goody-two-shoes bit is a front,'
says one ex-British Gas manager who is now a senior executive in the oil
industry. 'He is extremely ruthless, and always acts in his own self
interest. I hardly ever knew him to contribute a new idea.'
While many outsiders agree Brown is more of a doer than a thinker, they put
such violent attacks on his personality down to professional jealousy. 'With
Brown, what you see is what you get,' says one.
If nothing else Cedric Brown is a stayer. He has been with the same company
all his adult life; he has been with the same woman even longer. 'She is
fantastically supportive,' he says, 'and she is very interested in British
Gas.' That is just as well. Joan Brown has no career of her own - she
although has raised their four children - and has been keen to help him in
his. It was she, says Brown, who urged him to take the job as manager of the
Morecambe Bay gas project in the 1980s, an assignment that made his career.
'If you don't do it, someone else will,' she had warned presciently.
From January, Brown will be taking a smaller role in presenting British Gas
to the outside world. Ultra-experienced Richard Giordano, ex-chairman of
BOC, is to take over from lacklustre Bob Evans as chairman, giving British
Gas a taste of the outside world. Does Brown resent it? Was it a job he
wanted for himself? 'British Gas has been too in-bred,' he says. 'We needed
someone with a reputation outside. It is all part of British Gas maturing.'
In any case, he reflects, if he were chairman it would mean finding another
chief executive. 'But I like being chief executive too much myself,' he
says.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Management: Culture clash on the Rio Grande - As Nafta takes
root, Damian Fraser looks at business relations between the US and Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The difference between business cultures in the US and Mexico can be trying
for both countries. They may have just signed a free trade agreement, but
business practices in the two countries are strikingly different, and will
probably remain so for some time to come.
The culture clash, as weary US executives call it, has tripped up foreign
companies thinking that business in Mexico will be much the same as that at
home. Recently several foreign firms - including Commercial Union of the UK
and Quality Coils of the US - have packed their bags, after trying and
failing to do business south of the border.
The differences range from the apparently trivial - the time lunch is taken
and for how long - to more serious issues such as the way workers should be
treated to bring out the best in them. While Americans complain that
Mexicans abhor deadlines, and defer taking decisions, Mexicans say that
Americans are always in a hurry and are too impersonal.
For those who get it right, the rewards can be great. Some US plants in
Mexico are among the most productive in the world, such as Xerox's in
Aguascalientes and Ford's in Hermosillo. Roberto Batres, head of Arthur D.
Little in Mexico, says 'the most powerful and basic force behind Nafta is
the positive experience US companies have had with Mexican workers'.
The differences in business practices partly derive from a lack of
competition in Mexico. Until the late 1980s Mexico's economy had been closed
to trade, and there was little incentive to be efficient. Companies enjoyed
huge market power, so the customer was never considered important.
Government regulations were often burdensome, so rule-bending and good
contacts in the bureaucracy were essential.
While this is now changing, many US executives are frustrated at the slow
pace of modernisation. John Atterbury, head of Southwestern Bell in Mexico,
which has a minority stake in Mexico's monopoly telephone company, says he
has repeatedly tried to increase the number of operators working in
directory services, without any success.
'Obviously any time you come into a country and have an advisory role it is
difficult. The main problem is the union rather than the management. The
unions have problems communicating with their rank and file,' he says. 'We
have to change the culture to be more customer-orientated.'
Simple administrative differences in Mexico compared with the US often
surprise American companies, says Laurence Noclain of consultants Resource
Valuation Limited. In Mexico, all bills, for example, have to be paid in
person, since no company relies on the postal service. This means that
salespeople are also in charge of collecting receivables. It is essential
that they be rewarded not just on total sales but according to their success
in collecting bills, says RVL.
Mark Ehrlich, a psychologist who prepares US executives for work in Mexico,
says some difficulties arise from different cultural traditions. Mexicans,
he says, are more inclined to accept the intrinsic worth of individuals
without demanding specific performance or achievement; Americans tend to
judge everyone as equal, and value them according to results.
Mexicans in his view rarely put abstract rules and principles over the needs
of individuals. Americans believe strongly that no one is above the law, and
avoid making exceptions. Mexicans tend to avoid confrontation for fear of
offending people, whereas, in his view, Americans 'state the facts,
regardless of the impact'.
This has important implications for businessmen. Frank Digregorio, the head
of Xerox in Mexico, says he tries to make all his Mexican workers feel part
of a community, or family. If the workers have to start at 6am, he is there
to greet them. He tries to have a meeting with the unions every two weeks,
or at least every four weeks. 'Teamwork is essential,' he says. 'You need to
communicate a passion for quality.'
Guillermo Grim, head of Canada's Northern Telecom in Mexico, says: 'You can
be cold and personal in Europe and the US and it works. In Mexico, the best
way to do things is to be warm and friendly.' He warns Americans never to
lose their temper, or embarrass Mexican colleagues in public.
The element that perhaps most frustrates foreigners in Mexico is time. When
Mexicans say 'right now' they often mean whenever they can. No one is
surprised when meetings start late, or are interrupted by long telephone
calls. Again, some of the explanation may be economic: when Mexico's economy
was closed, a shortage of spare parts and raw materials meant planning was
difficult, and improvisation essential.
Like much in Mexico, this is now changing, both in the private and public
sector. Whereas 15 years ago Luis Echeverria, then president, took pride in
arriving several hours late for everything, President Carlos Salinas is
almost always on time. The business-orientated north of Mexico is much more
focused on punctuality than the capital, and in terms of time-keeping is
almost indistinguishable from the US.
With pay and educational gaps between management and workers much wider in
Mexico than the US, Mexican companies tend to be more hierarchical, and less
responsibility is delegated. 'There are fewer people taking decisions and
more people supervising,' says Barry Wilson, head of Cadbury Schweppes in
Mexico.
Batres says that foreign companies should not mimic this kind of structure.
In his view the lack of delegation in Mexican companies partly explains why
productivity lags far behind the US. The centralised decision-making stifles
creativity, and is economically costly, he says.
'US companies have learned something that, disgracefully, most Mexicans have
not realised,' he adds. 'This is the tremendous value in the Mexican
workforce. It is the gateway to a lean manufacturing process. But the
workers have to be treated right.'

FT  13 DEC 93 / People: Zabriskie's point of departure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The question of who is going to emerge at the head of Merck when the
charismatic Roy Vagelos leaves the world's largest drugs group a year from
now gets ever more intriguing, writes Richard Waters. Two potential
front-runners have now left to run other US drug companies: president
Richard Markham to Marion Merrell Dow and, last week, head of manufacturing
John Zabriskie to Upjohn.
The shake-up following Zabriskie's departure provides few clues. True, head
of research Edward Scolnick has also been given ultimate responsibility for
manufacturing, apparently putting him in the strongest position. But two
others have also seen their roles enhanced in an apparent attempt to keep
the field wide open.
Judy Lewent, the widely-respected chief financial officer, has also been
given responsibility for public affairs, while head of strategic planning
Francis Spiegel will oversee Merck's Kelco division. All part of a plan to
give managers a more diversified background, says Vagelos.
And then there is Martin Wygod, head of Merck subsidiary Medco, whose
marketing skills and proven ability to anticipate big changes in the drugs
market have drawn praise from Vagelos. Asked recently what skills his
successor would need, Vagelos replied: 'Vision'. On that test, Wygod wins
hands down.

FT  13 DEC 93 / People: Dreyfus' bear turns bullish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Howard Stein, who over the past quarter of a century has built Dreyfus into
one of the US's biggest mutual fund groups, is nothing if not consistent,
writes Richard Waters.
The perennially cautious Stein (below) made his first big impact by
pioneering money-market funds during the 1970s, at a time of soaring
inflation and interest rates. Even today, during an equity and bond market
boom, Dreyfus (and Stein) remain temperamentally wedded to more cautious
money-market funds, though the firm has made belated efforts recently to
jump on to the equity market bandwagon.
So it was with a dash of humour that the lugubrious Stein unveiled last
week's plan to sell Dreyfus to Mellon Bank in an all-stock deal valued at
Dollars 1.7bn. Stein, a tall, patrician figure renowned for his hands-on
management of Dreyfus (he still manages some of its funds), says: 'This
67-year-old bear you have been writing about lately has finally found
something to be up about.'
Not that he remained up for long; he found time to remark on the 'potential
dangers inherent in an exploding mutual fund and financial services world',
and left it to Mellon Bank's Frank Cahouet to talk about the benefits.
For Stein, who also pioneered the development of tax-free municipal bond
funds in the US, the deal is a mixed culmination to a remarkable career. Had
it not missed out on the mutual fund boom of the past two years, Dreyfus
(with assets under management of Dollars 80bn) is unlikely to have
countenanced such a takeover. The changes will inevitably bring an end to
the family-company style Stein has always adhered to.

FT  13 DEC 93 / People: Deutsche Bank - keeping a watching brief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Looking out from Metallgesellschaft's headquarters on Reuterweg in the
centre of Frankfurt, chief executive Heinz Schimmelbusch has a clear view of
the steel-blue towers of the Deutsche Bank, writes David Waller. He has a
habit of pointing up at its skyscrapers and explaining to lunch-guests that
up there somewhere his lords and masters are keeping an eye on him.
In fact, Schimmelbusch is being watched over by Deutsche Bank - a major
shareholder in Metallgesellschaft, Germany's 20th biggest company  - but not
literally.
It was in the office of Ronaldo Schmitz, a management board director at the
bank and chairman of the Metallgesellschaft supervisory board, that
Schimmelbusch, a ruddy-faced Austrian nicknamed 'the Rasputin of Reuterweg',
together with his finance director and another senior director, met Schmitz
at 8 am on December 3. Cap-in-hand, Schimmelbusch, Germany's 1991 Manager of
the Year, asked for new lines of credit to cover a potential liquidity
crisis arising from cash payouts linked to futures contracts taken out in
the US.
Details of the talks leaked and on the following Monday Metallgesellschaft's
share price fell by 12 per cent. Metallgesellschaft and Deutsche both insist
that the liquidity problems are temporary and technical in nature - but it
seems that contacts between Schmitz and Schimmelbusch are set to become more
frequent in the weeks ahead as the bankers are kept abreast of developments.
On the face of it, the two men have a great deal in common: they are both
young by the standards of top German businessmen (Schmitz is 55,
Schimmelbusch, 49) and both have an extremely international outlook,
speaking fluent English with a north American twang. They are both outsiders
in Frankfurt: Schimmelbusch because he is Austrian, Schmitz, less because he
was born in Brazil than because he joined the board of Deutsche Bank direct
from industry. This was in 1990 after 23 years with BASF.
Temperamentally, however, they are worlds apart; though both are highly
intelligent, Schmitz is an ice-cold and calculating finance man who is head
of the bank's corporate finance activities, whereas Schimmelbusch is an
impulsive and impassioned talker, direct to the point of being uncouth.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Management: How to stay in touch with the real world - Liam
Strong, chief executive of Sears, describes his methods for sifting and
exploiting information / Tips from the Top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIAM STRONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Information is the life-blood of any business, the oxygen that feeds all
major decisions.
As technology has increased the speed with which news is made available
throughout the world, senior executives need to keep abreast of an ever
wider range of subjects. The information demands of any job can be daunting,
but it is a salutary fact that any information you require, no matter how
elusive, is undoubtedly available if you know how to find it.
I spend about 10 minutes skimming the daily papers but tend to read all the
Sunday papers. The UK press generally has very good coverage of
international events and I do not usually take international papers. The
exception to this is the Sunday edition of The New York Times which I get
occasionally because it has probably the best book review section of any
newspaper.
New York is still a city where reading the latest books before your friends
is almost a competitive sport. I flick through fashion magazines to keep up
to date with trends and advertising. I make a special point of looking at
magazines for younger readers because trends move much faster in this
sector.
So far as business reading is concerned, I am now faithful to a small number
of publications. Fortune, because it has good, well written articles and is
beautifully designed. The McKinsey Quarterly, because it is a good indicator
of current trends. And the Harvard Business Review, whose abstracts I flick
through with a view to sending copies of articles around the organisation.
I try to maintain an international network of people who see my markets from
a particular vantage point: international store designers, fashion
journalists, retail experts from leading business schools, analysts in major
market research and brokerage houses and a few venture capitalists on the
West Coast and in East Asia.
It is wise to assume that all your competitors have access to the same data
as you, so any competitive edge will be determined by how fast you can get
the available facts and how effectively you use them.
There is a danger of assimilating too much undifferentiated information on
too many different subjects. I try to ensure that our company has a working
hypothesis on developments that are likely to have an impact on our markets.
So our information gathering is therefore focused on revising and evolving
our current view of the future.
An operation as large as Sears is itself a huge repository of information
and I talk to people at all levels as often as possible. Also, the Sears
management works hard to ensure everyone is exposed to raw data. Reports and
figures that have been diluted by cool corporate language provide little of
the flavour of what is really going on.
We all sit in on research sessions, listen to interview tapes regularly and
ensure that our buying teams are getting directly involved with the customer
groups they are serving.
Another extremely effective way of discovering how well your company is
operating is to spend time with suppliers. They are in a unique position to
say how well the middle management level in your organisation is living up
to the promises made in the corporate mission statement.
Finally, I try to get out of the office as often as possible. There is no
substitute for direct experience. Few of us get out of the office into the
real world often enough.
For relaxation, I am a steady reader of fiction and usually get through a
book a week. The range is fairly eclectic. I am not a radio fan, but I do
listen to the Archers occasionally to upstage my wife who is a fanatical
follower. I rarely watch television.
I travel a great deal and aeroplanes, at least in Europe, are still a haven
from the telephone and a great place to work and catch up on reading. At
airports I usually buy a wide range of magazines including, I have to
confess, Hello].
Next Monday: George Prince of the Synectics Corporation on running better

FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Telford and Shropshire (8): A piece of heaven on
earth - Michael Cassell explains his personal passion for the county
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'Shropshire is possibly one of the most bland, boring and monotonous of all
British counties. Holidaymakers should give it a wide berth.'
This advice might come from any Salopian or fan of Shropshire who regards
the county as a little bit of heaven on earth and who wants to keep it that
way. That means scaring off visitors whose tramping feet grind Offa's Dyke
to dust or whose flashy, off-road jeeps turn ancient bridleways into
battlegrounds.
But rural life is not that simple. Shropshire might not like tourists but it
badly needs them. They provide an important source of revenue for a county
trying to combat the decline in traditional industries and, more
specifically, for growing numbers of families who supplement their income
from tourism. One in six farms in Shropshire operate at least one enterprise
for tourists and the number is growing.
It is hardly surprising. Shropshire is as beautiful and under-exploited as
it is sparsely populated, a continuing conundrum given its immediate
proximity to the industrial West Midlands. It is as though a million
Brummies, en route for the beaches of the Welsh coast, have never had time
to stop as they rush through a county too close to home to bother with.
Shropshire, in spite of its size, remains one of those places that people
find hard to put on the map. It usually ends up somewhere east of Manchester
or north of Leeds. Those who find it invariably fall in love with it.
Huge tracts of the county have been designated as areas of outstanding
natural beauty. There is rugged wilderness and rich farmland, rolling
moorland and wooded slopes; it is part-English and part-Welsh and littered
with the evidence of a troubled history imposed upon by its border with
Wales.
Countless hills are topped with ancient, earthwork fortresses; picturesque
Norman fortresses and churches are commonplace.
Rich in minerals, the north of the county was the cradle of an industrial
revolution which is still remembered and celebrated at Ironbridge Gorge,
where Blists Hill living community museum recreates the past in the shadow
of Abraham Darby's famous iron bridge.
Until comparatively recently, visitors to Shropshire were left largely to
their own devices, given the restricted support and information services
available. It was as though the county was deliberately lagging behind,
uninterested in encouraging interlopers from a less welcome, new age.
Hotels were basic, restaurants were mostly caught in a 'meat and two veg'
time-warp and shopping was unexciting. The opening of a delicatessen in one
market town was viewed rather like the arrival of a space ship.
The county still cannot claim to offer the broad range of choice available
in better developed parts of the country but it has made great strides and
can now offer high standards of hotel accommodation alongside the more
usual, and ever-popular, farmhouse style holiday base.
Despite the continuing wish to preserve the county's timelessness, there has
been a marked sea-change in attitudes. Tourism has finally been recognised
as an important element in the county's economy and the proliferation of
tourist information centres alone offers evidence of a more serious, better
co-ordinated approach to the issue.
In south Shropshire, the county council has launched a pilot scheme to
identify the economic impact of tourism on the area and detailing a strategy
and action programme for implementation. If it is successful, similar
projects will be extended to other, rural parts of the county.
The county is easily divided into two parts. To the north - above a line
drawn by the A5 - is the best known area, with its tree-fringed meres,
pleasantly rolling countryside and sandstone hills.
Ask anyone to mention a Shropshire town and the chances are they will say
Telford, possibly Shrewsbury and occasionally Oswestry.
Telford may be Shropshire's commercial 'hot spot', with its influx of
high-tech Japanese companies and expanding housing estates, but tourists can
easily afford to miss most of it.
They might, instead, try Shrewsbury, its medieval buildings struggling to
hold their own against heavy traffic, or Bridgenorth with its remarkable
panoramic views out across the River Severn. Oswestry, on the county's
north-west borders, offers a pleasant and convenient base from which to
explore a little-known corner of England.
But it is to the south of Shropshire where the best treasures lie, tucked
away in the remote, rolling hills around Clun, stretched out along the
Corvedale and hiding down the half-timbered lanes of Ludlow, surely one of
the most beautiful, unspoiled towns in Britain.
The tourist can easily spend a week or two exploring the lanes and villages
of an area which still battle to remain, as AE Housman so famously observed,
among the 'quietest places under the sun'.
Ludlow itself, perched above the River Teme retains an elegant streetscape
largely preserved over centuries. The market in castle square provides a
focal point in the shadow of the castle which was briefly home for Edward
1V's two ill-fated sons.
Nearby are endless walks across Forestry Commission land in Mortimer forest
and there is plentiful game and coarse fishing.
Drive north on the A49 past Stokesay Castle - an exquisite 13th century,
fortified manor house open to visitors - to Church Stretton, dubbed 'little
Switzerland' by the Victorians who established the town as a spa.
At the heart of the Shropshire hills, the town sits under the Long Mynd,
5,000 acres of heather-covered moors which rise like a hump-backed whale
behind it. A multi-storey antique market serves as a useful refuge on a wet
day, of which there are plenty.
To the north-west of Ludlow find Clun, the delightful stone-built village at
the head of the stunning valley which bears its name and which has a
thousand-year-old packhorse bridge.
A little further is Bishop's Castle, immortalised as 'Mallards Keep' by
novelist Mary Webb. The town has seen more robust times but its High Street
still stretches uphill dramatically to the Three Tuns pub which has its own
brewery.
Then there is Bury Ditches, the iron-age fort which stands over Clunton and
offers anyone with a bit of puff and a picnic basket one of the most
spectacular dining rooms in Britain. Shropshire is crammed full of secrets;
let's hope the tourists never find them.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Telford and Shropshire (7): Growing need to
diversify - The dependence on agriculture must be shifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shropshire may be among the most beautiful and unspoiled of all British
counties but the rural characteristics which make it so special also present
it with big economic challenges.
The county is among the most rural of all, with the number of people
employed in agriculture - at 7 per cent - more than three times the national
average. Half as many again work in agriculture-related employment and, in
the south of the county, one in three people depend for their jobs on
agriculture and associated sources of employment.
With agriculture in decline - the county's farming workforce fell by nearly
20 per cent during the 1980s and is expected to remain in decline - the
challenge is to diversify away from economic dependence on the land and put
in place an employment base which can provide long-term jobs for the local
population.
Past failure to do so means that younger people have been steadily drifting
away from the area in search of employment. The county council calculates
that the 1980s saw a net migration of 6,500 people aged 15-24, a trend which
also threatens the ability of potential employers to secure the skills base
they require to expand. The workforce left behind tends to be older and
increasingly immobile.
Alongside the decline in traditional sources of employment, rural services
are also being cut back, with schools, village shops and transport links
topping the list of casualties. In Shropshire, up to 30 per cent of all post
offices, garages and primary schools have been closed.
The county council acknowledges the need to act decisively to stem the rot
threatening the survival of rural communities and has, in spite of tough
restrictions on resources, put in place a framework intended to construct
new dimensions for Shropshire's economy.
The task is not an easy one. Shropshire may be exceptionally beautiful, but
one of the reasons it has remained so is because road links remain
comparatively poor and public commuter services are non-existent. Employers
may have taken to Telford in the north of the county, which is now tapped
into the motorway network, but places such as Ludlow to the south have found
the going much tougher when it comes to attracting new employers.
In the county's eyes, diversification of an agricultural economy means
enacting a series of integrated initiatives on several broad fronts,
including help to the existing farming community, support for new and
existing businesses and the targetted promotion of specific industries.
The focus for the county's efforts to develop the rural economy is its rural
economic development initiative (Redi) which was set up in 1992 to bring
together public, private and voluntary organisations intent upon developing
the county's rural economy. Redi's objectives are to identify economic
blackspots, devise suitable initiatives and then appoint the most suitable
agencies to deliver a response.
South Shropshire district, for example, has been designated part of the
Marches countryside employment programme, comprising a three-year pilot
scheme which aims to stimulate economic diversification through a
partnership of local organisations.
Several initiatives are in hand to improve the efficiency of remaining farms
and to offer advice on training and employment opportunities beyond
agriculture. There are moves to help farmers add value to their products to
help them to survive, as well as to develop new products.
Given the problems emanating from the county's comparative remoteness, other
policies are in place to help overcome the difficulties of physical
separation of the producer and supplier from the customer.
One of the new 'business link' centres established by the Department of
Trade and Industry is to be located in Telford but, because of the distances
between north and south, local partners in the county's business support
network are to establish a satellite business development centre in Craven
Arms, the small market town which sits astride the A49 close to Shropshire's
southern boundary.
The problem of access to advice and information, training and business
support services across such a widespread geographical region has also
encouraged the county's business development unit to organise a series of
rural business surgeries throughout the county.
This year, the unit changed its business grant scheme to give priority to
applications from the rural south and west of the county and to those
companies generating additional employment. Shropshire training and
enterprise council is now also providing business start-up and development
courses in rural locations.
Modern telecommunications systems have already been identified as one of the
keys to economic development and diversification in a county such as
Shropshire. In a taste of what may be to come, the small town of Kington,
across Shropshire's southern border in Hereford and Worcester, was this year
selected for a national pilot scheme to study the effect of state-of-the-art
communications and computer technology on the economic and social fabric of
small towns and villages.
The intention is to protect existing businesses and to attract new ones,
partially by luring back those people for whom high-tech business and rural
locations have always been seen as incompatible. The results of a 12-month
study will be closely scrutinised across the border in Shropshire.
Perhaps the most obvious candidate for development as Shropshire tries to
escape its agricultural base is tourism, which already accounts for an
estimated 10 per cent of employment and which accounts for a Pounds 20m
annual spend on the part of visitors.
The county last year launched its sustainable tourism project, intended to
achieve a sensible balance between the benefits of tourism development and
the need to conserve and protect Shropshire's natural beauty. Woe betide
county hall if it gets the balance wrong.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Telford and Shropshire (6): Incomes falling / A
look at the rural economy

John Evans laid off half his workforce earlier this year. The staff at his
700-acre hill country farm in south west Shropshire went from four to two.
He has less livestock as the subsidy cushion for sheep and cattle becomes
less comfortable. He needs fewer people to look after them.
The Evans family started on the farm as tenants three generations ago. Mr
Evans is now a freeholder and he will pass the farm on to his sons who are
already training to take it over. He is chairman of the Clun Forest branch
of the National Farmers Union and, like his peers, he is coping with changed
attitudes to agriculture.
'I was educated to maximise everything. My sons look at it from a more
economic base: you can only produce what you can sell,' he said.
On 600 acres of arable land, in the east of the county, Michael Dugdale,
chairman of the Country Landowners Association in Shropshire, also wrestles
with pressures aimed at reducing his production. He is setting land aside,
as he must and, he says, 'we grow some crops - grass for seed, turnips for
seed where there are no subsidies'. He is interested in oilseed rape for
industrial use. 'Things like this will have to come in the future.'
Farm incomes have been falling but there has been some recent relief. 'This
year farming has been a little bit better than it has over the years. The
harvest has been quite good. Price have been dropping lately but they were
good prior to the harvest,' Mr Dugdale says. Against that, corn exports have
not been as attractive as they were in 1992, largely because of currency
fluctuations.
If Shropshire is highly sensitive to both European Union agricultural policy
and increasingly to the ebb and flow of market prices, it is because the
rural economy plays a larger role in the county than in most others. The
predominant land use is agriculture, accounting for 81 per cent of the area.
Shropshire Training and Enterprise Council reported that, with construction
and motor vehicle engineering, agriculture and horticulture is a favourite
career choice for males. This choice is unwise since statistics show that
the rural workforce has been shrinking.
'Between 1981-89 it experienced the second largest fall in employment of all
industries: 1,400 jobs, a decline of 18 per cent. A loss of a further 1,500
jobs is predicted by the end of the decade,' reported Shropshire County
Council.
For all that, the number of people employed directly in agriculture is
proportionately higher than the national average. The TEC noted, on the
basis of the 1991 census, that in Shropshire agriculture accounted for 5.5
per cent of employment compared with 1.7 per cent for the West Midlands
region as a whole.
This is an ageing workforce. Nearly 66 per cent of those employed are over
35 and, of them, 75 per cent have been engaged for more than six years. Mr
Evans points out that generations often follow each other on the same farm:
grandfather to father, father to son.
But there are variations within the county. 'There is very little Grade One
land, but the arable land is good, and there's good dairy land - it gets the
rainfall,' said Mr Dugdale. 'The big area is the uplands and that's the bit
there's most concern about.'
Livestock farming is the most labour intensive and it is most common in the
uplands, where in some districts employment is far above the county average
at more than 30 per cent. Shropshire splits into three main areas, with
dairy farming in the north, arable in the east, and beef and sheep in the
south and west, the Marches. 'Milk has come out of the hills - they have
gone to beef and sheep, but on the valley bottoms, there's quite a lot of
milking,' says Mr Evans.
This sort of shift is not without its problems. 'Rising sheep numbers on
upland landscapes present ecological problems. On the Long Mynd about 18,000
sheep are grazing an area where the ecological limit is estimated to be
5,500 sheep, according to the Country Landowners Association,' he says.
But farm incomes nationally - and Shropshire is no exception - have been
falling steadily since the mid-1980s as costs have risen faster than output
prices and the European subsidy regime has become less generous and more
controlled.
Surveys of 1990-91 net farm income carried out by Manchester University and
used by the county council show that the average farm income for dairying
was Pounds 22,000 a year for Shropshire, slightly higher than the national
average. For cropping it was Pounds 17,000, slightly lower than the national
average, but for lowland livestock farming, a characteristic of the Marches,
not enough was earned to cover costs.
The loss of wealth in the Marches has led Shropshire County Council to work
with Hereford and Worcester County Council in the preparation of an
application to the European Commission asking for Objective 5b status. This
would provide funds to help with the diversification of the rural economy in
order to offset the changes which have been taking place in agriculture.
'Wales already has 5b status. To stop on the boundary is an entirely
artificial termination of assistance, says Mr Bruce Crawcour, the Shropshire
economic development officer. 'The Marches have exactly the same problems .
. . If we get 5b status, that could bring in Pounds 20m over the next five
years for Shropshire and Hereford and Worcester.'
Spending would be concentrated on providing an infrastructure which the
private sector might be induced to use. Private sector property development
in the area has largely come to a halt.
This would be a new pot of funding for an area of 160,000 people who, apart
from their dependence on Common Agricultural Policy subsidies, have never
before had European assistance.
Among Shropshire farmers there is, in any case, an ambivalent attitude
towards continental Europe. Mr Dugdale, noting the framing of the set aside
rules and their apparent evasion by farmers in some parts of continental
Europe, said: 'We feel strongly that we obey the rules and the others don't'
But for Mr Evans 'the French are the best ministers of agriculture we've
got'.

act to follow / A look at the continuing drive to win the foreign investment
that will provide employment

Trucks going to and from Telford ply the M54 day in and day out, testimony
to the hive of activities within the town. The statistics are impressive.
More than 1,000 companies have located in Telford, attracted towards the
relatively spacious lay-out of the town which puts almost every site within
five minutes of a motorway junction.
Easy access for supply vehicles also means that people can easily get to the
town to work. The town itself has a population which is younger than the
region, while the pool of economically active people within half an hour's
travelling time is forecast to grow from 552,500 in 1991 to 587,000 by 1995,
according to a study carried out by Wrekin District Council and consultants.
Telford has also benefitted from being an area which qualified for
government grants for companies setting up in the area, or existing
companies investing in expansion. That this status has now ceased can be
seen as testimony to Telford's success.
It is now the older urban areas and towns in the south which have been hit
hard by the contraction of defence and other high technology activities,
which qualify.
Publicity for the town draws heavily on the appeal it has had for overseas
companies. More than 130 companies, from 18 countries, have set up in the
town, mostly in manufacturing, or distribution, but some are service
companies.
The US tops the list, but the 24 Japanese companies - including NEC, Ricoh,
Epson, Maxell - might be said to have sealed the town's reputation.
Companies from Taiwan, one of the newer investors from Asia, are the latest
to choose Telford.
The bulk of the town's employers, however, have less exotic backgrounds.
Most have relocated from other parts of the West Midlands. Two of the most
important relocations, however, have been from the public sector: the Inland
Revenue, which set up its central computer activities in the town, and the
Land Registry. But cherries of this size are not likely to drop again for
some time.
Given the uncertainties in the British economy, the Telford Development
Agency (TDA) must still look overseas to meet the demand for jobs from
people living in and around the town. Japanese investment has slowed, German
and other European Union interest is not being confirmed. The US is also
slow. The TDA is targetting Switzerland, from where eight Telford companies
have already arrived.
Telford was picked for the proposed first British Sky Park. The concept is
for 64 houses to be built, each with a hangar at the bottom of the garden,
which would be connected to a central runway, so that executives of foreign
companies could jump into small, private planes and be in their head offices
within a couple of hours.
The suitability of Sky Park to Telford is still awaiting the verdict of the
UK environment secretary. Even if it is turned down, it offers an
interesting angle on the diverse ownership of companies in the town.
Telford's economic architects would like to see a greater diversity of
activities to serve as a bulwark against recession and the continued
rationalisation of locations by companies.
The town suffered badly in the early 1980s. The current motor industry sales
dip has taken its toll even in the past month, with the closure of the
GKN/Jaguar pressings activities, which is moving to take up Ford spare
capacity on Merseyside.
Telford wants more research facilities and would like to embrace higher
technology. A science and technology park is on the cards. The new
Shropshire campus of Wolverhampton University will help to emphasise that
the town is increasingly capable of accommodating more than the sort of
routine assembly and back office jobs that have proved vulnerable.
Unemployment in the Telford Travel to Work Area is 9.7 per cent. In the town
itself, it is at least a couple of points higher. The latest West Midlands
Survey* puts the figure for Shropshire slightly higher than the rest of the
region, where employment prospects are improving. Telford seems to be
reflecting this trend, since the rise in unemployment also lagged behind
that of the West Midlands.
With a growing population, the town has to create more jobs simply to stand
still.
But Telford is not all 'new town'. One part of north Telford - based on the
old mining settlements of Oakengates and Hadley - displays social and
economic characteristics associated with inner cities.
The isolation of its inhabitants is all the greater because the new
investment has been made close to the area. But a bid to get the area
designated for the government's City Challenge programme did not succeed.
Labour-led Wrekin Council is conscious of area's needs. With the Commission
for New Towns and several housing associations, Pounds 17m investment is
going to meet unsatisfied demand for cheaper housing, both to rent and for
purchase. The upgrading of facilities, such as shopping, is also planned for
the districts. Small factory units are being built with the help of European
regional development money.
Telford cannot afford to take its eye off the ball for a second. The town
has to look good and work well if it is to continue to attract incomers.
Its marketing people argue that much of the relocation is 'self-selecting',
determined by the need of the components sector for good sites in the
region, and that Telford has those sites.
Loss of assisted area status will not help. Competition with other areas,
particularly Wales, is intense. Furthermore, Telford tends only to come into
the picture when a company has already decided it wants to set up in
Britain.
At the same time it must continue to meet the requirements of companies that
are already established in the town. The problem with success is that it can
be a hard act to follow.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Telford and Shropshire (3): Coping with the
unexpected - Hazel Duffy finds the real test of the town plan was its
adaptability
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Unrelenting blackness hung over the back-to-back slums of Birmingham and the
aptly named Black Country well into the 1960s. The worst conditions
prevailed in factories and offices.
Then in 1968, Telford - the town was named after the inventive British
engineer - was planned as an overspill from the huge West Midlands
conurbation.
Demographers at the time were predicting that the population of the area
would grow. The new town was designed to accommodate this projected growth
and to put people in improved surroundings.
Although the idea of creating new towns to relieve population in urban areas
was unpopular in some quarters, ministers had decided that in the West
Midlands some relief had to be provided.
While a predominantly rural county, the chosen new town area of Shropshire
was far from being a rural paradise of green fields on which young
architects could unleash their ambitions.
John Madin, architect of the plan, says his first inspection of the area
revealed 'mile upon mile of derelict land running from the Severn Gorge to
the A5'. This is where the Industrial Revolution was born. Spoil heaps
littered the area and he and his partner later discovered 3,000 mine shafts.
The task was twofold: to plan for a new town and to reclaim this large tract
of derelict land. But the real test of the Madin plan - based originally on
the Dawley area, in the south of what is now Telford, and expanded by 1968
to include the area to the north - was whether it could be adapted to the
political and economic shifts which lay ahead.
The plan had to be strong but flexible. 'A plan which would, as the town was
built, accept economical and social changes from then into the 1990s. In the
early '60s that seemed a long way off. It seemed as far away and as
unrealistic as George Orwell's 1984,' says Mr Madin.
In the event, Telford had to be shaped on a smaller population than
originally planned. Instead of the forecast 225,000 by the early 1990s the
1991 census puts the population at 119,000 and this is not expected to
increase much beyond 140,000 in the next decade. Part of the reason behind
the discrepancy in the figures was that families were turning out to be
smaller than expected. Also Telford did not attract as much employment as
had been foreseen.
The Midlands economy - which it was assumed would provide most of the jobs
for Telford - did not go on expanding beyond the early 1970s. Existing
industry in the Telford area, notably the companies in the GKN complex,
shrank.
The planner Professor Colin Buchanan, whose report on traffic in towns was
published 30 years ago, was more successful in his predictions. Professor
Buchanan said roads and other facilities would have to be built to
accommodate the growing number of cars and trucks.
While, to a large extent, Professor Buchanan was ignored, Telford - the
first new town to be planned post Buchanan - shows his influence.
The original plan specified a town motorway, linked to the main roads,
connecting residential areas with industry and the town centre. A secondary
road system connected the residential areas - a group of villages, based on
the original villages in the area and supplemented by new clusters - and
access to the town centre. Local distributor roads joined up with the inner
and outer roads.
This concept was expanded to include the larger area five years later.
Pedestrians were not to be neglected. Walkways connect the housing clusters
with schools, community facilities and transport to the places of work.
Green swathes of land have survived between the villages. A park was built
in the centre.
One vital road link was missing for the first 15 years - the connection with
the M6, although Mr Madin says he had told ministers at the outset that
Telford must be connected with the new motorway network if it was to
succeed.
The M54 was opened in 1983. Continued government restrictions on industry
expanding into areas other than those of persistent high unemployment was to
prove another shackle on the growth of Telford into the 1970s.
Those who did move there, however, were greeted with houses and their own
small gardens. Tower blocks were discouraged in Telford, in spite of their
huge popularity with architects and treasurers in the cities.
The first houses were almost all built by the development corporation for
rent to standards which were higher than those the private housebuilders
could afford to specify. Space was set aside for private housing, however,
much of which has since been taken up.
Planning in the 1960s assumed that automation was going to allow for more
leisure time. The white heat of technology was to be turned to the benefit
of everybody, giving them more money and more time to enjoy themselves.
In fact, it was unemployment which struck Telford in the 1979-1982
recession. The fall in spending power and the slower than forecast growth in
population meant that investors were reluctant to take up the Telford
opportunity.
This has gradually changed as the town succeeded in persuading the
government to designate an enterprise zone within its boundaries and as the
development corporation attracted a new and more diversified group of
employers from other parts of Britain and from overseas.
The town centre has expanded and attracts shoppers from a wide area,
although the shopping centre does not look like the one that was originally
planned, which specified shops to be built on a canopy, with car parking
facilities beneath.
Instead, the shops are surrounded by open-air car parks as in out-of-town
shopping centres. But, as Telford matures developers may be persuaded to
work up improved schemes.
Many things did not turn out as planners in the 1960s had envisaged. But Mr
Madin, who now runs an international design group, believes that his
original plan - dubbed a plan for 'freedom city' in 1969 by the Birmingham
Evening Mail - was largely respected by the development corporation.
Above all, the plan proved to be flexible enough to cope with the
unexpected. And the town is gaining the self-confidence that is to be
expected of a 25-year-old.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Telford and Shropshire (4): Town loyalty is what
counts - Large companies help stabilise the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Muller, the German dairy foods group, this year will produce Pounds 125m
worth of yoghurt at its new custom-built plant at Market Drayton. Shropshire
would like to have a few more companies like it. Indeed, the county council
made abortive bids to attract Toyota, the Japanese motor manufacturer, and
Fortex, the New Zealand, meat processing company.
The reason is not far to seek. Shropshire is a county of small towns.
Loyalties lie with the towns rather than the districts of which they are a
part. Large companies help to stabilise the local economy of particular
areas. If they close, then the immediate effects can be far reaching on
relatively small communities, pushing them into a spiral of decline.
Outside Telford, the largest concentration of people and economic activity
is Shrewsbury, the county town. It is not only a modest manufacturing centre
in its own right with companies such as Perkins Engines and Vickers
Precision Components, but also a significant retailing and financial
services centre, drawing in business from both the county and mid-Wales.
Its diversity and size meant that Shrewsbury survived the recession in
better shape than the industrial centres. Analysis of unemployment on a
district basis by the West Midlands Enterprise Board showed that, at the end
of the summer, unemployment in Shrewsbury was 8.3 per cent compared with
10.6 per cent in The Wrekin, of which Telford is a part, and 10.3 per cent
in Oswestry in the north of the county.
Where there is less diversity, local unemployment rates have been higher.
When JP Woods closed its poultry processing plant in Craven Arms, south
Shropshire, with the direct loss of 500 jobs, it threw out of work 6.5 per
cent of the local labour force.
New investment to compensate for that shock to the local economic system has
not been forthcoming.
The combination of national recession and the relative decline of
agriculture led to a chain of plant closures. At Ellesmere, in the far north
of the county, closures and or reductions in plant size at companies like
Dairy Crest, Swan Hill Engineering and Ellesemere Electronics caused 600
jobs to disappear. At Express Dairies in north west Shropshire, cheese
making stopped and 140 jobs were lost.
When Farmgas, producing energy from farm waste in Bishops Castle on the
south west side of the county, transferred operations to Derbyshire, 100
jobs went. St Ivel's decision to close a yoghurt plant in Whitchurch, north
Shropshire, led to the loss of 180 jobs.
Whitchurch has become of concern to the county council whose economic
officials noted that 'there has been a chain of redundancies over the last
10 years. The town has lost its manufacturing heart. There is no longer a
major manufacturer. The biggest employer is Tesco (the supermarket group).
Market Drayton was going the same way'.
The difficulties of Whitchurch point up the more general problem of a
contracting rural economy as lower demands feeds through to the food
processing plants and the individual farms. Herein is the significance of
Muller's decision to build a Pounds 30m plant in Shropshire.
According to the county council, 70 local dairy farms are supplying milk
exclusively to Muller. The plant itself is now employing 460 people. Its
presence has helped to rebuild local business confidence which, in turn, it
is hoped, will generate more employment out of its own momentum.
But investments on the scale of Muller are rare, although, in co-operation
with the West Midlands Development Agency, the regional inward investment
organisation, the county council is approaching 550 French companies in the
hope that some might wish to set up in Shropshire. For the most part,
however, the small market towns of the county will have to seek salvation
elsewhere from the declining rural economy.
In the absence of interest from the private sector, local authorities are
trying to provide the infrastructure for the development of small scale
industry. Thus, the county council has completed serviced land schemes in
Bishop's Castle and Craven Arms. Local authorities are co-operating with the
Rural Development Commission and, where the public sector partners can spark
an interest, with the private sector to provide industrial space in, for
example, Oswestry, Ellesmere, Cleobury Mortimer and Clun.
In the case of Shrewsbury, property development is extensive, with the
county council involved in four schemes for industrial and office use. One
site has been sold to Mercury Telecommunications for a new fibre optic
centre; three acres of an 18-acre project have been sold to Massey Ferguson,
the agricultural machinery group for a sales and service centre.
Alongside infrastructural developments, there is a programme of
environmental improvement in market towns such as Ludlow and Oswestry, the
better to encourage tourism and to exploit the alluring county landscape.
Shropshire's slogan for tourists is 'Staying Off the Beaten Track'. But the
county would prefer industry to get on to it.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Telford and Shropshire (2): Fledgling finds its
wings - Hazel Duffy looks at the young town's efforts to attract newcomers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Telford was 23 years old when it was abandoned by its parent, the Telford
Development Corporation, in 1991. The corporation had been the guiding
influence of the new town from its inception. Abandonment, forced by the
government, was hard and Telford protested to no avail.
But Telford does not have to stand entirely on its own two feet - yet. The
corporation's responsibilities were split three ways. The government's own
body, the Commission for New Towns (CNT), was assigned to dispose of 2,500
acres of land that had been in the ownership of the corporation.
The Telford Development Agency, was set up by the CNT, Wrekin District
Council and Shropshire County Council to market the town and attract inward
investment. The district council resumed planning powers, except for the
acreage which is the responsibility for the CNT.
Arguably, at 23, it was time for Telford to get out from under the wings of
its parent. Those who opposed, did so on similar grounds to those used by
other new towns - they were not yet ready to be launched into a harsh and
highly competitive world without the special care implied by the development
corporation structure.
Telford has been helped to the tune of about Pounds 1bn from government over
the past 25 years, complemented by Pounds 800m investment by the private
sector. This may seem generous, given a population of only 120,000, although
others might compare it with the public subsidies that have gone to London
Docklands over just 10 years.
Young Telford has had some tough times in its short life. It was hard to
tempt manufacturers into the area when communications with the outside world
were as poor as they were until the M54 was opened in 1983. Meanwhile, the
existing industrial base in the town was crumbling fast. Tens of thousands
of Telford jobs disappeared in the recession of the early 1980s, when so
much of manufacturing industry was unable to live with a sterling exchange
rate dominated by North Sea oil.
The past 10 years have been much more successful. Telford Development
Corporation had been far sighted in the 1970s, seeing the threats to
manufacturing industry on the horizon, and reading the omens for a town
which depended on corporate parents which were located anywhere but in
Shropshire.
The corporation knew it had a lot to offer, particularly to Japanese
companies which were starting to look towards Europe, and to towns which
could offer greenfield sites. It went out and marketed, and got the
companies in.
Christopher Mackrell, the CNT's director for the West Midlands (Telford and
Redditch), and former commercial director of the Telford Development
Corporation, says that 35 per cent of Japanese investment in the UK is in
the town.
It has taken time to build up this level of confidence, however.
The plight of the town in the early 1980s was such that the Treasury agreed
to an Enterprise Zone to help the town become more competitive. The rates
holiday, and attractive terms for writing off capital expenditure against
tax liability, have helped to sell most of the 250 acres EZ. Just 20 acres
remain undeveloped. Unlike in the early days of Telford, when factories were
predominantly rented, most of the property has been bought by investors or
the occupiers of the premises.
Under the New Towns Act 1985, the CNT, which will be wound up itself in
1998, is charged with disposing of a land bank equal to 2,500 acres. It is
all outside the EZ. The land is spread mostly around the outer ring of the
town. It already has outline planning permission for development, either for
housing, or employment, most for industry, but also for commercial purposes.
Sites can be assembled if this is what a client wants.
The grant of formal planning consent for specific projects lies with the
CNT, in conjunction with the Environment Secretary. However, it is highly
unlikely that an end purpose which did not meet the approval of the District
Council would be permitted.
The land bank is important from the point of view of the West Midlands
region. Greenfield sites are a rarity, given the government's leaning
towards disallowing further development of green belt land.
The Telford land bank, according to the Telford Development Agency,
represents about 40 per cent of good quality land in the region. It is a
powerful marketing tool within the region, although Telford has plenty of
competition from outside the region.
Industrial land is priced at about Pounds 115,000-Pounds 125,000 an acre,
land for housing at nearly Pounds 200,000 an acre, prices which, Mr Mackrell
says, 'provide a yardstick for negotiated disposals', to current occupiers,
as well as to prospective developers.
In the two years, since the disposal edict was issued, Pounds 20m has been
realised in land and property sales by the CNT in Telford. This breaks down
into about 100 acres sold for housing, 25 acres for employment.
Wrekin District Council also owns property, worth about Pounds 40m, which it
rents out at Pounds 3.50 to Pounds 4.50 a sq ft for industrial users, and
between Pounds 6.50 and Pounds 10.50 a sq ft for offices. The Council works
closely with the CNT. It is content to let the CNT, with the Development
Agency, market Telford, acknowledging that they have far superior networks
of international contacts than a district council could muster.
Among existing businesses, however, the Council is working hard to promote
networking. Under the old system, the Development Corporation was
responsible largely for external relations with the private sector. Now,
increasingly, it is the council.
David Hutchison, chief executive, admits that they are still learning. But
he points proudly to the Business Link (One Stop Shop), opening next year,
which Telford has managed to secure with strong Council input. Before the
end of the decade, and the wind up of the CNT, Wrekin will have acquired the
skills of parenting.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Telford and Shropshire (1): Building on success
not an easy task - While the development of Telford has attracted overseas
investment and brought new high-tech industries into the county, the worry
is that the pace of indigenous growth is too slow to create enough jobs for
an expanding population
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Mitac, the Taiwanese computer company, will today open its Pounds 3.8m new
plant in Telford. At the same time, the US group, Augat, which already makes
telecommunications equipment in the town, will announce a factory expansion
 -so that it can make automotive components - and the establishment locally
of its European headquarters.
Telford would perhaps have preferred larger investments than these with
which to celebrate the anniversary of its creation 25 years ago as one of
Britain's new towns, with a brief to provide new homes and jobs for
overspill population from the industrial West Midlands. Modern factories and
office blocks stand as testimony to its achievements but recession at home
and overseas has slowed the inward movement of companies.
Since 1968, more than 130 companies from 18 different countries have settled
in Telford. Most came from elsewhere in the West Midlands but US groups were
also among the early arrivals, and in the 1980s the pace of Japanese
investment quickened. About 35 per cent of all Japanese companies investing
in the UK have come to Telford, including NEC, Ricoh, Maxell, and Epson. The
hope now is that Telford will draw companies from the growing economies of
the Pacific Rim.
Telford's attractiveness owes much to the availability of land, the ease of
movement around the area, and the local workforce's willingness to adapt.
It has been able to meet the needs of high-tech industries requiring open
space, in a way which the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation cannot.
But the town has not escaped the effects of recession and, as the UK economy
tentatively resumes growth, the immediate prospects for Telford and
Shropshire are mixed. Expansion in the short term is likely to depend more
on indigenous growth than on injections of capital from outside the region,
yet the pace of such growth seems certain to be slower than needed to make
an impact on unemployment, or to cope with the demands of an increasing
population.
Employment growth has recently been weak. The latest West Midlands business
survey carried out by Wolverhampton Business School concluded that growth
had taken place everywhere in the West Midlands except Shropshire.
However, the same report showed that the proportion of companies in the
county reporting increased sales was the highest in the region. 'You would
not expect everything to be smooth coming out of recession,' Professor David
Walker, head of the centre for business research at Wolverhampton
University, argues. 'Until now, Shropshire has fared reasonably well. It
does not have heavy industry winding down. It has shown growth on the level
of Coventry, but it is not so dependent on the motor industry.'
Indeed, heavy industry wound down decades ago, leaving a legacy of disused
mine shafts and derelict land. Clearance of that land as part of the
development of Telford made it possible to attract a new generation of
light, high technology industries and confirmed Telford's position as the
industrial centre of the county.
It has been a costly process. About Pounds 1bn of public funding has gone to
Telford, drawing in a further Pounds 800m in private sector investment but
the town must now fend for itself without subsidy. The main incentives which
Telford was once able to offer potential investors have been removed: its
intermediate status as an assisted area disappeared this year, its
enterprise zone with the associated capital allowances and rate rebates is
not only expiring, but is nearly full.
The development corporation which guided Telford's development has been
wound up. 'It was an engine fuelled by vast sums of money. Taking it away
leaves a hole,' says Stephen Jury, chief executive of the Shropshire
Training and Enterprise Council.
Responsibility for promoting the area has passed to the Telford Development
Agency, established by the Commission for New Towns, Wrekin district
council, the local authority for the area, and Shropshire county council. It
is continuing to target existing sources of inward investment and new
potential investors.
A scheme designed to appeal to internationally mobile executives and their
companies is 'Sky Park'. The plan, currently with the Environment Secretary,
envisages a development of 63 homes with hangars at the bottom of each
garden linked to a central runway which executives could use to commute to
business destinations.
More generally, however, the town must now rely on its basic advantages to
attract newcomers: the availability of greenfield sites and labour, and easy
access to new office accommodation.
At county level, too, concern is focused on establishing factory space and
communications for new corporate residents. 'Once the infrastructure is
there, people will come,' says Bruce Crawcour, economic development officer
at the county council.
The challenge of providing enough jobs for a growing population is, however,
a big one. A study carried out by Warwick University for the Tec predicts
population growth in the county of 34,200 during the decade to 2001.
'A substantial number of jobs will have to be created. It is difficult to
see how this can be achieved without inward investment,' warns Mr Jury. If
employment growth does not resume, according to the Warwick study, 'the
projected pattern of population change implies that the Tec area will
contain substantial numbers of unemployed people aged over 35 by 2001,
(particularly in) areas such as Telford which have attracted migrants who
will be in this age group by 2001.'
Telford can be expected to grow, but the greater number of jobs will not be
in manufacturing, where higher productivity is leading to less rather than
more employment, but in the services sector. Thus, the growth of tourism and
leisure, allied to the expansion of the retail sector, is vital.
So far, in the county as a whole adjustment to a slowly rising population
and the recession has been relatively smooth. Unemployment rates have
generally been below the national average.
The highest rates of unemployment have been in The Wrekin, and in Oswestry,
both dependent on manufacturing. Both have pockets of structural
unemployment, with rates at about 20 per cent. Indeed, concern in Telford
about deprivation was such that the Wrekin Council made a bid -
unsuccessfully - for City Challenge funding from the government.
Some farms in the hill areas have been running at a loss and as wealth has
diminished, services have been run down and some communities have found
themselves locked into a spiral of decline.
'The most important thing for strengthening the rural economy is to have a
first class telecommunications network. This is the way of removing rural
inaccessibility,' says Mr Crawcour.
The search, therefore, is for economic diversification, and, if it could be
achieved, stronger local control over important economic decisions affecting
the county.
In a county where companies employing more than 200 workers make up just 1
per cent of all companies, Telford is the centre for the larger
manufacturing groups, and from the New Town's earliest days the growing
diversity of their ownership has been a source of strength and of innovation
in product development.
But, it is also a source of weakness in that local managers often have only
immediate operational control. The decision to move the work of Venture
Pressings to Halewood was taken, for example at Ford headquarters, and not
in Telford where the factory is based.
Mingled with the satisfaction that companies have set up operations in
Shropshire is the fear of instability that comes from being largely a branch
economy as far as bigger companies are concerned. 'We suffer from the lack
of large companies owned and managed in the county,' Mr Crawcour says.
To create a stronger economic infrastructure for growth in the south and
west of Shropshire, the county council is applying to the European
Commission for Pounds 20m of funds. It is a modest sum compared with that
which helped to create - in the development of Telford - a focal point for
growth in the Midlands.
The hope, however is that it will generate conditions in which further
growth can take place.

FT  13 DEC 93 / The Business Traveller: More leg room for your money -
Gordon Cramb discovers that there is a bonus for some KLM business-class
passengers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those with a long-haul flight ahead of them this winter, and an employer who
is prepared to pay for a business-class ticket but no more, might wish to
consider going Dutch.
On KLM, you could land a first class-type seat for the journey, without
forking out extra cash for the privilege. The Netherlands flag carrier last
month abolished its unprofitable Royal Class. It is reconfiguring its fleet
to add seats in the tourist cabin and move business class to the front of
the air-craft.
The process will take until March, and the airline has changed only one
aircraft so far. On the rest, the former first-class cabin is untouched
except for the menus. So for a club-level fare, business travellers who
strike lucky can stretch out for a near-horizontal sleep.
So how can you get one of these seats, rather than a more closely packed and
steeply angled one in the regular business-class section?
The best way is to request a seat allocation when booking, and ask about the
configuration (as a rule, if it is an old-style interior, make sure the row
number is in single figures). KLM is being a bit coy about this facility and
its agents may need some prodding.
One way to improve your chances, and to benefit for further flights besides,
is to join the airline's frequent flyer programme. The scheme - inevitably,
it is called Flying Dutchman - may grant priority in seat preference and is
offering double its usual credits for business-class travellers through the
winter season, equivalent to those previously accorded to Royal Class
passengers.
There is some inconvenience: the transit through Amsterdam's Schiphol
airport can mean a long walk from gate to gate. You may be additionally
hampered at the moment by building works. But you could score enough points
for a free ticket back there, to stroll the city's canals another time.

FT  13 DEC 93 / The Business Traveller: Pack a sense of humour - Gillian
Tett explains how best to survive air travel in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing breaks the ice in a Moscow meeting quite like the word 'Aeroflot'.
Of all the hazards dogging western business in Russia, flying has long been
the most colourful.
There is the legendary tale of the traveller who set off to fly to Volgograd
 -and was deposited 3,000m away in Vladivostok instead. There are the every
day epics of 12-hour delays, pet goats in the cabin and tarted-up air
hostesses. And there is my own dinner party piece of the occasion I argued
myself onto a flight to Baku - and found that other passengers were sitting
in all the seats, luggage racks and toilets, which meant I had to squeeze in
behind the pilot at the controls.
Now the good news for the faint-hearted is that alternatives are available.
In the last two years Aeroflot, once the monoply airline of the Soviet
Union, has been broken up into 160 regional and republican carriers. Most
still operate under the flag of Aeroflot, and sell tickets to foreigners
through the central Aeroflot ticket agencies. The Russian transport ministry
has recently urged the smallest carriers to re-unite, possibly as holding
companies. However, the service of the different carriers varies
significantly, not least because of the varying availability of petrol.
Meanwhile, 161 entirely new airlines have been registered as well, with two
now offering scheduled services competing with Aeroflot.
One is the Transaero group, which offers reasonably priced flights between
Moscow, Riga, Kiev, Alma Aty and other cities. The airline uses two Boeings
and two Ilyushin 86's, mercifully redesigned inside. The hub is Sheremetevo
1 airport, one of the less unpleasant in Moscow. The hostesses, trained by
Air France, are smart. And instead of the standard Aeroflot food - rubbery
chicken squares and strange, fizzy juices - the fare on a recent Transaero
flight from Alma Aty was a herb omelette, complete with button mushrooms.
The second new private company is the Chance airline, which flies three
times a week between Moscow and Tblisi.
Chance's Dollars 150 service, like its name, is memorable. The tickets
themselves are as flimsy as loo paper, but passengers are offered champagne
and roses. The airline is too young to have established a meaningful safety
record - but that is unlikely to deter anyone who has chosen to travel to
Georgia.
A third alternative is to charter your own aircraft. Private jets can be
hired from most west European countries, and if there are several passengers
and destinations on the trip, the cost may not be too discouraging.
Aeroflot will also arrange charters and Russian army units sometimes offer
their own aircraft for private flights, particularly in far-flung regions.
If none of these options is feasible, then you will have to use a scheduled
flight from one of the former Aeroflot carriers. Even here, however, there
are tactics which can help on any flight:
If you are new to Russia, travel with a local. Having someone who can argue
with officials can determine whether the journey is simply novel or nasty.
Many airport officials outside large cities like Moscow will not speak
English, and the system for check-in can be bewildering. Equip yourself for
long delays, wherever you are flying. Take some food. Loo paper and whisky
are also helpful. Above all, bring something utterly absorbing to read.
Travel light. Recovering lost checked-in luggage is difficult. Although
there is little leg room in the cabin, you can usually store extra hand
luggage at the front or rear. If your aircraft suddenly dives, do not
immediately panic. Remember Aeroflot pilots are trained fighter pilots,
which makes them highly skilled. Finally, hang on to your sense of humour.
Most flights do arrive, eventually.

Concorde flops: A special 32 hour Concorde flight around the world to
celebrate the New Year was cancelled after only 10 people expressed an
interest in the tickets selling at Dollars 25,400 each.
Air deal: Britain and Latvia signed an air treaty last week which allows
scheduled flights between the two countries for the first time.
Test case: A High Court case by a schoolgirl and her teacher against the
Association of British Travel Agents over a Pounds 10 holiday insurance
premium that was not repaid when one of its members went out of business
ended last week. The judge has not said when he will make a ruling.
Mr Robert Webb QC, counsel for the pair said there were about 25,000 cases,
with a value of Pounds 250,000, resting on the outcome which had wide
implications for the industry.
Smoke Free by 1995: Cathay Pacific has taken a step closer to becoming a
'smoke-free' airline. From March 1994, all Cathay Pacific flights between
Hong Kong and Europe will be no-smoking. This will bring the total
no-smoking flights operated by the airline to 70%.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Athens: Bus drivers on Friday called a halt to a two-day-old strike as a
Christmas goodwill gesture, but pledged to resume their protests at
government plans to renationalise the city's services.
The drivers, most of whom bought their buses in August 1992 when the
conservative government privatised Athens's bus service, called a strike
over the new Socialist government's plan to reverse the privatisation.
Sweden: Almost all Swedish air traffic control could be paralysed by a
threatened stike of 5,000 controllers and a possible lock out by employers
on December 13 and December 20 in a wage dispute.

FT  13 DEC 93 / The Business Traveller: Tunnel vision realised - Travel
Update
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hardened businessmen and journalists burst into spontaneous applause on
Friday evening as the driver announced that we were travelling at 100mph 40
metres below the seabed of the Channel on the first public journey through
the channel tunnel, writes Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent, who
was with the group.
The new Eurostar trains, which will not be operating commercially until next
summer, will transport passengers in just three hours from the centre of
London to the centre of Paris. The trains are still being tested. Friday's
historic trip through the tunnel was made in a Thameslink Sprinter.
It may have been historic but it was not spectacular. After 30 minutes one
tunnel looks much like another.
But the ride was exceptionally smooth. With the air-conditioning working, a
guaranteed seat and a meal, it will be very comfortable.
Return fares to Paris and Brussels will match those charged by airlines. The
first consumer test suggests the tunnel will be a real alternative for the
business traveller crossing the channel - that is if British Rail can sort
out the journey from London to the tunnel.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Building review attacks abuses and lack of trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guidelines aimed at reducing contract abuses and litigation in the Pounds
45bn-a-year construction industry will be published today as the first stage
in a wide-ranging review of business practices in the sector.
The review, jointly financed by construction employers and the Department of
the Environment, is thought to be highly critical of adversarial attitudes
between companies and clients which it says have soured commercial
relationships and have damaged the industry's reputation.
The interim report by Sir Michael Latham, the former Conservative MP and
ex-director of the Housebuilders' Federation who led the review, is
understood to refer to a climate of deep mistrust and a disturbing
atmosphere which had led to considerable dissatisfaction in the industry.
The guidelines are designed to improve ways in which property developers and
other private-sector and public-sector customers award contracts and make
payments to construction companies.
A second, more detailed report due to published next summer will examine
ways in which contractors and others working in the building industry can
improve practices and reduce friction in commercial relationships.
DoE officials believe the chances that the review's recommendations will be
implemented are boosted by the broad support it has received. It has been
supported by construction industry leaders as well as representatives of
some of its most important customers including property companies, local
authorities, banks and large industrial companies.
Sir Michael's interim report is expected to recommend that customers seeking
better value should consider reducing the size of tender lists. In one
instance the review body was told that a local authority had sought bids
from 28 companies for a heating and ventilation contract worth less than
Pounds 250,000.
This size of competition for small or medium-size contracts is wasteful when
the customer must have known that many of those asked to bid had very little
chance of success. Companies required to spend large sums pursuing
unnecessary bids will try to recover this expenditure on jobs they do win,
the report is understood to conclude.
It is also expected to criticise customers who drive prices down to
uneconomic levels in the belief that they are getting the best value. It
warns that contractors faced with a loss may try to cut corners.
Construction companies may also seek to recoup losses by overcharging
clients for late design changes.
The report is also understood to criticise customers who delay payments and
thereby put contractors and sub-contractors at risk.
A report by Construction Intelligence Data, an independent research and
credit rating organisation, warned earlier this year that 60 per cent of all
construction contracts were paid late.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Skill shortages threaten upturn in W Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Skill shortages have begun to appear in the west Midlands as the regional
economy, still heavily dependent on manufacturing, starts a jerky recovery
from recession.
Fears that such shortages, a characteristic of the region during the growth
years of the 1980s and present until late 1990, could inhibit sustained
recovery have been fuelled by a series of reports and supported by anecdotal
evidence.
'If we keep on going with a few percentage points of growth, that can be
coped with. If there is an upsurge, the problems will be there,' warned Mr
Bill Nicholls, the training specialist at the Engineering Employers'
Federation West Midlands.
Last year, the consultants Cambridge Econometrics forecast that, of all the
UK regions, the west Midlands would be the most likely to be hindered by
skill shortages. By June this year the West Midlands Business Survey,
conducted by Wolverhampton Business School, was reporting a rise from 8 per
cent to 12 per cent over the previous six months in companies facing
difficulties in finding the right staff.
The Confederation of British Industry and BSL, consultants, reported during
the summer that more employers in the west Midlands and Wales - 13 per cent
 -than in any other regions expected skill shortages to limit output over
the following four months.
Against the background of a long-standing regional shortage of managerial
and professional skills, the Department of Employment said last month:
'There are now more lower and intermediate-level occupations being reported
as difficult to fill.'
But the position differs. There is no present indication of skill shortages
in Birmingham or Wolverhampton. In Solihull, the Jobcentre sometimes finds
it difficult to fill specialised positions, for example, some computer
software specialists. In Madeley, Telford, the Jobcentre has filled nearly
every vacancy - 'occasionally we have difficulty with specialised
engineering things'.
There are reports from Sandwell of problems in filling skilled engineering
vacancies. Dudley is short especially of technical sales, setters and
draughting personnel. Central England Training and Enterprise Council
(Centec), based in Redditch, has surveyed 600 companies and found 21 per
cent with vacancies which are hard to fill, half of which are professional
and managerial and a third are engineering technicians.
Information, however, is imprecise. The Department of Employment has reduced
in number its classification of occupations so its statistics are more
vague. Further, computer glitches have deprived it of information about the
length of time vacancies are available.
Employment analysts noted that difficulty in filling a vacancy could reflect
low pay, bad conditions, unsocial hours or other factors. They also pointed
to a mismatch between the presence of skills and the presence of work.
Slimma, the women's clothing manufacturer, is expanding from its base in
Leek to Cannock, Staffs, because of a shortage of machinists. Mr Gary Green,
operations manager of Grau, the Redditch anti-lock braking system maker,
said he had had vacancies for software engineers for a year. 'There are no
major universities nearby you can feed off. The nearest is Birmingham and
there you go into a pool with companies like Lucas trying to pull people
off.'

FT  13 DEC 93 / Pay rises fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Median basic pay rises in Britain fell to 2 per cent for the three months to
the end of October, according to provisional data from Industrial Relations
Services published yesterday, Robert Taylor writes.
That rate was the same as for the three months to June, which was the lowest
level for at least nine years. Median pay awards across the whole economy
have fluctuated within a 2 per cent to 2.3 per cent band for the seven
months since April.
IRS figures show a noticeable drop in the monthly level of pay rises in the
upper quartile of private-sector workers - down to 2.5 per cent in October
from 3 per cent in September.
By contrast there was a slight increase, from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent,
in the same period in the lower quartile.
The provisional data also reveal a widening gap between the level of pay
deals in manufacturing compared with those in the private services sector.
Basic manufacturing wage rate rises this year have been running at least 0.5
per cent higher than those in private services with an average gap for the
year of 0.8 per cent.
The latest figures contain a higher-than-normal proportion of public-sector
pay awards - affected by the government's 1.5 per cent wages policy - and a
smaller number of basic pay rises in the private manufacturing sector.
The IRS figures refer to the level of recorded basic settlements and not to
the growth in total average earnings. The findings are based on only 38 pay
reviews in October.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Massey tractor sales rise 22%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK sales of tractors from Massey Ferguson's plant in Coventry will be 22 per
cent higher this year than last, reflecting an overall surge in the
purchases of farm machinery.
The group said that by the end of the year it would have sold 2,300
Coventry-made tractors in Britain compared with 1,880 last year. A further
2,000 Massey Ferguson tractors made in Beauvais, France, would also be sold
in the UK.
The company claims to be the largest tractor producer in the UK, but usually
80 per cent of its output is exported. The domestic market leader is thought
to be Ford, followed by Massey Ferguson and then Case and Deere. Between
them the four supply 80 per cent of the market.
The Agricultural Engineers Association estimated that this year UK farmers
will buy 18,000 tractors and that there will be sales of a further 1,100
compact tractors with a power output of less than 40 horsepower. Total sales
for 1993 of 19,100 compare with 14,296 in 1992, the most depressed year for
tractor sales since the second world war.
The UK market has been exceptional in Europe. 'Farmers have had money put in
their pockets,' said Mr Aaron Jones, managing director of Massey Ferguson.
'UK farming has had a good year, but it has been fortuitous. This is derived
from the downward movement of sterling against the Ecu,' said Mr Chris
Evans, chief economist of the Agricultural Engineers Association. This year
farmers have on average received about 15 per cent more revenue than they
expected, he added.
The availability of cash coincided with latent demand built up because of
low equipment purchases in recent years and the opportunity to take 40 per
cent capital allowances until last November.
Massey Ferguson noted a start to the domestic buying surge last April. The
rise in sales was one factor behind revisions to its production schedules
and the hiring of 160 fixed-contract staff to supplement its normal
1,550-strong workforce.
In early 1993 the Coventry plant expected to build 13,500 tractors this
year. Now it expects annual output to be about 17,000 for markets worldwide
as, Mr Jones claimed, Massey Ferguson wins a larger market share in Europe
and as distributors in Europe and North America build up stocks.

FT  13 DEC 93 / TUC wins cash for works groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union has agreed to finance the Trades Union Congress in its
efforts to win support for works councils inside Britain's largest
transnational corporations.
The EU move, aimed at encouraging employers and unions to set up
consultative bodies within British companies, is likely to infuriate the
government.
British ministers strongly opposed the EU directive on works councils, which
is likely to come into force by the end of next year.
The EU - at the instigation of the European Parliament - has allocated
Pounds 190,000 to the TUC which it can spend next year on campaigning for
works councils among the largest British companies.
The TUC has appointed Mr Nick Clark, an official from the GMPU print union,
as a full-time officer to carry out the work. The EU has spent about Pounds
24m over the past two years funding meetings of workers employed by
transnationals in preparation for the works council directive.
The TUC believes large British companies will be affected by the directive
in spite of the opt-out from the social chapter secured two years ago by the
British government.
Britain's large transnationals with more than 100 employees in two or more
EU countries will have to provide a works council for their workers in the
other 11 states of the EU and also in Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway
which are members of the European Economic Area.
The TUC believes British companies will have to include their British
workers on the works councils because it will be impracticable for them to
create such bodies for their foreign employees alone.
Many of Britain's more progressive large blue-chip companies with well
established worker participation schemes, such as Imperial Chemical
Industries and Unilever, will be urged by the TUC to establish a
European-wide works council for all their employees as soon as possible.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Pressure for Bank autonomy grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will come under pressure this week to cede greater
independence to the Bank of England.
The all-party Commons Treasury committee is expected to call for a degree of
autonomy that would bring the Bank more into line with the New Zealand
model, under which the government cannot directly determine the Reserve
Bank's monetary policy.
Its report, to be published on Thursday, will coincide with the publication
of a private member's bill by one of its members, Tory MP Mr Nicholas
Budgen, as part of his drive for greater Bank of England transparency.
Mr Budgen, a leading Euro-rebel, said: 'The problem at the moment is that
monetary policy can be changed without anyone knowing what is happening.'
Mr Budgen argues that publication of monetary policy guidelines would give
the Commons more, not less, control over the Bank.
In New Zealand the government has a contract with the central bank
specifying a target inflation range. Failure to achieve this can result in
dismissal of the governor.
Sir Robin Butler, the UK cabinet secretary, is to visit New Zealand next
month and is expected to examine the workings of the Reserve Bank.
Although Mr Budgen's bill has little chance of becoming law, it will add to
the debate on the issue. It is due for a second reading on January 28.
The Treasury committee is understood to have rejected independence as in
Germany's Bundesbank, largely because it operates under such a different
political system. The New Zealand system, however, is similar to that of the
UK. While the committee's report stops short of recommending the New Zealand
model, it favours giving the Bank autonomy.

<TEXT>
The number of large companies which use unions to communicate with their
employees appears to be rising after a sharp fall in the late 1980s, a
survey by employee communications consultancy Vista has found, David
Goodhart writes.
About 60 per cent of 375 of Britain's biggest companies questioned last
month said they used unions to brief staff. This compares with 53 per cent
in a 1989 survey, which was sharply down from 62 per cent in 1985.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Irish rivals both aim at Major: Disquiet surfaces in Dublin
as Ulster unionists threaten to withdraw parliamentary backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night faced conflicting pressures from the Dublin
government and the Ulster unionists as the weekend murder by the IRA of two
Northern Ireland policemen cast a shadow over the Anglo-Irish peace
initiative.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said that after their
Brussels' meeting he had agreed with Mr Major some '70 per cent' of the
proposed joint statement they hope might persuade the IRA to end violence.
That raised expectations that two leaders could hold a further meeting this
week to clear the remaining obstacles.
Officials from both governments worked through the weekend on the text and
Mr Major and Mr Reynolds plan to speak on the phone later today to assess
progress.
As Mr Major consulted cabinet colleagues, Downing Street still appeared
hopeful of a pre-Christmas accord.
But the Irish prime minister warned he was not prepared to sign an anodyne
declaration which would not offer a reasonable prospect of a permanent
cessation of violence.
Amid pessimism in Dublin on the prospects for a substantive statement, Mr
Reynolds said that guarantees for the Protestant majority in Ulster had to
be balanced by recognition of the nationalist aspirations of a large
minority.
The key differences now centre on the issues of self-determination and on
Dublin's proposal for an all-Ireland convention, involving all political
parties north and south. Mr Reynolds signalled in Brussels that he could
accept a statement which did not explicitly endorse the 'value' of eventual
unity. But Dublin's acceptance of a unionist veto over any change in
Ulster's status had to be set in the wider context of Irish
self-determination.
Irish government officials reaffirmed yesterday that Mr Reynolds 'will not
sign a statement that will not achieve the result of a cessation of
violence'. If agreement could not be reached, a final pre-Christmas summit
was unlikely.
The two governments' task in attempting to square the circle between
unionist fears and nationalist terrorism was underlined by a blunt warning
from two leading members of the Ulster Unionist party directed at Mr Major.
Mr John Taylor, MP for Stangford, said any move towards a united Ireland
would prompt his party to threaten the government's majority by opposing it
in any vote of confidence. Mr David Trimble, MP for Upper Bann, accused Mr
Reynolds of 'effectively acting on behalf of the IRA'. He said Mr Reynolds,
by taking on the Hume-Adams proposals, was talking about 'surrender by
stages' to the IRA.
He rejected any concessions to Mr Reynolds's proposals and ruled out the
possibility of agreeing to a peace conference representing all parties in
the republic and Northern Ireland.
But Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA,
repeated his call for Irish self-determination. He said acceptance of the
need for majority consent in Northern Ireland had to be seen as an interim
part of a process towards national self-determination.
Meanwhile Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, said that the IRA had nothing to offer Northern Ireland except
death and suffering.
His comments came after two police officers were shot dead by IRA gunmen at
Five-miletown in Fermanagh. Several people were arrested.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Drugs R&amp;D is at risk, says Pfizer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK is becoming increas-ingly unattractive to drugs groups, according to
the largest foreign-based employer of pharmaceuticals scientists in Britain.
Pfizer, the US drugs group, says the collapse of the science base,
increasing government interference in National Health Service drugs spending
and growing violence from animal rights activists are undermining Britain as
a base for pharmaceuticals companies.
Dr Peter Ringrose, senior vice-president of medicine R&amp;D at Pfizer Europe,
warned that the UK's pre-eminence in medicines research was under threat. He
said: 'Six of the world's top 20 selling drugs were discovered in the UK.
Britain has the highest per capita number of Nobel prizes of any country in
the world. But there are now rising concerns about the UK as a site for
pharmaceuticals research in the future.'
Pfizer's R&amp;D centre at Sandwich, Kent, employs 1,250 research staff and is
the largest investment by a US drugs group anywhere in the world. The
facilities, which have received Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) of investment
over the past five years, have doubled in size since 1987.
But Dr Ringrose said such investment could be threatened by government
controls on prices and demand for drugs. These included a 2.5 per cent price
cut last month and the introduction earlier this year of lists of products
that NHS doctors could no longer prescribe. In effect the NHS would only
allow doctors to prescribe new products whose prices had been cut to the
same level as older products.
He said: 'When the price of a new product is determined by a basket of old
generic products, what is the point of developing the new drug?'
Dr Ringrose said the attractiveness of the UK for drugs research was also
being undermined by the dire state of the academic infrastructure. The
government's white paper on science, engineering and technology was
encouraging, 'but so much damage was done to British universities during the
1980s that what is required is more than platitudinous comments from
ministers'.
However, Dr Ringrose said that animal rights violence was becoming the UK
drugs industry's biggest concern. 'If you stop the use of animals you can
shut down most of UK pharmaceuticals research. Ironically, Britain has among
the tightest regulations on the use of animals.'
Mr Hugh O'Connor, chairman and managing director of Pfizer UK, said:
'Throughout Europe there will have to be rationalisation. What does not make
sense is to manufacture on eight sites.' The company now manufactures in the
UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Italy. It recently sold
its Greek manufacturing operations.
The increasingly difficult environment for drugs groups could encourage them
to cut manufacturing, endangering the UK's Pounds 1.3bn trade surplus in
pharmaceuticals last year.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Restore link with Iraq, says Heath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's diplomatic links with Iraq should be restored for political and
humanitarian reasons, Sir Edward Heath said yesterday.
The former prime minister said the diplomatic situation was unhelpful to
British interests. He has just returned from Baghdad where his talks with
Iraqi president Saddam Hussein led to the release of three Britons serving
long prison sentences on charges of entering the country illegally.
He told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: 'Our ambassador in Amman and
his staff do everything they can from outside. It is not the same thing as
being there on the spot and being able to use our judgment about what is
going on.'
He said that the Russian charge d'affaires was looking after British
interests and doing a good job. 'But why do our activities have to be
handled by the Russian charge?' he demanded.
Sir Edward warned that UN sanctions were not affecting the Iraqi president's
standing in the country. 'This action does not make Saddam's people hostile
to him. It puts them on his side because they resent very strongly the way
they are being treated.'
Sir Edward urged that talks should start with Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi
deputy prime minister. The situation was alienating other Middle Eastern
countries which wanted to resume business with Iraq.
Meanwhile, Lady Olga Maitland, Conservative MP for Sutton and Cheam, called
for international action to free foreign nationals still held in Iraq after
the Gulf war. She said there were 625 Kuwaitis and 61 foreign nationals from
more than 30 countries in Iraqi jails.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Crunch time for Swansea staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week about 40 executives from EDS-Scicon, the US computing services
company, will arrive in Swansea to begin interviews that will mark the end
of DVOIT, the Department of Transport information-technology agency. The
organisation is being assimilated into EDS-Scicon; its staff will either
become EDS-Scicon employees or leave.
DVOIT is the first government agency to be privatised under the government's
current round of civil service reforms. Its experience may illuminate the
way ahead for dozens of Whitehall agencies responsible for everything from
defence accounts to passports.
Some potential buyers fear, however, that they will court unpopularity if
they are forced to cut jobs heavily in a search for economies.
'If you go around butchering people, you do not survive long in the market,'
says Mr Charles Cox of Hoskyns, a company which withdrew from the bidding
for DVOIT. Others worry that the terms of the contracts are being set too
rigidly.
The principal aim of EDS-Scicon's purchase of DVOIT is profitability through
efficiency and cost-saving. Mr Marwin Rifka, head of EDS-Scicon's
public-sector division, was unwilling to set a figure on the savings he
believed could be achieved by absorbing DVOIT, but he said it would be above
the 25 per cent the government was demanding from all bidders for the
agency.
Immediate savings would be felt by DVOIT's primary customers, which include
the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, the Vehicle Inspectorate, the
Driving Standards Agency and the Department of Transport. Some 70 per cent
of DVOIT's work is carried out for the DVLA.
This first round of cost-cutting will be achieved using methods traditional
among facilities management companies, of which EDS-Scicon is the world's
largest example. DVOIT's workload will be squeezed on to EDS-Scicon's
computers at Stockley Park in west London and the Swansea data centre will
close.
Mr Rifka points out that there is an excess of data-processing centres. The
DVOIT computers will be used elsewhere in the EDS group and staff will
either be redeployed or will leave.
The existing 370 DVOIT staff will be asked to change jobs, to learn new
skills and possibly to move to Stockley Park. Mr Rifka says that, if staff
refused all the company's overtures, the DVOIT workload could be handled by
a mere 54 people. His intention, however, is to establish a centre of
expertise in Swansea manned by at least 250 ex-DVOIT staff. Perhaps 10 per
cent of the staff might be persuaded to move, he said.
The second round of efficiencies will come from EDS-Scicon computer
specialists working in collaboration with DVOIT's customers to improve
operational efficiency through better, more modern, computer systems. This
is likely to lead to the kind of improvements noticeable by the public:
rapid turnround of motor licence updates, for example, or faster renewal of
licences.
EDS-Scicon has substantial expertise in ways of developing such computer
systems rapidly. Furthermore, unlike a government department which might
have to maintain a costly full-time team of experts in computer development,
it can move systems specialists from other parts of its international
operations to tackle specific problems.
There are still concerns that the government is demanding rigid contracts
over unrealistically long periods. Contracts were being drawn up to run for
10 years when most computer specialists thought five years was a long time.
'They do not know what their requirements will be in five years, let alone
10,' one said. 'The policy may change; there may be a new government;
technology may have changed the economics again.'

FT  13 DEC 93 / MoD trains its big guns on commercial target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By any international standards, Britain's Ministry of Defence has already
gone a long way down the road to privatisation and commercial management.
But while senior defence officials are convinced that market-testing will
bring significant savings, the benefits so far are hard to evaluate.
Ten years ago the MoD made its own ammunition and refitted its own ships.
But since 1987 the Royal Ordnance munitions factories have been part of
British Aerospace. The dockyards have been under commercial management and
are now to be sold. In April this year the 6,800 employees at the Atomic
Weapons Establishment, which makes nuclear warheads, left the civil service
when Hunting-Brae, a private consortium, took over full managerial
responsibility.
In all these areas, the workload from the MoD has fallen drastically. The
government wants to keep both the Devonport and Rosyth dockyards, and plans
soon to invite separate tenders for their privatisation. But top navy
officers have argued that a single dockyard, working to capacity, could be
tens of millions of pounds a year more efficient.
The Commons public accounts committee earlier this year found that
uncertainty and falls in workload 'made it difficult for the commercial
managers to operate on a fully commercial basis and improve efficiency', but
costs had been cut (the two dockyards, like Royal Ordnance, have cut
workforces by two-thirds in 10 years).
Recent contracts include the MoD's computer services centre, now run by
Hoskyns, the information-technology company. The initial stages of RAF and
Navy flying training, at Topcliffe in North Yorkshire, have been contracted
out to Hunting. The Army Base Repair Organisation, which repairs army
fighting vehicles is being market-tested.
The National Audit Office recently estimated that savings from
private-sector competition averaged 24 per cent, or Pounds 64m a year. It
said the policy had cut 17,300 posts since 1979.
Defence activities figure strongly among the government executive agencies
currently being reviewed.
The MoD's experience with private contractors has not all been good,
however. It recently cancelled a contract with a company, Airwork, which it
blamed for causing damage 'of a very serious nature' to Tornado fighters
which it was modifying. And when the NAO asked the opinion of MoD officials
monitoring cleaning contracts, it found that only a third considered the
ministry was getting value for money.

A quarter of young people leaving the government's Youth Training scheme
become unemployed, while only a third gain qualifications, says a report
published yesterday by the independent Unemployment Unit and the charity
Youthaid.
As many as 52 per cent of all young people on the scheme leave early.
The highest unemployment levels of YT leavers are London - 29 per cent  -

More than half of Britain's charities believe that their audit fees may rise
as a result of new charities legislation, according to a survey by NGO
Finance magazine.
Fifty-five per cent said the new accounting requirements for charities,
which are still awaited, were likely to increase costs.
The survey covered nearly 600 charities representing total annual income of
Pounds 3.4bn and with audit fees between them of Pounds 4.5m a year.

Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, intends
to take legal action against the Labour party to try to prevent the
introduction of women-only shortlists for the selection of some of its
parliamentary candidates for the next general election, Robert Taylor
writes.
'I have not fought all my life against sexual discrimination to see one form
of discrimination replaced by another,' he says in a letter to a party
member revealed yesterday on BBC's On The Record programme.
A National Opinion Poll in the Labour party magazine New Century shows 61
per cent of people oppose all-women shortlists and only 28 per cent back
them.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Companies welcome sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies which supply contract services to public bodies have welcomed last
week's announcement that most of the 144 government executive agencies are
to be opened to bids from the private sector.
Many companies which had bid for contracts from the government under its
market-testing programme have become disillusioned with a process which
appeared to favour in-house bids from the civil service. The shift in favour
of privatising agencies wherever possible will rekindle companies' interest
in providing services to the government.
So far, only one agency has been privatised - DVOIT, the
information-technology arm of the Department of Transport. Three other
agencies were identified for privatisation when they were created: the
National Engineering Laboratory, Chessington computer centre - which handles
much of the civil service payroll - and Adas, the agricultural advisory
service.
Reviews are under way on privatising the Transport Research Laboratory,
Companies House, the Patent Office, the Department of Trade and Industry's
Accounting Services Agency and four DTI laboratories.
Two companies scanning the list of opportunities with particular interest
are Capita and CSL, both management buy-outs from Cipfa, the professional
body for public-sector accountants. Both have established businesses
supplying white-collar services to local government and the health service,
and are keen to expand into central government.
Capita, with 1,150 staff, is 'very interested' in acquiring entire agencies,
according to Mr Paul Pindar, managing director. The company, which started
with consultancy and computer services, now collects council tax and
business rates for some councils and pays benefits on their behalf.
'There are some very interesting businesses in central government which
could prosper in the private sector,' said Mr Pindar.
Capita is also interested in helping management buy-outs in agencies, and
has raised a fund of Pounds 100m from venture capitalists. The company is
already backing the bid by the management of the DTI's Accounting Services
Agency to buy itself out so that it can look for work elsewhere in the
public sector.
CSL employs about 700 staff supplying revenue collection, exchequer services
and general financial management to public bodies. It has recently become
part of Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, and is keen to win a share of
central government business.
'Our stock in trade is taking public servants and turning them into
private-sector people with an emphasis on profit, quality and flexibility,'
says Mr Dick Turpin, CSL's deputy chairman.
Another company with a track record in supplying services to government is
Serco, which specialises in defence and security work. Since 1964 it has run
the ballistic missile early warning station at Fylingdales on the North
Yorkshire moors, providing services from cleaning to systems maintenance.
Serco's 9,000 employees now provide services in defence, central government,
local government and civil aviation in 29 countries. In the UK they run
local authority leisure services, manage Hyde Park in London, maintain speed
cameras on main roads and operate defence firing ranges.
Mr Richard Nicholls, Serco's marketing director, welcomed last week's
initiative to open up the agencies to outside bids. 'This reflects the
growing interest internationally from governments which wish to concentrate
their efforts and resources on the tasks they best perform.'
Agencies such as NHS Estates and the Buying Agency will be of particular
interest to Mr Oliver Jones, managing director of Symonds FM, a property
management company. His 350 employees currently manage property for
companies opening for business in the UK, public-sector organisations and
newly privatised utilities.
'Our classic client is a bureaucracy facing change,' he says, 'and there's
no bureaucracy like the civil service.'

FT  13 DEC 93 / Unions give more workplace briefings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of large companies which use unions to communicate with their
employees appears to be rising after a sharp fall in the late 1980s, says a
survey, David Goodhart writes.
About 60 per cent of 375 of Britain's biggest companies questioned last
month by Vista, an employee communications consultancy, said they used
unions to brief staff.
The latest percentage compares with 53 per cent in a 1989 survey based on a
broadly similar sample, which was itself sharply down from 62 per cent in
1985.
Most employee communications experts are highly critical of managers who
rely on unions or noticeboards to talk to employees.
Mr Peter Walker, head of Vista Communications, is a critic. 'This shows the
failure of British managers to take full responsibility for briefing their
own staff direct,' he said. 'In our view, union representatives are there to
represent their members and are not good at passing on management messages.'

FT  13 DEC 93 / Russian Elections: Voters hand great power to president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under the draft constitution which the Russian people appear to have
approved yesterday, President Boris Yeltsin is set to become one of the
world's most powerful, democratically elected, presidents.
It is seen as an authoritarian constitution by much of the opposition. But,
even among Mr Yeltsin's supporters, it has been seen as dangerous in as much
as it gives power to one individual in a state with authoritarian traditions
and a shallow experience of democratic practice.
The system proposed would have the president at its undisputed and all but
unchallengeable apex. He would be head of state, of the armed forces and of
the Security Council - this last a potentially powerful body with no clear
boundaries to its remit. His powers to appoint premiers, judges and central
bank chairmen would generally be conditional on approval from one or both
chambers of parliament but he has the authority to issue decrees wholly
independent of parliament, or any other level of power - save that these
decrees must not flout the constitution.
This might mean that in any unresolvable dispute between the president and
the parliament, the president could resort to a decree.
The president can be impeached, though only for treachery and serious
crimes, and not on grounds of breaching the constitution. Even then, the
process would depend on two-thirds of both houses agreeing within three
months of the constitutional court's upholding the decision to attempt to
impeach.
The constitution itself is virtually untouchable as three-quarters of the
upper house of the parliament, representing the regions and republics, and
two-thirds of the lower house, must favour the change.
The parliament has two chambers: the upper, or Federation Council,
representing the interests of the regions and the lower, or State Duma,
comprised of the fledgling political parties and the members elected on a
first-past-the-post system from the constituencies. Both have the right to
initiate legislation, and they have a particular responsibility for laws on
the budget, federal taxes and financial, monetary and credit policy.
However, laws on financial matters must in effect be agreed with the
government, as draft laws in this area require a corresponding resolution of
the cabinet before they are debated.
The effect is to strengthen the government's - and the president's - hands
vis-a-vis the parliament; and to ensure that the parliament will be at its
most influential when it works with the government and the president, rather
than against them. Its influence will also depend on how persuasive it can
be in presenting policies, and how flexible the president and government are
in tailoring their proposals to the parliamentary majority to avoid
gridlock. The balance will be a sensitive one.
The judiciary would be granted independence - and the judges life tenure -
but again they face a tough battle to increase the standing and prestige of
a profession traditionally ill-regarded in Soviet times and only fitfully
authoritative since. The constitutional court could, and arguably should,
emerge as a powerful arbiter of a constitution with many unclear clauses,
taking its place beside the US Supreme Court and the German constitutional
court as a check on government and a defender of rights.
But any constitution in a civil society as fragile as Russia's will be under
test. None could be a guarantor against a revival of its authoritarian,
centralist traditions. It will stand or fall not on the letter of its
clauses, but on the politicians' and citizens' willingness to exercise
restraint.

Amid snow-topped tanks mounted on pedestals, between statues of Lenin and
prominent Bolsheviks, beneath Soviet slogans praising their valour, the men,
officers, wives and pensioners of the Taman Guards division yesterday voted
for a new parliament. It was 10 weeks to the day since some of them were
preparing to go to Moscow to shell the old one.
'How are we to vote, sergeant, how are we to vote?' one recruit shouted
cheekily to his platoon leader as he and his comrades marched into the
Stalin-era officers' club turned into voting station 1527 yesterday morning.
It seemed to be a joke. But inside the crowded little hall, where queues of
servicemen and service families waited for their turn in the two little
booths, the window ledges and table edges were grabbed by anxious men and
women turning over the multi-layered papers, asking the officers in charge
what to do.
Mr Robert Porogov ('my first name came from your famous socialist Robert
Owen') was in no doubt how he had voted. 'I'll tell you quite openly,' he
said loudly in the crowded hall. 'I'm a Communist and glad to be so, an
internationalist, what's more. These elections are a bit of a sham, and the
constitution is written just to give Yeltsin all the power. I think we'll do
well', he said, greeting other, largely elderly, tovarishchi (comrades).
The Taman men, who came to Mr Yeltsin's aid during the August putsch of 1991
and did so again in October, would not speak of their role. Questions to one
recruit who seemed willing to talk were politely cut short by an officer.
Most of the voters, asked how they had completed their papers, replied with
similar courtesy that we should mind our own business. 'It's secret now,'
said one lady with a tight smile.
Apart from Mr Prorogov and his Communist comrades there was an
unsteadypensioner who had voted 'completely democratic' and a widow who had
voted for the nationalist Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The unannounced arrival of Mr Quentin Davies, a British Conservative MP and
one of the international observers, caused a flurry. He had broken away from
his prescribed route to tour military bases in order to check if all was
well in an area where control and corruption could flourish in secret.
Maj Kovalov, president of the voting commission, smart in a civilian suit,
anxiously demonstrated the orderly nature of the process, saying 'we had two
big problems - one, too little time to prepare, and two, overcomplex voting
papers. No, we had no meetings here, no agitation. No one seemed too
interested. Many, many questions; everyone wants to know what to do. Of
course we help them, but not on how to vote, that's their own business.'
Mr Davies, a former diplomat (in Moscow in the 1970s) and a Russian speaker,
objected to the fact that several voters were filling out their large voting
slips papers in the open, and that the two small boxes into which the slips
were being stuffed would not hold the possible volume of paper without being
changed. But he said: 'It seems a lot of care is being taken to ensure that
it's done fairly.'
Later, at an air base some 20km further on (where Migs instead of tanks
stood on pedestals), Lt-Col Alexei Kubinka, head of the election committee
on the base, said that more than half of his electorate had voted by 1pm.
Col Kubinka's view was that Mr Zhirinovsky was probably doing well. When
people thought about voting for Mr Yegor Gaidar's Russia's Choice party, he
said, they would first ask themselves - what have they done for Russia so
far? Not much, was the unstated implication.

of conducting summary executions to end crime, was yesterday putting himself
across as a man of the world.
Accompanied by his elegant wife to a Moscow polling-station, he did a star
turn in four languages - English, German, French and Turkish - for
reporters, focusing on the need to fight 'la misere' as he put it. But his
main credo - repeated time and again during his campaign - is to look after
Russians, in Russia and in the former Soviet republics.
As part of that package, he has constantly stressed his Russianness and
attacked all manner of foreigners, despite the fact that he himself was born
in the republic of Kazakhstan, and has a foreign-sounding patronymic,
Wolfovich. Skirting around the possible embarrassment that this might cause
him with his patriotic anti-foreign constituency, he once said, when asked
for his nationality, that his mother was Russian and his father was a
lawyer.
He has successfully exploited the role of underdog. His autobiography reads
like a Russian version of Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' in terms of its self-pitying
portrayal of a lad making his own way in the world despite all obstacles.
Although some voters yesterday described him variously as 'the incarnation
of evil' and 'deranged' - all recognise he is extremely articulate. His
campaign appearances have been clear, humorous, and extremely easy to
understand.
He can also point to being the only party leader in this election who has
never been a member of the Communist party.
After graduating from the Oriental Studies and Law faculties of Moscow
University, he worked as a lawyer, most recently as head of the legal
service of Mir publishing-house until 1990.
In that year he founded his Liberal-Democratic party, at a time when other
fledgling parties began to challenge the monopoly of the Communist party.
He first rose to prominence in Russia's first presidential election in June
the following year when he captured 6m votes and came third among five
candidates.
While Russia's Choice on Friday confessed that it had been a mistake not to
take Mr Zhirinovsky seriously, some of his opponents in this election
continue to suspect him of being a puppet manipulated by other forces.
Mr Yuri Boldyrev, a leader of the Yabloko group, said for instance that
having been restored to the political limelight by the Kremlin when he was
invited to help draft the new constitution, Mr Zhirinovsky would prove a
'useful enemy' for Mr Yeltsin in the new parliament.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Mideast extremists lurking in the wings: Israeli withdrawal
from Gaza-Jericho is fraught with danger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Failure to achieve substantial progress at a summit yesterday between
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman,
will leave Palestinians and Israelis feeling even more insecure in a land
already rife with anxiety and violence.
Israel had been due today to begin dismantling the military apparatus which,
for more than two decades, has controlled the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
area of Jericho - captured during the 1967 Six Day War. It was unclear last
night whether Israel would proceed as planned with the symbolic gestures
designed to mark a historic, and probably irreversible, step towards
Palestinian national self-determination.
Both sides will have to face the consequences of delay. Even if a protocol
is agreed within the next 10 days, the way ahead is fraught with danger.
Public support for the peace process is at its lowest point since the
September signing; violence, mistrust and suspicion have replaced
enthusiasm. The PLO and the Israeli government will have to move fast to
ensure that extremists do not exploit the lingering vacuum.
For Palestinians that means an explicit demonstration by Israel that it is
really handing over substantial power to a Palestinian authority and easing
its military grip.
For Israelis it largely means the PLO taking up the responsibility of office
and using its embryonic police force to rein in attacks by Palestinians
against Jews and increase security, which remains the touchstone of Israeli
concern.
The tasks will not be easy but both Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat are badly in need
of a boost.
The most urgent need is to iron out the last remaining points of
disagreement on a protocol which lays the framework for a phased four-month
Israeli troop pull-out from Gaza-Jericho and the transfer of power from the
Israeli military-run civil administration to Palestinian hands.
Although Israel could begin a symbolic withdrawal today - dismantling
barricades, redeploying troops away from some Palestinian-populated areas
and releasing up to 1,500 Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners - the real
withdrawal cannot go ahead before the protocol is in place.
Three key issues remain to be resolved: the size of the Jericho area, the
role and number of Israeli troops who will stay behind to safeguard Jewish
settlers, and control over border crossings between Gaza and Egypt and
Jericho and Jordan.
Despite the pessimistic tone of yesterday's meeting both sides believe
agreement is within reach.
But once the protocol is signed there are likely to be tough times during
the months leading up to April 13, when Israeli military withdrawal must be
completed.
Detailed plans are in place for the transfer of power from Israeli to
Palestinian hands - that part of the peace talks went relatively smoothly.
However, implementation will be more difficult and will try the patience of
both Palestinians and Israelis.
Two critical concerns hang over the PLO. The first is whether the former
liberation movement is ready to assume administration of the economically
decimated, faction-riven Gaza Strip - home to 900,000 Palestinians. The top
leadership of the PLO is deeply split, with mounting criticism about the
authoritarian leadership of Mr Arafat and his preference for political
appointees of his own generation, rather than professionals, to staff
administrative bodies. Several key officials have resigned recently,
charging Mr Arafat with an inability to respond to the challenge of
governing or reforming the bureaucratic and centralised decision-making
system.
Secondly, there are deep doubts about Mr Arafat's willingness or ability to
move against Palestinian extremists both inside and outside the PLO. Will
he, for example, dispatch his police force to confiscate weapons from
Islamic guerrillas intent on launching attacks across the Gaza border into
Israel?
Even if Mr Arafat wishes to do so he may be constrained by the domestic
political situation and the prospect of elections next July (although to
many Palestinians that date already seems optimistic).
On the Israeli side the challenge of the next four months is equally
formidable.
Once the protocol is signed and Israeli withdrawal is in full flow Mr Rabin
will have to rely on the safeguards enshrined in the peace accord and on the
goodwill of the Palestinians.
How long will the prime minister, already under intense domestic pressure,
be able to hold out if Palestinian attacks do not subside? And can Mr Rabin,
hanging on to power with a wafer thin parliamentary majority and an almost
permanent coalition crisis, risk a showdown with increasingly militant
Jewish settlers? Without more concrete peace dividends - such as better
security, an end to the Arab boycott or peace with Jordan - the government
will face an uphill battle selling its peace policy to a sceptical public.
For both Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat the real challenge ahead is managing their
own constituencies. Both men will need each other's patience, goodwill and
courage to make the process succeed and defeat the extremists waiting in the
wings.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Zimbabwe likely to win extra aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HARARE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Donors attending a Zimbabwe aid meeting in Paris today are expected to
respond sympathetically to the government's call for extra funds in 1994 to
support its economic reform programme.
Zimbabwe will ask donors at the meeting, to be chaired by the World Bank,
for an extra Dollars 226m (Pounds 151.6m) to close its 1994 funding gap.
This implies some Dollars 808m in new pledges, assuming that project aid is
disbursed over five years and balance of payments assistance over 18 months.
The programme, blown off-course by the drought in 1992, has progressed
rapidly since April, when steps were taken to liberalise investment and
exchange controls covering individuals. This season's rains have started
well and GDP growth of at least 4 per cent is possible in 1995, though it
will take until 1995 to return to 1991 output and export levels.
Inflation, which peaked at almost 50 per cent in August, 1992 has halved to
24 per cent on a year-on-year basis and will average 28 per cent for 1993,
against 42 per cent last year. Output has started to grow again, after a 7.7
per cent fall in real GDP in 1992, but there will be only marginal expansion
this year.
Donors are expected to question the World Bank's forecasting record, which
as recently as June predicted 7 per cent growth, but now estimates a mere 1
per cent.
The bank's forecast, in a paper prepared for the Paris meeting, of export
growth (in US dollar terms) of more than 10 per cent annually for the next
three years may be treated cautiously. Not only is this faster than growth
rates forecast for world trade (5.8 per cent a year), but it is in sharp
contrast to Zimbabwe's performance over the past five years, when exports
have fallen almost 10 per cent.

FT  13 DEC 93 / China warns Patten of HK turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The war of words between China and Britain over Hong Kong escalated at the
weekend, with a senior Chinese official suggesting for the first time that
Governor Chris Patten's democracy plans for the colony could provide a
pretext for an early Chinese takeover there.
Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, described Mr Patten's plans for
greater democracy as a kind of 'man-made turmoil'. The first stage of Mr
Patten's democracy legislation will be tabled in the Legislative Council
(LegCo) on Wednesday - an event which China has said would end bilateral
talks about Hong Kong's political development.
Use of the word 'turmoil' is particularly significant. In 1982 Mr Deng
Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, told then British prime minister Mrs
Margaret Thatcher that China would take control of Hong Kong before 1997 if
turmoil erupted in the colony.
Mr Patten yesterday said there was 'no turmoil or chaos in Hong Kong'.
Chinese officials could put their 'hearts and minds at rest on that
particular issue', he added.
The governor was supported by Mr Ronald Arculli, deputy leader of LegCo's
Liberal (conservative) party. 'Hong Kong is not in turmoil now, and I can't
conceive of any situation where Hong Kong would be in turmoil,' he said.
Mr Qian was speaking at a meeting of Beijing's 'preliminary working
committee' (PWC) - a group of mainland officials and Hong Kong plutocrats
charged with advising China on its takeover of Hong Kong. At the meeting the
foreign minister said China hoped to control 'disorder' in the colony
through agreement with the British. 'But if co-operation breaks down, we
cannot sit back and watch disorder in Hong Kong.'
It is clear, however, from the PWC's deliberations that China is planning
for a breakdown in bilateral co-operation. The group has been charged with
drawing up arrangements, by July next year, for fresh elections after 1997.

An article published in the Financial Times on December 8 incorrectly stated
that Mr Shaul Eisenberg of the Eisenberg group of companies had recently
hosted a visit to Israel by the governor of Jiangsu province, China. Mr
Eisenberg actually hosted the governor of Jiangxi province.
Furthermore, Mr Eisenberg points out that his United Development

Burger King to open a chain of restaurants in China but has not won the
franchise as we reported.
Detailed negotiations have not yet begun, Mr Eisenberg says.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Boost for fusion reactor project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The successful generation of fusion power at the Princeton Plasma Physics
Laboratory in the US is a boost for plans to spend an estimated Pounds 10bn
on an international nuclear fusion reactor in the late 1990s.
The proposed International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (Iter) would
show whether a controlled version of the fusion process which fires the sun
(and the hydrogen bomb) could deliver safe energy on earth. If the optimists
are right, fusion will become the cheapest and cleanest source of power and
heat in the middle of the next century.
In a series of experiments at the end of last week, the doughnut-shaped
Princeton reactor produced up to 5.5MW of power by joining together two
forms of 'heavy hydrogen': deuterium and tritium.
The power output was three times greater than that generated by the Joint
European Torus (Jet) - a similar reactor near Oxford in the UK - when it
achieved controlled nuclear fusion for the first time two years ago.
Iter is potentially the most ambitious global project undertaken in science.
The six-year design stage alone will cost the partners - the US, EU, Japan
and Russia - Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m). Construction would require not only
an estimated Dollars 10bn but also sufficient political goodwill to agree a
site for the reactor.

FRANCE
Anyone who has ever suspected that the Balladur government is making a fuss
about nothing in the Gatt negotiations might have changed their mind had
they witnessed the tone of last week's French regional press.
The week began with the announcement that the EC and the US had finally
reached an agreement on agriculture, a breakthrough welcomed by the national
newspapers. The response in the provinces was very different.
'The Gatt negotiations are totally reactionary,' thundered Mr Christophe
Pron, head of one of the Aube farming unions, in Tuesday's L'Est Eclair.
'This isn't free trade: it's dictatorship.' L'Alsace described the mood of
local farmers as 'anxious' and feared that the US concessions were 'totally
inadequate'.
The following day, La Depeche du Midi assembled a panel of agricultural
leaders to air their views. The bluntest was Mr Raymond Lacombe, former head
of FNSEA, the national farmers' union. 'The Americans have one aim  - to
smash the common agricultural policy,' he fumed. 'The Europeans are making a
major political mistake. The world will starve if food becomes a political
weapon for the Americans.'
Tempers were still heated on Thursday. Presse-Ocean described the farmers as
'between deception and anger'. The small farmers' union condemned the French
government's conduct of the negotiations as 'high treason' in DNA, the
Alsace paper. Ouest-France said the farmers had been 'boxed into a corner'.
Enough was enough for the nationals by the end of the week. 'Gatted Out]'
shrieked the headline of Philippe Bouvard's column in Friday's France-Soir.
'I've found it hard to follow the Gatt dossier,' he confessed. 'All I know
is that the naughty Americans, not content with having foisted Disneyland on
us, have entrusted the future of our exports to someone called Mickey.'
UNITED STATES
US news organisations maintain an apparently insatiable news interest in
outer space, but there comes a time when one spacewalk starts to look rather
like another.
That time came last week for US newspapers, as the space shuttle mission to
repair the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's defective Hubble
satellite telescope rolled smoothly towards its conclusion.
Watching routine space shuttle launches is almost as fascinating as train
spotting, and the lack of drama soon saw Hubble relegated.
The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and Washington Post all carried
front-page stories with photographs and graphics on Monday. By Tuesday, only
the pictures remained, with the words shifted to the inside pages.
The dirty secret, of course, is that news organisations devote reporters and
camera crews to the space shuttle just in case one blows up again, as
Challenger did in 1986. Since reporters must justify their expenses, they
write stories, but when nothing goes on, it is hard to keep them on the
front page.
By Thursday the New York Times was devoting its front-page attention to the
lone gunman who on Tuesday evening had killed five people on a Long Island
commuter train, and the Washington Post was warning its readers to boil
their drinking water.
GERMANY
Just how sharp is the much-vaunted long-sightedness of Germany's top
managers? The question was asked last Monday in the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung's comment on the severe liquidity problems at Metallgesellschaft.
En passant, it raised the same poser about Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest
industrial concern, whose AEG subsidiary was within days to announce plans
for a radical structural shakeout and the sale of its flag-bearing domestic
appliances business to Electrolux.
Both groups, the FAZ suggested, were peacocks that had fanned their tails
too wide: in the case of MG, by attempting to change the old mining and
metals company into an environmental technology group through high-risk
acquisitions and investments.
Borsen-Zeitung, the traditionally po-faced stock market daily, also resorted
to the peacock analogy in its analysis of the New York oil futures farrago
which generated MG's crisis. It proposed that the local subsidiary had been
allowed to over-stretch its capabilities.
'There is need for action here,' BZ concluded.
Details of action at AEG, the care-worn electrical and electronics business,
rescued from the brink in the 1980s and then tucked under the Daimler-Benz
wing, had been well-leaked in advance.
The German media, sceptical at the best of times about Daimler's ambitions
to become an 'integrated technology group', accepted that some progress had
been made with the planned disposal of businesses unconnected with planes
and roads and trains.
But Handelsblatt, the financial daily, was in no mood to be generous. 'The
AEG story is a story of erosion and failings. . . Damage limitation is
dominant. Long-term structural and behavioural concepts have yet to come,'
it charged.
Another article in the same paper, less judgmental but more glum, concluded:
'The dream of an independent, globally-active electro-group appears to have
faded. The contraction will continue.'
SOUTH AFRICA
South African newspaper readers have had a rough time over the past few
months: headline writers have served up a tedious diet of alternating
breakthrough and breakdown as constitutional talks lurched toward their
conclusion; editors and political columnists suffered rapid mood swings from
triumph to gloom and back again while the rest of the population
demonstrated little more than exhausted indifference.
The process reached its climax last week when blacks took their seats on the
Transitional Executive Council, ending 350 years of white domination.
Yet this story of black triumph over apartheid was relegated to page two in
the Sowetan, the leading black daily.
The Citizen, the popular Johannesburg daily that also has a large black
readership, followed suit, concerning itself on its front page with whether
the Prince of Wales would ever be king.
Ironically, the Afrikaans daily Beeld greeted the great day with a page-one
burst of lyricism: 'The door of the new South Africa has been opened and
hope shines through in brilliant beams', it said. The Sowetan's political
correspondent took a rather more cynical line: 'If yesterday (was) the
beginning of the end of minority rule, it certainly did not feel like it.'
The Johannesburg Saturday Star also noted the 'damp squib' effect of the
TEC, and set out to find out why. 'People don't seem to know exactly what's
going on,' said Ms Joyce Dube, a journalist quoted by the paper. 'Perhaps we
have not made it clear,' she said, indicting the role of her own profession
in failing to put the minutiae of negotiations in proper context.
But 'Big B', a patron of a Soweto shebeen (bar), had the last word: 'Power?
What power?', the Saturday Star quoted him as asking. 'You must be joking.
Just because you have your hands on the steering wheel does not mean you're
driving to the bank.'

centuries, Reuter reports from Andorra La Vella.
Five political groups were competing for 28 seats in the Consell General de
les Valls, the Andorran parliament. About 9,700 Andorrans, representing only
15 per cent of the population, are eligible to vote.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Hungary mourns death of premier Antall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jozsef Antall, Hungary's conservative prime minister and eastern Europe's
longest- serving leader, died yesterday afternoon at the age of 61, after
heart trouble compounded his cancer condition.
His death, after 3 1/2 years in office, follows a long battle against
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer with which the prime minister was
diagnosed in 1990, the year he and his centre-right coalition were elected.
The demise of Mr Antall, leader of the governing Hungarian Democratic Forum,
threatens political turbulence, coming shortly before elections pencilled in
for next May,
Taking over as interim prime minister is Mr Peter Boross, the interior
minister, who deputised for Mr Antall during his hospital treatment.
But the succession is by no means certain and other candidates such as
defence minister Lajos Fur may emerge. The struggle is set to shift the
centre of political gravity within the Forum to the right as contenders seek
the support of party activists. A potential kingmaker is Mr Sandor Lezsak,
who runs the day-to-day affairs of the Forum and has publicly played down
his desire to do the job himself.
Last night he said on Hungarian television: 'The HDF's leading bodies are
determined not to have a struggle for succession so that the country can
maintain its creative calm and security without which, I believe, we cannot
have firm prospects for the future.'
A possible alternative to the election by MPs of a new prime minister is
that the parliament dissolves itself and Mr Arpad Goncz, the president,
calls early elections.
Mr Antall's death is a loss for the Forum because, though his popularity
ratings were low, he was widely respected, even by his opponents, and seen
as an electoral asset.
Thousands of mourners gathered in front of Budapest's ornate parliament
building last night to sing Hungary's national anthem and light candles in
Mr Antall's memory as the caretaker cabinet met in emergency session.
Ministers, Mr Goncz and leaders of the Democratic Forum party later emerged
to join the throng.
Mr Antall's departure from the political scene depresses the Forum's chances
of staging a recovery in public support from the 10 per cent recorded in the
latest opinion polls. The Forum now faces an uphill battle against a
resurgent Hungarian Socialist Party, the former communists, as well as a
liberal bloc.
The change in leadership will raise concerns about the country's reputation
as an island of stability in an unsettled region, an achievement tied to Mr
Antall's personality.
Nevertheless all the potential successors to Mr Antall share a commitment to
the market economy and Hungary's integration into the western community.

<TEXT>
Members of the United Mine Workers of America look set to ratify an
agreement this week to end the seven-month US coal strike. The nation's
biggest coal companies and union leadership agreed on a new five-year
contract in Washington last week.
Both sides have won concessions, although the prolonged strike was costly
for all parties, and particularly for the midwestern coal industry, which is
in a long decline, industry analysts say.
The union appears to have achieved some guarantees that union miners will be
hired when coal companies or their subsidiaries open new mines, said Mr
Rafael Villagran, a Lehman Brothers analyst.
He said the companies gained more flexible work rules, including the right
to schedule seven-day weeks and in some cases 10-hour days. 'The settlement
will certainly be taken positively by investors,' said Mr Villagran, 'and it
should make the UMWA a little stronger. Their representation in the industry
has been dropping, and they needed to stop that. This could help.'
Less than half of the coal in the US is mined by union workers. The union
risked the strike to gain job security for its members and, to some extent,
a future for itself. Its strategy, a selective strike which targeted
companies with the toughest bargaining positions, split three coal producers
from the employers' group.
The strike settlement, however, does not change a fundamental shift away
from the high-sulphur coal mined in the Illinois basin, where the union is
most active.

Half the world's population will be living in cities by the end of this
decade, leading to critical shortages of clean water, housing and health
care, according to Population Concern, the UK-based family planning charity,
writes Bronwen Maddox.
The world's population is growing by 96m people a year, with more than 80
per cent of the growth in towns, it says. The UN has forecast that the
world's population could double to more than 10bn people by the middle of
the next century.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Landslide for Frei in Chilean election: New president's
victory reflects popularity of outgoing Aylwin government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eduardo Frei of the governing Concertacion coalition swept to victory in
Chile's weekend presidential elections, winning the largest popular backing
of any Chilean head of state in 60 years.
Mr Frei, whose father was president from 1964 to 1969, won 58 per cent of
the vote, against around 24 per cent for his main rival, Mr Arturo
Alessandri of the centre-right. By securing more than half the vote, he
avoided a run-off in February, and will take office on March 11.
His victory was built on the popularity of the four-year government of
President Patricio Aylwin, which is credited with engineering a largely
successful transition to democracy from the 17-year dictatorship of General
Augusto Pinochet. Mr Aylwin is set to leave office as Chile's most popular
president ever, according to Mrs Marta Lagos, director of polling
organisation Cerc.
For the first time in more than half a century, the election did not result
in a shift of power to the opposition. Nevertheless, it underlined Chile's
long-standing voting patterns, which divide the electorate into roughly
equal blocks of left, centre and right.
Parliamentary elections, also held on Saturday, left the shape of Congress
little altered. This will make it difficult to achieve changes sought by Mr
Frei to the 1980 constitution, which require a two-thirds majority in both
houses. The constitution, drawn up under the military, packs the Senate with
appointees of the Pinochet regime and does not allow the president to
appoint or remove the head of the armed forces - Gen Pinochet.
Mr Frei is not expected to veer much from the economic policies that have
helped Chile become Latin America's fastest growing economy. Growth this
year is expected to be 6.2 per cent after 10.3 per cent in 1992.
During the Aylwin administration, some 10 per cent of the population has
risen out of poverty. Unemployment has fallen nationally to 4.5 per cent and
real wages have risen by 3.5 per cent annually, largely in line with
productivity growth. Meanwhile, Chile has the highest investment rate in
Latin America, estimated at 27.5 per cent of gross domestic product this
year.
In an interview just before the election, Mr Frei said: 'It's clear the
four-year transition is over and Chile has recovered its democratic
tradition.'
The main challenges that had faced Mr Aylwin concerned human rights, the
consolidation of democracy and the reconciliation of development with social
justice, he said. 'These tasks have been achieved and we therefore have
other priorities, such as the fight against poverty and improving
education.'
Mr Ricardo Lagos, a socialist leader within the Concertacion and likely
cabinet minister, said social issues would become the highest priority 'not
because Aylwin did badly, but because he's done well'.
Mr Alejandro Foxley, the outgoing finance minister, agreed that the new
administration would have to reorder its priorities. 'We have institutional
problems, that could become serious, in the way that health and education
services are provided.
'We are not happy with the way the system is working either on the public or
the private side,' he said. The private health system needed better
regulation to stop insurers from withdrawing coverage from high-risk
patients. The public system was overcentralised, prone to industrial
conflict and still suffered from years of inadequate funding by the military
regime.
Mr Frei foresees radical reforms in these areas, particularly in education.
'If we are really serious about leaving the ranks of underdeveloped nations,
we will have to introduce profound changes in the educational system and in
work training,' he said.
However, Mr Juan Villarzu, Mr Frei's main economic adviser and his expected
finance minister, made clear that the Frei administration would not allow
social concerns to loosen the grip of fiscal restraint. On the contrary, if
the international downturn continued to weaken the prices of Chile's
principal primary exports, the 1994 budget might have to be cut, he said.
But in the medium term, given international recovery, he saw 'few
restraints' to growth rates of around 7 per cent. Inflation is expected to
fall to 12 per cent this year.
This success has been accompanied, according to recent opinion polls, by a
scaling-down of popular expectations about what democratic government can
achieve. If this is good news for Mr Frei, there are some questions about
the six-year term he is expected to serve. 'One good thing about short
presidential periods is when people start to become dissatisfied you have a
change of government,' said Mr Foxley. 'A six-year term may be too long for
that.'

FT  13 DEC 93 / Malaysia, Australia kiss and make up: Kieran Cooke and Nikki
Tait see the heat taken out of a diplomatic confrontation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like two rather awkward dancing partners, Malaysia and Australia are doing
the diplomatic waltz again. Last month Mr Paul Keating, Australia's blunt
speaking prime minister, trod on Malaysia's toes by describing Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, his Malaysian counterpart, as a 'recalcitrant' for not attending
the recent Apec summit in Seattle.
Malaysia responded by imposing restrictions on contacts with Australia and
there was talk of downgrading diplomatic relations.
But after Mr Keating wrote a personal letter to Dr Mahathir and twice
publicly expressed regret for his remark Malaysia has now agreed to be
friends. 'The government does not wish to prolong this issue and will take
no further action,' said a statement after a weekend meeting of the
Malaysian cabinet.
Australia, clearly relieved the row has ended, says it wants further to
develop relations. But damage has been done to business confidence in what
has always been a fragile relationship.
Australia is turning more towards the fast-growing economies of southeast
Asia, and Malaysia has become one of Australia's top dozen trading partners
 -in 1992-3 Australia exported goods worth ADollars 1.3bn (Pounds 590m) to
Malaysia and imported some ADollars 970m worth.
But during the recent debacle Australian companies had begun to report the
cancellation of export orders: last week, for example, Voxson of Brisbane,
which makes and exports mobile phones, saw one of its Malaysian dealers halt
an impending order for cellular equipment. Meanwhile, the Malaysian
authorities moved quickly to ban Australian commercials and TV programmes,
including a film on the well-known Australian, Crocodile Dundee.
Business people on both sides now wonder how long it will take to normalise
ties again. A vocal contingent in Australia has consistently warned about
putting too many eggs in the Asian basket, citing the political
instabilities they feel prevail in the region.
One test case could be a multi-billion-dollar bid by Transfield, the large
privately-owned Sydney engineering group, to supply 27 patrol vessels to the
Malaysian navy.
As peace overtures gathered pace last week, officials seemed to feel the
company was at least in the running for the order. Hopes rose further after
Dr Mahathir visited the Australian stand at a local defence exhibition.
But for Malaysia, there are questions about how the row might affect
Australian investment in the country. Malaysian statistics show Australia's
investments there trebled last year to more than Dollars 830m (Pounds 557m),
making it one of the leading investors in the country.
And at a time when Malaysia is seeing a sharp drop in the growth of foreign
investment - with foreign capital going to other emerging economies such as
China and Vietnam - a fall-off in Australian investment could hurt.
'The Australians have been clumsy,' said a diplomat in Kuala Lumpur. 'But
Malaysia is gaining a reputation as a difficult country to deal with - at
least on the political level. Damage has been done on both sides.'
Dr Mahathir, though, seems to relish the role of spokesman of the smaller
nations, attacking the west, particularly the US, on a range of issues
including human rights and the environment.
'Sometimes you have to be a bit notorious to be a bit famous,' he said
recently. 'In order to be known, you have to be nasty. I'm sometimes nasty
toward governments, not business people.'

<TEXT>
Portugal's opposition Socialists were headed for a big victory over the
ruling Social Democrats of Prime Minister Anbal Cavaco Silva in nationwide
municipal elections yesterday, according to forecasts after three-quarters
of the votes were counted.
The vote, which came mid-term in the legislature of Mr Cavaco Silva,
appeared to represent a humiliating defeat for the centre-right government,
with a significant rise in the vote for left-wing parties.
The Socialists held on to the cities of Lisbon, Oporto and Coimbra, and were
forecast to win a majority of the country's 305 municipal councils.
The votes counted by late last night gave the Socialists 35.38 per cent of
the total vote nationwide, compared to 32 per cent in the previous 1989
election. The Communist party had polled 13.15 per cent, while the Social
Democrats had 34.21 per cent.
Mr Jorge Sampaio, a Socialist, was re-elected mayor of Lisbon with a
forecast 67 per cent of the vote.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Haggling clouds Gatt hopes on services: Negotiators on
financial, shipping and audio-visual sectors at loggerheads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US and European Union negotiators were still at odds last night over some
elements of the key services sectors, providing one of the main hitches in
what appeared early today to be significant progress towards a wide-ranging
Uruguay Round agreement.
While Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt's director general, railed at the US and the
EU for failing to settle their differences, negotiators on financial,
shipping and audio-visual services remained at loggerheads in spite of
intensive meetings throughout the weekend.
Trade officials questioned what would be left of any agreement to liberalise
trade in services if commitments in banking, securities, shipping and the
entertainment industry were minimal.
In literal terms, it would include trade in insurance services, tourism,
construction, professional services, consultancies, and limited easing on
the movement of workers, but these are small by comparison with the three
sectors blighted by dispute.
One senior official called for negotiators to rein in their ambitions in
order to make compromise possible. He reminded negotiators that present
disputes ignored how much more ambitious the agreement to liberalise
services had become since the decision in Punta del Este in Uruguay in 1986
to bring trade in services into the Gatt.
'At Punta del Este we were talking only of a framework of rules for
services. It was only in 1990 that countries raised their sights to the idea
of getting commitments to liberalise. It is true that most of the offers
today offer little more than standstills, but at least that is a start. They
provide a foundation for us to work from in future rounds.'
Mr Larry Summers, US deputy treasury secretary, yesterday challenged this
view: 'We have not achieved what the US financial services industry was
hoping to achieve in 1986,' he said shortly after arriving in Geneva
He insisted the US had 'very substantially modified its position' since
summer, when negotiators were warning they would withdraw their financial
services offer completely if other countries did not come forward with
better market-opening offers.
'We think that everyone's legitimate interests are protected by the two-tier
most favoured nation option we have proposed. Those who have made serious
commitments to national treatment will get a full set of commitments from
the US.'
He complained that many countries were still refusing to guarantee access to
foreign banks and brokers no worse than that currently available.
Negotiators are understood to be considering whether some kind of carve-out
could be managed for financial services which would allow negotiations to
continue beyond the December 15 deadline for completion of the Uruguay Round
agreement. Officials question how a services agreement could be completed in
such circumstances, or even whether the entire Uruguay Round package would
not be jeopardised if commitments on financial services remained unclear.
On maritime services, negotiators gloomily predicted that ocean shipping now
seemed unlikely to remain in the Uruguay deal, after EU officials discovered
on Thursday that a US offer was much more limited than originally expected.
The most critical 'round-breaking' issue remained the US-EU row over access
to Europe's television and film industries. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, said yesterday he felt all other differences could be
settled if compromise could be found on the audio-visual issue.
Mr Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America,
insisted that 'we are really trying to be flexible'.

FT  13 DEC 93 / US grounds aircraft subsidy talks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations on a Gatt code disciplining state subsidies for aircraft ground
to a standstill at the weekend after US industry representatives said the
proposed agreement was unacceptable.
'Right now I don't see the aircraft agreement as a basis for going forward,'
a senior US official said yesterday. The impasse followed strong objections
by American engine and component manufacturers to being included in the
revised code, which would restrain subsidies of all kinds to the aircraft
industry.
There were signs later in the day that another attempt might be made to
resuscitate the talks. Officials were reluctant to term the issue a
'round-breaker', but failure would be a serious setback to efforts to secure
fairer competition in the aircraft sector.
Trade negotiators from other countries involved in the aircraft talks said
the US industry was making a strategic mistake in rejecting a deal that
would rein back state supports for the aircraft industry around the world,
including emerging competitors in the Far East. The industry is the US's
biggest export earner.
The US and EU agreed last year to press for 'multilateralisation' of their
1992 bilateral accord capping state subsidies to the European Airbus and
placing a limit on US indirect supports via military and space research
contracts for aircraft manufacturers.
However, the bilateral pact applies only to large civil aircraft, whereas
Gatt's existing civil aircraft code applies to all aircraft and components,
and covers 22 signatories with a wide variety of subsidy systems.
The US industry is objecting to inclusion in the revised code of provisions
that would impose tighter disciplines on research-based subsidies than those
included in the separate, and more general, subsidies agreement being
negotiated in the Uruguay Round.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Blue-chip groups join forces on voice network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five leading international telecommunications operators are to be invited to
bid against each other for one of the largest service contracts ever awarded
in Europe.
Eighteen blue-chip companies have formed an association to handle the
contract, which is to supply a private 'voice' network linking the west
European offices of the participating companies.
The five operators to be approached are British Telecommunications; AT&amp;T of
the US; Sprint, a rival US carrier; Eunetcom, an alliance of the French and
German state operators; and Unisource, an alliance of the Swedish, Dutch and
Swiss state operators.
According to the FT's Telecoms Markets newsletter, companies in the user
association include Rank Xerox, ICI, Du Pont, Philips and Shell. It is
expected to expand to more than 30 companies by 1994.
Most of the companies already have private networks linking their offices.
They expect the new arrangement will allow them to make large savings by
creating a single network, which will be paid for on a usage basis.
Laws protecting the monopolies of continental operators mean the companies
will not be able to use the new network to communicate with each other. All
'voice' telecoms contact between them will have to use the public networks
until the European Union's liberalisation programme extends competition to
basic 'voice' services. This will not be until 1998 on the existing
timetable.
However, the contract reflects the degree of competition already permitted,
and the readiness of multinationals to exploit it fully. It will also
intensify competition between rival alliances of telecoms operators formed
to bid for such contracts.

Germany will make a special effort during its presidency of the Union next
year to strengthen the powers of Europol, the fledgling pan-European police
agency, to tackle organised crime. At a news conference after the summit,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl described organised crime as a 'cancer' spreading
through the EU. 'The need for intense co-operation between governments is
urgent,' he said.
During the summit, EU leaders approved a plan of action, drawn up by justice
and home affairs ministers last month, to reinforce the fight against drug
trafficking, money laundering and organised crime.
But although other leaders and the Belgian presidency only touched on the
issue in their briefings, Mr Kohl made a special effort to underline the
need for greater co-operation. He is known to have been disappointed that he
did not persuade his fellow leaders to insert more robust commitments on
international crime-fighting into the Maastricht treaty two years ago.
Europol, based in The Hague, is currently charged with co-ordinating the
European fight against drugs trafficking, but EU leaders agreed that a
special Union convention should be prepared by next October aimed at
broadening its responsibilities.
Mr Kohl said a pan-European approach was the best way to tackle such
cross-border problems, as regional and local police were unqualified to deal
with international crime.
As if to underline the difficulty of getting 12 member states to agree on
sensitive justice and interior matters, EU leaders were forced to note in
their communique Spain's objection on principle to implementation of common
EU action on asylum. Madrid is protesting about Belgium's sympathetic
treatment of two Spaniards suspected of links with Eta, the Basque terrorist
group. It wants to extradite the pair but last week a Belgian court freed
them pending investigation of their plea for political asylum.

FT  13 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Serbians warned of tighter sanctions
</HEADLINE>

Sanctions against Serbia will be tightened unless it cedes some conquered
territory to Bosnia, European Union leaders warned at their summit.
But they invited the Serb, Bosnian and Croat leaders to meet their foreign
ministers in Brussels on December 22, to take up what the summit conclusions
described as 'now a real possibility of achieving peace' in Bosnia.
The special meeting is also aimed at averting what the summit called the
'humanitarian disaster. . . . threatening Bosnia-Hercegovina this winter',
because of the warring parties' failure to comply with undertakings their
political and military leaders gave to the Twelve in Geneva on November 29,
to allow unimpeded passage to aid convoys.
The Union, which on November 22 threatened to use military force to get the
convoys through, warned in the conclusions that the factions 'must adhere
strictly' to what was agreed in Geneva.
Next week's meeting was convened under German pressure, in spite of
nervousness by the current Belgian presidency of the EU that new peace talks
could fail. Even Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, put chances of
success at 'still 50-50' but Chancellor Helmut Kohl said: 'I can only hope
that, a few days before Christmas, we will see some more reason and
humanity' in Bosnia.
The Twelve appeared to agree with Lord Owen, the EU's negotiator on Bosnia,
that a breakthrough may be possible if real pressure is applied to the
warring parties. There was also concern among some delegations that Greece,
which takes over the rotating EU presidency from Belgium next month, might
be seen as less than impartial because of its traditional sympathies towards
Serbia.
But Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek alternate foreign minister who will
chair the Council of Ministers from January, told the FT on the eve of the
summit that he thought the Serbs would agree to the land-for-peace formula
the EU offered in Geneva. 'Nobody should be tempted into waiting for a
spring offensive' in an effort to secure more land, he warned.
The summit conclusions underlined that 'the Serbs must be aware of the
responsibility they take upon themselves should they continue adopting an
inflexible attitude. They must realise that only real territorial
concessions by them in Bosnia-Hercegovina and acceptance of the modus
vivendi in Croatia will induce the European Union to work, as it promised to
do in Geneva, for the progressive and conditional suspension of sanctions in
line with implementation.'
Earlier attempts, led by Germany, to get sanctions toughened, were softened
into an EU commitment to 'promote a more rigorous application of sanctions'
against Serbia until a peace settlement requiring it to cede 3-4 per cent of
the territory it holds in Bosnia.
At the summit, Lord Owen was warned by EU external relations commissioner Mr
Hans van den Broek against giving Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic the
impression that he could secure more territory if he ended the war.

FT  13 DEC 93 / EU Summit: EU issues a pledge it hopes never to redeem - The
potentially heavy price for a Gatt accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union issued a promissory note to French farmers at the summit
to get France to sign up to the Uruguay Round world trade deal now within
reach. But it is far from certain that the EU will have the resources to
redeem this pledge if the note is ever presented for payment.
At the same time, the 12 heads of government issued negotiating guidelines
on textiles, cinema and broadcasting, and future multilateral trade rules
and weapons, which could complicate efforts to conclude the Gatt talks in
Geneva.
EU foreign ministers start what could turn into a week-long meeting today to
try to put flesh on the bones of the summit's Gatt guidelines, which Sir
Leon Brittan, the chief EU trade negotiator, will also have to factor in to
his tactics in Geneva.
The French hard line encouraged countries like Spain, Portugal, Greece,
Ireland and Belgium to come forward with their own last-minute lists of
demands that had to be satisfied either within the Gatt negotiations, or to
offset damage to national interests if a deal is reached.
The summit conclusions described textiles as 'of vital importance to one
member state', in implicit reference to Portuguese threats to veto Gatt
unless the US offers more market access for textiles, or the EU helps
Portugal restructure its textiles sector.
The conclusions also require an agreement which 'guarantees special and
separate treatment of audiovisual matters both now and in the future'.
France, with strong backing from countries such as Spain and Belgium, wants
cinema and broadcasting kept out of Gatt altogether to guard against further
cultural 'invasion' from the US.
Greek objections to US protectionism in ocean shipping probably mean that
maritime transport will now be taken out of the Geneva negotiations,
Brussels officials say.
The French and Spanish demand for tougher trade defence mechanisms to put up
against US Section 301 legislation will be looked at by the foreign
ministers on the basis of a plausible compromise drafted at the summit.
On agriculture, France demanded a guarantee that farmers would not have to
'set aside,' or take out of production, any more land if the output
forecasts of the reformed common agricultural policy push the exportable
agricultural surplus above Gatt limits on subsidised food exports.
In practice, that would mean cutting prices to world market levels so the EU
could export without subsidy. Farmers would then get direct compensation for
the cuts which would cost the EU budget Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.52bn) for every
Ecu10 by which the world price target had been missed.
A joint Franco-German text spelled all but the cost of this out, and in
addition, offered German farmers guarantees their incomes would not be
affected by any further revaluation of the D-Mark, as well as letting east
German farmers off part of the penalty for exceeding by 10 per cent the area
they are allowed to plant.
In the event, France got the more ambiguous commitment that if the CAP
forecasts and Gatt limits collide, this would 'not increase the restraints
of the reformed CAP'. The EU 'would, if necessary, take the requisite steps
while respecting the decisions of the Edinburgh European Council' last
December, which put a ceiling on EU farm and budgetary expenditure. The
German demands, which could prove even more costly than France's, have been
left for further wrangling.
Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, who has to sell a Gatt deal to
parliament this week, acknowledged that the set-aside guarantee was
implicit, but insisted that 'it is agreed that what needs to be done will be
done'.
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, chose to emphasise 'there will be no
change to the own resources (EU budget) limit and that has been agreed'. Do
these commitments add up?
A Gatt agreement will not start until 1995, and whether CAP output forecasts
are accurate will not be known until 1996. The revised Blair House EU-US
accord on farm trade pushes part of the Gatt cuts towards the end of its
six-year timetable. So nothing should have to be done until around 1997, and
only then if production projections are wrong. But by then, the EU budget,
which moves up in line with combined gross domestic product, should have
more resources, assuming growth resumes.
But if Germany eventually gets the 'green' D-mark formula it wants - the
costly 'switchover' mechanism which raises farm prices in all countries in
line with the strongest revaluing currencies - such calculations could be
worthless, and the promissory note will fall due.

FT  13 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Deadlock broken over R&amp;D spending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EU leaders have managed to break the deadlock over financing the Union's
research and development budget for the next five years.
They agreed that the total budget for the EU's fourth 'framework programme'
of research and development, which runs from 1994 to 1998, should be 'not
less than Ecu12bn (Pounds 9.14bn), to which might be added a reserve of
Ecu1bn (Pounds 760m), to be released at a later date'.
That appears to represent a small victory for the European Commission, which
had proposed an R&amp;D budget of Ecu13.1bn for the five-year programme. That
plan was supported in meetings of research ministers by nine member states.
But at last Monday's research council, the Union's biggest paymasters,
France, Germany and Britain, held out for a lower figure - said to be around
Ecu11bn - and the issue had to be passed to the summit.
The leaders acknowledged that the research programme would be an important
element in support of the general growth plans agreed on Saturday. In their
communique they said 'the implementation of an ambitious, well-targeted
research programme constitutes a significant contribution to efforts towards
recovery, particularly in areas such as information technology'.
If the Ecu12bn budget is approved by the European parliament, some Ecu10.5bn
will be spent on the R&amp;D projects themselves, and the rest on training,
international co-operation and dissemination of results. Research ministers
have already agreed that 28.2 per cent of the Ecu10.5bn should go to fund
information technology and communications research, 18.15 per cent towards
non-nuclear energy projects, 16 per cent to industrial technologies, 13.1
per cent to life sciences, such as biotechnology, and 9 per cent to
environmental projects.
Even at a reduced figure of Ecu12bn, the fourth framework programme is, in
absolute terms, the largest ever undertaken by the EU. But Commission
officials point out that it cannot be compared directly with the 1990-94
programme (worth Ecu6.6bn) because of inflation and changes in its
composition.

FT  13 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Clarke's capers cut little ice - The UK
chancellor's startling summit debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke prides himself on being one of the British cabinet's good
Europeans. He owns up to believing in a single European currency. He speaks
of the post-Maastricht European Union without biting his lip. Mr John Major
prefers still to refer to the European Community.
But the chancellor of the exchequer's performance in Brussels over the past
week has left more than a few of his European counterparts perplexed and not
a little irritated. Mr Clarke himself appears characteristically
unperturbed.
Last week started with him denouncing Mr Jacques Delors' white paper on
growth, competitiveness and unemployment even before he had seen the final
version. By the end of the summit the new boy on the Brussels block was
boasting that the finance ministers had successfully 'filleted' the document
before it was incorporated in the conclusions of their leaders. Those
conclusions would not require the British government to 'change any item of
its policy'.
In between Mr Clarke had denounced Mr Delors for trying to slip the document
past the finance ministers.
Overall, it was not a performance to endear him either to Mr Delors or to
colleagues from other European capitals. 'Why does he behave like this?'
asked one bemused Commission official.
It is partly a question of style. Good Europeans are supposed to behave like
the urbane Mr Dougals Hurd, the foreign secretary, fighting their national
corner with softly spoken charm and sophistication. Mr Clarke, who hails
from the street-corner school of politics so admired in the British House of
Commons, has not learnt to speak the language of diplomacy. An instinctively
rumbustious politician, he perhaps never will.
So plans for the Community to raise an extra Ecu40bn (Pounds 30.5bn) for
infrastructure projects through Union Bonds were not 'misguided' or even
'mistaken'. They were nonsense, nothing more than an attempt to catch an
easy headline.
Nor was he modest in his claims for British achievements at the summit.
Europe's decision to back supply-side policies aimed at lowering employment
costs, boosting competitiveness and deregulating markets had demonstrated
the UK was firmly in the European mainstream. Understandably perhaps, he was
more reticent about the fact that the central elements of Mr Delors' white
paper had been endorsed by other governments.
British officials are convinced that his European colleagues will get used
to Mr Clarke's rougher edges - and will discern through the occasional
bluster a genuine commitment to Europe. The chancellor's own assessment at
the end of the week was typically uncompromising: 'My credentials are
impeccably European.'

FT  13 DEC 93 / EU Summit: EU Rottweiler both petted and panned - Summiteers
at odds over Ecofin council's role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

If there is one question unresolved following the Brussels summit, it is the
strange case of the European finance ministers' split personality.
As a result, finance ministers return to Brussels today to discuss the
technicalities of carrying forward the ambitious growth plans agreed by
their political masters on Saturday, not quite sure whether they are the
angels or the devils of the new European Union. The answer probably depends
on your point of view.
At one extreme, there is Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission
president. In an animated contribution to Saturday's post-summit press
conference, he condemned the finance ministers as both arrogant and ignorant
on the subject of funding for new cross-border infrastructure projects.
'Ignorance doesn't prevent you from getting on as a politician, but
sometimes if you know what you're talking about it is quite useful,' he told
journalists.
At the other end of the scale is Mr John Major, the British prime minister,
and an enthusiast for a powerful Ecofin council. On Friday, he railed
against the Belgian presidency's decision to exclude the finance ministers
from the leaders' discussion of EU growth plans, claiming it was like
preventing the 'resident physician' from helping to analyse the patient's
fever.
On Saturday, Mr Major went further. Many heads of government, he said, had
reacted to the approach of the finance ministers by 'holding up a clove of
garlic and shouting 'unclean'' to keep them away from the building. Mr Major
probably had in mind the attitude of President Francois Mitterrand, who told
fellow leaders on Friday that sending the detail of Mr Delors' growth plans
back to finance ministers would be the same as burying them.
In fact, the Ecofin council has already built up something of a reputation
as the Rottweiler of the Union's many ministerial groups. To governments
which want to defend themselves against unpalatable extra expenditure or
fiscal measures it is a useful guard-dog, but to other governments, the
Commission, and even ministers in other councils, it can be a dangerous
nuisance with a tendency to savage their pet ideas.
In June, for example, the Ecofin council effectively shelved the idea of a
European energy tax, in spite of earlier agreement between energy and
environment ministers on the principle. During the Belgian presidency, the
ministers have found themselves at loggerheads with the Commission over its
white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, and proposals for
legally binding macro-economic guidelines. Finance ministers have also been
condemned by Mr Delors for their sluggishness in enacting EU leaders'
promises on a European growth initiative at the Edinburgh and Copenhagen
summits.
The bone of contention at the Brussels summit was Mr Delors' suggestion that
the EU should find some Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.1bn) of extra financing each year
to back big infrastructure projects in energy, transport and
telecommunications, possibly by issuing 'Union bonds'.
After the meeting, Mr Major and Mr Kenneth Clarke, his chancellor of the
exchequer, said this idea had been thrown out by leaders. But, Mr Jean-Luc
Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister who chaired the meeting, said 'all the
options were open, including the possibility of Union bonds'.
For Mr Dehaene and Mr Delors it was more important that leaders had backed
the principle of an action plan, including infrastructure investment, and
measures to improve employment opportunities.
However, when pressed on the funding question, Mr Delors was crushing about
some finance ministers' claim that the European Union or the old European
Community had rarely, if ever, borrowed money on such a scale. 'The finance
ministers were very arrogant about this, but if I'd asked how much the
Community had borrowed this year, they would have got nought out of 20,' he
said.
In 1993, he pointed out, the Union had borrowed Ecu6bn and been named
'borrower of the year'; in 1979, the member states won a facility to borrow
Ecu7bn which was lent on to companies; in 1975, Ecu6bn was borrowed to cope
with the oil crisis.
Nonetheless, it is finance ministers who will bear the brunt of the
follow-up work on trans-European networks, the growth initiative and further
financing.
According to the summit communique, finance ministers are expected to
finalise the text on macro-economic guidelines today and report back
annually on its implementation.
They must also adopt a system of interest-rate subsidies for small and
medium-sized companies before the end of the year; assist the Commission in
implementing infrastructure programmes 'efficiently, consistently and as
soon as possible'; and study, together with the European Investment Bank and
the Commission, how to mobilise that additional Ecu8bn a year for investors
in networks. Whether or not the ministers do their homework, it seems that
the Ecofin council is indispensable.

FT  13 DEC 93 / EU Summit: More retreat than defeat on Euro-laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Legislation on drinking and bathing water quality is to be recast into more
simplified 'framework' directives, with standards that EU member states will
be able to implement as they see fit, leaders decided at the weekend.
This body of EU law was among a range of regulations the European Commission
has reviewed in the light of the Union's subsidiarity doctrine, which in
theory licenses action at European level only when national, regional or
local measures would prove inadequate.
The Commission agreed to repeal 16 of 22 laws on an Anglo-French 'hit-list,'
itself a much scaled-down version of the 71 items the UK had originally
wanted discarded. However, the Commission review document approved by the
summit on Saturday was not a surrender. The political climate which has
developed as a result of the nearly 300, often intrusive, Euro-laws which
put the Single Market in place, and public reaction to the Maastricht
treaty, has chastened Brussels and governments.
Most of the legislation in the review is for recasting and simplification
rather than outright scrapping. It includes a vast corpus of customs
legislation, rules on takeover bids and indirect taxation, on the
classification of pharmaceutical products and foodstuffs, on mutual
recognition of professional qualifications, as well as the water directives
dating from the late 1970s.
The document warns on the water directives that 'application of the
subsidiarity principle must not be allowed to lower these standards'. And it
specifically excludes from the review the urban waste water directive, which
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, attacked last month on cost grounds, and
officials in London had expected to be axed.
Also excluded were individual social and employment Euro-laws on the grounds
that the recent Commission green paper on social policy has started 'a broad
debate on the future options of the Union in this field'. The so-called
'acquired rights' directive, protecting workers' rights when their company
passes into new hands, is to be amended next year 'to simplify its
application and enhance its effectiveness'.
The change of heart is most unlikely to lead to a general roll-back of EU
legislation. An underestimated aspect of the post-Maastricht climate is the
more uninhibited way in which member states prosecute their national
interests, and partly as a result, mistrust each other to implement
agreements and laws reached jointly. This, as Brussels well appreciates,
often leaves EU institutions holding the ring.

A seesaw session of world trade talks that started in a mood of crisis ended
early today with the US and EU apparently having settled wide-ranging
disagreements which were jeopardising a successful outcome of the Uruguay
Round.
Most critically, dispute over US hopes to dilute anti-dumping rules have
been settled, with officials of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
saying 95 per cent of the Uruguay Round text had now been agreed.
The US and EU have still failed, however, to reach agreement on opening
Europe's markets for television and films. Other important areas such as
financial services and shipping continue to leave the important services
sector in the balance. Intellectual property rights and a successor to the
US-EU aircraft code were also unresolved.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, said after talks broke up
that the session had been an 'amazing success' and that the treaty text was
almost complete.
The progress came after Sir Leon Brittan, the chief EU negotiator, cancelled
plans to return to Brussels on Sunday evening. He and other senior trade
officials continued talks with their US counterparts at the EU's trade
mission in Geneva until the early hours.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, who was to hold a breakfast
meeting today with Sir Leon, said: 'We've made tremendous progress.' He said
that beside the audio-visual dispute, the farm trade issue was still open.
A Gatt official said the aim now was to complete texts for an overall
agreement by late today. This, he added, depends on the US and EU wrapping
up their differences.
He said the Gatt secretariat hoped to distribute the texts to heads of
delegations late in the day. The Trade Negotiations Committee, which
oversees the Uruguay Round talks, will hold a meeting tomorrow.
Earlier yesterday, before talks resumed in the evening, Mr Sutherland
accused the US and EU of blocking progress.
His accusations came as US President Bill Clinton telephoned French Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur, British Prime Minister John Major and German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in an effort to rescue the talks.
The discussions, which began with a breakfast-time disclosure by Sir Leon
that the talks were 'in crisis', involved nerve-racking brinkmanship that
appeared to leave successful outcome of the trade talks by the December 15
deadline in the balance.
While speculation spread that negotiators were examining exclusion of
financial services from the negotiations, later comments confirmed that the
US-EU dispute over access to Europe's television and film markets was the
key stumbling block.
At the EU summit in Brussels, which ended on Saturday, Mr Ruud Lubbers,
Dutch prime minister, said it might be necessary to 'stop the clock' on the
Wednesday midnight deadline for concluding the Uruguay Round. That followed
adoption of a hardened EU position on audiovisual trade, textiles and
demands by France and several other member states for tougher trade weapons.
But Mr Sutherland dismissed the possibility of changing the deadline as 'a
misapprehension of the highest order'.
French officials believe the summit guidelines to EU negotiators to secure
special, separate treatment for European cinema and broadcasting should be
sufficient for the French government to get a Gatt deal through the National
Assembly this week.

<TEXT>
Final agreement on terms for an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and
Jericho has been pushed back by at least 10 days after the failure of a
summit yesterday aimed at resolving differences on vital security issues.
The meeting in Cairo between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, was
designed to clear the way for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied
territories, which was due to start today under the terms of the outline
peace agreement signed between Israel and the PLO in September.
The two men, holding separate press conferences after more than 2 1/2 hours
of talks, said they would meet again in Cairo in 10 days in the hope of
reaching agreement.
Mr Rabin added that both leaders remained committed to implementing in full
and on time the outline peace deal signed in Washington, but said: 'We found
certain differences in the interpretation of the deal.' These included
responsibility for 'the lines dividing the territories and Jordan and Egypt,
the problem of difficulties at the border and the size of Jericho'.
The two leaders said talks on economic co-operation would continue in Paris,
while separate delegations would continue to discuss the eventual transfer
of power from Israeli to Palestinian administration in Gaza and Jericho. On
the crucial security issues, Mr Rabin said only that these would be
addressed in 'informal talks'.
There had been optimism, particularly in Israel, that the summit would
reinject momentum into stalled negotiations on withdrawal. The breakdown
means that an Israeli pull-out is unlikely to begin until Christmas Eve at
the earliest and heightens the risk of intensified violence in the occupied
territories.
Mr Rabin said he saw no reason why Israel could not complete its military
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on schedule by April 13 next year 'if in 10
days from now we reach agreement on those issues on which we have not
reached an understanding'.
Mr Arafat showed disappointment over the summit's outcome. Asked if the
delay would fuel violence in Gaza and Jericho, he replied: 'I hope not.' He
had been insistent that today's deadline for the start of an Israeli
withdrawal should be met. But neither he nor Mr Rabin could announce even
'symbolic gestures' to mark the day.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Neo-fascists benefit from reformist disunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The charismatic neo-fascist, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, can thank his
reformist opponents in cities such as St Petersburg for his success in
Russia's first multi-party elections yesterday.
Traditionally a bastion of support for reform, the weekend elections in
Russia's second city displayed all the ingredients of what its mayor, Mr
Anatoly Sobchak, yesterday described as a 'lesson' for the country's divided
and disorganised democrats.
Not only did the reformist parties fail to unite around their pro-market and
pro-democracy convictions, they also proved unable to counter Mr
Zhirinovsky's populist promises with a more coherent message of their own.
'Only Zhirinovsky articulated clear phrases setting out what he plans to
do,' claimed Nadya, a speech-therapist who justified voting for him by
describing the 12 other parties in the election as 'an amorphous mass'.
Selling painful market reforms is harder than promising instant economic
well-being, an end to crime and the restoration of national greatness - as
Mr Zhirinovsky has done with great skill.
A potent cocktail of poverty and intellectual disillusionment with the
reformers has created the potential for a fascist surge.
But few reformists would argue they ran a good campaign.
Nowhere was this clearer than in St Petersburg's Central constituency, where
Mr Alexander Nevzorov, a popular ultra-nationalist whose vitriolic '600
Seconds' TV show was recently taken off the air, stood against two democrats
who seemed more intent on knocking each other out than on stopping him.
In an election where there will be no run-off, disciplined extremists could
only benefit.
Unlike the pro-government Russia's Choice bloc, and the reformist Yabloko
bloc, Mr Zhirinovsky had no problem ordering his representative to stand
down in favour of Mr Nevzorov, who has gleefully called these elections
President Boris Yeltsin's 'first mistake'.
A similar spectacle of democratic ineptitude in the city's Northern
constituency bordered on the farcical. There voters faced a record choice of
20 candidates for just one seat in the new State Duma, or lower chamber.
Of them only four were attached to a party - including Mr Zhirinovsky's
ubiquitous Liberal Democrats. Yet Russia's Choice was not among them. The
other 16 represented themselves - with primitive platforms ranging from
'common sense' to 'the restoration of Soviet power and the elimination of
presidential power as genetically alien to the people of Russia'.
Against this confusion, the city's poverty offered a powerful incentive for
a backlash against the recent market reforms.
'The most important thing is to restore order so that people don't go to
state shops and re-sell bread for three times as much,' declares Maria, an
ice-cream seller and single mother who supports two children on a salary of
Rbs80,000 a month (about Pounds 34).

FT  13 DEC 93 / Yeltsin claims referendum win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russian voters have approved plans for a reformed constitution that would
give strong powers to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the president's advisers said last
night.
However, the elections for the Russian parliament showed fragile support for
radical reform. The Communist party and the neo-fascist Liberal Democratic
party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky were the main beneficiaries of a low
turnout.
With Russia seemingly poised between reform and reaction, Mr Yegor Gaidar,
first deputy prime minister and leader of the liberal Russia's Choice group,
said the 'possible success of the extremists is a result of the new social
and economic situation in the country, and also because of divisions on the
part of the democrats'. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister for
privatisation, appealed to the democrats to 'unite in the face of a new
fascist threat'.
Although the turnout nationwide was low, it was enough to pass the 50 per
cent barrier needed for the vote on the constitution to be valid. Mr
Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, said that about 60 per cent
of those voting had backed the new constitution - an outcome which, he said,
gave the government stable conditions for its work.
Early indications of results gave a mixed picture of the parties' positions,
although all showed a considerable strength for the Communists and the
Liberal Democrats.
Germany's ARD public television news reported an exit poll carried out by
Russian polling institutes as showing that 23 per cent had voted for
Russia's Choice, 17 per cent for the Communists and 13 per cent for the
Liberal Democrats.
However, results for four constituencies broadcast by the Ostankino TV
company put the Liberal Democrats on 24 per cent, the Communists on 17,
Russia's Choice on 16.1 per cent and the conservative Agrarian Party on 8.3.
Further figures from the far-eastern Primorsky district, which includes the
city of Vladivostok, put Russia's Choice on 17 per cent, the Liberal
Democrats on 14 per cent, the Communists on 13 per cent and the Yabloko
group of Mr Grigory Yavlinsky on 11 per cent.
While detailed results will not be available until today or tomorrow, it is
clear that the new parliament, set to convene on January 11, will contain a
solid block of strongly nationalist deputies dedicated to opposing
pro-market reforms and to promoting anti-western policies.
Mr Gennady Burbulis, a leader of Russia's Choice and a former close aide to
President Yeltsin, blamed his former boss for refusing to support Russia's
Choice and preferring to stay above the conflict. 'We will now have to
swallow our pride and seek concrete compromises,' he told the Interfax news
agency.
Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's spokesman, said it might be possible
to co-operate with communist and nationalist parties.
Both the capital, Moscow, and the second city, St Petersburg, registered a
bare majority of participating voters, while the big city of Ekaterinburg,
home town of President Yeltsin, failed to register 50 per cent - as did
several other important regions.
As expected, the north Caucasian republic of Chechnya took no part in the
elections.

FT  13 DEC 93 / Yorkshire TV group to defer results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television will announce today that it is deferring
publication of its financial results until the end of January and passing
its final dividend.
The company had always said it would announce its results for the year to
September tomorrow.
Last month the north-east ITV company warned that a loss was likely for the
1992-93 year because of unexpected problems on advertising sales, through
overtrading - selling more air time than it had available - and pulling
advertising revenue forward by offering heavy discounts.
The company will promise today that pre-tax losses for the year are unlikely
to exceed Pounds 9.5m. The final figures may be up to Pounds 1m lower.
Meanwhile the Yorkshire board has given permission for LWT to explore in
detail an agreed bid to take over Yorkshire. As part of the proposals Anglia
Television would buy Tyne Tees. The deal is designed to fend off a hostile
bid from the Granada group for LWT.
The Yorkshire-Tyne Tees announcement will come on the day that the House of
Lords debates government proposals which will allow one company to hold two
broadcasting licences. LWT hopes government liberalisation of ownership
rules will allow LWT, Yorkshire, Tyne Tees and Anglia to join together to
form the largest ITV grouping.
Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, the television rental and
leisure group, is pushing ahead with his takeover bid for LWT. Mr Robinson
said yesterday: 'Granada and LWT make a perfect fit.'
Central Television shareholders will today receive the details of the
Carlton Communications offer which values Central, the second largest ITV
company, at Pounds 814m, equal to Pounds 27.92 for each Central ordinary
share.

Orford and Swan is a small British company which concentrates on making a
few products to exceptionally high standards. It makes silk scarves in pure
silk jacquard crepe-de-chine or in luscious twill. Photographed left is the
gloriously rich Medallion in black and dark red.
Then there are shoes such as those also in the photograph left which are
made from the same richly patterned pure silk jacquard as the scarf. They
are perfect for indoor evening wear, they look particularly good when teamed
with black. There are also waistcoats, bow-ties and braces for chaps.
There are, of course, much grander, more established names in the world of
must-have scarves but Swan and Orford seems to be establishing a very
English niche, all of its own.
The best selection of shoes and scarves can be seen at Space NK, Thomas
Neals, 41 Earlham Street, London WC2 and at Fortnum &amp; Mason, Piccadilly,
London W1. The shoes are about Pounds 125 a pair and the scarves about
Pounds 145 each. The cashmere silk shawls are a real luxury at about Pounds
325 and can be found at Harrods while Liberty of Regent Street and Sogo of
Piccadilly sell the scarves and waistcoats (Pounds 252 each).

FT  11 DEC 93 / Leading Article: The house that Jacques built
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Where would - and will - the European Commission be without Jacques Delors?
Back in August, the collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism in the
face of a deepening European recession seemed to signal the final
disintegration of the project to which the Commission president has devoted
the last 10 years. But, far from admitting defeat, Mr Delors has forged
ahead with work on a white paper designed to address the competitive
deficiencies within the European economy that the last few years have
cruelly exposed. As a coherent vision of Europe's future, the document is
only half convincing. But that, given the obstacles that Mr Delors faced, is
better than most people expected.
Mr Delors - a Brussels-based socialist at the centre of a predominantly
conservative-governed Union - has a reputation as something of an ideologue,
a man determined to pursue French-style dirigisme on a wider European stage.
But the white paper demonstrates that the Commission president is, above
all, a pragmatic and skilful politician.
The white paper rightly states that more needs to be done in order to build
a dynamic, liberal and competitive European economy; most obviously, a
successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round is required. Aspirations for
private involvement in the financing of trans-European infrastructure
projects, streamlining welfare systems and removing remaining obstacles to
free trade all suggest that the Commission remains on the liberal-minded
road.
The labour market remains Europe's Achilles' heel. But the Commission's
willingness to embrace an agenda of reducing regulations - including minimum
wages - and cutting non-wage labour costs, combined with investment in
education and skills, is encouraging. The sentiments suggest that Mr Delors,
and his Commission colleagues, have moved a long way towards accepting the
need for deregulation to promote job growth.
Rigid timetable
Yet there are substantial holes. The document confirms, for example, the
importance of a stable, European macroeconomic framework. But it does not
acknowledge, let alone draw conclusions, from the failure of the hard ERM to
deliver that stability. Nor does it explain how a growth and job oriented
strategy can be meshed with the rigid timetable and convergence criteria
laid down in the Maastricht treaty.
The problem is that the events of the summer, while derailing the Maastricht
monetary timetable, have clearly been to Europe's benefit. The shift to wide
ERM bands and the consequent freedom to cut interest rates that this has
given European governments seems to have delivered, by accident rather than
design, the necessary combination of loose exchange rate co-ordination and
monetary flexibility. The resulting downward trend in European interest
rates is helping both the German and French economies to emerge from
recession. French growth is still being being dragged down by unnecessarily
high real interest rates, but that is now the sole responsibility of the
French government.
Sensible approach
In short, Europe seems to have stumbled into a workable monetary system. But
what of the monetary union timetable, the role of European Monetary
Institute, the apparent French desire to stay within narrow bands, or the
fiscal convergence criteria? The sensible approach would be to maintain the
current flexibility, abandon the requirement to move to Emu via narrow
bands, set up a system of consistent national inflation targets and entrust
the EMI with monitoring convergence across a broad range of nominal and real
variables.
All these issues Mr Delors studiously ignores. But it is on fiscal policy
that the white paper is most misjudged. The case for investment in
trans-European networks is strong. The argument for a European-wide fiscal
expansion is less so. But the case for allowing the Commission to borrow
directly from the capital markets in order to finance this investment - the
proposed Union bonds - is full of holes.
As a trick to allow national governments to bypass the Maastricht fiscal
criteria, it is transparent and unnecessary. As a means to enable fiscally
irresponsible countries, such as Greece and Italy, to borrow cheaply under a
different name, it sets a dangerous precedent. But it is the constitutional
implications of the fiscal proposals that are most worrying.
Mr Delors' strategy, it seems, is to use the shield of a recovery programme
to enable the Commission to assume more of the fiscal powers of a sovereign
state. But that is a step which begs questions that go far beyond the scope
even of the most wide-ranging examination of Europe's economic future.
The white paper sets out clearly Mr Delors' vision of a flexible, low
regulation, high investment, job-creating community of nations. The task of
explaining how Europe's political institutions are to be developed to match
this economic aspiration is one for the EU's political leaders, aided and
abetted by Mr Delors' successor.

FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Ill omen from the pitch for Belgians - Summit
Diary / FT writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders'
meeting in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a shadow cast over yesterday's Brussels summit, but it wasn't the
war in former Yugoslavia, the possibility of a last-minute hitch in the Gatt
talks, or even the spectre of millions of jobless Europeans: it was the
shock defeat of Belgium's top soccer club, Anderlecht, by Werder Bremen of
Germany in Wednesday night's European champions' cup-tie. Brussels-based
Anderlecht led 3-0 after half an hour - and yet the Germans managed to score
five goals in the final 24 minutes to win the match.
At the summit, the early play went in favour of the Belgians - captained by
premier and football fan Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, who was chairing the meeting.
Fellow summiteers bowed to the probing forward runs of Mr Dehaene and Mr
Jacques Delors, another soccer enthusiast, as they deftly outlined plans to
promote European growth, competitiveness and employment. The Belgians' fear,
of course, is that before the match finishes today, the Germans and British
may emulate Bremen's remarkable comeback with some sharp counter-attacks on
the growth plans in the meeting's final communique.
* * * *
After the Lord Mayor's Show comes the muck-cart: ministers, diplomats and
journalists are bracing themselves for a nightmare on Monday when the
Belgian presidency has committed itself to hold five simultaneous
ministerial meetings in the overcrowded Charlemagne building in Brussels,
many of them charged with clearing up issues unresolved by EU leaders. Some
of the coincidences are fortuitous - with a Gatt deal in the offing, it's as
well that foreign, trade and agriculture ministers will be close to one
another - but nobody seems to know where finance, health and environment
ministers will find room to discuss the state of their particular part of
the European Union.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Timing of peace statement in balance: Obstacles remain as
Major and Reynolds seek springboard for lasting Ulster settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments yesterday held on to the prospect of a
joint declaration designed to secure a pre-Christmas end to 25 years of IRA
violence in Northern Ireland.
But after a fresh round of talks between Mr John Major and Mr Albert
Reynolds, the two leaders were forced to acknowledge there were several
remaining obstacles to an agreement which would usher in a new era in
Anglo-Irish relations.
Despite these difficulties, the two leaders hope to meet again in London
before Christmas to pursue an agreement.
During talks at the European Union meeting in Brussels, the British and
Irish prime ministers agreed the statement should act as a springboard for
an intensive round of negotiations on a permanent political settlement in
Northern Ireland. More immediately they hope it will coax the IRA, through
its political wing Sinn Fein, into extending its traditional Christmas
ceasefire into a permanent cessation of violence.
Officials on both sides, however, admitted the two governments had yet to
find the precise language for the most sensitive passages in the document.
They also remained uncertain that the first attempt since the 1985
Anglo-Irish agreement to balance the competing claims of Irish nationalism
and Ulster unionism could restore peace.
After an hour-long meeting the two leaders issued a brief joint statement
saying they had made further progress towards agreement on the text of the
declaration. They would meet again before Christmas to bring the process to
a conclusion. With Mr Major anxious to secure an accord before parliament
breaks on Friday for the Christmas recess, one high-ranking British official
commented: 'I very much hope we get there. I cannot guarantee that we will
get there.' He then added: 'There is still some way to go.'
The two governments will attempt to iron out the remaining differences
during intensive contacts over the next few days, opening the possibility of
a final summit meeting in London on Tuesday or Wednesday.
Anxious to reassure the Ulster Unionists, British officials said the
declaration would underwrite its guarantee to the Unionist majority in
Northern Ireland that there could be no change in the status of the province
without their consent.
Mr Major had also won assurances from Mr Reynolds of the Irish government's
commitment to drop its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as part of a
comprehensive political settlement.
The joint declaration will repeat the offer to Sinn Fein of a place at the
negotiating table in response to a total cessation of terrorist activities.
There were signs, however, of continuing disagreement over Dublin's demand
for an all-Ireland convention open to all constitutional parties from the
North and South.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norway's Christmas tree, its annual present to Britain, was switched on this
week. In my view, however, the tree in Trafalgar Square does nothing to
lessen the infamy which that glum little country attained this year with its
decision to renew, unilaterally, the commercial slaughtering of whales in
defiance of the international ban on whaling adopted in 1986.
The Norwegians branded themselves as ecological hooligans by harpooning 226
minke whales - 157 commercially and 69 in the name of scientific research.
The meat finished up on local fishmongers' slabs where it retailed at about
Pounds 17 per kilo.
Norway was bombarded by protests. There was talk of US trade sanctions and
consumer boycotts of Norwegian exports; calls to travellers to stay away;
and reports that German and British companies had cancelled several million
dollars' worth of contracts for Norwegian food.
Were the Norwegians stupid? Why had a country of such insignificance and
poverty of achievement hurled itself into the furnace of international
condemnation for the sake of 226 dead whales? To find out, I visited the
Norwegian embassy in London, where I put these questions to Terje Lobach,
the embassy's counsellor for fisheries and agriculture.
Lobach is a nice man. He poured me coffee. I was determined not to get
bogged down in a sterile discussion of the Norwegians' technical arguments.
I wanted to get straight to the blood and guts - to ask Lobach why the
Norwegians seemed incapable of grasping the central tenet of the
anti-whaling case: that firing explosive harpoons into the planet's greatest
mammals is a crime against life.
First, though, it has to be acknowledged that there are many strands to the
Norwegians' case. They maintain that the north-eastern Atlantic minke is
plentiful in number (at least 87,000), and certainly not endangered; that
traditional Norwegian whaling provides employment and supplements income
among coastal communities; and that minke whaling, which yields meat
consumed by humans, is essentially different from the industrial,
capital-intensive whaling (primarily for whale oil) of former years which
drove some whale species piteously close to the brink.
Moreover, when it comes to killing methods, Norway claims that the majority
of whales die 'instantly.' According to the Norwegians: 'During research
whaling in 1992, about 50 per cent of the 95 whales shot died instantly . .
. less than 10 per cent lived for more than 10 minutes.'
Whales injured by a harpoon must be killed as swiftly as possible by rifle.
There are inspectors aboard whaling vessels to ensure compliance with
Norwegian law.
But why, I asked Terje Lobach, should Norway bother with all this
fiddle-faddle when the essential question was an emotional one. Why, I
wondered, had Norway's prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, impudently
claimed that decisions about the use of resources - in this case, the
leviathans - could not be based on 'sentiment.' Why were the Norwegians so
frigid?
'Norway has always objected to the ban on whaling,' Lobach said calmly,
'because there is no scientific evidence that minke whales cannot be managed
and harvested in a proper way. It has to do with resource management,
especially of fisheries, in which Norway's record is second to none. The 226
minke whales taken this summer represent less than 0.2 per cent of the
estimated minke stock in the north-east Atlantic.
'Norway is a very new independent country, and part of the reason for its
resumption of traditional whaling is that Norwegians don't want to be told
by outsiders what to do with their own natural resources. In polls, the
Norwegian government has the backing of 70 to 80 per cent of the (4.2m)
population.
'Norwegians can appreciate the sentimental objection to killing lambs, but
we still have to take their lives for food.'
'Not with explosive harpoons,' I countered.
'Even in Britain,' said Lobach, 'methods of slaughtering livestock for the
table leave much to be desired. In Norway, whalemeat is described as 'the
greenest of all meats,' because of the scientific way in which it is
harvested.'
I admit it: my opposition to whaling is 'emotional' and 'sentimental.' But I
would rather be thought emotional than mistaken for a Norwegian. They can
stuff their Christmas tree.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Private View: The last miner in the county
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It will be a black Christmas for some. 'The lads finish work at dinnertime,'
the lodge secretary said, 'and we'll be away down the road to the pubs
havin' a few pints and reminiscin' about what was and what could have been.
Aye, it'll certainly not be any celebration.'
That was yesterday, when 650 men took their leave of Wearmouth colliery,
Sunderland, one of the oldest pits in Britain and the last in the once-great
Durham coalfield.
When Alan Mardghum (pronounced 'Marjam') was born in 1955 there were 700,000
miners working in 850 British coalmines. When he went to work there were
still a quarter of a million. Today there are just 16,500. Coal, which fired
the Industrial Revolution and powered the British Empire, has become a
cottage industry.
In the 14 months since the Government caused a public outcry by announcing
that 31 pits were to close, 23,000 men have left the industry. Wearmouth was
one of 12 mines reprieved for 'market testing'; but like seven others of the
dozen so far, and in spite of high productivity on its remaining face seven
and a half miles out under the North Sea, it failed the test.
Alan Mardghum is so upset, he cannot admit that it is the end. He clings to
the hope that a private buyer will be found for Wearmouth's 140m tonnes of
proven reserves, and that one day British mining will be resurrected by a
repentant public and government.
As lodge secretary of the miners' union, he has mastered the language of
political indictment: he blames government for the lack of a proper energy
policy, the 'dash for gas', massive subsidies for nuclear power, the
electricity link from France, coal imports - all, he said, part of the
vendetta against miners and their union.
I take it you're not a Tory voter, I said.
'Certainly not.' He laughed. 'It's not that apparent, is it?'
It is apparent enough from the campaign posters and rude cartoons adorning
the lodge secretary's office. This is Scargill territory, a left-wing pit
where the men have always responded to the call.
Mardghum, a member of the Labour Party since 23, grew up in the nearby
village of Southwick a mile along the bank of the River Wear. He described
it as a hard area of high unemployment where children kept time by the
hooter of the former Wear Dock shipyard. Southwick is famous: here the late
John Adie, the adoptive father of TV reporter Kate, had his chemist's shop -
now a grunge fashion boutique.
Alan and his brother were the first miners in the immediate family. Their
father worked on the buses. I mentioned all those mothers who for
generations had tried to prevent their sons going down the pit. Wasn't it a
good thing they did not have to do that any more?
'No, I don't think it's a good thing. Not for any sentimental reasons . . .
People tend to get a bit misty-eyed about the coal industry. It's a dirty,
filthy, horrible job at the end of the day. Nobody who tells the truth would
pretend any different. But the way you've got to look at it is: is there an
alternative energy source?'
Let us suppose, I said, that the alternative sources are forever cheaper. Is
it necessarily a disaster to lose coalmining?
'I think it is. I think the city council would agree with that. I think
you'll see a rapid rise in crime, because there isn't any alternative
employment.
'You talk about mothers not wanting their son to go down the pit. But I'm
certain if they had the choice between the son joyriding stolen cars or
burgling people's houses or going down the pit, they would take the
opportunity for them to earn a decent wage and be supported by a union that
is fighting for decent conditions.'
Like other smokestack areas, Wearside presents a surreal picture. Scenes of
dereliction where coal, shipbuilding and heavy engineering once prospered
are patched over with new motorways, shopping centres, light industrial
parks. In one stands a group of 'units' mockingly designed like Greek
temples with brick columns and concrete pediments.
There might be new jobs, said Mardghum, but they were too few and too
low-paid. He cannot accept that heavy industry is finished. How could an
island trading nation not have its own merchant shipbuilding industry?
There's no God's law which says we have to build our own ships, I said, if
we can buy them cheaper from Koreans.
'Well, I think there's a moral argument when they're losing, I think, 100 a
year killed in Korean shipyards. There's certainly a moral argument against
importing coal that's produced by black slave labour in South Africa or
child labour in Colombia.'
Mardghum may have more excuse than reason for his gloomy refusal to foresee
a decent future for the area. The man himself is ebullient: it is the NUM
official who is pessimistic.
'If there's an upturn we'll have another boom and another slump. That's the
way the capitalist system works. It's always jam tomorrow. They've promised
us that for years and years and years. 'Take less now and you get more
tomorrow'. It never materialises.'
What will you do now? I asked.
'The first thing is to get over the shock of losing a job. It's the first
time ever I've been unemployed.'
For his 17 years work he will collect a redundancy cheque for Pounds 25,000.
But the chances of a union activist finding work were slim. 'So what I'll
probably do, what I should have done when I was 17 or 18, is go to
university and study for a degree.
'I've thought about social work. Through mixing with lads at the pit I would
have an aptitude to do something like working with teenagers with
behavioural problems. I'm a bit of a softie, so I don't think I would work
with babies or young kids who have been abused. I don't think I could stand
that.'
Would you work for a capitalist organisation?
'If you rule out working for a capitalist organisation you'd be on the dole
the rest of your life,' he laughed. 'I've got political principles but I
drink scotch and Newcastle beer that make a massive contribution to the Tory
Party. I mean, I'm not stupid. I'll be delighted to get a job in whatever.'
It could be the last Christmas with money for a long time. 'I'll certainly
not go crackers with money just because I'll have a few bob in the bank from
redundancy payments. We'll spend no more this year than we did last year:
you're talking about 1,500 quid, 2,000 quid. That's what we normally spend.'
He will improve the council house and buy a better second-hand car, perhaps
a Sierra. 'If the money's run out and if I haven't got a job, we've got a
decent house to live in. So long as it's a roof over your head and its warm
and comfortable, its something.'
The Wearmouth pensioners will have their usual Christmas dinner (in summer
there is a coach trip to Blackpool or Scarborough). Marghum hopes the Durham
miners' gala, the day of bands and political speeches, will survive into its
110th year.
Do you think Britain is losing something apart from its coal?
'I think it loses the culture that miners have brought to the country, like
the brass bands, the miners' welfares and things. I canna think of any other
group of workers that built a community around one industry as such.
'When you look at the artists, the Sidney Chaplins of this world, the
politicians the union and industry's thrown up, I think it will be a
terrible miss.'
Miners had a special place in everybody's heart, he said. 'I mean, even
Thatcher's got a regard for miners - she said she was terrified to be beat
by the miners in 84-85.'
But the popular view was often distorted. 'Particularly in the south of
England they still view coalmining as a little lad of 12 gettin' down the
pit with his pony and pushing tubs of coal around. You've got a bit of
how-green-was-my-valley attitude. There's a lot of nostalgia about
coalminin', more and more now its in a rapid state of decline.'
An ignorant nostalgia?
'In some respects, yes. And I mean that with the best respect to everybody
who supported us, because we've had tremendous support from across the
country. People need to be made aware that it's a high-tech,
highly-competitive industry that's been butchered.'
What will you regret most - apart from losing your job, I mean?
'I'll certainly miss the camaraderie, the sense of being part of a
collective - that's very, very important in me life - where one man looks
out for another. When you're working underground you're fighting Mother
Nature. To do that you've got to be very vigilant.'
What have you learned from it?
'I think I'm a better person for having worked there and mixing with the
lads whom I represent. They've been absolutely tremendous.' His eyes were
blinking now. 'And I would like to think that, you know, I've done me best.
Warn't always right, but I think I have always done me best to represent the
lads.
'And I learnt that from working with them, being honest with them, having
arguments with them. Hasn't always been easy. I couldn't wish, I cannot
imagine working that length of time anywhere else other than with these. I
mean, they've been absolutely brilliant.
'We've lost this battle. This was one of the most important for us. But
we'll be back again in some form.' He paused a while. 'So, yes. Very, very
sad.'

FT  11 DEC 93 / Old and out of touch with Mr Blobby: Dominic Lawson feels
the onrush of middle-aged senility as he contemplates the pop charts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week I celebrate my birthday. I now realise that I must be getting not
just older, but actually old. I know this because it took me a while to work
out what age I would become on December 17. I discovered, after much
counting of fingers, that I am to be 37. This worried me, because a month or
so ago I was rung by a newspaper reporter who asked me how old I was, and I
said, after some hasty arithmetic, that I was 37. Only a year out, I know,
but there was a time, not so long ago, when I could not have made such a
mistake.
The physical signs of ageing bother me not a bit. I enjoy the sight of more
and more silver hairs as I study myself in the mirror. I do not mind that I
now stand with the middle aged on the right hand side of London
Underground's escalators, while once I joined the whizz-kids running up the
left lane. I do not even mind that, with every passing year the wicket
keeper for the village cricket team I play for, is moving closer and closer
to the stumps as I bowl.
Such physical manifestations of ageing are somehow dignified. As I grow
older I want to be taken more seriously, and such infirmities help. But the
mental signs of ageing are less pleasing, aesthetically. People who say that
they do not know their own age because birthdays no longer matter to them,
are deluding themselves. They forget because they are no longer good at
remembering things. The reason why I forget my own age is the same reason
why I cannot remember the name of someone to whom I have just been
introduced. My brain cells are atrophying, just like the muscles in my
bowling arm.
We, the senile middle-aged, have, of course, a store of knowledge, which we
can plunder, to give the misleading appearance of being alert. What is now,
in nostalgic retrospect called 'an old fashioned education' sometimes stands
us in good stead, like the hibernating squirrel's store of nuts. But
meanwhile the march of popular culture leaves us looking more and more like
beached whales.
I experience this most in my discussions with my cartoon editor at The
Spectator. Gently, like a good boy scout assisting an elderly lady across a
busy road, he explains to me all the cartoons I do not understand, pointing
out how this one refers to a particularly popular new television programme,
or that one is a joke about the latest American film.
A couple of weeks ago he began filling the paper with cartoons of a strange
figure, who bore a passing resemblance to the Michelin man. 'Who is that?' I
asked. 'Who is that?' said my cartoon editor. 'You're like the judge who had
never heard of the Beatles. That is Mr Blobby.' 'Who is Mr Blobby?' I
persisted. 'It doesn't matter,' sighed my cultural adviser, 'but he's
massive. He's huge. He's taking over the country.'
And he was right. The front page of yesterday's Daily Mail consisted of not
much more than a picture of 'Mr Blobby' at the door of number 10 Downing
Street. And I finally discovered who Mr Blobby is. He was described by the
Daily Mail as 'the chart-topper.' So that was it. Mr Blobby is to the youth
of 1993 what the Beatles were to my generation, and I have indeed become
like the famous High Court judge who thought the Beatles were insects.
I suppose I should be worried about my isolation from the biggest influences
on the UK's youth. And I suppose I should not express the age-old thought
that my popular heroes were giants compared with those of a succeeding
generation.
All the same, can Mr Blobby really be as good as Lennon and McCartney? John
Lennon scandalised the people of US, when he told them that the group was
'more famous than Jesus Christ'. I fear that if Mr Blobby were to make a
similar boast, he would find many supporters.
But I will make no protest. The old appear merely petulant when they damn
the follies of the young. And I must be careful: I have a daughter, who in
less than two weeks will reach her first birthday. I must make it my
business not to sneer at Mr Blobby, because he will seem almost sensible
compared to the idols of the next generation. Meanwhile I will celebrate my
birthday with a much younger person, who is quite happy not knowing how old
she is.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: Scouse in the house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few cities have needed Scouse wit to lighten its darkness quite as much as
Liverpool has - blighted by the death of shipbuilding, the tragedy of
Toxteth, the horrors of Hillsborough and the Jamie Bulger case. Yet few
provincial centres have been as artistically vital as Liverpool, from the
Mersey bands of the 1960s, through the playwrights of the 1970s, the
Liverpool Everyman, the Philharmonic, the Tate.
In the 1960s, it was music that kept the kids off the street. And alongside
all those jangling guitars and sweaty, twisting bodies in the Cavern and
lesser clubs, came the poets, especially the three that seemed to sum up the
spirit of the place: Roger McGough, Brian Patten and Adrian Henri.
In 1967, Penguin published an anthology of the three of them in their
Penguin Modern Poets series. The Mersey Sound is still in print and has now
sold almost half a million copies, making it the best-selling poetry
anthology of all time. And this week the three of them had a reunion reading
at the South Bank. The Liverpool Poets were back.
But back to what?
And who were they writing for? Of the three, only Henri is not a born and
bred Scouser, though he is only one that still lives there. 'Our audience
was the same as the more discerning Cavern-goers,' he says,
'non-intellectual, non-university, a few art students, sixth-formers, a
young crowd who would try and appreciate anything as long as they weren't
bored: above all whatever was presented should entertain.'
The Livepool Poets in performance are part a cabaret threesome and part
earnest individualists. The opening sketch was a telling reminder of how the
Liverpool Poets have been treated by the critics - as 'a short-lived
furore'. Being popular, and easily understood at first reading, they must be
superficial. How true is this?
Henri is the slightest of the trio. Greatly influenced by the Beats, his
poems too often sound like random gobbets of autobiographical reportage. The
best of them depend for their success upon the single, forceful image. His
best work, in fact, has been done as an artist - from pop art in the 1960s
to multi-media events with live music, including the 'Liverpool Scene,' a
poetry/rock group that played with Led Zeppelin and recorded for RCA. What
he can do well is write a good song lyric.
Patten reads heart on sleeve, and some of his love poems are very good
indeed. Unfortunately, he seems too easily pleased by his own material. Too
much of his poetry is like an adolescent's first love affair with words.
McGough's is the most enduring talent, and he is also the most effective
solo entertainer of the three. He reads fast, making his well-crafted work
sound like good patter. Most of the poems he read were from his new book,
Defying Gravity (Viking, Pounds 9.99), a collection which The Times Literary
Supplement declined to review.
These days McGough's work is mainly about his relations - the large Catholic
family amongst which he was brought up; the young children of his second
marriage. This is all very different from the mildly subversive stuff of the
1960s, the tics picked up from e e cummings; the defiant spurning of syntax
and punctuation; the not so daring hymns to free love. What he seems to
exude now is a mood of incorrigible optimism and the belief that poetry and
what it memorialises is for sharing.
No wonder the young girl said to her friend as she walked into the foyer:
'We will write a poem tonight, I assure you, and it will rhyme]' No one ever
said that after a reading by Walcott or Brodsky. 'Oh my God]' was what they
said then. 'Such unscaleable heights . . .'

FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: New opera house finished at last - John Allison
attends the inauguration in Helsinki
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After long delays of up to 70 years, Helsinki's new opera house opened last
month with the first Finnish performance of Aullis Sallinen's Kullervo. The
opera was commissioned for the new house and completed in 1988, but as
construction got further behind schedule its premiere was moved to Los
Angeles in February 1992 (reviewed by Max Loppert).
The inauguration - celebrated lavishly - is of great significance for
Finland. In spite of a modern opera boom unparalleled anywhere, the country
has until now lacked a purpose-built opera house. Many new works have been
premiered in the courtyard of Savonlinna's castle, home to the renowned
summer festival and since 1919, Finnish National Opera itself has occupied
Helsinki's 500-seat Alexander Theatre, built in 1879 for the Russian
garrison, charming but hopelessly inadequate.
Since the 1920s, successive plans have been mooted and then shelved. The
final stage began as long ago as 1975 with the launch of an architectural
competition. The winning team, led by Eero Hyvamaki, was announced in 1977,
but even then construction did not commence until 1986.
As the project neared completion, so the controversy it inspired increased:
with Finland in the grip of a severe recession, people baulked at the cost,
in the region of Pounds 100 million. The state provides 85 per cent of FNO's
income, with ticket sales and sponsorship funding the balance. Top ticket
prices are a little over Pounds 20. Cultural provision in Finland - a
country whose total population is about half that of London - puts levels of
arts subsidy in the UK to shame.
Though the stark, white-tiled and glass facade perhaps has the look of a
1970s design built in the 1980s, the opera house blends well with the
scenery on the city's Toolonlahti Bay. Not far from Alvar Aalto's Finlandia
Hall, and across the water from the Helsinki City Theatre, the building is
dominated by its huge fly-tower, but to keep the surrounding park as green
as possible, the service areas are all underground.
Cool, Nordic modernism predominates inside. The foyers, white with blue-grey
marble floors, are spacious and the auditorium suggests an honest, modern
response to the traditional horseshoe shape, its curved lines ensuring
intimacy. Red beechwood panelling adds warmth, and the hard materials used
throughout help the excellent acoustics. These are matched by good
sightlines - no-one is far from the wide stage and its adjustable
proscenium. The theatre's versatile facilities are suited to a wide
repertory (it is shared with Finnish National ballet). It also boasts a
small second auditorium, which doubles as a rehearsal stage and a venue for
experimental works.
The move has necessitated expanding the orchestra and chorus, and on the
evidence of this Kullervo performance at least, both have found the measure
of their new home. They responded magnificently to the baton of Ulf
Soderblom, the midwife of countless new Finnish operas who retired in the
summer as FNO's chief conductor after 20 years. Kalle Holmberg's production
 -by all accounts essentially the same as in the Los Angeles premiere -
filled the new stage with fluid movement and allowed Kullervo to unfold with
inexorable dramatic thrust.
Though Kullervo's sources lie in Finnish myth and romantic drama this is no
'fur-hat opera': the powerfully-drawn characters all have modern resonance,
but the composer leaves recognition of this to his audience. The title role,
a sympathetic portrait of an angry youth trapped by society, is tailored to
the talents of Jorma Hynninen, Finland's foremost baritone and one of the
world's great singing-actors. His dark, full-toned instrument seems ideal
for the troubled Kullervo.
Though Hynninen compels attention, Kullervo is above all an ensemble opera,
and there were outstanding performances from Jorma Silvasti as a plaintive
Kimmo, Kullervo's friend, and Eeva-Liisa Saarinen, unbearably poignant as
Kullervo's mother. Anna-Lisa Jakobsson sang lustrously as the Smith's Young
Wife, and as the Blind Singer, Vesa-Marti Loiri crooned the ballad on which
the whole plot hinges with peculiar intensity. A single change from the Los
Angeles (and CD) cast brought Tapani Valtasaari into the role of the
weak-willed Unto.
This performance revealed Finnish opera at its richest. The country has long
been blessed with great singers and composers, and at last it has an opera
house worthy of them.
In repertory until January 7

FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: Come to the 'Cabaret' - Malcolm Rutherford reviews Sam
Mendes' new production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If this were a real cabaret, you would drop in for the second act which is
so incomparably better than the first. Since the Donmar Warehouse is a
serious theatre, you have to sit all the way through and take the smooth
with the rough.
I have been pondering why the first hour or so of this once marvellous
musical now seems so passive, yet the second is more explosive than ever.
Possibly one reason was first night nerves: there is not much zing in the
opening numbers. The auditorium at this most chic of London's theatres has
been re-arranged to turn the first rows into cabaret tables. Everything
seems to be in place. Then nothing much happens.
The master of ceremonies at the Berlin nightclub is played by Alan Cumming,
the man who did an electrifying adolescent Hamlet in the same theatre a few
weeks ago. He looks wonderful: perfect eye make-up, red around the lower
edges. Dressed first in a long black leather coat, only curtailed to give a
glimpse of his white socks, then in the black silk underwear of a
transvestite, he has kept that finger-wagging approach and way of appealing
directly to the audience that he revealed in Hamlet. When he is around all
eyes are on him. The trouble is that he is not around all that often. This
is a remarkably subdued performance: the MC as the observer rather than the
observed.
Is that deliberate? If so, it is a triumph of modesty over exhibitionism.
Kenneth Branagh in his precocious years would never have been tamed so
easily or effectively. Cumming is the new male star of British theatre.
Yet perhaps we should pay tribute to Sam Mendes, the young director. It is
just possible that he intended the first half to be dull in order to show
off later. For perceptions of Cabaret have clearly changed over the years.
The story was drawn from the writings of Christopher Isherwood, who lived in
Berlin in the 1930s. The original heroine seemed to be Sally Bowles, the
girl - drawn from a real-life figure called Jean Ross - who worked the
nightclubs in the German capital and wanted to die on the job like her
friend Elsie from Chelsea. It may have seemed romantic at the time.
Today Sally Bowles looks like a silly, uninteresting little girl, and her
American, aspirant novel-writing boy friend, Clifford, less silly but just
as stupid. They have moved from being central characters in the show to
almost peripheral. There may be some theatrical irony in the casting: Sally
is played by Jane Horrocks, the girl who starred in The Rise and Fall of
Little Voice.
There are compensations in making way for older people. The outstanding
character in this production is Fraulein Schneider, played by Sara
Kestelman. Those were the days when an unmarried German girl over the age of
15 continued to be addressed as Fraulein ever after. I do not think we ever
learn her first name, nor that of her lover Herr Schultz.
Fraulein Schneider keeps a boarding house and is not unduly fussy about her
tenants, provided they pay the rent and preserve a veneer of respectability.
Where she draws the line, as the 1930s advance, is in deciding to break off
her engagement to Herr Schultz because he is a Jew, even though German-born.
These scenes are vastly more mature than anything to do with Sally Bowles.
George Raistrick is a most dignified Herr Schultz. Ms Kestelman plays
Fraulein Schneider with an impeccable German English-speaking accent that
haunts anyone acquainted with central Europe. And the best songs in the show
have become the love duets between them, overshadowing even the theme,
'Cabaret'. The most satirical remains 'If you could see her through her my
eyes' sung by the MC dancing with an ape. It has a devastating final line.
Cumming performs it to perfection.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: Blithe minus spirit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Birmingham Repertory Theatre has updated Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit
(1941) and dragged it into the 1990s. The play looks more like Prohibited
Substance as the ectoplasmic ex-wife returns to haunt the living marriage.
But the evening still needs to be much more spirited.
Charles is a novelist who has called in a Medium, Madame Arcati, for some
psychic research; but his dead wife Elvira materialises visible and audible
to him alone and intent on having him join her on the other side. Charles's
second wife, Ruth, handles the situation well until Elvira kills her in a
car accident fixed for Charles. He is then haunted by two ex-wives who are
finally exorcised by Madame Arcati and the Maid.
The set, a conservatory with TV, stereo, fax and computer promising
technological mischief. But Coward's ambiance is lacking. The play is partly
about being polite at all times, and partly about ideal, blithe womanhood
represented by Elvira. The director Robin Midgley has missed these aspects
of the play.
Midgley and his designer Ruari Murchison fix Elvira in the 1960s, listening
to Sgt. Pepper and materialising to 'Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.' The
idea works intermittently, but cannot be sustained. This is because the play
is too flimsy to change. Coward wrote it over a week's holiday. He said: 'I
will admit that I knew it was witty, I knew it was well constructed and I
also knew it would be a success.' The play ran for 2,000 performances in the
West End.
Missing from Birmingham are Coward's delicious Dry Martinis which marshal
the action like punctuation orders a sentence; gone are tales of
fecklessness and irresponsibility in Budleigh Salterton; and absent is the
innate sense of the frivolity of it all. The trick of Coward's comedy makes
the encounter between two worlds into another cocktail conversation.
In come, commendably, an Indian couple Dr Bunti and his wife Sadie who, with
seasonal if not devotional correctness, do not drink and drive. Also in are
modern furnishings which make people behave in an un-Cowardlike way: just
try insoucaint lounging in a leather and chrome Vassily Chair, circa 1922.
As Madame Arcati, Patsy Byrne is wonderfully terrestrial. She huffs and
puffs around the stage, humming, swinging garlic and consuming strawberry
sandwiches. Elvira and Ruth (Eve Matheson and Angela Scoular) in bright
latex dresses orbit around a confused but self-satisfied Charles (John
Labanowksi).
Visitors from the other side have appeared on stage and screen from Hamlet
to Ghostbusters. Perhaps Teddington's most famous son (1899-1973) should
materialise himself to liven up the proceedings in what he thought was his
most successful play.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: A 'forte' soprano
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just two months ago, Elizabeth Connell sang a brave, vital Isolde in the
Festival Hall, with Wagner's giant pit-band surrounding her on the platform
(and with the wrong conductor), and she made her music hit the back of the
Grand Tier. On Wednesday she sang a Wigmore Hall programme entitled 'In
Praise of Women': a decidedly douce selection of songs with piano, from
German Romantics to later French to forgotten Victorian, some of them
composed by women.
It was an imperfect success. In her Schumanns and Mahlers (husbands and
wives) and Mendelssohns (brother and sister), all salon-scale songs, Miss
Connell's chesty diva tones were not well found, and her higher register -
always in forte - was like chalk on slate. Only because, I should guess, she
was trying to reduce her big-house fortissimo to Wigmore dimensions; the
result throttled her stirring full-cry tone down to something fierce but
thin, and very hard on the ear. Brahms, Wolf and Strauss were somewhat more
comfortable, but bumpy (like her lively accompanist Eugene Asti).
From time to time some of the Connell strengths flickered through, on
reduced voltage - here a telling phrase seized with energy and imagination,
there a winning touch of wry Irish humour. But what was the point of barging
into territory so fastidiously cultivated by full-time Lieder singers? They
have accustomed our ears to long, lucidly detailed lines, partly on the
assumption (sometimes debatable) that every word of the poetry should be
heard, where this dramatic soprano goes instinctively for the high points
and elsewhere drops whole syllables into a murky void.
Singing mostly from the printed music, she struck jarring reefs among French
vowels as well as German ones. In early Faure, who sometimes let his purely
musical impulses spoil the prosody of his chosen verses, Miss Connell -
charming though she was - stressed the false accents again and again, where
a native specialist would smoothe them over.
That assiduous delver Graham Johnson was credited with help in choosing the
programme. No doubt it was he who dug up Honegger's Petit Cours de Morale,
five arch little songs on Giraudoux texts (sub-Eric Rohmer and distinctly
Anglophobe); but they needed sniffy native knowingness to bring them off,
and did not get it. In her closing group of parlour songs by Victorian
ladies, however, Miss Connell swung nicely into the right sentimental
address. I was delighted to learn at last where the deathless line 'Pale
hands I loved beside the Shalimar' comes from: it turns out to be the first
line of a Kashmiri Song by Amy Woodforde-Finden (1860-1919).

FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: Light enough to take to bed - Art books need not break
either your arm or your bank balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Christmas, we do things that we never - well hardly ever - do during the
rest of the year, such as giving each other lavish art-books. Here are my
recommendations of recent ones which I have found stimulating and readable,
on subjects ranging from felines in Ancient Egypt to the intimacy of Jasper
Johns and Robert Rauschenburg.
In the case of art-books, readability is in large part a function of size.
My own limit for comfortable reading in bed is two kilos, which is still
considerably too heavy for reading on a plane. Publishers should think
harder about the trade-off between glamour and portability. A book like
Jeffrey Ruda's pleasantly written monograph on Filippo Lippi (Phaidon;
Pounds 95.00, 560pp) is arm-breakingly beautiful at over three kilos. The
fault is not the writer's prolixity, but the flashy and wasteful design.
At the opposite extreme, modest yet good art-books can cost as little as a
tenner. Thames and Hudson's venerable World of Art paperback series costs
only Pounds 6.95 as does its wallet-sized New Horizons series, which has
serious texts and masses of remarkably good and often unusual images. Van
Gogh, Rembrandt, The Aztecs and others would make ideal stocking-fillers.
So, too, would the British Museum Press's attractive series on Medieval
Craftsmen and Eastern Art (Pounds 6.95 and Pounds 9.95).
Sharon Fermor's Piero di Cosimo; Fiction, Invention and 'Fantasia' (Reaktion
Books 226pp, Pounds 29) is lucid and absorbing, a book for anyone who wants
to understand better the nature of the Renaissance in Florence. Piero,
painter of the famous 'Forest Fire' in Oxford, was found dead at the foot of
a staircase in 1521. In all the books he is characterised as an odd-ball, an
interpretation which rests wholly on Vasari's biography.
The wild garden had yet to be invented in Renaissance Florence, yet here was
a man who never pruned or hoed, but just let everything grow wild. He lived
off hard-boiled eggs, cooking (but not eating) 50 at a time. Piero di
Cosimo, as vividly presented by Vasari, was as anti-social and bestiale as
Leonardo da Vinci was courtly and refined.
These days, art-historians are disinclined to take Vasari literally, and
Fermor shows that his life of Piero was written as a cautionary tale. Vasari
granted that the misanthrope had great gifts, particularly imagination, or
fantasia, in which respect he was like Leonardo who could also see pictures
in gobs of spit on a wall. But Piero's relative failure spelled a moral dear
to Vasari's heart; artists who wanted to get on had to be urbane and
sociable.
Fermor sheds light on the meaning of many of Piero's paintings, attractively
reproduced. The bare-breasted portrait said to be Simonetta Vespucci is, in
fact, a highly erotic Cleopatra. The National Gallery's much-discussed scene
is firmly identified as 'The Death of Procris' (below), painted according to
a contemporary play. Procris was accidentally slain as a result of her
sexual jealousy. Piero's version is dreamy rather than tragic, because in
the play Procris is restored to life. Fermor thinks that this edifying tale
was just the sort of thing a Florentine would have wanted in the nuptial
chamber.
Another enjoyable monograph is Judith Leyster; A Dutch Master and Her World,
by James Welu and Pieter Biesboer (Yale; 391pp, Pounds 45). This year marked
the centenary of the rediscovery of Leyster (1609-60), the Haarlem genre
painter who is the second most famous female Old Master after Artemisia
Gentileschi. Yet Leyster's success as an independent artist is in a sense
more remarkable because she was not the daughter of an artist. The book,
which is in fact an exhibition catalogue, presents a well-written and
stimulating picture of Leyster's place among artists of the Dutch Golden
Age.
John Gage's Colour and Culture; Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to
Abstraction (Thames and Hudson; 335pp; Pounds 38.00) is a remarkable
achievement. It would appeal inter alia to scientists, gardeners,
psychologists and designers. Gage explores the vast, limitlessly fascinating
subject of Western man's attempts to grasp the elusive nature of colour.
Beautifully illustrated and massively learned, this weighty book requires
concentration but the effort is amply rewarded.
I second my colleague Colin Amery's praise for Timothy Mowl's Elizabethan
and Jacobean Style (Phaidon; 240pp; Pounds 29.95), a fizzing polemic which
sees Inigo Jones as tantamount to a national disaster. For just the one
chapter on how Great Halls of houses like Hardwick were used as theatres,
this book would justify its cost. More temperate appreciation of English
style comes in Charles Saumarez Smith's Eighteenth-century Decoration
(Weidenfeld and Nicolson; 406pp; Pounds 50), a splendid guide to the look of
homes from cottages to castles.
Another book I will often be turning to over the years is Nicholas Penny's
The Materials of Sculpture (Yale; 318pp; Pounds 35.00). Looking at sculpture
and carved ornament, how well do we appreciate the challenges which the
materials posed their makers? Penny picks and chooses from the art of East
and West, helped with sumptuous illustrations. He writes with exemplary
clarity.
Lastly, two highly readable books on over-worked subjects, cats and love.
The world is crawling with cat-lovers whose horizons will surely be expanded
by Jaromir Malek's fascinating book, The Cat in Ancient Egypt (British
Museum Press; 144pp; Pounds 14.95). This is a lovely book, written so simply
that a child could follow it. As for the passion of Jasper and Robert, it
and other literary and artistic pairings such as Bell and Grant, Jackson and
Krasner, are chewed over in Significant Others; Creativity and Intimate
Partnerships edited by Whitney Chadwick (Thames and Hudson, 256pp; Pounds
14.95).

FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: Out of tune with its clients - The Arts Council has
got itself into a sorry mess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Arts Council deserves no sympathy for the mess it has got itself into
over the funding of the London orchestras. It was a ludicrous dereliction of
duty to ask an outsider, Sir Leonard Hoffmann, to decide which of the three
orchestras should continue to receive Council money. What on earth is the
music panel for?
So there is general satisfaction that Hoffmann has come up with a report
that is obviously poison to many at the Council. His decision (on the vote
of only two members of a five man committee) that the Philharmonia is
marginally more deserving than the LPO totally upsets the apple cart.
According to the Council's plan, the LPO was to get the vote, confirming its
position as house orchestra at the South Bank, and a counter to the LSO at
the Barbican. The Philharmonia and the RPO were to be left to their own,
free market, devices. And the Arts Council would save money.
That is the root of the problem. It is yet another example of the Arts
Council's unresolved battle as to whether its role is to fight for the arts,
or to give the government better value for its subsidy. There is a case to
be made for funding a super orchestra: such a case explodes if it is a
by-product of a scam to save money.
It is a carbon copy of the fiasco the Council got itself into during the
summer over its decision to cut funding to ten regional theatres. Once again
the theory was respectable. Faced with the probability of a grant cut the
Council took itself off to Woodstock to work out priorities, to back
winners. For some bizarre reason it decided that modern dance and the visual
arts (the two weakest sectors of its empire, with minimal popular or media
support) should get cash at the expense of popular local theatres. In the
face of an outcry, not least from its own drama panel, it changed its mind,
and lost immeasurable face.
From then on the Council has become an Aunt Sally, allowing the media to
question its existence - and the position of its managers. The chairman Lord
Palumbo goes in April, which looks fortuitous; his successor can be a new
broom, untainted by the past. But now secretary general Anthony Everitt is
vulnerable. His contract expires in the autumn and few would bet on a
renewal.
Yet the whole sorry saga is predictable and goes back to the appointment of
Palumbo five years ago. He was given secret orders by the government to slim
down the Council (saving money again), and to hand over the decisions on
funding arts companies to a network of regional arts boards. Once the
Council had abdicated most of its powers it had to find a role to justify
its existence. Hence the chase after initiatives, all of which, from the
bland and binned strategy for the arts document which emerged earlier this
year to the theatre and orchestral debacles, have ended in tears.
The final humiliation is that the government has reneged on its part of the
bargain. It has harried the Council to make even more cuts in its budget
than was reasonable, demanding an extra Pounds 600,000 in savings next year.
It then put the boot in on November 30 by cutting the Council's grant for
next year by Pounds 3.2m. This has proved especially humiliating because the
National Heritage Secretary, Peter Brooke, actually secured a reasonable
Pounds 21m increase in his total budget and could easily have given the
Council a stand-still grant. On Wednesday the Scottish Office did just that
for the Scottish Arts Council.
All we need now is stories of bureaucratic extravagance in the regional arts
boards after they get their heady new powers in April and the whole sorry
story will be complete. The arms length principle of arts funding will be
deemed to have failed and those in the Heritage Department who want to do
away with the Council altogether will be in position to strike. Think of how
much fun the civil servants, and ministers, will have in deciding just how
much subsidy to hand out to thenational companies, like Covent Garden and
the RSC, which will fall under their power.
That everything in the arts is now back on the agenda is suggested by the
delay in finding a successor for Lord Palumbo. Obviously anyone approached
will want to know what, if anything, the job entails. Peter Brooke now has
three choices. He can delay an appointment into the late spring and then
give someone the task of winding up the Council. He can choose one of the
great and the good - Sir Ernest Hall comes to mind - to go in there to smack
heads, ease out dead wood, and build up confidence, assisted by the fact
that the Council will soon have the task of distributing around Pounds 70m a
year of Lottery money around the arts. Or Brooke can merge the jobs of
unpaid chairman and salaried secretary general into one, putting in a proven
administrator, like John Tusa, as a powerful chief executive. This is what
happens at the National Endowment for the Arts in the US.
Through its indecisiveness the Council has brought its very existence into
doubt. What can it do now? On Wednesday it announces its grants for 1994-95
and will probably share the misery of reduced funding equally among the
nation's arts companies. But by then it will also have to respond to
Hoffmann. It will be terribly embarrassing if it rejects the Hoffmann
findings. But if it accepts them where does this leave the LPO, only two
years into a five year contract as the house orchestra of the South Bank, a
residency pushed through, with money and encouragement by the Council? The
LPO currently gets over Pounds 1.1m a year in subsidy: Hoffmann allocates it
Pounds 700,000, insufficient to allow it to fulfill its programme. With more
money somehow, the orchestras could be satisfied. But money is the one thing
in short supply at the Arts Council. Peter Brooke, a professed believer in
the arms length principle, has seen to that. Some arms are shorter than
others.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: In search of the next Tolstoy - Arkady Ostrovsky looks
at the five books on the shortlist for the second Booker Russian Novel Prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARKADY OSTROVSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the many literary jokes of Daniil Kharms, the famous Russian
absurdist, there was one concerned with the present state of Russian
literature. In it Pushkin sits in his study and thinks: 'I am a genius -
fair enough. Gogol is a genius too. But Tolstoy is a genius as well, you
know, and Dostoevsky is a genius. God, when will it all end?' And then it
all ends.
The Booker's establishment of a special Russian Novel Prize seems to refute
the Russian absurdist, suggesting that the great Russian novel maintains its
tradition of excellence. In establishing the prize, the Booker pursued two
aims: first, to help writers whose work could earn little money in Russia's
present financial circumstances; secondly, to draw the attention of British
publishers to contemporary Russian literature.
The author of this year's best Russian novel will receive Pounds 10,000.
From the nominated 38 novels there is a shortlist of five. These are Victor
Astafyev's The Cursed and The Dead; Semyon Lipkin's Notes of a Lodger;
Vladimir Makanin's A Baize-covered Table With a Carafe in the Middle;
Lyudmial Ulitskaya's Sonechka and Oleg Ermakov's Sign of the Beast.
Vladimir Makanin, 56, is well known to the Russian intelligentsia and
belongs to the generation of writers defined by Russian critics as the
'40-year-old's'. Makanin was 40 in 1977: the nickname describes not his age,
but rather the age of his character. The 1970s, a time of profound
stagnation in Soviet society, produced a particular Soviet type: average,
faceless, a grey mass, characterless like the thousands of identical flats
intended for 'identical' Soviet people.
The English reader used to struggling with unpronounceable Russian names may
relax with Makanin. His characters do not have personal names. The
impersonal 'he' substitutes for the name of the central character. 'He' has
nightmares of a similarly impersonal baize-covered table, a powerful symbol
of the communist court. Makanin dissects the Soviet system and its mentality
like a skilled anatomist. He describes brilliantly the mechanisms of
suppression and depicts the types of communist prosecutors who take part in
this nightmare-trial.
The final scene, in which his character challenges the monstrous table and
dies from its touch, is reminiscent of the famous Pushkin poem The Bronze
Horseman where the protagonist challenges the menacing statue of Peter the
Great. Written in Kafkaesque style, Makanin's novel becomes a startling
portrait of Homo Sovieticus.
Although almost the same age as Makanin, Lyudmila Ulitskaya, 55, writes in
an entirely different style. Her short novel Sonechka describes the life of
a fragile, all-forgiving woman, Sonya, who lives with her husband and
daughter in a communal flat in post-war Moscow. The quiet and happy life of
her family is interrupted by the appearance of a young orphan-prostitute,
whom her daughter brings home from school. And even though Sonya's husband,
a painter, has an affair with this new 'member' of the family, tolerant
Sonya forgives everybody and loves everyone all the same. Saccharine and
sentimental, filled with nostalgia, the novel carries a simplistic,
unoriginal message: that a person can preserve himself no matter what is
happening in the outside world.
When in the 1970s Semyon Lipkin, 82, finished his Notes of a Lodger, he must
have had little hope of ever seeing it published in Russia. Lipkin was
mostly known as a poet and translator. In the late 1970s he joined the
famous literary almanac Metropolis, which was soon shut down by the
communist party. After that, he was no longer published in the Soviet Union.
Born into a Jewish family in Odessa in 1911, Lipkin had experienced most of
the events described in his book: civil war, Czarist pogroms, Bolshevik
pogroms, the Jewish ghetto, the second world war. The genre is best
described by its title: 'Notes'. The novel is rather unstructured, but
contains a series of vivid scenes of life in Odessa, where Jews, Russians
and Ukrainians all live together. There is a bewildering array of
characters.
The whole period of Russian history from 1917 to the 1950s is shown through
the eyes of scientist Michail Lorenz, who at times has a striking affinity
with Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago. Had the novel been published in the 1970s,
when it was originally written, it would have had an explosive effect,
revealing some of the most secret sides of Soviet history. But it has missed
its ideal date of publication; it is now like an old coat which one loves,
but would no longer wear.
'O, Russian people, how open and forgiving your heart is] You can touch it
with your hands under a coat, feel its anxious beating with your palm, feel
its trustful warmth.'
This hymn to an open yet mysterious Russian soul, with its touching
admiration of the 'saintly' Russians runs through the whole of Victor
Astafyev's The Cursed and the Dead. To be fair, there are a few characters
in the book who are not strong Siberian boys, but Armenians and Kazakhs. Yet
they are there not for their own sakes; they appear simply to show the
generosity of Russian people. In a multinational country where 'Russian',
'Armenian', 'Jew' indicate not nationality or citizenship, but an ethnic
affiliation, this sentence carries unpleasant nationalistic connotation.
Astafyev, 69, represents the so-called 'country prose', a genre which
appeared in the post-thaw period and which sympathetically describes Russian
rural life.
The Cursed and the Dead is set during the second world war on the Russian
home front where young Siberian soldiers die not under the German fire, but
in the Gulag's regime. A good craftsmen, Astafyev knows how to keep the
reader gripped. A shocking description of the cruel, unfair execution of two
naive Siberian twins, gives way to a utopian and idealised picture of
natural village life. The style is a mixture of a low-key dialogues and
biblical descriptions.
It is worth noting that Astafyev's main belief - that the salvation of
Russia depends on the simple religious Russian people - coincides with the
right-wing ideology of the Russian nationalist party.
The life span of Oleg Ermakov, 28, the youngest writer in the Booker
shortlist has already included a few years of war. Sign of the Beast, his
first full-length novel, deals with one of the most tragic periods of recent
Soviet history - Afghanistan.
Bestial rules of the disintegrating Soviet army, the cruel mistreatment and
humiliation of young recruits, the ethnic conflicts, although not news to
most of today's readers, are still shocking to hear. But do these disturbing
images make Sign of the Beast a good novel, or simply help it to sell? This
is an excellent documentary story but not much of a novel. Ermakov's
literary devices and metaphysical images of East and West, Taoist and Viking
are rather primitive and disrupt the telling of the story.
Although I would not call any of the five novels outstanding, Makanin's
Baized-covered Table remains the most intelligent and interesting of a
bunch. The best novel will be announced at a presentation dinner in Moscow
on December 14.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: Alien settings - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long evenings have given useful space for imaginative drama, and this
week has by chance produced pieces with an assortment of alien settings. It
also happens that on Radio 3 there was a series of four talks by Robert
Wistrich, Professor of Jewish Studies at University College, London, on The
Revival of Nationalism. Only one of the plays I heard had any touch of
nationalism in it (and that not serious); but it was good to be reminded of
foreign cultures.
The Sunday play on Radio 3 continued its Polish season with Mariage Blanc by
Tadeusz Rosewicz, translated by Adam Czerniawski. Its 16-year-old heroine,
Bianca, is unhappy about the marriage to Benjamin arranged for her, and a
lot of the play consists of her talk with her friend Pauline. We learn that
she wanted to be a boy, that her mother and father never loved each other,
that she thinks her grandfather 'unclean'. Much varied sex goes on among
family and servants, including Bianca's 'dream' affair with Saint Nicholas,
one of several sex-oriented dreams. Pauline explains the facts of life, and
Bianca swears she will have a mariage blanc. To make sure of it, she cuts
her hair like a boy's before the first night, and as she enters the marital
bedroom she asks Benjamin to consider her as his brother.
There are moments of deep understanding between the girls, and the play was
originally condemned as pornographic. There is indeed much straightforward
talk, dodgy at Sunday's 7.30 to 9.00 timing. I was not much impressed by the
playing under Kate Rowland's direction.
More blancs in Radio 4's Monday Play Lorraine Hansberry's posthumous Les
Blancs. Hansberry came from prosperous black folks in Chicago and was
seriously concerned with the advancement of coloured people. This play,
however, is about Central Africa under the threat of revolt, a different
matter altogether, and she seems only to have read about such things in
books. Her African village is not convincing, especially as she has added to
the indigenous company the staff of a medical mission, a liberal American
reporter, a military officer who treats the Africans as peasants, and a
quasi-Western member of the central family, Tshebe (Leo Wringer), who likes
to be called 'Mr Matoseh'. The story concerns his problem - to join a revolt
in which his relations are involved, or to go back to his textile business.
There is some sinister gunfire, but few casualties. Heather Goodman was the
director.
We go still further afield on the World Service, with its version of Dr
Strangelove in an adaptation by Kerry Shale. It comes in two parts, the
first last Sunday, the next tomorrow. Shale also plays some of the
characters, eight of them - five of the crew of the American B52 that
precipitates the end of the world by bombing Russia; the Presidents of the
USA and Russia; the RAF officer attached to the USAF; and Dr Strangelove
himself, a quite small part so much distorted vocally that it is hard to
understand. The mutual antagonism of the nations is, one hopes, as much a
matter of history as their post-nuclear weaponry; at any rate the total
destruction of life involved in Russia's 'Doomsday Machine' is no longer as
threatening as novelist Peter George left it. It may be that to treat
national enmity as a source of laughter is the best idea.

THE CHIMERA by Sebastiano Vassalli Harvill Pounds 15.99, 315 pages
A chimera, says the dictionary, with acknowledgment to Greek mythology, is
'a fantastic or grotesque product of the imagination; a bogey'. Sebastiano
Vassalli has chosen this title for his novel about a young peasant girl of
early 17th-century Italy whose fate was to be selected by the
Counter-Reformation church as a witch and burnt at the stake. The Chimera
has won the Strega Prize (strega happens to mean 'witch') and now appears in
a fluent English translation by Patrick Creagh.
The historical novel, when ambitiously intended, is often framed in some
sort of modern-day device. Vassalli takes his perspective from the
Milan-Turin autostrada, where his village of Zardino on the misty plain near
Novara is 'slightly to the left and a little beyond the second flyover'
against the panorama of the Monte Rosa. He claims to have stumbled on the
story of Antonia, an episode that would otherwise have been lost for ever:
'Looking out over this landscape, the nothingness of it, it came to me that
in the present there is no story worth telling. The present is hubbub . . .
To find the key to the present, and to understand it, we have to withdraw
from the hubbub, to descend to . . . the depths of nothingness . . . to the
ghost-village of Zardino, to the story of Antonia . . .'
Having got this pretentious stuff off his chest in, thankfully, just a
couple of pages, Vassalli gives us a fascinating tale, a minutely-imagined
novel about the underside of history, by which I mean the parts that
historians never seem to reach.
Antonia is a foundling, adopted by kindly peasant farmers, whose adolescent
beauty in this pestilential landscape is so striking that it persuades both
the 'Village Gossips' and the fanatical post-Reformation clergy that she
must be the work of the Devil. The point is that 'witches' in most cases
were not hags or old women, on the contrary. Antonia, who is a simple and
innocent girl, notorious only for being used as model for the Madonna by the
painter Bertolino, is to be destroyed by the rumour-mongering, and in
consequence the hatred, of a primitive society.
The Counter-Reformation, and therefore the Inquisition, is in full flood. We
are shown the distinguished local bishop, a passionate follower of Borromeo,
whose radical presence in Novara provokes the Inquisitors to hurry through
the trial; Don Michele, the fake though not unbenevolent priest of the bad
old days; the 'new' priest, the rigorous and extortionate Don Teresio; the
nobleman-poet Caroelli; the bandit Il Caccetta; a kindly executioner; the
risaroli itinerant labourers of the paddy-fields; and, not least
interesting, Antonia's lover, the Stroller, one of those mysterious groups
of men 'who always remained on the shadowy side of history' (John Buchan has
a similar and convincing awareness of this shadow world in his best
historical novels such as Midwinter and The Blanket of the Dark).
No suspense is intended in this story of the five-month process which leads,
ineluctably, to Antonia's hideous torture and death at the age of 20. Her
ordeal is portrayed as 'part of an unconscious ritual by which for centuries
the Catholic Church (and the Protestant churches as well, come to that)
vented its sexual tribulation and anguish on those poor women - its terror
of womankind as 'Devil' and its need for a Devil'. The Inquisitor argues
that 'heresy can be suppressed, but it may also be forestalled'. Against
which the Antonias of that time - or any other - have no chance.
Vassalli is a good enough novelist not to labour his moral. The bishop comes
to understand that the true spirit of the Counter-Reformation had ground to
a halt within two decades and would remain 'a monument to worldly things and
worldly politics'. Antonia's execution is watched by crowds 'neither
bloodthirsty nor wicked . . . the same decent, hard-working people who in
our 20th-century cram the stadiums, watch the television, go to vote at
election time; and if need arises to wreak summary justice on anyone they do
not burn him but they none the less wreak it . . .'
These quotations are misleading. The quality, and the resonance, of this
remarkable book lie in its evocation of a distant society which would be
utterly lost to us were it not for the imagination of a gifted novelist.

KEYNES IN THE 1990s: A RETURN TO ECONOMIC SANITY by Michael Stewart Penguin
Pounds 5.99
It is hard to deny that 14 years of Conservative economic stewardship have
produced disappointing results. The severity of the recession of the early
1980s can perhaps be explained by the inexperience of an incoming government
and the numerous problems inherited from Labour. But Conservatives have few
excuses for the dismal record of recent years: record trade deficits and
double-digit inflation followed by deep recession, mass unemployment, an
exploding public sector deficit and a humiliating exit from the Exchange
Rate Mechanism.
There are two ways of reacting to this record. Michael Stewart's conclusion
is that the economic failures were inevitable. Twist and turn as they might,
Conservative governments were doomed to fail because their approach was
based on fundamental misconceptions about the way modern economies function.
The cardinal error was to revert to an atavistic 19th century faith in the
efficiency of market forces.
This was the sheerest folly, argues Stewart, because in the 1930s John
Maynard Keynes had shown beyond reasonable doubt that market economies are
not self-stabilising. Governments must actively manage economic demand and
the most reliable tool is fiscal policy. It is vain, moreover, to expect
deregulation and privatisation to do much for the economy's supply-side. If
productivity is to be improved, Britain must increase public investment
substantially and expand the provision of government-funded vocational
training.
Stewart's timing is certainly excellent. Public disenchantment with
market-oriented policies is growing. The Financial Times recently ran an
editorial entitled 'Monetarism in retreat.' Many readers will find Stewart's
arguments persuasive. Having read his rehash of Keynes's critique of
classical economics, many will feel they at last understand what went wrong
in the 1980s.
But there is a second interpretation of recent events that Stewart does not
consider: this is that the economic philosophy behind Conservative policies
was broadly correct but that the implementation of the strategy left much to
be desired.
The most serious policy failure in the 1980s was macroeconomic: ministers
allowed demand badly to outstrip supply in the late 1980s, leading to a
resurgence of inflation and an unnecessarily deep recession. But this error
owed much to policy disagreements within the government. Had either Lawson
or Thatcher been able to follow their convictions the outcome would have
been better. If Lawson had been able to put sterling into the ERM in 1985,
Britain would have had an inflation anchor in place before encountering the
storms of the late 1980s. But, ifAlan Walters had been Chancellor, domestic
monetary policy would have been tightened sooner, achieving a similar result
by different means.
Stewart's curious belief that greater fiscal activism would have helped
seems based on his view that Keynesian economics accounted for the 'golden
era' of rapid growth between the 1940s and early 1970s. But this is a
simplistic conclusion. In the first place, Britain did poorly during these
years relative to countries such as Germany and Japan, where Keynesian
doctrines were treated with greater scepticism. And many factors lay behind
the global expansion, including extensive rebuilding after the second world
war, the growth of world trade after autarchy in the 1930s and a secular
rise in public spending as welfare states were extended. All this provided a
tremendous boost, but it could not have persisted indefinitely, and the
price in terms of steadily rising inflation was evident by the early 1970s.
Would Keynesians have run fiscal policy sensibly in the past decade? It
seems unlikely: with hindsight fiscal policy was too lax in the late 1980s
but few, if any, Keynesians called for public spending cuts or sharp
increases in taxation. On the other hand Keynesians were clamouring for a
fiscal boost in the early 1980s, when it was not needed. Given the
ever-present pressure for higher public spending, such a boost might have
led to a decade of Italian-scale deficits and even greater structural fiscal
problems.
Stewart's nostalgia for the pre-Thatcher years is equally misplaced. Does he
really think Britain would perform better today with a 1970s policy
framework? That included a top personal tax rate of 98 per cent;
bureaucratic controls on prices, wages, dividends and foreign exchange
transactions; nationalisation of broad swathes of industry; and an array of
special legal privileges for trade unions.
The move toward greater reliance on market forces was a global phenomenon.
In the past decade most industrial countries have pursued policies broadly
similar to Britain's. The drive to reduce the growth of public spending was
global as was the focus on improving incentives by cutting tax rates and
deregulating industries. If Labour had retained power, it too would have
pursued these policies; indeed much of Thatcherism was merely an
embellishment of policies initiated by Denis Healey in the late 1970s.
Stewart's philosophical arguments are sadly misguided. Keynes's theories
were undoubtedly ingenious. But it is by no means clear that they amounted
to a convincing refutation of classical economics. Fiscal policy can be
important on occasion, but over the long haul individuals' propensity to
work and save, and their willingness to embrace necessary economic change,
are far more important determinants of growth.
Few recent books have poked fun more effectively at Conservative chancellors
but, coming from an economics don at London University, it is irresponsibly
one-sided.

LOST PROPHETS by Alfred L. Malabre Jr Harvard Business School Press
When The Way the World Works by Jude Wanniski was published in 1978, Mr
Barton Biggs, the Morgan Stanley guru, gave it as his considered opinion
that it was the most important economic work since Karl Marx. (Biggs is
currently in the news for telling Morgan Stanley's clients to get out of
China/Hong Kong only six weeks after telling them to bundle in. Perhaps if
his earlier judgment had been more widely known, his recent advice would
have been received more dispassionately.)
Jude Wanniski, together with Art Laffer and Paul Craig Roberts, led the
Supply Side movement in the US in the late 1970s and early 1980s and
captured bigger fish than Biggs. Their talisman was the so-called 'Laffer
Curve', a simple device which could be, and was, drawn on a thousand paper
napkins in restaurants all over the country. Their message was simple and
seductive: the way to cut the public deficit was to reduce taxes. Martin
Feldstein, sometime Chairman of the US Council of Economic Advisers, pointed
out at the time, this was 'something a Congressman could digest in about 30
seconds and then talk about for months'. The Wall St Journal was very
enthusiastic and played its part in convincing President Reagan - no very
difficult task, to be sure.
Of course it ended in tears as such movements do, with some saying they had
been sceptical all along, some forgetting all about it and some saying it
had never really been tried. But it provides the most dramatic and enjoyable
of the case studies presented in Alfred L. Malabre's Lost Prophets, a book
whose thesis is that since the war the economics profession has
systematically misled the politicians and the general public by promoting a
series of over-optimistic over-simplified economic nostrums.
Before the supply siders (fortunately never as powerful on this side of the
Atlantic as on the other) were the monetarists - who inflicted, if anything,
more damage here than in the US. Roughly contemporary with both were the
Rational Expectations men who believed that everybody expected what they
expected (which is why they styled the expectations rational): as a result
they claimed that all economic action by government would be doomed to
failure.
Before all these people there were the naive Keynesians, loudly preaching
that the business cycle was dead or that it was in governments' power to
kill it. Before that again, according to Malabre, was the delusive fantasy
of the Bretton Woods system.
But just a minute. The Bretton Woods system of fixed but adjustable exchange
rates lasted for some 25 years and - to put it as neutrally as possible -
coincided with the greatest period of non-inflationary high employment
growth that the world has seen this century. Of course it reached its
sell-by date. Malabre could legitimately have attacked those who, after the
system had broken down in the early 1970s, tried to put Humpty Dumpty
together again. But to mock a regime which was so successful at the time on
the basis that nowadays there is no alternative for the dollar but to float
is to miss a lot of points.
The trouble with this book is that Malabre does not carry the critical guns
with which to accomplish the demolition jobs he is attempting - except when
the targets are as big as a barn door - which admittedly a lot of them are.
We have certainly been beset by nostrums - and many of them, and especially
the lurches from one to another, have done us a lot of harm. So, on the
principle that my enemy's enemy is my friend, much in this book is to be
welcomed.
But much of it, sadly, is pretty mushy. A large cast of little known
economists is cited in evidence against a lot of other scarcely better known
ones, in conversations recalled from long-forgotten conferences held over
the decades in outstanding American beauty spots. Malabre's own view emerges
as one of extreme pragmatism: in particular, that the business cycle is
rather like the weather - nothing can be done about it. This may be true,
but the trouble is that he then cannot resist giving us his own methods of
forecasting, on the basis of interviews with businessmen. He creates a whole
theory of the business cycle from what he says he used to learn at the
annual conferences of consumer goods salesmen. A glance at his CV, however,
shows that he only attended three of them. A smallish sample.

of the woman who rescued Oscar

WONDERFUL SPHINX: THE BIOGRAPHY OF ADA LEVERSON by Julie Speedie Virago
Pounds 17.99, 219 pages
When Oscar Wilde was released on bail before his trial for homosexual
offences in 1895, one woman, at least was waiting for him outside the
courtroom, ready to risk her reputation in society on his behalf.
Wilde then needed help of the most practical kind, because the vindictive
8th Marquess of Queensberry made a point of ensuring that no hotel would
take him in. The lady who rescued him was Ada Leverson, a writer whom Wilde
had nicknamed his 'wonderful Sphinx' on account of her enigmatic bon mots.
From an intellectual liberal Jewish background, Ada Esther Beddington (as
she was) had married Ernest Leverson, a prosperous businessman. When Wilde
faced criminal proceedings at the Old Bailey in 1895, the Leversons were
living in a large London house in Courtfield Gardens with their small
daughter Violet.
After Mrs Leverson took the courageous decision that he should stay with
her, she called her servants together and said that if anyone wished to
leave during Wilde's residence in the house they were welcome to do so. No
one did.
The nursery floor was then made over to Wilde as a refuge. She asked Oscar
if he wished the toys, dolls, rocking-horse, to be removed. He said 'No',
and then held lengthy conferences with his lawyer surrounded by these
reminders of childhood. Ada encouraged him to jump bail, foreseeing what the
law's outcome would be. But Wilde refused to do this, just as he had refused
to avoid the trial altogether by fleeing across the Channel.
When, after serving his two year sentence, he was released, early in the
morning to avoid the press, Ada was among the little group of former friends
who had risen at dawn to greet him. She later described the scene:
'He came in with the dignity of a king returning from exile. He came in
talking, laughing, smoking a cigarette, with waved hair and a flower in his
button-hole, and he looked markedly better, slighter and younger than he had
two years previously. His first words were, 'Sphinx, how marvellous of you
to know exactly the right hat to wear at seven o'clock in the morning to
meet a friend who has been away] You can't have got up, you must have sat
up.''
The group was a mutual admiration society whose other members included
Robert Ross, More Adey, Reginald Turner, the Oscar loyalists who were to
quarrel bitterly among themselves and with 'Bosie' Douglas, the son of the
Marquess, after Wilde's death. Other friends of Ada's included Robert
Hichens, author of the satirical novel The Green Carnation, Aubrey
Beardsley, Ronald Firbank, Max Beerbohm, Somerset Maugham. It was a society
in which the great, the only, crime was failure to sparkle. Treachery was
tolerated, but not dullness.
As such there was a great deal of frivolity that seems very unfunny today
and a lot of plain silliness. It was the era of the Practical Joke, of
hoaxes and disguises; they thought there was great humour in the spectacle
of a man dressed up as a woman. The actor Brandon Thomas, who canonised this
joke in his play Charley's Aunt, married Marguerite Leverson and became
Ada's cousin by marriage and another friend.
Caricature and parody, those minor arts perfected by Beerbohm, were widely
practised in the 1890s. It was, as this biography of Ada shows, primarily as
a parodist in the pages of Punch that Ada first made her mark. She parodied
Oscar there to his delight. Before she tried her hand at fiction she was
earning a modest income as a literary journalist.
Serious newspapers lightened their pages with pieces of gossip and sketches
of life in Society. We think of (Sir) Anthony Hope (Hawkins) only as the
author of The Prisoner of Zenda, but in his day he was equally well known
for 'The Dolly Dialogues' in the Westminster Gazette. They were instalments
of a long-running flirtatious exchange between a man who is a bachelor and
the nubile Dolly Foster who at the end of it all marries a peer.
Ada wondered if it were possible to write whole novels in this kind of
nuance dialogue. Across the Channel the Comtesse de Martel de Janville had
shown, under the pseudonym of 'Gyp', that it could certainly be done with
ease in French. Her novels of Parisian society, written exclusively in
dialogue, were like stage-plays in book-form, and were required reading
among the English aristocracy of Edwardian England. You can still find
complete sets of them in the libraries of some of the grander country
houses.
Not only Ada but Ronald Firbank and Henry James responded to the challenge
of writing dialogue-only novels. James following 'the admirable Gyp' (as he
called her) turned out a masterpiece of the genre, The Awkward Age. That was
in 1899; it was in the first decade of the 20th century that Ada essayed
this form and published six dialogue novels, from 1907 with The Twelfth Hour
to 1916 with Love at Second Sight.
Intimate conversation between men and women full of sexual innuendo is her
game. She included thinly disguised pen-portraits of her friends, but at
their core the books represent urgent dispatches from the marital
battle-front and news of the walking wounded. Her own experience of marriage
had not been happy. Ernest had betrayed her many times with other women and
by now had left her. He did, though, make provision for her in his will.
By general consent Love at Second Sight is her finest novel. It has been
reissued by Virago with the two earlier ones, Love's Shadow and Tenterhooks
containing the same central characters. All three are published in one
volume as The Little Ottleys with an introduction by Nicola Beauman.
Ada the novelist is not to everyone's taste but if you once fall for her
understated conversational manner you become completely hooked. Colin
MacInnes, one of her most zealous admirers, led the current revival. There
is an earlier family biography by her daughter Violet Wyndham, a memoir by
her grandson Francis Wyndham, and section on her in Osbert Sitwell's Noble
Essences.
After the war it was the Sitwells who replaced the Wilde circle as the
centre of her social life. Julie Speedie's book is subtitled 'the biography
of Ada Leverson'; it might have been more accurate to have described it as
'a biography' because though it is very thoroughly researched and
informative, it seems possible there could be another, more at ease with its
heroine and less slow-footed.

HOLDER OF THE WORLD by Bharati Mukherjee Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 286
pages
The idea on which this novel is constructed is sensationally good. An
American woman, a 20th century operator in bankable antiquities, has
developed a personal interest in a series of Mughal miniatures. These
depicting the Salem-bibi, a woman from New England who travelled with a
husband as far as the Coromandel coast and ended dramatically in the Court
of a Hindu raja subsequently slaughtered by Aurangzeb. The Salem-bibi, whose
original name was Hannah Easton, is associated with a diamond, now lost,
called the Emperor's Tear. The modern American (Beigh) has a would-be client
for it, every bit as piratical as the early East India Company adventurers.
This in itself would be enough for a fine tale of search, identity and the
parallels between different lives in different eras, but Bharati Mukherjee
(ex-Calcutta, now living in California) goes far beyond such traditional
fare. Beigh lives with Venn, a scientist of Indian origin who is into
computers, data bases and virtual reality. Venn's Project (X-2989) is to
recreate an entire day from the recent past - 'finally a use for sensory and
informational overload . . . In five years, they'll be able to interpose me,
or you, over the grid for upwards of ten seconds.' So, a species of
time-travel. But we never hear much more about Venn because his obsession is
to be a metaphor for Beigh's own recreation of Hannah Easton's life from
disparate records in London, Massachusetts and India - the imaginative
projection of any passionate researcher. Only at the end does metaphor elide
with reality in a scene in a computer lab which should be the climax, but
which instead descends into the bathos of a supernatural melodrama.
There is much in this book to admire and savour. The evocation of both the
New England world and that of late 17th century Madras, each with its
different complement of exotic, feared Indians, is memorable. We feel the
awful tension between the world of Salem, where sin is constantly to be
sniffed out, and the real horrors that lie just beyond the plantations in
the form of raiding, scalping tribes. We feel the appeal, to a girl raised
in such an environment, of the buccaneering English imposter who carries her
off; the stages by which she reaches the long, surf-tossed beach of Madras
are entirely convincing - 'I watch my convoy of East Zndlamen voyage across
(Venn's) computer screen, freed or space and time . . . The maiden ladies
from Lancashire, caulkers and coopers, soldiers and sail-makers, gunners,
cabin boys, two-headed freak dogs, horses, goats, hogs . . . plum puddings,
vats of pea soup, mutton . . . lemons, rum, beer, dysentery, scurvy,
compressed into a one-second long video model.' Nowhere does the author
invoke Joyce, but her intentions are basically the same brave ones as the
creator of Ulysses.
Why then does this novel, for all its intelligence and vision, not really
take off? Mukherjee seems overawed by the form she herself has imposed on
the raw material available. She is a writer who has always strung her novels
and stories between different cultures: the idea that an individual, by
changing countries, may move through separate incarnations, runs through her
work like a fable for Hindu belief. But such juxtapositions should speak for
themselves, and in The Holder of the World they are not allowed to; the
author is constantly at one's elbow.
Having given Hannah a mother who elopes with an Indian brave, she prompts
'Her embroidery gave away the conflict . . . She knew she must deny all
she'd seen on the night of her mother's disappearance' - and continues to
prompt throughout the novel.
Hannah's fate is so heavily flagged that all element of gradual revelation,
that basis of story telling, is removed. This might not matter if we were
more involved at a human level, but we are not. With a stylish assumption of
scholarship, the author confines herself to what she could plausibly have
discovered about the Salem-bibi from documents, but this results in a
picture which, in spite of all the busy interpretation, remains
one-dimensional, nerveless. Finally we cannot really care what happens to
Hannah; she seems, in any case, well-equipped for the brutal circles in
which she moves. Since the novel-form has to be continually re-invented in
order to remain alive, I wish this spectacular example well. But, to quote
the author herself, 'K-2989 is one of the discoveries more exciting in
principle than in application.' What, having got this false excitement out
of her system, will she write next?

FT  11 DEC 93 / All the power to the president: The Russian people vote
tomorrow on a draft constitution. John Lloyd looks at the implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A draft constitution goes before the Russian people tomorrow. It is a
document which might not shake the world, but it will form a vital part of
its stability because of Russia's importance and fragility.
Its adoption by the people and its acceptance by the Russian political class
would sustain and enlarge the still fragile area of democratic practice.
But its rejection, either because a majority of those voting are against it
or because the required 50 per cent of the electorate do not turn out, could
usher in a period in which institutions have no base and a division of
powers cannot develop because all formal political power remains monopolised
by the president.
'Better vote for this imperfect document than have none,' said Yegor Gaidar,
leader of Choice of Russia, the leading liberal group, mustering a lukewarm
endorsement for his president's draft. 'We'd again find ourselves in the
situation of legal chaos . . . where everything depends on whom the defence
ministry supports, on who has a pistol in their hands, on who, at the vital
hour, can best organise their forces in Moscow.'
Such a period could see the unravelling of a Russian power structure which,
since the closure and suppression of the former Russian parliament in
September and October, has been sustained by a presidency which is the
source of all power but whose shaky legitimacy has depended on a promise to
create a legislative chamber and a 'law governed state' underpinned by a
constitution in which the citizen can find rights and the politicians a
role.
But there is a countervailing view, which has been powerfully put in the
course of this campaign - although those who put it differ on whether or not
their objections to the constitution are greater in importance than the
danger of chaos.
The document itself is one which would provide presidential powers greater
than any other major democratic country, save perhaps France. The
president's powers would lie in his ability to appoint the prime minister
and approve the prime minister's choice of government - and to dissolve
parliament if it failed to agree.
The president would appoint judges, top military and the chairman of the
Central Bank - although most of these need parliamentary approval. And the
powers would lie in his ability to call referenda, and, perhaps most
threatening of all, in the clauses which gives the president the right to
issue decrees which need no oversight or approval by any other level of
power - so long as they can be shown to be in accord with the constitution.
A less obvious danger lies, paradoxically, in the breadth and generosity of
the articles on human and civil rights, on the entitlements each citizen
would have, including the right to a job, to medical care, to support, even
to clean air. The sheer scale of the promises reduce the document to a
formality because they cannot be observed.
Perhaps the most popular criticism is that voiced by Stanislav Shatalin, the
veteran radical economist: that the final draft, drawn up by Yeltsin's tight
circle of advisers and amended - it was said - up to the last minute by the
President himself, was not approved by a constituent assembly, or by the
regional and republican leaders who had earlier participated in the
constitutional discussions. Because of this, the argument runs, the
constitution is not a framework for a great country's future democracy, but
one for a particular president's immediate needs.
But it is in this aspect that the draft constitution is most like that of
other major democratic states.
This point is strongly made by Professor Vladimir Tumanov, one of Russia's
top judicial experts and one who took a part in the final drafting: 'I don't
agree with those who say that this is a 'transitional' document.
'All contemporary European constitutions were adopted, in one way or
another, in a 'transitional period' but they're still working and after they
were adopted they assisted stability.'
An example: the Italian constitution, first drafted in 1946 immediately
after the war and finally coming into force from January 1, 1948, has as its
first words: 'Italy is a democratic republic founded on labour.' The wording
reflects the power and the prestige of the two left-wing (anti-Fascist)
parties at the time: the Italian Communist Party and the Italian Socialist
Party. Yet, for all the stamp of the times, Italy for much of the post war
period, has been ruled by a right of centre party.
It is to the US which most Russians look when they seek to compare
themselves: and in comparing constitutions they see at first a presidential
constitution, and one enacted in times of conflict (with the British).
But US specialists who have studied the Russian draft say the parallel
doesn't hold: the US constitution was one in which the participating states
reluctantly ceded powers to a weak centre. And the constitution is largely
non-specific in the rights it grants, creating only a framework of
permissiveness within which specific prohibitions are left to be defined by
case law.
A central point, often obscured in the smoke of the Russian battle, is that
the working of a constitution is less important - within certain boundaries
 -than the attitude of the authorities towards it.
Russia's politicians and its citizens are new to the democratic arena: they
have experience only of decorative constitutions. They have witnessed a
parliament destroyed, and the old Soviet era constitution torn up by a
president who now asks for support for a new state law.
Will these citizens accept it tomorrow? And can these politicians make it
work?

FT  11 DEC 93 / Outdoors: Are those my skis? - Arnie Wilson makes a pair of
his own, and is very reluctant to use them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE checklist could hardly have been longer if I had been about to undertake
micro-surgery: undergloves; gloves; apron; industrial glasses; protective
shoes; gallons of purple resin to slop and slosh all over the bench; all
kinds of bits of pre-shaped fibreglass; triaxial-braided torsion box; carbon
steel racing edges; Grateful Dead top-skins.
On second thoughts, I felt more like a kid in a playgroup than a surgeon. Up
to my armpits in purple grunge, I had serious doubts about whether the
soggy, clammy, messy, viscous, sodden objects I was toying with would ever
turn into anything, let alone brand new skis.
But then, perhaps they didn't: perhaps the sleek, elegant Dark Star K2 TRC
skis with Limited Edition Grateful Dead 'Lunatic Fringe' tops and my name
lasered into them in red were substituted in the final stage of the
manufacturing process. Perhaps the ones that I 'made' in Seattle were thrown
laughingly on the scrap-heap.
There was certainly plenty of time for a switch to be made between my
putting the finishing touches to the skis and their arrival 24 hours later -
after we had paced up and down the K2 ski factory on Vashon Island like
fathers-to-be awaiting the arrival of new-born babies. Another possibility
was that Tom, who had guided me patiently through the whole process - 'wet
it out - then get a long, skinny bead and give it a uni-directional blast
with your paddle' - could easily have substituted some he had 'prepared
earlier'.
The invitation to make my own skis was irresistible, especially to someone
technologically illiterate such as myself.
K2, which has dynamic, Himalayan-sounding connotations, actually refers to
the Kirschner brothers (Bill and Don) who used to make splints and animal
cages on Vashon Island, a short ferry ride across the spectacular waters of
Puget Sound in Washington State.
Then one day in 1961, using a pair of borrowed skis as a pattern, Bill
Kirschner made himself a pair of fibreglass skis. By 1964 Kirschner
Manufacturing produced their first commercial batch of skis: 250 pairs. By
the following year, the figure was up to 1,600, and by 1966 K2 was selling
21,000 pairs of skis and the company had 83 employees. Today K2 is America's
top-selling ski, selling 500,000 pairs annually worldwide - about 10 per
cent of the world market.
Skis you make yourself are rather different from rentals, and having made my
own, I did not really want to ski on them. I became paranoid about the
faintest hair-line scratch. Every run became nail-bitingly tense. At the
slightest impact I imagined all those funny, sloshy bits of resin-soaked
fibreglass spilling out like entrails from a punctured corpse.
At least in America, in fresh snow, they had a chance, the poor wretches.
Crystal Mountain, 76 miles from Seattle, was a pleasant surprise, although
we did arrive in unusually good snow conditions. With almost 30 trails,
acres of back-country skiing, and a vertical drop of more than 3,000 feet,
the cost of a lift pass - Dollars 16 during the week, Dollars 28 at weekends
 -came as a revelation after most prices in Colorado, Utah and California.
Alpental, only 46 miles from Seattle and one of four interconnected resorts
in Snoqualmie Pass, was also quite a find simply because of its challenging
Internationale run and its exceptional back-country skiing. It is very rare
to find great tree skiing on long, steep slopes in such a small resort.
My new skis had a field day blasting their way down Draft Dodger Ridge,
Great Scott Bowl and Trash Can. Alpental, and its neighbours - Snoqualmie,
Ski Acres and Hyak - have 33 lifts between them and 16 runs are floodlit
every night. However the owner, Dave Moffett, seems to have somewhat
optimistic statistics about the annual snowfall, which he swears is between
400 and 450 inches.
Independent estimates put this at 170 inches. Still, as with Crystal
Mountain, it's extremely good value, especially on Mondays and Tuesdays when
a ticket will only set you back Dollars 10] It's Dollars 15 dollars a day
for the rest of the week and Dollars 25 a day at the weekend.
Snoqualmy is Twin Peaks country, known in real life as North Bend. On the
way back to Seattle, we called in at the cafe that doubled as the Double R
Diner, where we were assured that 'no one here is investigating murders,
insurance scams, shady land deals, committing adultery or joining secret
societies', and paused for lunch at The Salish Lodge immediately above the
spectacular 280-foot high Snoqualmie Falls which featured in the Twin Peaks
opening titles (or so I am told).
As for my skis, they are safely home in west London, leaning against the
wall of my office, trophies to be gazed upon by a string of admirers,
including my mother and the lady from Meals on Wheels.
One day, perhaps, they will find their way on to the wall of a mountain
restaurant in the Alps. Perhaps with a fitting label, such as: 'Arnold
Wilson spent the latter part of his life under the misapprehension that he
made these skis. They were actually made by a K2 employee called Tom.'
Arnie Wilson flew to Seattle as a guest of American Airlines and K2 skis

FT  11 DEC 93 / As They Say in Europe: British disease is catching on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was another miserable week: self-flagellation took over where self-doubt
left off and new realms of Euro-misery were revealed in the press. Ruling
centre parties were again crushed by supposedly discredited opponents as the
papers grimly acknowledged the errors of the past.
This time, though, I was often caught off balance. Sometimes, you read a
phrase in a paper and then look again to see if it is the paper you thought
it was. The fact is that everybody is suffering from a new form of the
British disease.
One such example, a headline over an editorial, was: 'Wanted: a new
political class.' I thought it must be the Guardian or the Observer in
London, which run such items most days. But it was Tagesspiegel in Berlin.
Another came in a quotation from a trade union leader admitting to mistakes
in the past: 'The unions went along with the short-sightedness and
greediness that almost became an ideal.' Not the Daily Mail banging on about
the 1970s' unrest but Dagens Nyheter of Stockholm quoting a union leader of
the '80s.
So, Sweden is passing through an experience familiar to British readers
while Tagesspiegel was sharing worries common to most German commentators
about the resurrection of the eastern German communists, the PDS, in the
Brandenburg elections. The resurrected Italian communists, also the PDS,
emerged similarly triumphant, so now we have two leading members of the
European Union haunted by ghosts from the past.
It is an experience, as I noted a couple of weeks ago, to which Europeans
will have to get used. This should, in fact, be easy in spite of German
attempts to whip up paranoia.
Communists were a danger when they acted as the agents of an outside power,
or as a gathering point for domestic totalitarians with utopian and
transcendental tendencies. Today, communist parties merely fill the gap left
by the disappearance of socialist parties.
Each country invents its own reasons for extreme forms of anxiety - the
surge of the far left or, even worse, the far right. Humiliating departures
from the World Cup. When old chickens come home to roost, the grass often
looks greener elsewhere, to coin a phrase. If one's own nation has been
defeated, another must have won.
Nevertheless, it was still a surprise to come across a third striking
pronouncement of the week, this time in Nice Matin. It told readers: 'France
will be weak in Europe because it has not been able, in these past few
years, to enforce its conception, against that of Britain, of an integrated
Europe capable of constituting a real commercial power which could stand up
to the United States and Japan.
'Twenty years after having entered the Common Market and having left Efta,
which it had created, Britain will have achieved its aim: Europe should be
nothing more than a free trade area without the ability to integrate and
unify its interests and without its own methods of self-defence.'
This was predicated on there being what the paper called a 'bad Gatt
agreement' which, when translated, means any agreement that seems likely to
be achieved at this stage.
France sees itself as a defeated nation, and no amount of shouting by
ministers about their trade triumphs serves to diminish the country's
self-contempt. But some of the old spirit is still there: one always enjoys
the blithe assumption of the French that their interests coincide exactly
with those of Europe.
Imagine Nice Matin, or anybody else in France, admitting the fundamental
truth that it would be in Europe's interest to eliminate French farming as a
significant political force.
With any luck, this weekend could be the last that we shall have to concern
ourselves with the minutiae of the Uruguay Round and international trade
policy. It is the moment when the future of the world economy hangs in the
balance (I believe that is the appropriate cliche) in Geneva.
And as its leaders are locked in fateful conclave in Brussels, western
Europe looks to the future with trepidation.
Fortunately, at this time, I have available a commentary from the daily
paper that obviously should have been recognised earlier as the bellwether
of European opinion, the Luxemburger Wort (which is, symbolically,
two-thirds German, 30 per cent French and 3 per cent native).
Luxembourg's top commentator wrote that the crushing of Christian Democracy
and PDS victories in Brandenburg and Italy proved that 'excessively rapid
trade liberalisation would destroy jobs and social benefits . . . In the two
cases, the Asiatic challenge has fed fear of the future.'
This should be taken seriously, for the Wort is not a paper given to
overstatement. On the same day, its splash headline was: 'Gatt talks more
difficult than expected.'

FT  11 DEC 93 / Fostering a culture of contempt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hugh Dickinson asks how vulnerable families can be expected to produce good
children
What is happening to us? After the first wave of shock and rage over the
latest awful incident of child violence or psychopathic cruelty - or even
worse, non-psychopathic cruelty - has receded, different voices can be heard
in radio interviews and letters to the press. They hold a note of puzzled
horror. What caused people to behave like that? What causes children to
behave horribly? If we knew the cause, we could allocate the blame.
Grown men with guns in Bosnia doing a spot of ethnic cleansing is one thing.
But child murderers in Britain? What is going on? Could the atrocities of
Bosnia be lurking just under the surface of England's green and pleasant
land?
Is there more wickedness about? I know no sensible calculus of evil. I
suspect that all human communities have a certain quantum of evil sloshing
about in the bilges and leaking out in different ways.
The fabric of social controls which keep it from flooding out and destroying
civilised behaviour are only built with immense patience and moral courage.
Many of those controls are now being wantonly eroded. Looking for scapegoats
we often focus in the wrong place. Above all we long to punish - violently.
Are the two lads in Liverpool who so brutally bashed the life out of a
weeping toddler so 'uniquely wicked' that they must be punished by shutting
them up for 'many, many years?' For a 10-year-old, is 20 years in prison
punishment, containment or therapy?
The murder was indeed grotesque. It has aroused a tidal wave of punitive
rage, particularly in the neighbouring housing estates. One of the most
memorable images from all the bizarre media coverage of this horrible little
tragedy was the picture of adult men and women surging forward behind the
control barriers, their faces contorted by grimaces of animal rage, shaking
their fists and yelling obscenities at the police vans bringing the two boys
to court.
Brutality to small children rouses violent passions. Yet, if the crowd could
have got at these two, it would have torn them to pieces. Instinctive rage
is not a good base for moral discrimination.
By what scale of values are the two 10-year-olds categorised as 'uniquely
wicked?' Yes, the deed was horrific. Any normal child brought up to be aware
of and care for the feelings of others, particularly smaller and weaker
people, should have an instinctive or acquired revulsion against such
brutality. But adults have put images of extreme violence in front of
children for years.
Quite apart from violent fantasy, the real world feeds our imaginations with
nightmares every day: a 16-year-old girl tortured slowly to death; horses
maimed; a bar sprayed with bullets; pedestrians slaughtered by drunken
drivers. Hasn't the threshold of moral inhibition dropped dramatically in
the past 15 years? Certainly, violent crime is now common among much younger
children.
All the panels and leading articles and media interviews ask the same
question: why did it happen? Wickedness is real enough. But it does not hide
just in the place where punitive rage focuses the prurient lenses of the
press. And it is increasingly difficult to know where wickedness ends and
insanity begins - or sickness.
Are drug addicts wicked? We do not punish insanity, not even grossly
criminal insanity. We lock it away and try - albeit half-heartedly - to cure
it. There might be a genetic component to both insanity and wickedness but,
certainly, both are largely the product of the interaction of environment
and personality. A society in which the delicate network of community values
and community feeling has dissolved will breed mental illness, insanity and
wickedness. The fault lies in ourselves and in our stars.
Any parish priest or GP will tell you, however, that individuals and
families are feeling themselves increasingly isolated in a disintegrating
community. How far that is the unwitting consequence of public policies over
the past decade is hard to tell. The culture of contempt has been fostered
deliberately in politics and among the comfortable classes.
Collective responsibility has been undermined in the cabinet, in parliament,
in local government and on the streets. Every man - yes, man - for himself
and the weak go to the wall. Is that wickedness? How can vulnerable families
with inadequate parents and no money be expected to produce sane and good
children in such a climate? Amazingly, many do.
The people who might help them - teachers and social workers - equally are
the object of public contempt. It seems we must have someone to kick. If we
can locate evil in a class of people, in a foreign country, in aliens or in
two small boys, we can project into them the darkness which is in ourselves
but which we dare not own. Then we can beat the living daylights out of
them.
A cabinet minister said recently that we should have less 'understanding'
and more moral condemnation of anti-social behaviour. Would he, I wonder,
have 'understood' the sale of arms to Iraq, an action which resulted in the
gruesome deaths of thousands. Would he be 'understanding' of adultery among
his fellow ministers?
The trouble is that if we begin to understand, we find that these simplistic
black and white condemnations do not fit the moral complexities of human
behaviour; in fact, they often turn out to be positively wicked. It puzzles
me that we have to turn to the commentators in the foreign press to find any
hint that the treatment of the two small boys by the press and the court
might itself be thought an instance of extraordinary wickedness.
Or is this urge to condemn, itself a kind of sickness? The psychopath is so
sick that he has no inkling of what it is like to be another person. Doing
gruesome things to them may produce awful pleasures in himself, but there is
a complete dissociation between his inner world and outside reality.
That might have been the case with one of the convicted boys. It certainly
appears to be the case with certain aspects of our society. There seems to
be no real empathy for the accumulating pain down there on the streets of
Britain - only a puzzled angry surprise when it explodes in wicked deeds.
After a decade of punishment, I think Britain plc needs some TLC.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Sport: When Germany is in love - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Love affairs can be painful. As Boris Becker, competing in the Dollars 6m
(Pounds 4m) Compaq Grand Slam Cup for the first time, flailed his way to
ignominious defeat at the hands of the young South African, Wayne Ferreira,
in the first round last Wednesday, women in the crowd at Munich's
Olympiahalle were reduced to tears and grown men were biting their lips.
A national hero had died.
Germany fell in love with Boris in 1985 when, at the age of 17, he won the
first of his three Wimbledon titles.
He was the first German, the first unseeded player and the youngest male
ever to win the world's greatest title.
In December that year, I was in the same Olympiahalle to see Boris beat both
Stefan Edberg and Mats Wilander as Germany went down honorably to Sweden 2-3
in the final of the Davis Cup. The scenes of emotion among the fanatical
German supporters that weekend were extraordinary. Becker's reaction to the
chanting, the stamping and the tears of joy was even more extraordinary.
'When I looked into their eyes I was frightened,' he said afterwards. 'At
that moment I could understand what had happened to us at Nuremburg.'
Eight years later the tears of joy have become tears of sorrow. Becker looks
older than his 26 years. Life in the fast lane has taken its toll. At heart
Boris is a generous soul, but the soul is in torment. He has agonised about
his place in the universe, has contributed anonymously to good causes, has
wrestled with the penalties of fame and wealth and has tortured himself over
the rival claims of duty to country and self as he has pursued the No 1
ranking. He has also changed coaches with bewildering rapidity and has
finally broken with his manager and mentor, Ion Tiriac.
All that has been painful enough but love, too, has brought personal pain.
The disturbing outburst of racial hatred against his fiancee Barbara Feltus
forced the couple to consider moving abroad for the arrival of their first
child early next year.
The man who has replaced Becker in the hearts of his countrymen is
25-year-old Michael Stich, who this afternoon plays Edberg in a semi-final
that repeats their first round clash here last year. That was a highly
emotional occasion for the German - not only because the match itself
produced some of the finest tennis of the year as Stich came back from 1-4
down in the final set to win 7-6 6-7 8-6.
It also marked a revival in the fortunes of a man whose epic Wimbledon
victory over Becker in 1991 had not brought him the adulation at home that
he deserved. When the two Germans met again at Frankfurt in the ATP Tour
Championship that year the crowd left him in no doubt who was their
favourite.
During a mediocre 1992, Stich tried to come to terms with that difficult
situation. A win over Becker in May on clay in Hamburg, his home town, was
generously applauded by the north German fans. The win over Edberg in
Munich, the city that he had adopted after meeting his former coach, New
Zealander Mark Lewis, at the Iphitos Club three years earlier, at last
established Stich as the rightful heir to Becker's crown. As he sat on court
afterwards the emotion overflowed.
'I am not ashamed to cry,' he said. 'Maybe this was one of the most
important matches I have ever played . . . just to prove to myself that I
can still win, to prove to all the people out there who counted me off
already.'
Certainly that win re-ignited the talent that had lain dormant since
Wimbledon 1991. In a blaze of powerful serving, skilful volleying and
penetrating returns and passes, Stich swept past Richard Krajicek, Pete
Sampras and Michael Chang to win the Compaq Cup and the Dollars 2m cheque
that went with it. Stich had at last come of age.
The maturing process has continued most impressively in 1993. Stich has
enjoyed the sort of success that all players dream of but few achieve. True,
he has not won any of the four Grand Slam titles, but the new German No 1
has done just about everything else. For the second time in three years his
titles have included victories on all four surfaces (clay, grass, hard and
indoor carpet), a feat last achieved by Ivan Lendl in 1989.
The most recent of those titles, a magnificent win in four sets over the
world No 1 Pete Sampras in Frankfurt three weeks ago, earned Stich the world
No 2 ranking for the first time. It also revealed that he had come to terms
with his countrymen's infatuation with Becker.
'I had to learn the last two years that there are always going to be heroes
in a country. Boris was the one that caused tennis really to be recognised
and he deserves the credit he gets.'
Last weekend in Dusseldorf, Stich contributed three victories in leading the
Beckerless German Davis Cup team to victory in the final against Australia.
That tasted especially sweet.
'When the year began I did not expect us to win the Davis Cup. But I think I
have showed that I am a good tennis player. I played two great tournaments
in Germany and now every match I win is like a Christmas present to myself.'
Perhaps the best present of all was the recent popularity poll in which he
was voted Germany's 'Athlete of the year'. At last Michael Stich has become
a hero in his homeland. A new love affair has begun.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Motoring: What will the Chunnel offer? - Stuart Marshall
casts a sceptical English eye on the benefits of undersea travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like millions of people living in the south-east of England - and
particularly in my own county of Kent - I have never been a Channel Tunnel
enthusiast. This is not because the high-speed rail link, should it ever be
built, would go anywhere near my home. Put my feelings down to being an
old-fashioned reactionary. I liked Britain being a proper island and I have
always seen the Channel crossing by ferry as pleasure, not penance.
I doubt I was alone in hoping that if I ignored the Chunnel, it just might
go away. But new bridges began appearing across the M20 as it neared
Folkestone, while a forest of gantries and overhead wires went up behind
high concrete retaining walls. Work trains could sometimes be glimpsed.
When the first advertisements appeared for the Chunnel car ferry, which
starts running next May, I thought it was time I had a look. It was a
revelation. What has been built, unseen by M20 users, is something as big as
an airport terminal. But instead of acres of runways, there is a marshalling
yard and rail tracks running into a tunnel.
The operating company, Eurotunnel, says people still have many
misconceptions. Many think they will be able to drive their cars through to
France; and while most do realise it is rail only, some believe their cars
will go on flat trucks, as on car-carrier trains, while they ride in
passenger carriages.
Wrong again. You stay with your car in a windowless van. You can walk around
it if you wish, but the only place to visit is the lavatory in every third
interconnected coach.
When, in five months, the tunnel starts competing with the car ferries, this
is what will happen. Motorists will leave the M20 by the Eurotunnel slip
road, pause at a toll booth to pay for their passage, and then have a
choice. Those in a hurry can pass through Customs and drive straight on to
the train. Others can go to the terminal building for refreshments and
duty-frees.
Tickets can be bought from travel agents in advance but there are no
reservations; all-comers get in line for the next train. At peak times,
there will be one every 15 minutes; but if you just miss one at, say, 2am,
you could have to wait an hour or so.
Platform to platform, the under-Channel train will take 35 minutes.
Eurotunnel says that, during the day, a motorist should be able to drive out
of the French terminal at Sangatte, near Calais, and on to the A26 autoroute
within one hour of coming off the M20.
There will be separate ferry trains for cars and commercial vehicles. Main
line passenger and freight trains will also use the tunnel but, apart from
sharing the tracks, have nothing whatever to do with the car ferry trains.
Fares have not been fixed but, to compete, they must be about the same as
those on the ships. Every safety and security precaution known to man has
been taken. Using Eurotunnel should be rather less risky than riding in a
clapped-out London Underground train.
Will it kill off the Dover-Calais ferries? Of course not, although it will
take a chunk of the available (and constantly growing) business of
transporting cars and lorries to and from mainland Europe. If the tunnel's
freight trains reduce the number of juggernaut lorries now pounding our
motorways to pieces, every motorist will cheer.
I have two reservations about Eurotunnel (which, beyond any argument, is a
wonder of 20th century civil engineering of which Britain and France can be
proud). While I do not exactly relish the thought of an underground - and,
even more so, undersea - journey of more than 30 miles (50 km), I shall
certainly try it. But the idea fills many people with such undiluted horror
that they say there is no way they will ever make the trip.
A more logical objection is that the time saving could be an illusion. The
train might take 35 minutes, platform to platform, against the ferry's 75
minutes, dock to dock. But you can eat, stretch your legs and shop during
the sea crossing. A family driving from, say, Birmingham to Paris would have
to stop for a meal before or after the tunnel crossing - so what has
happened to the time saving?
Many cross-Channel travellers, very sensibly, use the ferry as a mobile
motorway service area. So, with an eye on the Chunnel's opening, P &amp; 0 and
Stena Sealink have upgraded their fleets. The ships are now more like cruise
liners than ferries in size and facilities. They are so stable that even a
gale does not disturb their equilibrium - or, more important, that of their
passengers. For an extra Pounds 5 on each leg, P &amp; O club class is a truly
civilised way of crossing the Channel.
When heading west to Normandy and Brittany, I like using the longer routes
such as Newhaven to Dieppe; Portsmouth or Southampton to Le Havre, Cherbourg
or St Malo. Longer crossings are not always reflected in higher fares; a
four-hour Newhaven-Dieppe voyage can be cheaper than Dover-Calais.
Although the ships on these routes are not as large as the short-haul
super-ferries, their facilities are comparable, if on a smaller scale. My
wife and I have passed less comfortable nights in hotels than we did
recently between Portsmouth and St Malo on Brittany Ferries' 23,000-ton
Bretagne. It has every facility to make the eight-hour crossing pleasant;
even a hairdressing salon.
In Britain, Suzuki is synonymous with small four-wheel drives, and its Swift
front-wheel drive hatchback gets overlooked. It deserves better. I thought
the Swift GLX 1.3 automatic five-door, which I used as a runabout recently,
would suit many buyers whose motoring is mainly in town and who rate ease of
control above all else. The four-cylinder, multi-valve engine and
three-speed automatic gearbox are well matched. Power steering is
finger-light; central locking and a tilt-adjustable steering wheel are
standard; and the high-roofed body is agreeably roomy, with good all-round
vision. The ride can be bouncy on bad roads, and luggage has to be lifted
over a high sill. But, but at Pounds 9,125, the two-pedal Swift is cheaper
than any power-steered rival.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Sport: Blown through the pain barrier at record speeds -
Sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sailors are finding the pain barrier at least as relevant as boatspeed when
it comes to driving the Whitbread 60 class. 'It was very wet, very cold and
very dangerous. I wouldn't wish it on anyone,' said Andrew Cape, navigator
of second-placed Tokio, when he stepped ashore in Fremantle at the finish of
the Whitbread second leg.
His colleague, watch-leader Matt Smith, stood barefoot enjoying a cold beer
and the Aussie sunshine. It was first time he had had his fleece-lined
seaboots off since the leg began.
The watch running into the finish was the first without the crew muffled in
foul-weather gear.
'I hate the Southern Ocean,' cursed Winston skipper Brad Butterworth as he
stepped ashore. 'Foggy, rainy. An incredibly bleak and stupid place. No
wonder there's no one down there.'
Tokio is still race-leader, her first leg lead chipped away when Intrum
Justitia finished, two hours ahead of her.
Skipper Chris Dickson was happy to confirm that his tactics were
ultra-cautious through the 7,500 miles of the Southern Ocean.
'In our boat we were very, very conservative. Every time it blew over 40
knots of wind, we'd see Intrum gain between 10 and 20 miles on us in a
six-hour period. After two high-speed broaches which we didn't enjoy at all,
we'd just take the foot off the pedal.'
Probably the worst weather of the leg came a week ago on the night
Brooksfield, the Italian entry, began to sink.
With over 60 knots of wind across the deck Tokio was sailing with no
headsail and just a deep-reefed main. Nevertheless, the lightweight sloop
was still making 15 knots - and according to the next day's satellite
position check had gained on several rivals which had pressed on regardless
and suffered sail and equipment damage.
Intrum, skippered by British helmsman Lawrie Smith, had led the W60 fleet
since leaving Uruguay 25 days ago. During that period she broke the world
speed record for a 24 hour run, covering 425 sea miles. Yet her biggest
trial came two days from the finish just off the West Australian coast.
'We just found a hole between us and Australia,' said navigator Marcel van
Triest, explaining how the yacht drove into a windless localised
high-pressure system that saw boat speed fall to under two knots. Tokio
closed from over 80 miles astern to 19.
'We deserved a bigger lead than two hours. It was pretty frustrating to see
two weeks work eaten away like that,' said Smith. His victory was all the
sweeter for having been achieved against the odds.
Intrum's original skipper Roger Nilson pulled out of the race on medical
grounds. Smith was hired and joined the yacht just days before she left
Uruguay. Morale was a little wobbly after a disappointing first leg that
left the well-funded and highly-organised yacht to finish in fifth place.
'He was very quiet at first, joining each watch and observing how people
performed before making any moves,' said navigator Marcel van Triest.
'Lawrie got respect from the crew because of his capacities as a sailor not
because he was imposed by a sponsor.'
However, it was van Triest's contribution that gave Intrum her vital break.
The destruction in a gale of the vital mid-size gennaker meant that by the
half-way point of Prince Edward Island, Intrum's slender lead over Tokio was
being eaten away to less than two miles.
'As we rounded Prince Edward they had us on visual and we had to get away,'
recalled Smith. 'Marcel said to go south, although it put us on the wrong
gybe and I wasn't too happy about it.'
'I said we had a two-thirds chance of gaining 20 miles and a one third
chance of losing 10, so Lawrie said do it,' said van Triest. 'Then he moaned
about the decision the whole night.'
Van Triest emerged from the leg with his professional reputation sky-high.
Intrum caught a ride on a localised low pressure system and was 50 miles in
front by dawn.
'We could see their sails down to the south just racing away from us and
there was nothing we could do,' said Dickson. In the context of the race
overall, his own performance was near faultless.
'We started this leg with a 10-hour lead over Galicia Pescanova who were
lying second, and we're now 15 hours up on them, so we feel we have
improved,' added Dickson.
Merit Cup, the maxi-ketch skippered by Swiss helmsman Pierre Fehlmann, was
the first of the maxi-class to finish, with an elapsed time of 25 days 21
hours 11 minutes, 44 minutes behind Yamaha.
New Zealand Endeavour, Merit's only serious rival in the five-boat maxi
fleet, came in one hour and 46 minutes later. It was a more than creditable
performance for a yacht that lost the upper 6m of her mizzen mast halfway
through the leg.
Having crossed the line eight hours and 22 minutes ahead of Merit on the
first leg, NZ Endeavour skipper Grant Dalton has finished Part Two of this
33,000-mile epic in much better shape than he could reasonably have expected
and still comfortably leading his division.
Dalton's thesis that one of the outdated but still powerful 80ft maxis could
lead the lightweight W60 class around the world remains unproven.
Without her full sail area NZ Endeavour struggled in lighter air but her
highly-experienced Kiwi crew still did a remarkable job to bring the wounded
boat to the line well in touch with the race leaders.

There is hardly a fashion editor who doesn't own a Georgina von Etzdorf
scarf - but there are alternatives.
Calver &amp; Wilson, for instance, go in for rich plain velvets, the most
delectable in panne velvet. The scarves feature richly contrasting or toning
borders. The range starts at Pounds 39.50, with children's versions at
Pounds 12.
The range is stocked at Browns of South Molton Street, London W1, Harrods of
Knightsbridge, London SW1, Joseph, Liberty and other quality shops.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Fashion: Get dressed up for the Medieval revival - Velvet is
the dominant fabric in evening wear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best-dressed parties this winter have a touch of the Gothic about them -
anything from medieval high romance, through Renaissance richness to the
arts and crafts movement.
It is easy to see from where this revival comes.
The current dominant shape is flattering fit and flare - a snug,
narrow-shouldered bodice fluting out gracefully to a full hem - and it is
but a short step in the designers' imagination to a medieval fantasy of
raised waists, scooped-out necklines, flared sleeves, rich velvets and
figured damasks, jewelled crosses and huge rings - even small trains on
those fluted skirts.
Velvet is the unifying thread running through this winter's fashion stories
and it asserts its supremacy even more strongly for evenings, its natural
habitat.
Crushed, pleated, panne, embroidered, beaded, devore or just smoothly
glossy, it is the must-have fabric of the moment.
If you are buying one evening piece this winter, make it a simple, loose-cut
black velvet tunic: Ben de Lisi's is one of the best.
Get Gothic for now with spanking great crosses and oodles of jet, but have
the comfort of knowing such a classic will look just as good in other guises
when fashion returns to the 20th century.
Black is still highest-rated for evening but velvet gives hope to those who
believe there is night life after black. Its pile is woven as tiny loops,
which are then shaved off.
This very fine, carpet-like texture creates a depth of colour and sheen that
lends itself to the glowing shades of medieval art - ruby, burgundy, deep
green royal blue and purple.
Many fibres can take a velvet pile. Cotton is tough but has little sheen or
drape and is best for tailoring; Liberty sells it for Pounds 13.95 a metre.
A viscose-acetate mix, around the same price, is softer but for a sinuous,
shimmering medieval dress, a viscose and silk mix at Pounds 49.95 would
drape much better.
Pure silk velvet is now an haute couture rarity. All velvets show marks, so
the crushed type, where the pile is pressed in, is more service-able.
Whatever its finish, velvet has an instantly dressy effect which is also
versatile.
Without any adornment, the basic budget velvet dress, usually in stretch
panne velours with a scooped neck and fluty skirt, would be fine for an
informal dinner or anywhere on the young and stunning.
A short, cap-sleeved version in green or black from Marks and Spencer
(Pounds 39.99); Monsoon's long style in black with a tracery of gothic
patterning (Pounds 80); or Monix's emerald-green flute and Whistles' purple
tunic style would pass muster worn innocently with a simple silver cross on
a leather thong and plain, centre-parted hair.
And yet, as a foil for a treasure chest's worth of beads, baubles and
jewelled crosses, any of them could look immensely grand.
At the other end of the market, designers tend to add the jewels for you,
trusting their own taste rather than that of their customers.
Amanda Wakeley's blackberry velvet, strappy column, moulded to every curve,
has a high-waisted bodice encrusted with whirls of old gold beading (Pounds
699).
David Fielden's sleeveless midnight blue fishtail style (Pounds 404) has a
wide, beaded hip belt that would grace a medieval siren; while a silken hood
overlaid with old gold lace and scattered with golden beads adds a touch of
mystery to Hardy Amies' burgundy couture sheath (dresses from Pounds 2,500).

FT  11 DEC 93 / Fashion: Camouflage to be seen in - Jane Mulvagh takes to
the moors and finds a colourful variety of hunting attire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the moors to admire a man's leg] How rarely we see it and what a joy to
behold if well-turned under a pair of breeches. If a girl wishes to take on
this spectator sport she must also take on the elements, for the moor is one
of the last public places, apart from the swimming pool, where the male
limb, 'clean as a fork with the wind whistling through its prongs' (as Mrs
Mountstart Jenkinson wrote of Sir Willoughby Patterne in the 18th century)
can be admired.
Panting up behind a keen stalker, his breeks blown tight against his rump,
his prongs defined in peaty, ribbed stockings, is all enough to send her
heart racing and her lungs burning - or is it the interminable climb? They
call such attire 'camouflage' but I'd call it the most glorious adorning of
the male species.
Camouflage. People define it in such curious ways. Surely the aim is not to
be seen: by stag, grouse, salmon or hare. And yet there seems little
camouflage afforded, as most, save for the locals, attempt to flaunt, not
camouflage, their prosperity and their physical prowess.
Surveying the huntin', shootin' and fishin' fraternity around Perthshire one
can almost predict who will come home with a full bag just by looking at
their attire.
The locals naturally, look the most convincing in a colour span that ranges
suitably from lovat and Sherwood greens to peat and bogwood browns; for
barely half way up the drive they disappear into the similarly-hued terrain.
The Germans come a pretty close second: a sober and military lot who, like
the Scots, approve of parsimony, and so favour weathered Loden
hand-me-downs. But those Italians just can't help adding a dash of peridot
or scarlet cashmere to their sensitive limbs. Like baboons on heat, they
announce their eager and colourful presence.
By far the most extraordinary camouflage is displayed on two American lady
falconers, ankle-deep in heather in search of grouse. One is in a clashing
concoction of Bay City Rollers' tartans, which she has crowned with a waxed
cotton Indian turban; the other, built like a sturdy ram, is in a
midi-length black distressed leather coat inset with a panel of plastic
panther pelt along her spine.
That an amorous local wild cat has not compromised her is quite remarkable.
Three Texan sisters hunting rabbits through the rushes seem not to have
heard of sporting camouflage and still to believe that flaunting it is all.
The trio are identically kitted out in champagne-coloured leather
field-boots from Schneiders, and a fawn suede jacket and matching breeks
tailored to the slenderising millimetre.
The buttermilk cashmere polo-necks and taupe stetsons atop their
bottle-blonde locks make them look like brittle bamboo canes about to snap
in the gales of an unsuitable climate.
The dry-cleaning bills alone for those sodden suedes trumpet their
affluence.
But even the pros are occasionally tempted from their green-brown
camouflage, probably out of boredom. The suitably sober falconers setting
off with Harris hawks could not resist the chicken-yellow stockings shown to
them by their Japanese clients.
There they stand, proud but silly, in lovat to the knees, their lower legs
mimicking the yellow talons of their hunting machines and the plumage of the
one-day old chicks stuffed into their pockets.
The gap between tradition and high fashion is too large to bridge when
hunting and just as the Leander Club oarsmen bemoaned the colour of their
flamingo-pink socks earlier this year at Henley - too bright to convey the
correct provenance - so the ageing snobbery persists north of the border.
But for the newcomer who wants to appear authentically barbarous, all is
well. I hear that a London firm has set up a service to ensure instant
eligibility: they will distress and age your new waxed jacket]
Now that is keen camouflage.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Fashion: Niche brands spread their wings - Changes in the
high street are leading specialist companies to diversify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD RAWLINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fashion industry is in the throes of a brand revolution, as niche brands
are 'going life-style'. Companies successful in a specialised area - such as
knitwear - are diversifying into comprehensive clothing and accessory ranges
in order to capitalise on the strength of their name.
Pringle and Burberrys, known for their cashmere jerseys and raincoats
respectively, have introduced ranges of men's and women's clothing and
accessories. Dr Marten, famous for its boots, has branched out into men's
casual wear. Designer Paul Smith, acclaimed internationally for his
menswear, is now designing for children and is about to launch a women's
collection.
Andrew McRobb, Pringle marketing director, says the reasons for
diversification are more complex than simply exploiting a name. 'We are
responding to dramatic changes in the high street over the past few years,'
he says.
'The growth of branded life-style chains such as Next has forced the demise
of many specialist boutiques, which used to stock our merchandise. We must,
therefore, produce a life-style offer aimed at department stores.'
McRobb believes changes in department stores have also fuelled the movement.
'Stores used to have specific sections for knitwear, but now they have
life-style sections, which include knitwear,' he says. 'They stock brands
such as Cerruti and Escada which offer knitwear as part of a broader range.
British brands have been traditionally slow to adapt to the evolving retail
structure, and we have a lot of catching up to do.'
When niche brands diversify they tend to make a bold statement to consumers
by opening a flagship store displaying the full range. Pringle, for
instance, has just opened one in London at 93 New Bond Street. And Levi
Strauss customers have been made aware that it offers lots more than just
jeans since the opening of its Original Levi's stores.
The expanded Pringle collection emphasises casual wear: men's Fair Isle
jerseys are combined with tartan shirts, polo shirts, washed cotton chinos
or denim jeans. Alongside marine-inspired cotton knits for women can be
found flowing floral dresses or more sophisticated cashmere/silk palazzo
pants and tunics for the evening, and Celtic-inspired, hand-crafted
jewellery.
Wayne Hemingway, managing director of Dr Marten Clothing, says of his
company's diversification: 'Dr Martens is one of the few icon brands in
youth culture. Like Levi's, Wrangler, Timberland and Nike products, DM boots
transcend fashion. The brand name is strong enough to carry a complete
clothing range.'
The clothing collection is aimed at style-conscious young men and is divided
between the street-wise Dr Marten Useful Clothing range and the more mature
Dr Marten Gents line.
The latter is a witty combination of British work wear and the type of
clothes worn by the gentry for sporting pursuits. It includes heavy leather
despatch-rider coats, donkey jackets and tartan trousers, along with tough
cavalry twill and washed corduroy, chunky jerseys, tank tops, and
semi-formal shirts in exaggerated cotton Oxford.
For next spring and summer, the range takes a nostalgic trip back to caravan
holidays in Bognor in the 1950s with towelling tops, knitted waistcoats and
cardigans and short trouser suits dominating.
Dr Marten is opening a large clothing and footwear store next year in
London's Covent Garden. The clothes are already stocked by Harrods and
Selfridges in London, and Red or Dead stores in Leeds, Nottingham,
Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and London.
Burberry is equally keen to draw attention to the width of its range which
already embraces clothes for men, woman and children, luggage, food, scent,
toiletries and, most recently, jewellery and evening wear.
Thomas Burberry, the company's diffusion line launched last year,
deliberately steers clear of rainwear and includes sweat shirts, bodies and
leather jackets. Managing director Stanley Peacock says: 'Today, Burberry
rainwear represents only 35 per cent of the business and the main growth
areas are knitwear and accessories. The house check has become a signature
used as a mark of identity linking a wide range of products.'
Its men's clothing collection for this autumn and winter features navy
pin-striped or grey Prince of Wales suits, Burberry check shirts, polka dot
and paisley ties along with casual suede waistcoats, Ban sweaters and duffle
coats.
Paul Smith says he is introducing women's clothing, having observed how many
women come into his shops to buy menswear either for their partners or for
themselves. His collection captures the essence of the men's range with the
emphasis on beautifully-cut suits and separates, quality fabrics, and
details such as inside pockets, hand stitching, and vivid linings, normally
the reserve of men's tailoring.
The silhouette is slim, with long, four-button jackets and knee-length Epsom
coats in natural linen, navy mohair, and quirky pistachio/damson plaids.
Skirted jackets feature pronounced flap pockets and fishtail cuffs and come
in orange, purple, red and navy silk dupion. Trousers are slim, as are
shirts which have long collars and, often, Nottingham lace cuffs.
Paul Smith is opening a shop for his women's wear early next year, alongside
his menswear emporium in Floral Street, London. The collection will also be
stocked nationally by leading department stores.
It is not just clothing manufacturers who are diversifying in order to
capitalise on their name. Jigsaw, the women's chain, has opened a men's
clothing shop in Floral Street, with knitwear and a covetable black leather
reefer coat, priced reasonably at Pounds 385, proving particularly popular.
Browns, the designer retailer on London's South Molton Street, having
acquired a reputation through stocking labels such as Romeo Gigli and Donna
Karan, is basking in the reflected glory by launching its Browns' Own Label
women's clothing collection. Both Jigsaw and Browns' Own Label fill a gap in
the market between high-priced designer labels and affordable high street
brands.
While Italian, French and US fashion houses make fortunes out of everything
from licensed scent to sunglasses to bath towels, UK brands are just
beginning to wake up to the opportunity of a lifestyle.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Strictly for serious claret lovers only -
Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON, NICHOLAS LANDER, FRANK GRAY, JILL JAMES and LUCINDA
DE LA RUE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most perfect gift for a claret lover has presented itself in the nick of
time for Christmas: the beautifully-bound and long-awaited magnum opus based
on the unusually rich archives of Bordeaux first growth Chateau Latour.
Chateau Latour - The History of Great Vineyard 1331-1992 by my revered
colleague Edmund Penning-Rowsell is a translation and synthesis of a
two-volume work based on the Latour archives which appeared in French in
1974, but is very much more handsomely produced and continues the Latour
story right up to this year when Allied-Lyons sold it back into French
hands, concluding a 30-year British stewardship.
It was just after the property was bought by Pearson, owners of the
Financial Times, that the extraordinary collection of correspondence between
the managers and owners of the estate was found, some dusty cupboards
yielding a history not just of this property but of the world's most famous
fine wine region, back to the 14th century.
The book is elegantly written and helpfully presented so that anyone
interested in bordeaux finds it difficult not to be drawn in to this inside
story of how some unremarkable marshland was transformed into the fount of
one of the most magnificent liquids in the world.
The book is produced in a strictly limited edition, the first 10 copies are
signed, and costs Pounds 145 from Hatchards of Piccadilly in London
(071-439-9921) or from the publishers Segrave Foulkes on 081-546-8909).

The FT promotion 'Lunch for a Fiver' last January, which allowed people to
eat in top-class restaurants for Pounds 5, bore several pale imitations in
subsequent months. Coming shortly to a bookshop near you, however, is the
book Dinner for a Fiver.
This is a direct response to a reader's letter which asked me how the 130
restaurants in our scheme managed to prepare a two-course lunch and sell it
for Pounds 5. I asked the chefs and restaurateurs to provide me with a
representative three-course menu which they had offered during that
fortnight together with the ingredients and method.
Dinner for a Fiver contains recipes from more than 60 of the restaurants
which took part and includes, in its 192 pages, menus for French, Italian,
Chinese, Thai and even Belgian dinner parties.
Vermilion, the publisher, was brave enough to rise to my challenge calling
for the paperback to sell for Pounds 5. The official publication date is
January 6 but copies should be in the bookshops before Christmas. It is also
available by mail order. Tel: 0279-427203.

The record for the biggest ever single sale of cigars belongs to Zino
Davidoff, doyen of cigar merchants. In a splendid new coffee-table book, The
Illustrated History of the Cigar, he recalls that the event occurred in the
late 1950s at his Geneva shop, when ex-King Farouk of Egypt, a large man in
every way, placed an order for 40,000 Hoyo de Monterrey Double Coronas.
After many cables and phone calls to Cuba, the order was able to be
confirmed. The king kept his side of the bargain, paying what now would be
the equivalent of Pounds 400,000.
The Illustrated History of Cigars, by Bernard Le Roy, Maurice Szafran, is
published by Harold Starke Publishers, Eye Suffolk, 200 pages, Pounds 40.

If you have left an important client off your Christmas hospitality list nil
desperandum. Jeroboam's, the wine and cheese specialists, can come up with
plenty of ideas for corporate presents. It specialises in putting together
gift boxes for companies 'whatever the budget'. To ensure pre-Christmas
delivery in the UK last orders should be in by December 16. Contact:
Jeroboams 51 Elizabeth Street, London SW1W 9PP. Tel: 071-823-5623, fax
071-823-5722. Retail and wholesale.

Essex company Tremayne and Webb, of The Gatehouse, Hobbans Farm,
Bobbingworth, Chipping Ongar, is also well-used to supplying company
boardrooms. Hampers and gift packs start from Pounds 9.75 up to The Ultimate
Indulgence Hamper at Pounds 425. Kimberley and Toby Webster will provide
more details. Tel: 0277-890525, fax: 0277-890149. Last orders for UK
delivery December 15.

Marks &amp; Spencer is also trying to snatch some of the corporate market this
year with its gourmet gift chests. Champagne, port and Christmas provisions
come in a wooden chest at Pounds 250. Although I find the appearance of
their cakes unattractive - 'shop cakes' my grandmother would have said
dismissively - its range of biscuit and chocolates is good. Attractively
packaged, prices start for as little as 29p for chocolate pennies. Ideal
stocking fillers and children's fare.
Careful selection of M &amp; S canapes will also save you a lot of party
catering time. Smoked salmon rolls filled with cream cheese or smoked salmon
pate (Pounds 6.99 for 18) make a reliable cold platter.

Innes traditional organic sourdough bread tastes like bread used to. A 2kg
loaf measures 15 inches across and the dough takes five days to rise. It can
be bought by mail order from Thoby Young at the Fresh Food Company, 100
Bayswater Road, London, W2 (tel or fax 081-969-0351). It costs Pounds 10.50
including p and p. With the bread, try Mojama tuna, from Andalucia, a
delicacy not readily available in the UK.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Distinctive Scotch - Giles MacDonogh samples
some of Campbelltown's pride and joy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Campbelltown is a remote place. It lies almost at the end of that long spur
of Scotland called Kintyre. If you are forced to take a bus it will take
more than three hours from Glasgow. If the driver insists on stopping to eat
his sandwiches, it will take almost four.
Campbelltown's is a sad story of decline. There were once 33 distilleries
here. Today these are reduced to just two (and a bit). Their story has been
told in a recent book by Brian Townsend: Scotch Missed: the Lost
Distilleries of Scotland (Neil Wilson of Glasgow, Pounds 14.99).
No one is completely certain why Campbelltown became the 'Detroit of Malt
Whisky' in the 19th century. At first proximity to Ireland probably had
something to do with it. Then there were the thirsty stevedores of the
Glasgow shipyards to assuage and, finally, the great steamships which passed
Campbelltown on their way out to the Atlantic. Some time around the turn of
the century quality began to tail off in Campbelltown. Most likely the
distillers had been overproducing. The distilleries limped through the first
world war but were rubbed out one by one during the Depression.
Springbank is now the only Campbelltown whisky which can be said to thrive.
Glen Scotia is periodically silent and Longrow is an occasional product of
the Springbank stills.
Springbank is a highly individual whisky, a reflection to some degree of the
fact that it alone of all Scotland's whisky distilleries - with the
exception of Glenfarclas on Speyside - remains a small family business.
Springbank has a modest peat count - about a third as much as Laphroaig
across the water on Islay. Longrow uses 100 per cent peated malt, but wears
it lightly.
At Springbank they call the complicated distilling operation 'two-and-a-half
times distilling'. The spirit which comes off the still should be light and
characterless. Not so Springbank. The Wrights put this down to the eccentric
washstill and its rummager (this whisks around the still) creating
Springbank's much-admired complexity. The rest of the process is also
individual. Most distilleries bottle their whiskies at a convenient central
location after breaking them down to drinking strength with demineralised
water. Springbank bottles at source using water from Crosshill Loch. For
this reason its bottlings are at 46 per cent. At this strength they have
determined that the whisky will not go hazy, unless, for some peculiar
reason, you store your whisky in the fridge.
Springbank bottles whisky in a variety of styles. The classic 10-year-old is
a nice balance of sherry sweetness and peaty smokiness. The 15-year-old has
more bourbon oak character with some floral notes. The 21-year-old is a
return to sherry with a nutty richness about it: a superb whisky; the
25-year-old is a classic after-dinner whisky with great weight, built in a
rich fruity style. The 30-year-old is rather woody.
Springbank also bottles vintage whiskies. A 1972 (19 years in wood) was
another bourbon wood spirit with an attractive nuttiness; the 1965 (25
years) was sherry again; the 1962 (29 years) was already woody but with a
splendid combination of oloroso sherry, licorice and peat. I did not much
like the 33-year-old.
Finally, Longrow should not be overlooked. The 16-year-old is a surprisingly
lemony dram with a very subtle peatiness.
On the other side of Campbelltown Loch is the Isle of Arran where the
Curries are building the Lochranza Distillery on the northern end of the
island.
The shareholders intend making a relatively light whisky at Lochranza, not
some peaty bruiser like an Islay malt. At the moment they believe other
distillers will take fillings of their whisky for their blends but the
survival of this brave venture does not depend on selling to the major
whisky companies.
Lochranza is currently selling Pounds 450 bonds which entitle purchasers to
five cases of a blend based on Lochranza malt in 1998 and five cases of the
malt itself in 2001. This will be a seven- to eight-year-old whisky. They
see the importance of the bonds as a means of establishing a customer base
for the future. They are not issued in order to cover the building costs.
Anyone interested should call 0290-552282 or fax 0290-550177.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Variable vintage in Burgundy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the production of fine burgundies is a fraction of Bordeaux's
output, the quality of the former is much harder to assess when first
available for public tasting: in the cellars of the Hospices de Beaune
before the auction of its new wines on the third Sunday of November.
Bordeaux, better organised, wait for its Union des Grands Crus around April
1.
This year, the Hospices' 38 cuvees, mostly from the Cote de Beaune, were
particularly hard to taste as, in order to avoid the risk of a secondary
fermentation - highly unlikely, anyhow, especially in this year's very cold
weather - the wines all were injected with sulphides just before the weekend
of the auction. The result was a lack of colour and a hard, acid taste that
obscured fruit and body.
This could have contributed to a 24 per cent fall in prices for the reds and
5.4 per cent for the whites: a drop for the fourth year in succession
following the mostly excessive rises from 1985 to 1989. During those years,
prices that, for charity and publicity reasons, traditionally are about
double those in the outside market, rose by three or four times.
This year, in a stagnant market for the Cote d'Ors Grand and Premiers Crus
wines, merchants were less prepared to buy. The classic red Beaune, Nicolas
Rolin, that had made more than FFr43,000 a cask (300 bottles) in 1989 was
knocked down this time for FFr12,000, while the Meursault Philippe le Bon
fell from FFr81,000 to FFr20,000. And although 759 casks were offered - 96
more than last year and the highest total for 20 years - the proceeds of
FFr10.617m were more than FFr1m less than 12 months earlier.
The most interesting aspect was the substantial acquisition by merchant
firms which deal with French supermarkets. Unlike buyers for top-level
clarets, these firms had not been much involved with leading burgundies.
As in Bordeaux, a potentially very fine vintage was diluted by rain. There
had been an early but variable flowering at the beginning of June, followed
by stormy weather in June and July, but August was exceptionally hot and
sunny.
Picking began in the Cote de Beaune on September 15 and was mostly completed
by the 21st. Then came heavy rain on the 22nd and later, just when much of
the Cote de Nuits was picking.
The parcellation of the Burgundy vineyards means that it is sometimes hard
to summarise the year's vintage. In theory, this year, the Cote de Beaune
was more successful than the Cote de Nuits, but I tasted prominent tannin
everywhere. Eighty per cent of Meursault's premier cru was damaged by hail
and there was hail, too, in Chambolle. A provisional expectation is fairly
light reds that can be drunk early but whites that are austere and lack
character.
Prices will not follow the Hospices' falls - for the simple reason that they
have dropped already. In the past year, so much regional wine (Bourgogne
Rouge, Aligote, Macon, etc) has been sold at low, often loss-making, prices
that a run on the '93s has cleared out the market already.
There is no en primeur fine wine market in Burgundy and most growers (not
the merchants) prefer to offer their wines in bottle in two years' time. So,
we have plenty of time to make up our minds about buying the '93s. But, like
their two predecessors, they will be inexpensive by burgundy standards.
(Indeed, one distinguished merchant, Louis Latour, told me that in real
money terms, prices were back to the 1962 level.)
I tasted some attractive '92 whites at prices half those of the '89s. The
'92s will be available next spring and the reds are thought to be acceptable
but not very interesting although the whites already have a high reputation:
rich and full-bodied. The '91 whites, appear dull although, on the spot,
there are some great admirers of the reds. Of course, the most attractive
vintage recently is '90, but whether it is superior to the '89s remains open
to question.
The trade in Burgundy is in better shape than last year, and there is a good
market for the 'village' wines. The recession in France has hit hard, but
both Latour and Drouhin have expressed confidence in the UK market.
Confirmed burgundy drinkers can look forward to plenty of very acceptable,
moderately priced wines.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Chocolate with sex appeal - Chocolate needs an
educated palate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANDY BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A love of fine wines is chic. But claim a similar passion for chocolate, and
you are likely to be branded a superannuated Ovalteeny. In Britain, the
general perception of chocolate - notwithstanding masked intruders abseiling
into one's bedroom - is about as sexy as flannel nightwear.
Chantal Coady would like to change all that. She is the founder of the
Chocolate Society, and proprietor of Rococo, a tiny temple in the King's
Road dedicated to chocolate.
Coady believes that mass marketing and cheap substitutes for essential
ingredients have degraded consumer taste. Chocolate confectionery has been
reduced to an amalgam of sugar, fats and chemicals whose association with
cocoa is entirely coincidental. The once sensuous, high-tax luxury of
aristocratic boudoirs has gone the way of the powdered wig.
But, she says, we are now on the brink of a chocolate renaissance. The
British, joint third with the Belgians in the league of European chocolate
consumers, are waking up to the pleasures of the 'real' thing.
Chocolate, like wine, requires an educated palate. It should appeal to the
senses even before it reaches the tongue; glossy and fragrant, with a
characteristic snap, like tree bark, when broken. It should melt smoothly in
the mouth, and have a long 'finish'.
Among the painted clouds and plaster putti of Coady's little shop, I was
guided through a tasting: from the rich bronze Grand Cru No 1 (Pounds 3.25),
with all the 'red notes' of the pure Criollo bean, to the dark blended amer
chocolate made with 85 per cent cocoa solids. Coady pointed out the
astringent 'green' notes introduced by the Trinitario bean, and woody,
citrus or dry flavours inherent in various blends.
Next, we sampled chocolate with added flavours. Some combinations were
familiar, such as orange or mint; others, like cinnamon, more exotic. But
the real liaison dangereuse was the Pink Peppercorn (Pounds 2.50). If one
were looking for conclusive proof of chocolate's emancipation from the
nursery, this is it: strictly adults only.
Rococo's range of chocolate comes in 100gm bars. A selection would make a
delicious gift for a 'foodie' friend, and, since Rococo encourages customers
to try before they buy, I can also recommend the experience of making the
choice.
There are, of course, those for whom chocolate has never lost its sex
appeal. Charbonnel et Walker, chocolatiers By Appointment, have been in the
business of ravishing their clients' taste-buds for over 100 years. Madame
Charbonnel was reputed to have been a chocolate lover of no mean status - a
royal mistress, no less - and C &amp; W still treats its customers like royalty.
Its presentation is as seductive as the chocolate itself. You can fill an
exquisite hand-made box covered in moire or Liberty print with a 10 lb
assortment (C &amp; W will keep a note of your favourite centres), or house two
violet creams in a tiny silk casket.
Casanova, who considered chocolate a potent aphrodisiac, would have
appreciated the chocolate champagne bottle, nestling in white satin and
filled with champagne truffles (Pounds 33).
If you want to be more explicit, you can deliver a personal message, in
chocolate letters hand wrapped in foil, spelled out among an assortment of
filled chocolates in C &amp; W's Boite Blanche (Pounds 33 for 1 1/2 lbs). One
customer recently sent a box with the message, 'Ring Me' and a telephone
number. C &amp; W is too discreet to reveal the outcome.
For Christmas, there are elegant crackers, in seasonal red and gold or the
traditional blue and white Charbonnel house style, which slide open sleekly
to reveal 4ozs of bittermints (Pounds 11.95 each). And, having cultivated a
taste for 'real' chocolate, indulge it further with one of the sublime
truffle sauces (original, dark rum, Grand Marnier or Cognac, Pounds 5.75).
If you still think chocolate is kids' stuff, you deserve to be confined to
the nursery for life.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Sicily and its seasons - J D F Jones enjoys
the delights of a soft-centred book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By J D F JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The aspect of those monumental dishes of macaroni was worthy of the quivers
of admiration they evoked. The burnished gold of the crusts, the fragrance
of sugar and cinnamon they exuded, were but preludes to the delights
released from the interior when the knife broke the crust; first came a
spice-laden haze, then chicken livers, hard boiled eggs, sliced ham, chicken
and truffles in masses of piping hot, glistening macaroni, to which the meat
juice gave an exquisite hue of suede . . . (they) ate without thinking of
anything, and without realising that the food seemed so delicious because
sensuality was circulating in the house . . .'
That comes from Lampedusa in one of our century's greatest novels, The
Leopard, If you have ever been curious about the mysteries and delights of
Sicilian cuisine, Anna Tasca Lanza's deliciously-illustrated,
softest-centred book, The Heart of Sicily (Cassell, Pounds 18.99, 255
pages), will enchant you.
She is mistress of the Regaleali estate and the story is an unabashed
promotion of its commercial wine operation (she also runs a cookery school
there). But the book is about food, not wine, laced with recipes of
traditional Sicilian dishes, and takes the form of a seasonal sequence,
starting with Pasta con le Sarde in springtime when the wild fennel is fresh
and moving through to the winter season of olives and citrus.
Sicily is of course one of the cradles of our civilisation - we are shown
how Regaleali's head shepherd makes cheese every day in a manner that has
scarcely changed since the ancient Greeks. Its cuisine and culture have been
successively influenced by Greeks and Romans, Arabs and Normans, French and
Spaniards. But the Mediterranean tradition was invaded by the French via the
Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in the 19th century, which brought in the
'monzu' (ie monsieur), a head chef with a knowledge of consommes, foie gras,
cream and butter.
The book, full of family and landscape, is evidently directed at an American
readership, but that need not matter. Read here of Estratto di Pomodoro (how
the estate kitchen annually reduces 4000 lbs of tomatoes to 240 lbs of
extract); of wondrous, oil-drenched versions of melanzane (eggplant); of
dishes of wild rabbit; of fried courgette flowers ('Mario takes the flowers
for Fiori di Zucca Fritti to serve with drinks before dinner or to include
in a Fritto Misto. He fills the flower with as much diced mozzarella as it
can hold and a small piece of anchovy and folds it over. Then he dredges it
in flour, dips it in egg wash, coasts it with breadcrumbs, and fries it . .
.') It's all ecstatic stuff.

Jancis Robinson finds plenty of seasonal bargains in the first part of her
high street wine choice

<TEXT>
Fine wine-making techniques have been filtering down, yea even unto the
under-Pounds 3-a-bottle bracket. Indeed, the following British off-licence
chains and supermarkets have all but given up on expensive wine, leaving
that elite area to the independents.
This year's worthwhile fashions include cheap Portuguese reds, Argentinian
perfumed white Torrontes - and Riesling, in dry form, has finally been
allowed out of the closet.
The more expensive the wine, the more limited its distribution (LD). Star
ratings denote corporate commitment to wine quality.
ASDA****
This year's prize for the most improved wine selection. The Leeds-based
supermarket group now has a range of well-chosen, often unusual bottles.
WHITES
Hungarian Chardonnay 1992 Pounds 2.99. The dark, heavy bottle says Pounds 12
burgundy. The wine says fiery Hungarian white rather than restrained
Chardonnay. The combination is rated a Minosegi bor (quality wine) and is
well worth trying at the price.
Chilean Sauvignon Blanc 1991 Pounds 3.29. If the well-designed label is
correct, this wine is heading for its third birthday and yet still has
attractive, lemony zest.
Mount Barker Chardonnay 1992 Pounds 4.99. Goundrey. Full, pungent, big
Western Australian but with good balance. Very keen price.
REDS
Rowan Brook Cabernet Malbec 1992 Pounds 3.29. Good-value Chilean, not too
heavy or syrupy. The Chilean Cabernet Merlot at Pounds 3.49 is in the same
mould.
Pinot Noir Vin de Pays de l'Aude 1992 Pounds 3.75. Great price for Limoux's
oak-aged answer to red burgundy.
Barbera d'Asti 1990 Gemma Pounds 4.49. Lively, full, accessible example of
Piedmont's dominant grape.
Ribera del Duero 1987 Senorio de Nava Pounds 5.69. Intense, deep coloured,
oaky, quite chewy but dramatically powerful essence from Spain's most
fashionable red wine region.
SPARKLING
Sharffenberger Brut Pounds 8.99. A Californian that is not trying to be
champagne but which can offer more complexity and maturity than any
champagne selling at the same price.
AUGUSTUS BARNETT**
Poor old A Barnett has finally been swallowed up by Allied-Lyons and will
doubtless be 'integrated' with Victoria Wine in the New Year. Graphics could
do with a new broom.
WHITES
Chasan, Vin de Pays d'Oc 1992 Domaine le Ploges Pounds 3.79. Amazing how
popular this relatively recent crossing of Chardonnay with the sherry grape
(Listan) has become. It would not have happened had they decided to call it
Listonnay. Light, spritzy Chardonnay imprint on a decent wine from the
Languedoc.
Chardonnay, Vin de Pays d'Oc 1992 Domaine de la Tuilerie Pounds 3.99.
Definitely worth the extra 20p, if only for the label, but also for the
ubiquitous but well-made Ryman Chardonnay made outside Carcassonne. Heady
aroma, slightly short.
REDS
Ch Ormieres 1991 Minervois Pounds 3.99. Very appetising second wine from the
widely-admired Ch Fabas. The same sort of build as red bordeaux, and ready
to drink.
Ch Lascombes Pounds 13.99-Pounds 24.99. Until recently this Margaux second
growth was under the same ownership as AB and the company can therefore
offer an array of vintages, 1983-1990, at fair prices. The 1985 at Pounds
24.99 is a dream to drink now, the 1986 at Pounds 18.49 is closing up.
FORTIFIEDS
Warre's Quinta de Cavadinha 1982 Pounds 13.49. Extremely fine alternative to
vintage port and ready to charm.
Gonzalez Byass Matusalem Pounds 18.45 (at Oddbins and Safeway too). A great,
proper, sweet sherry that is one of the very few wines which could be served
with both cheese and Christmas pudding.
DAVISONS and FULLERS
London and environs only but well worth seeking out.
GATEWAY**
Some very silly prices until January 4 and some imaginative selections. Good
Spanish range.
WHITES
Castillo Imperial 1992, Alanis Pounds 1.79. Cleverly blended dry white from
Galicia in north west Spain. Clean, lively, Atlantic seaboard wine. Low key
label. Could be anyone's house white over Christmas.
Chablis Premier Cru 1991 Pounds 4.99. If you must spend an extra Pounds 3.20
for a recognisably smart name and obviously burgundian bottle, then you
won't find better value than this, although the wine is not that much more
interesting, per se, than the Galician above.
REDS
Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignons Pounds 1.99. Melnik, Russe and Svichtov
wineries' offerings reduced from Pounds 2.85. Too many matchsticks for me,
but never mind the quality . . .
Ch La Verdotte 1992 Margaux Pounds 4.49. It comes to something when Ch
Durfort-Vivens, the estate ranked only four places short of a first growth
in 1855, is flogging its second wine at this sort of price. This wine,
described with some licence on the back label as from 'the gravelly hills
north of Bordeaux', is usually Pounds 6.49 and is certainly ready to drink.
MAJESTIC***
Wines for bargain hunters rather than technopurists here. Parcels and job
lots a speciality. Minimum 12 bottles.
WHITES
Bergerac Sec 1992 Domaine de Jolie Coeur Pounds 3.49. Respectable dry white
with good fruit and a hint of apples.
Pinot Blanc 1992 Ch Oberlin Pounds 4.99. Soft but lively Alsace from the
city of Colmar's own domaine. Good value.
Trittenheimer Altarchen Riesling Kabinett 1990 Grans-Fassian Pounds 5.99. A
sensational palate-sharpener from one of the top middle Mosel producers.
Just 8 per cent alcohol: purity, zip, delicacy and perhaps a whiff of
elderflowers in a bottle. Reaches parts no champagne ever can.
Vouvray 1989 Marc Bredif Pounds 7.99. Textbook stuff with honey, flowers,
and not so much acid that it cannot be drunk now with a wide range of foods,
but this medium dry wine will continue to develop for decades.
REDS
Lightning Ridge Shiraz Pounds 3.49. A special export blend from Australia
although it is much lighter, juicier, more peppery, and more southern French
than the average Oz red.
Pinot Noir 1991 Fleur de Carneros Pounds 6.99. They are getting the hang of
Pinot Noir in California. This is a second label from Carneros Creek and is
of the fruit rather than earth school. It won't get any better but is just
the style of scented red to serve with turkey.
SPARKLING
Cremant de la Loire NV Langlois-Chateau Pounds 5.99. Reduced from Pounds
7.49 and a well-made wine from Bollinger's outpost in the Loire.
Ruinart champagnes. Ruinart has long been an insider's favourite and
Majestic offers non-vintage R de Ruinart at Pounds 16.99 or, for those who
revere age and stature in a champagne, Dom Ruinart Blanc de Blancs 1983 at
Pounds 32.50. There is a further 15 per cent discount on unsplit cases of
these and several other champagnes. The Dom Ruinart would tempt me if I were
organising a seriously smart party.
MARKS and SPENCER
The M&amp;S shelves carry a sort of civil service selection of wine, leavened by
the odd daring addition. Solid rather than inspiring.
WHITES
Chardonnay 1992 Domaine Mandeville Pounds 3.99 Another Vin de Pays d'Oc,
from a relatively cool corner of the Languedoc in the Minervois hills. More
Chablis than Australian.
Chardonnay-Semillon 1992 Rothbury Estate Pounds 4.99 Well crafted New South
Wales blend of nearly 60 per cent Chardonnay with a high proportion of
Cowra's glossy, golden fruit.
REDS
Domaine St Pierre 1992 Pounds 2.99 Special offer for December on this ripe
blend of Merlot and Syrah from Domaines Virginie in the Languedoc.
Domaine la CoCte aux Loups 1992 Bourgogne Pounds 3.99 Attractively soft,
juicy, light red burgundy from the far north of the region near Chablis.
Margaux 1989 Pounds 6.99 Scented, plump claret ready to drink now.
SPARKLING
Saumur Brut 1990 Bouvet Ladubay Pounds 6.99 Lovely wine-making, delicate
mousse.  Refreshing, lighter than champagne.
Veuve de Medts NV Premier Cru Pounds 12.99 Some real age and development on
this wine, from the co-operative Union Champagne (a high proportion of all
the cheap champagne currently available comes from the co-ops). A champagne
that could be drunk with food.
ODDBINS*****
Powered by the energising combination of sheer enthusiasm and a certain
arrogance, Oddbins' buyers are the wine trade innovators. Their two London
fine wine shops at Holborn and Notting Hill Gate are probably the best in
the UK.
WHITES
Australian 1993 Rhine Rieslings. The off-dry Valley Estates version offers
spine, acidity, perfume and a bit of sherbet for Pounds 3.25, while the
Penfolds Bin 202 at Pounds 3.95 (Pounds 3.99 at Thresher) is broader. The
Mitchelton Goulburn is seriously fine and dry (much drier than most Alsace,
for example) for Pounds 4.99, but the Mt Langi Ghiran at Pounds 5.99 is
worth it too, all lime, fizz and refinement.
Santa Carolina and Casablanca Chileans from Pounds 3.99. Well made and good
value, especially the Santa Rosa Vineyard Sauvignon at Pounds 3.99.
Moscato d'Asti La Serra 1992 Marchesi di Gresy Pounds 3.99. Light, grapey,
low in alcohol. Post prandial refreshment?
Schoffit 1992 Alsace. Here is a young producer who seems to be extracting
only the fruitiest, most explosive part of the grape, partly by keeping
yields to below 50 hectolitres per hectare (the average is more than 80),
and partly by gentle, protracted pressing. Oddbins has limited quantities of
the eye-opening Pinot Blanc Cuvee Caroline at Pounds 6.99, a vigorously racy
Riesling from the Harth vineyard at Pounds 7.99, and an exceptionally long
Gewurztraminer that smells appetisingly of bacon fat at Pounds 8.99. Even
more thrilling (and richer) are Bernard Schoffit's Grand Cru wines available
soon from the two fine wine stores.
Shaw &amp; Smith Sauvignon Blanc 1993 Pounds 7.49. Both powerful and delicate.
Political similes spring to mind.
Krondorf Show Reserve Chardonnay 1992 Pounds 7.99. Another elegant, lively
Australian white.
Monbazillac 1990 Ch la Borderie Pounds 9.99. Seriously fine barrique-aged
sweet wine; better than many a Sauternes. Should keep for five or more
years.
Vouvray Moelleux 1990 Trie de Grains Nobles Pounds 10.99. Another stunning
effort from Domaine des Aubuisieres. Drink now in its full and lovely youth,
or keep in a cool, safe place for five or more years.
REDS
Minervois 1992 Domaine d'Arbens Pounds 3.49. Full, round, exciting medium
weight red in the soft, fruity mould of a good Loire red. Useful.
Palacio de la Vega 1991 Pounds 4.99. Cabernet Sauvignon with 30 per cent
Tempranillo, one of the many interesting blends to be coming out of Navarre.
Lively with lots of oak.
McWilliams Cabernet Sauvignon 1991 Pounds 4.99. Well tamed mouthful of
Australian red.
Coldstream Hills Pinot Noir 1992 Pounds 7.99. Just the thing for the turkey;
ready, and extremely easy, to drink.
Mt Langi Ghiran Shiraz 1991 Pounds 7.99. Full, round, correct, still wearing
its barrique pedigree.
Leeuwin Estate Redgum Ridge Cabert 1990 Pounds 7.99. Unusually dry and chewy
for an Australian red, from one of Western Australia's most famous estates.
Another Pounds 2 secures the exciting 1989 grand vin.
Ridge Geyserville Zinfandel 1991 Pounds 11.99. A truly fine wine with with a
brambly punch and a long aftertaste. To drink or keep. Ridge's Santa Cruz
Cabernet Sauvignon 1991 at Pounds 13.99 is also stunning.
FIZZ AND FORTIFIEDS
A range of special offers.
SAFEWAY***
In many ways the antithesis of Marks and Spencer, Safeway's wine department
seems to be fuelled by pure instinct. Thus, Safeway is most useful as a wine
supplier to those who share its enthusiasms: modern Iberians and cheap
eastern Europeans, together with English and organic wines.
Out of 80 or so of their wines tasted recently, there were a number that
struck this palate as too quirky. But those listed below are of genuine
interest.
WHITES
Domaine de Malardeau 1992 Cotes de Duras Pounds 3.49 (LD). One of several
Hugh Ryman Sauvignons on the market made in this useful region on the
fringes of Bordeaux. The explosion of fruit seduces the palate as the label
does the eye.
Australian Chardonnay 1993 Pounds 3.99. Well-integrated lively fruit from
Riverina. Full bodied yet not sickly, proving irrigation can be a good
thing?
Falcoaria 1992, Almeirim Pounds 4.29 (LD). A Portuguese answer to Alsace.
Exciting, lively, aromatic white with a dry finish, made by peripatetic
whizzkid Joao Ramos.
Vinas del Vero Chardonnay 1991, Somontano Pounds 5.29 (LD). Textbook barrel
fermented Chardonnay with all the delicacy on the palate that entails - but
Spanish? A nail in the coffin of blind tasting as a rational activity. Vinas
del Vero, in the far north of Navarre, also produces a creditable, if rather
light, Pinot Noir 1989, listed by Safeway at Pounds 6.49.
Penfolds Organic Chardonnay/Sauvignon 1993 Pounds 5.99. A super-concentrated
yet quintessentially crisp offering from biodynamically sound fruit grown in
the cool(ish) Clare Valley of South Australia.
REDS
Alentejo 1992 Pounds 2.99. Juicy blackberries fashioned into an aperitif,
almost white wine, style at the Redondo co-op in southern Portugal. Good
value.
Young Vatted Tempranillo 1992 La Mancha Pounds 3.19. All winery, no taste of
the vineyard, but a juicy, good value red. An interesting comparison with
the very similar central Spanish red below.
Casa de la Vina, Cencibel 1992 Pounds 3.29. The Rioja grape Tempranillo is
fashioned into a lively red with a chewy finish carrying the lower rent
denomination Valdepenas.
Las Alturas, Mendoza Pounds 3.49 (LD), also from Victoria Wine. An
interesting Argentine red, made by Jacques Lurton from Bonarda, the Italian
grape variety that has become Argentina's most planted red grape variety
since so much Malbec has been ripped out. It tastes as though juice lurks
under a layer of appetising dust.
Quinta do Vale da Raposa 1992 Douro Pounds 4.49 (LD). A remarkably soft,
flattering red considering its provenance, the harsh Douro valley which is
better known for port. More evidence for the case against automatic
fortification.
Quinta da Pancas 1990, Alenquer Pounds 5.75 (LD). A superior bottling with
the powerful reek of new oak rather than any particular patch of western
Portuguese soil, but an eye opener by any standards.
Penfolds Cabernet Sauvignon 1989 Coonawarra Pounds 7.99. Well-balanced, full
flavoured Australian answer to claret. A gold medallist in this year's
International Challenge organised by Wine magazine. Available elsewhere.
SWEET WHITES
Domaine Brial 1992 Muscat de Rivesaltes Pounds 3.49 a half (LD). Pleasant,
smart packaging, light golden Muscat in the old Beaumes-de-Venise mould.
Ch de Berbec 1989 Pounds 3.49 (LD). Peachy smooth Semillon made sweet just
across the river from Sauternes. Great value. Not subtle.
NEXT WEEK: Sainsbury, Thresher/Bottoms Up/Wine Rack and Victoria Wine.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Tasty tidings of confits and joy - In the
second of two articles, Philippa Davenport details weekend breaks in France
where the finer points of foie gras are featured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Britain, one roast duck and four diners may cause the carver to panic. In
foie gras country, almost every part of a duck is eaten. The fattened liver
is, of course, the prize but the rest of the bird is used as the basis of
many satisfying meals. The fat is rendered to become a cooking medium as
fundamental to Gascony as butter is to Normandy and olive oil to Provence.
Legs, wings and giblets go to make confits. The neck skin is stuffed.
Trimmings may be baked, shredded and potted as rillettes. The carcass, with
scraps clinging to it, may be roasted or grilled for irresistible snacks. As
for magret of duck - the huge and tender meaty breast - this, too, can be
made into confits, although that generally is considered a pity. Better to
relish it fresh, fried or grilled like a juicy steak.
Confits are a uniquely south-western French way of preserving meat, which
elsewhere is salted, smoked or dried, But this region devised the far
simpler idea of slow-cooking meat, submerged in its rendered fat, until its
tenderness allows a straw to pierce it. For storage, it is then sealed under
a layer of fat. The very best confits, they say, are cooked over an open
fire so the meat absorbs the wood smoke.
Few things are more reassuring to anyone keen on comfort food than a store
cupboard filled with jars or tins of duck or goose confit. Because it is so
versatile, it is the ultimate convenience food. Just take the preserved
joints out of the jar or tin, let most of the fat run from them and dry-fry
for five-10 minutes on each side. For frazzled skin, slip the pieces of meat
into a hot oven on a baking tray for about 15 minutes, skin side down at
first, then skin side up.
Confit made with neck, heart and gizzards is fashionable served warm en
salade. Meaty joints are more likely to be served with hot vegetables. The
smartest choice is probably pommes sarladaise (with truffles). A circle of
potatoes fried with a sprig of rosemary is also good; so, too, is a
sprinkling of finely-chopped garlic and parsley with a few cepes or a pool
of lentils, or braised red cabbage with roast chestnuts and pickled prunes.
Jeanne Strang's glorious guide to life and food in south-west France, Goose
Fat and Garlic, describes the preserving processes in vivid detail. And it
was Strang who started the ball rolling for me when I packed up my apron and
went in search of the mini-holiday breaks known popularly in Perigord, Gers
and the Landes as Weekends Foie Gras (although, in fact, they cover far more
than foie gras). The choices available are many and varied but all aim to
combine relaxation, good eating and learning. Below are details of just four
that might be of special interest to FT readers. Unless indicated otherwise,
they run from Friday afternoon to Sunday after lunch.
Duck is the bird on which you will be working and some knowledge of French
is highly desirable when attending courses with Mesdames Sarran and Gracia
(essential when telephoning them). To ensure personal attention, the numbers
accepted on each course rarely exceed eight. Prices are based on sharing a
double room with private bathroom and include the cost of all meals and
tuition along with one duck, which you take home as preserves; you are
charged for extra ducks which, if required, should be ordered when placing
your booking. Except in the case of Gourmet Espionnage, you must pay for
your own travel: I travelled fly-drive Gatwick to Bordeaux. Pierrette
Sarran, Auberge du Bergerayre, St Martin d'Armagnac, 32110 Nogaro. Tel. 6209
0872; fax 6209 0974.
Sarran is the doyenne of this business: small, wiry, passionate, highly
organized and always on the go. And while her establishment might still be a
ferme-auberge in spirit, her dining room is that of a classy restaurant.
This is serious cooking.
There are 14 bedrooms and a swimming pool. She has no fixed dates for foie
gras weekends but can probably make available one or several of the
following if enough people are interested; February 18-20, 25-27; March 4-6,
11-13, 18-20 and 25-27.
Prices: From Ffr1,550 a head. Partners who do not want to join the classes
pay full pension prices only: Ffr660-860 for the two days. Extra ducks are
charged at Ffr350 each. Marie-Claude Gracia, Auberge a la Belle Gasconne,
Poudenas, 47170 Mezin. Tel. 5365 7158; fax 5365 8739.
This is a chic establishment: the hotel of which Gracia is both chef and
owner has a Michelin star. The converted mill house has just seven bedrooms
and is sited dramatically on a bank of the river Gelise at the foot of a
hilltop village with steep, narrow streets. Weekends, which are billed as
'Weekend cuisine passion en Gascogne,' begin with 'acceuil, installation,
verre de l'amitie et diner autour d'un poule au pot' on Friday evening. The
guests do not don their aprons until Saturday. The schedule also manages to
find time for a quick visit to nearby Nerac and, on Sunday morning, a recipe
demonstration by Gracia and/or a visit to Mezin's market. Dates, prices and
further details on application.
Denise Garnier, Falgayras, Auradou, 47140 Penne d'Agenais. Tel. 5341 3403;
fax 5341 4754.
New Zealand-born Garnier and her French husband have been farming and
preserving ducks for 11 years and, in addition to the usual range of foie
gras, confits and pates, they produce exquisite cured duck breasts, jambons
de magrets seches. The programme here is the only one I found where the
livers of the freshly-killed ducks are dealt with, while still warm, before
the confits; apparently, the resulting foie gras is much more satisfactory.
The Garniers do not run a ferme-auberge and have just one studio cottage
available for a visiting couple; other course participants are accommodated
at L'Air du Temps, a small restaurant with rooms in the nearby medieval
village of Penne-d'Agenais. It is here that lunch and dinner will be served
to everyone throughout the weekend.
Prices: Ffr1,700 a head for the weekend. In addition to the preserves made
from one duck, guests will take away a pair of jambons de magrets seches.
Extra ducks are charged at Ffr300 each and there is a limit of three for
each participant.
Dates: Provisionally, these are January 7-9, 14-16, 21-23, 28-30, and
February 4-6. Some dates in March and early April may also be possible.
Gourmet Espionnage is the brainchild of Caroline Yuill of Oak Cottage,
Thorndon, near Eye, Suffolk 1P23 7JJ. Tel/fax: 0379-71 234.
Yuill specialises in personalised package deals, tailoring itineraries
according to the wishes of groups of eight or more (eight is her minimum
number). She makes all the arrangements and generally acts as guide and
translator throughout.
Her trips to France are designed for a minimum of four days but she prefers
seven so that the pace can be that of a relaxed holiday. A foie gras week,
she suggests, ought to include hands-on experience at making foie gras and
confits in the farmhouse kitchen of a small duck producer she knows, and
learning to cook dishes using both confits and fresh duck. The party might
also like to visit a local wine producer, an artisan cheesemaker and go to
markets.
The accommodation she suggests is a small, family-run hotel near Orthez,
halfway betwen Pau and Dax. She particularly recommends spring and Easter
for visiting this area. Her prices begin at Pounds 697 (inclusive of
everything, including travel) a person for seven days.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Travel: Golfers with the urge to drive by night
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We were on the lam in south-west Ireland and we were loving every minute of
it. Me and my friend Jock knew we would be caught by fading daylight
eventually. The question was whether we could delay the moment long enough
to eke out a few more holes of golf.
Our intention was to play as many as we could before dinner. It had been a
sudden idea, as the best ones often are, cooked up in a moment in late
afternoon. No sooner had we thought of it than we had jumped into my car and
set off, wheels spinning, for Tralee golf club 30 miles away. There were few
barriers to our sudden serendipitous idea. At that time of night, there were
would not be many others around to hold us up.
I knew Tralee, the first course designed in Europe by Arnold Palmer, from
several earlier visits. Jock, on the other hand, had never been there. He
was anxious to see as many of its outstanding holes as he could: the long
2nd, the demanding 3rd, the glorious 8th which lies so well along the sweep
of the bay, the short 13th across the pit, the devilish 15th.
Perhaps the 16th - which, from the back tees, I believe to be one of the
most difficult and heroic short holes in the world - might be too far; but
we would move as quickly as we could and hope to get them all in.
We began at a gallop and, after taking a deep breath, walked all the way to
the back tee of the 3rd, high above the sea. To James Joyce writing in
Ulysses, it had been 'the snotgreen sea, the scrotum-tightening sea.' Now,
however, it snoozed softly below us, benign and silvery. The green, built on
rocks, jutted out in the distance. Beneath it was the cave used in Ryan's
Daughter. Behind us, deserted and inviting, was the wide, long beach used in
the same film.
My first ball pinged off the rocks; another soared away to the left. It was
220 yards just to reach the green from this tee. What on earth made me think
I could hit the ball that far with an iron, even on a still night such as
this?
As the daylight began to fade I caught a glimpse of Jock. His face,
burnished by the wind and sun, had a look of sublime contentment. We were at
one with our surroundings and, just as important, with our own golf.
The setting sun spurred us to play still faster. The ebbing tide moved
slowly down the estuary leaving thickening fingers of mud behind. It looked
tired. We certainly were. It had, after all, been a long day, one that had
begun 14 hours earlier. We had not eaten since lunch and had hardly eaten
then. I had forgotten how hungry I was until we dashed from the 8th green to
the 9th tee to play our last hole.
In the gathering gloom, we each whacked a drive towards the beckoning light
of the clubhouse. Then we half-walked, half-ran until we found the balls. We
whacked them again and again. By now, it was so dark we could not make out
the flag on the green. Somehow we halved the hole, five whacks and several
putts each.
In the clubhouse, the hands of the clock stood at 9.55. The only place still
serving dinner was the Oyster Bar in Spa, six miles towards Tralee. The
barman telephoned for us. 'They will hold a table for you but you must get
there by 10.30,' he said.
Dinner was as much a surprise as anything that had happened to us all
evening: delicious soda bread and fresh salmon, perhaps caught a mile or so
from where we were sitting.
Afterwards, there was a tap on my right elbow. I looked up to see a stout
lady with a friendly face. Soon, we were deep in conversation. She sat at a
long table with what looked to be six or seven relatives. At the head was a
small boy in a blazer, no more than 12. 'My father died a year ago today,'
explained the lady. 'We had a mass this afternoon and now we're celebrating.
He had a good life. He was 90 when he died. In his later years, he often
said to me: 'If you look after me well when I am still alive, then you can
dance on my grave when I'm gone'.'
At midnight, the singing ended and the restaurant emptied quickly. We drove
home slowly in the velvet-soft darkness.
Jock looked out of the window. I concentrated on driving. My feet had
stopped aching and I felt the intense pleasure of a man who had exercised
well. It had been a rare old day, one that lingers in the mind for years.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Travel: When an elephant comes calling . . . - Michael J.
Woods goes on safari in remotest Tanzania
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From outside the tent, a decisive hollow crunching sound, like a giant
peppermint being crushed in a railway tunnel, woke me suddenly. I lay still,
listening carefully.
The full moon had been up before I went to bed, and I had drifted off to
sleep to the sound of a lion roaring across the river, a deep groaning
followed by a series of fading grunts. Now, though, it was dark. A slight
rustle came to my ears; in my mind, it was a snake slithering over the
ground-sheet. Then there was another crunch, followed by the quietest of
steps.
Moonlight streamed through the tent window as the elephant withdrew its dark
bulk, its questing trunk seeking the next crunchy, contorted,
apricot-coloured acacia pod. The huge animal was right next to the tent, and
I held my breath as the bed creaked when I raised myself for a better look.
It padded very softly round to the front, sniffed enquiringly at my
toothpaste, and strolled away to join the rest of its family further up the
Great Ruaha river. I reached for my notebook. After all, it isn't every day
a wild elephant comes close enough for you to touch.
The incident occurred in Ruaha although my safari to southern Tanzania began
in the Selous - the largest game reserve in Africa, covering an area almost
the size of Ireland - where I stayed in Mbuyu camp on the banks of the
Rufiji river.
Mbuyu means baobab in Kiswahili and, beneath the vast bulk of the great tree
from which the camp takes its name, we drank tea and surveyed the sandbanks
and pools of a waterway much diminished by the dry season.
Here were beautiful birds: pied kingfishers hovering like terns; giant
kingfishers; grey and Goliath herons stalking through the water;
yellow-billed storks using their wings to shade the glare from the surface
as they fished; black-winged stilts and brown hammerkops.
Just as impressive as the baobab-shaded tea terrace was an elevated hide at
the other end of camp where we sat one evening drinking cold beer as the sun
set and a roost of bats exploded, like a Roman candle, from the hollow stem
of a headless palm. Wave after wave of black specks soared upwards and
disappeared in every direction.
We took walks from here and cruised up the palm-lined river in an aluminium
boat. The water was crowded with pods of bad-tempered hippos and
yellow-green crocodiles, the latter all about 8 ft long, sliding from their
sandbanks as we approached. On our way home, though, one did not shift. He
was black and barrel-chested, a full 15 ft long. He lay with his great mouth
agape, filthy teeth lit by the falling sun. Even when our boat nudged the
sandbank on which he lay, he showed not a flicker of acknowledgement.
From the Selous, we travelled over the Uzungwa mountains through Mikumi
national park to Ruaha. Most visitors to Tanzania concentrate on the north,
on the Serengeti, the Ngorongoro crater and Manyara national park. Few go
south to Selous and even fewer to Ruaha; so few that, in the first nine
months of 1993, this national park received fewer than 1,000 visitors from
outside Tanzania.
Yet it is almost as big as the Serengeti and an extremely varied and
beautiful place. There are mountains, sand rivers, open plains of golden
grass and thick bush. The Great Ruaha river is rocky and has falls and
rapids after the rains.
Our camp was a private one organised in the relaxed, yet stylish, way so
typical of Gibb's Farm Safaris. On a hidden site beside the river, the
tents, which have en suite facilities and comfortable beds, were shaded by
several grey-green, woolly-headed old tamarinds, and by acacias which leaned
solicitously over them and dropped their pods to tempt visiting elephants.
From the dining tent, with its evening fire and view down the rocky river,
safari leader Nigel Perks, as sharp-eyed as ever, pointed out a nervous
bushbuck slipping down to the river to drink at sunset.
The lions in the bush across the water were noisy but never showed
themselves. We saw lions elsewhere, though. One pride was guarding a buffalo
carcase against vultures, taking it in turns to leave the shade of the bush
where they were resting and lie panting beside the body in the hot sun.
With the general (temporary?) cessation in poaching, the elephants here are
relaxed and breeding well. Small family groups down near the water were
breaking up fallen palm fronds or plucking clumps of grass.
I had come to southern Tanzania expecting to be overwhelmed by the richness
of the Selous. Instead, it was Ruaha which cast its spell.
Michael Woods visited southern Tanzania with Art of Travel (London tel:
071-738 2038), which puts together tailor-made safaris to the Selous, Mikumi
and Ruaha run by Gibb's Farm Safaris. A 10-day safari, including flights,
costs from Pounds 2,500. Only a few UK operators go to this area: they
include Safari Consultants (0787-228 494) and Abercrombie &amp; Kent (071-730
9600).

FT  11 DEC 93 / Property: Grandeur returns - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under the Grosvenor estate's settlement with Westminster council, No 7 Upper
Brook Street was the first TOP building in Mayfair to be converted back to
the grand town house it once was. Now, it has come back to the market for
Pounds 1.395m for a 62-year lease (from Egerton: 071-493 0676).
Also on the Grosvenor estate are the conversions to flats at 130 Park Lane.
Originally, this was made up of two of the bow-fronted houses that gave the
Lane a special flavour - and good views over Hyde Park - before the big
hotels and apartment blocks arrived. Five flats are for sale at prices from
Pounds 2m to Pounds 4.5m for 74-year leases (from Wetherell: 071-493 6935;
and De Groot Collis: 071-235 8090).
Some of the Mayfair buildings that will convert to residences remain offices
while the sitting tenants negotiate terms, wait for their appeals against
conversion to be heard, or for their leases to run out. But an unusual
variation on offices going back to residences is Flat K at 3/4 Balfour
Place; its lease allows it to be used as either an office or a residence.
Egerton is seeking Pounds 345,000 for a 46-year lease. The present owners
and their predecessors have used it as a residence.
Another large freeholder in Mayfair is the BP Pension Fund, which also has
made an agreement about TOPs with Westminster council. The fund owns 30
acres, mostly on the west side of Berkeley Square, which were bought from
the Berkeley Estate in 1967. Later, it acquired properties around Bruton
Street, east of the square. In its redevelopment at 33 and 35 Hill Street
and 27-30 Hays Mews, two flats and some mews units are still available at
prices from Pounds 320,000. The agent is Debenham Tewson Residential
(071-408 1161).
South of the Thames, a new four-storey office block in Furmage Street SW18
awaits planning permission to make 16 flats. The developers envisage it will
take three months from receiving permission to partition the units and put
in the plumbing. Inquiries to the Battersea office of Winkworth (071-228
9265), which also has just agreed the sale of an office made into a house in
Lavender Walk SW11. On the market at Pounds 105,000, it went for Pounds
95,000. to a first-time buyer from the City. Its special feature is a vast
reception room, 44 ft x 15.5 ft.
Tuesday sees the publication of a report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation
on Offices into Flats. It will discuss further the feasibility of converting
and re-generating inner city areas.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Property: Make a home at the office - London is awash with
empty business space. Now, some of it, especially in Mayfair, is being
converted to residential use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The second world war blitz saw many houses in Mayfair, an exclusive district
in the heart of the West End, converted into offices as parts of the City -
London's financial heart - were destroyed by Luftwaffe bombs. Only now, 50
years on, is the process of returning those offices  - many covered by
so-called Temporary Office Permissions (TOPs) - to residences starting to
have an effect.
This is a small part of a big change affecting London, which is full of
unused office space: blocks of the 1960s, '70s and '80s sit empty, built
when demand looked limitless. Making flats of them is an alternative use,
which can have the added benefits of creating a more vital city and allowing
more people to live near their work.
Regalian Properties' purchase (in association with the Sincere Company Ltd
of Hong Kong) of Alembic House on the Albert Embankment, SE11 (for about
Pounds 5m, through Cluttons London Residential Agency), looks shrewdly
timed. This 14-floor block, built in the 1960s and (reputedly) used by the
intelligence agency MI6, meets the top requisite in property: its location
on a bend of the Thames, with long views up and down river, including the
houses of parliament, is excellent. Best-selling author Lord (Jeffrey)
Archer already has a flat on the top two storeys and Regalian is to convert
the other floors into luxury flats.
Office space available in central London amounts to about 31m sq ft,
according to an estimate by property analyst APR (Applied Property
Research), and millions more square feet are in the planning pipeline. But
where are the businesses to fill them? Walk around London and everywhere you
see vacant offices.
Interest is a huge cost, draining a developer's funds. Then again,
maintenance for a 20,000 sq ft block costs an estimated Pounds 15,000
yearly, plus Pounds 70,000 for 24-hour security and, say, Pounds 200,000 for
rates, according to a Home Office report issued last year by APR with
chartered surveyor Cluttons, quantity surveyor Gardiner &amp; Theobald, and
architect GMW. To escape rates you must 'decommission,' which is a drastic
step involving removing the stairs and lift. The building, of course,
deteriorates at once - and the community with it. Clerkenwell, Shoreditch
and the South Bank, on the fringes of the City, contain much of the surplus
but spare blocks lurk all over inner London. And this 'creeping
dereliction,' as the report calls it, sits uncomfortably with the need for
more homes in the central area.
The causes of the surplus are easy to understand. Until the end of the
1980s, developers' returns on offices far outmatched those on residential
buildings. With a peak capital value of Pounds 1,000 a sq ft, their zest to
build offices was matched only by the anxiety of the banks not to miss out
on the boom. Then came their come-uppance: the financial crash, about 18
months after the residential market had collapsed. Prospective tenants
vanished and rents fell, even in the City.
Thus, a change to residential use looks attractive, even if it poses
difficulties for planning authorities that have not included the possibility
in development schemes they began at the height of the boom and which now
are being completed in the recession. But even if office use picks up, as it
must with recession easing, it can never mop up the space available
(although, if a council thinks there will be a lack one day, it can give
temporary permission to change a building's use).
There is 'very little difference now in the capital values,' according to
West End estate agent Anthony Lassman. He says office rents are running up
to Pounds 400 a sq ft in the heart of London; another agent, Peter
Wetherell, estimates Pounds 300-400 a sq ft for residential values. And
while offices have improved slightly from three or four months ago,
residential could be the best option for many blocks. Indeed, several
conversions are already in the pipeline in the area near Victoria station.
What changes of use are possible? Flats for a start, as at Alembic House. Or
the block could become a hotel, or a student hostel (for which the report
estimates a gross return per room of Pounds 50 a week for 40 weeks a year,
making Pounds 2,000).
The problems, however, are many. A hotel needs a drive-in and flats require
parking space. If there is no basement car park, can streets cope with
parking for residents? Is there enough daylight? (light requirements differ
for offices and homes). And, most importantly, is it proper living
accommodation? As a Westminster city council spokeswoman said: 'We have been
fighting bad housing for the past 50 years.'
In the Mayfair section of Westminster, the long-lived TOPs, mostly on the
Grosvenor estate, are a separate issue but slot into the general pattern.
During the war, houses were requisitioned in Mayfair for embassies and
emigre governments. TOPs continued this trend. They saved money for
aristocratic owners, who stayed in the country (and moved to cheaper
Knightsbridge, Kensington and Chelsea if they did need a town house).
TOPs had to be renewed every 10 years. But although Westminster council's
aim was to return buildings to residential use, there was a fog of
uncertainty, especially when buildings had been remodelled extensively as
offices. Late in the 1980s, however, the council decided TOPs would end in
1990. Building by building, negotiations began with the Grosvenor estate -
which had 84 TOPs in Mayfair - to see how suited each was for conversion
back to residential use.
Fifteen of the TOPs needed early decisions, which resulted in 29,100 sq ft
being declared offices and 97,160 residential. Another 12 were omitted
because of various special circumstances. The remaining 57 were settled in a
package, with 132,295 sq ft declared offices and 184,497 residential. So, in
total, there are 161,395 sq ft for offices and 282,107 residential (with 106
flats in apartment buildings, 15 flats in office buildings, seven houses,
and 12 existing flats).
Since the agreement, Mayfair has been full of builders and skips and now we
are starting to see the changes. No 106 Park Street has been made into 11
luxury flats and there will be about 17 in Brook House on Park Lane, which
used to house property company MEPC. The former headquarters of the Rank
Organisation at 38 South Street has been sold and will revert to being a
house, while 7 Upper Brook Street has already been converted back and is now
on the market for a second time.
The result is a gradually changing Mayfair with a central residential
enclave 'on a par with Belgravia,' says agent Kevin Ryan. Shops are mostly
on the edges, but South Audley Street has become an up-market village high
street. Of course, it will be a while yet before the area really gets a
'homey' feel. By the millennium, however, that could have come.

FT  11 DEC 93 / How To Spend It: The delicate art of selecting creative
presents - Sculptures, paintings and cartoons all make ideal gifts. Lucia
Van Der Post looks at what is on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the presents I have been given over the years I suppose the ones that
have given the most lasting pleasure are the pictures and sculptures with
which our house is over-supplied. Never mind that for years we were short of
comfortable chairs, that serious grown-up furniture was thin on the ground
or that we entirely lacked the sort of gadgetry that others cannot live
without - our walls looked smashing and our shelves were full of interest.
Not that I am alone in my predilections. There are plenty more like me. We
are the ones who would rather have a new drawing than a designer frock any
day of the week.
The key to giving art as presents, though, is a certain acquaintance (or
better still, a deep knowledge) of the loved-one's tastes. Not that this is
easy - many people's tastes are confusingly eclectic.
Works of art that have meaning nearly always make wonderful presents - into
this category, come drawings or sculptures of the beloved or the family as
well as scenes from special places.
This Christmas you are almost spoiled for choice. Many of the galleries have
had a hard time of it and special Christmas exhibitions give a fillip to end
of year sales. Here, are a few suggestions.
Edinburgh seems to have one of the highest proportions of picture galleries
of any city in Britain. Wandering down Dundas Street is a treat for anybody
wanting to get their eye in. The Scottish Gallery at no 16 in particular is
always filled with interesting contemporary work.
In less well-known William Street is Flying Colours Gallery, owned and run
by Jane Houldsworth, which in the run-up to Christmas has a solo show by
Ethel Walker as well as a sale of more than 100 framed works by about 30
different contemporary Scottish artists.
Prices range from Pounds 50 to Pounds 5,000 and there are established
artists such as John Cunningham, James Fullerton, I. Lesley Main as well as
newer talent such as Shona Barr, Lorna Robertson and Selina Thorp.
The sale runs until December 23, there are oils, water-colours, pastels,
landscapes, still lifes - the range is big but it is mostly representational
with a few near-abstracts. The picture photographed here, '10 Umbrellas', a
mixed media (acrylic/gouache) by James Fullerton, measures 8ins by 10ins and
sells for Pounds 565.
Flying Colours Gallery is at 35 William Street, Edinburgh, EH3 7 LW.
031-225-6776.
Cartoonists are a specialist taste - either they appeal to you or they do
not. The best collection I have seen recently is in Mark Birley's Bath &amp;
Racquets Club in London's Brook's Mews where he has accumulated a quite
stunning group of Pont's drawings - beautifully drawn, often very funny,
they wittily recall a vanished era and make quite an impact as they do so.
As Mark Birley got there first the rest of us will have to look elsewhere -
possibly to H. M. Bateman, Punch's classic cartoonist. King's Court
Galleries specialises in antique and reproduction prints and for this
Christmas is offering a series of over a hundred hand-coloured Bateman
lithographs.
Subjects range from golf, cricket and fishing to dentistry, the law and
banking. Each framed print (proper presents really ought, in my view, to
come ready-framed) costs Pounds 50.
Besides the Bateman cartoons, King's Court Galleries has a wonderful
collection of antique maps and prints, lots of rare 18th and 19th century
prints - most of them are original prints, usually hand-coloured, but there
are also, for those with less to spend, some limited edition reproductions
starting from as little as Pounds 10 (unframed).
The original branch is at 54 West Street, Dorking, Surrey (telephone:
0306-881757) but a later one has recently been opened at 951-953 Fulham
Road, London SW6. (Telephone: 071-610-6939).
Agnews, one of the grand, old established galleries which is used to dealing
in very grand names ('The Holy Family with the Infant John the Baptist' by
Rubens was in its summer exhibition) has decided to offer a selection of
works for Christmas.
This used to be an Agnews' tradition but in the heady boom years, when
nobody needed Christmas as an excuse to buy and price was no object, it was
discontinued. Here it is, back again and very welcome, too.
Works will include watercolours by Philip Sutton, whose prices range from
Pounds 850 to Pounds 1,500; lithographs by the late Dame Elisabeth Frink
('Owl' at Pounds 900, 'Man and Horse' at Pounds 850); etchings and aquatints
by Patrick Proktor; 'Chauvres Souris' by Graham Sutherland for Pounds 1,000.
For those whose tastes are more traditional there are 18th and 19th century
watercolours: 'Portrait of a Lady' by George Richmond (Pounds 1,100), 'The
Market Place' by Thomas Rowlandson (Pounds 750) and 'Rochester' by Alfred
Vickers (Pounds 650).
Pictured here is a print of Bernard Dunstan's watercolour of 'The Gabrielle
Quartet at Stourhead 1987' (Pounds 150).
Everything in the Christmas exhibition is under Pounds 2,000. It is on at
Angew's, 43, Old Bond Street, London W1 from now until December 23.
All the readers who ply their way home via Waterloo might like to know about
the Llewellyn Alexander gallery which is close to Waterloo and at the moment
is holding a lively, varied and well-priced exhibition specially aimed at
those looking for Christmas presents.
The theme of the exhibition is 'Feast of Food in Art' and the styles vary
enormously - there is Judy Joel and Linda Benton's naif paintings. There is
Edna Bizon's still-life which in its use of light and colour seems to refer
back to the 17th century Dutch painters. Then there is Kristina Jardel's
almost surrealistic disposition of the components of her still-life while
Robert Chandler's formal, restrained 'Still Life on a table' is almost
abstract. Something, as you see, for everybody.
Prices range from Pounds 200 to Pounds 3,500 but the vast majority are under
Pounds 1,000.
The picture photographed left - a still-life of fruit on a table and in a
bowl is sumptuously coloured with a rich dark background and beautifully
framed - is 'Harmony' by Kristina Jardel and it is Pounds 850. The Llewellyn
Alexander gallery is at 124-126 The Cut, Waterloo, London SE1 8 LN.
(Telephone: 071-620-1322).
While in the area it is worth noting that the Bankside Gallery at 48 Hopton
Street, Blackfriars, London SE1 9JH (Telephone: 071-928-7521) has a special
Christmas Show 'Art Off The Walls' with works by members of the Royal
Watercolour Society and the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers -
everything can be bought and taken away on the spot and prices start at
Pounds 50.
For longer term planning (perhaps for next Christmas, a birthday or
anniversary?) it is a good opportunity to take a good look at the work of
all the artists on show - almost all of them will also take on commissions
to paint a particular house, landscape or portrait.

FT  11 DEC 93 / How To Spend It: What to buy her with the bonus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the bonuses have been good, spoil her with a soft crushed velvet evening
coat by Romeo Gigli. The label is one almost any woman with any fashion nous
will cherish and the coat itself will lend warmth and glamour to a life-time
of evening outings. It comes long, short or swing-style, in anthracite,
coffee, ginger, pearl grey or, most stunning of all, deep claret. It
iscapaciously cut so if she is small they may be rather overwhelming. Pounds
450 from Design Label, 3 Sloane St, London SW1. 071-823-2883.
Most men find women's lingerie departments daunting. This is a pity for many
a splendid Christmas present is lurking in them. In particular there are
glamorous evening tops which fall halfway between underwear and outerwear.
Provided you know the beloved's bust size they are relatively easy to
choose. The classy names to look for are Natori and La Perla. They are
expensive but - as mother always said - you get what you pay for. The lace
(when there is some) is of high quality and they are beautifully constructed
so that they can be worn without feeling either that something dire is going
to slip or that one looks like an escapee from a bordello. They look
effortlessly, classily glamorous. The lacey Natori top (Pounds 199 from the
lingerie department of Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1), sketched here,
is typical of the genre - it can be worn on its own, teamed with a skirt or
trousers, or under a tuxedo or any other jacket.
Another label that women like to snuggle into is Nicole Farhi. At Fenwick of
63, New Bond St, her roll-necked cotton cable-knit sweaters are, 'simply
walking out of the shop'. They can be worn with leggings, crinkle-skirts,
trousers. At Pounds 139 a time choose from aubergine, berry, black, navy or
charcoal.

FT  11 DEC 93 / How To Spend It: Smells for men with refined taste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are bewildered by the confusing array of men's scents on sale this
Christmas, look no further than the superior smells made by the House of
Creed, writes John Morgan of GQ.
One of the few remaining privately owned parfumeurs, Creed was once a
British company but it moved to Paris on the suggestion of the Empress
Eugenie and is still to be found in its beautiful premises in Paris's
luxurious 8th arrondissement. Its scents are as distinguished as its list of
clients which has included emperors, kings and others with fragrant
aspirations of imperial proportions.
The best of the range is Green Irish Tweed - a wonderfully-civilised and
beguiling blend of floral, green and woody notes. The Chablis of the scent
world, it enjoys a cult following among the men's style press. The range
also includes Zeste Mandarin Pamplemousse, which, as its name suggests, is
fresh and citrusy; Orange spice, a classically masculine concoction of
oranges, clove and cinnamon; the rich and woody Bois de Portugal; and the
latest offering, Erolfa, a bracingly oceanic fragrance that combines the
fashionable ozonic note with bergamot, sandalwood and ambergris. Some of the
scents bear the millesime classification which denotes a higher
concentration of essences than ordinary eau de toilettes, and therefore a
more enduring and profound smell.
Prices start at Pounds 38.95 from Les Senteurs, 227 Ebury St, London SW1
(mail order 071-730-2322); Harrods Knightsbridge, London SW1; Liberty,
Regent St, London W1; Selfridges, Oxford St, London W1; Harvey Nichols,
Knightsbridge, London SW1; Frogget, Brighton and Tunbridge Wells.
Jo Malone is one of London's best-kept secrets. For several years she has
been tending some of the most high-profile skins in the UKand many have
become addicted to her hand-made range of body lotions, bath oils and
colognes. She uses French limeblossom, nutmeg, ginger, muguet, lime with
basil and verbenas of Provence to scent the potions and her packaging is
impressively simple - elegantly plain glass flagons for the oils and cologne
and they come in beautiful ivory and black boxes tied with grosgrain
ribbons.
A large box of pot-pourri smelling deliciously of wild orange and ginger is
Pounds 27, a small box containing two flagons of bath oil and cologne is
Pounds 29.95, a large box containing two decanters of bath oil and cologne
is Pounds 59.95 (the prices do not include postage and packing). Orders can
only be made by telephone: 071-589-5600.

FT  11 DEC 93 / How To Spend It: Christmas is a lot closer than you think] -
Only 14 shopping days left, don't panic] Lucia van der Post has some tips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Well, here we are, just 14 shopping days left to Christmas. Time is running
out and though I daresay some of you are already sitting back looking at all
those neatly-wrapped parcels, there are plenty of us whose lists still look
dauntingly full. For those still wondering what to buy for whom, here are a
few suggestions.
Personally, I think old-fashioned games are infinitely more fun than almost
any new one you care to name and they make a splendid family present. So
what about a set of packs of cards specially designed for Racing Demon?
Beautifully packaged, four packs of cards, plus an instruction leaflet, cost
Pounds 16.50 either direct from Elizabeth Designs, Mousehill Court, Milford,
Godalming, Surrey GU8 5EA. (Tel: 0483-417-357) or from Aspreys of Bond
Street, London W1 and the General Trading Company of 144, Sloane Street,
London SW1.
For something off-beat what about a fossil? Cobra &amp; Bellamy of 149 Sloane
Street, London SW1 have brought a collection back from the Dominican
Republic. They are about 35m years old and there is quite a choice. Ants
seem almost two-a-penny at Pounds 60 a time. Also Pounds 60 are winged
termites, flowers, petals, stamens. Mosquitoes, also mired in clear amber,
are about Pounds 850 while the piece de resistance of the collection (for
which a bid has already been made by the Natural History Museum) is a
sitting-up scorpion at Pounds 6,000. A praying mantis is Pounds 5,000.
For bookworms, bookchecks are good stocking presents. Printed almost exactly
like a check-book they are designed to keep a check on book borrowers - you
write your own name on the major part, tear it out and give it to the
borrower to use as a bookmark and reminder of the owner. You keep the stubs
where the filled-in foil reminds you of who has borrowed which book. There
are several different designs, each pack has 20 checks and costs Pounds 3.95
from Museum shops, good bookshops such as Waterstones and Dillons. To buy by
mail write to: Bookchecks, Ibthorpe House, Andover, Hampshire SP11 OBY.
Telephone: 0264-76683.
For the keep-fit brigade who have not yet found a club that suits them what
could be better than a subscription to a health or indoor tennis club? True,
it is expensive, but it is the sort of present that lasts all year round.
The Carlton Tennis Club, for instance, has three indoor courts and a fitness
studio. Full membership costs Pounds 650 a year with a joining fee of Pounds
250. You get an introductory game free. The club is at Alfred Road,
Westbourne Green, London W2 5EU. For membership details ring 071-286-1985.
Give her a beauty session - for Pounds 25 Jean Ashley, 32, Albert Bridge
Road, London SW11 4PY (Telephone: 071-720-4239) will provide a complete
facial treatment and she is happy to give appointments either in the evening
or on Saturday morning for busy working women. Stephen Glass of Face Facts
at 73 Wigmore Street, London W1 (Telephone: 071-486-8287) will give a
complete make-up lesson with step-by-step tuition and advice for Pounds 59.
He is not only expert, he is terribly nice.
Trivial Pursuits - the boardgame of the 1980s - is now available on video.
For the sports fanatic there is a Sports Editions with some 100 TV clips of
memorable sporting moments and questions to match. The Family Edition homes
in on questions of a more general nature covering news, entertainment and
historical events. Both are Pounds 19.99 from games departments, video shops
and departments.
Not everybody knows that The Design Museum at Butlers Wharf, London SE1 2YD
(Telephone: 071-403-6933) has a shop of its own. Particularly interesting
are the reconditioned vintage telephones ranging from Bell's Bakelite
Belgian version to the 1970s Ericafon. Prices range from Pounds 32 to Pounds
115.
For the home, Colefax and Fowler of 110 Fulham Road, London SW3 6RL
(Telephone: 071-244-7427) has a surprisingly reasonably priced range of
attractive, modish accessories. A set of three circular tartan boxes is
Pounds 18 (plus VAT), a blue and white flower brick is Pounds 29.95, a
beautifully turned wooden Tazza is Pounds 48 (plus VAT), a silver metal oval
bakeset (it would make a splendid cache-pot) is Pounds 35 and a charming
sea-shell picture frame is Pounds 30 (plus VAT).

FT  11 DEC 93 / Gardening: How impulse can cost you the earth - Robin Lane
Fox finds astonishing price differences at garden centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We all watch the retail price index for its ups and downs: I am a keener
observer of the impulse index. This tells you what percentage you have to
pay for buying on the spur of the moment and not shopping around.
In December, it outperforms the FT index. It is particularly fascinating to
keen gardeners who are, usually, peasants at heart. The index tells them
something about fellow gardeners who are not such peasants and are not so
keen on the dirty bits of their shared pastime.
To work out the index, you must price what you want at two or three
different places on the road into central London. Begin with its origin,
then its first significant urban outlet, and then its final resting place in
the vibrant heart of today's capital where everybody is cutting each other's
throat.
Those of us who go back to a product's origin are said in the trade to be
'sourcing'. My sourcing begins where the wolds first become evident in the
Cotswolds. Away from the A40, white-flowered jasmine, 3ft high, is being
sold by growers at prices between Pounds 5 and Pounds 7; large-flowered
cyclamen, with eight to 10 flowers and as many young buds, cost Pounds 3;
small cyclamen persicum cost Pounds 1.50, also in full flower and bud;
mistletoe costs Pounds 1, and you could throw in a few universal pansies if
you really wanted them.
Similar growers extend westwards through the former Vale of Evesham, and
nobody would buy from them merely on impulse: you must have decided what you
want from a plastic tunnel, even if you are then tempted to add something
else.
To plot the impulse index, you then follow the items eastwards into London.
I begin with the simplest example. Mistletoe is simply mistletoe, on a
two-pronged branch without any scope for debate about British Standards or
quality guarantees. Now, two of the capital's leading garden centres are the
Clifton Nurseries in Little Venice and the Chelsea Gardener in Sydney
Street. Unlike me, they have to pay their staff, buy only the best and pay
business rates on top. Which brings me back to mistletoe. In the wolds, it
costs Pounds 1; in Oxford's garden centres, it sells for Pounds 1.40
upwards; but in the vibrant heart of London, at the Chelsea Gardener, it
costs Pounds 5.
The index really jumps when it comes to jasmine. There are plenty of buds on
my two jasmines, 4ft high on their bamboo canes. I bought them last year for
Pounds 5 apiece but I really should be touting them in London. White jasmine
in Little Venice is selling at my size for Pounds 40 each, while in Sydney
Street it costs Pounds 49.95.
Naturally, you would want me to plot the impulse index for Christmas trees,
but they have become as hard to follow as the subtle variations between
fresh, freshly squeezed, pure and real orange juice. Clifton Nurseries
issues a helpful guide to the options, reminding us - rightly - that the
traditional Norway spruce is the first to drop its needles; that the
Nordmann fir is a soft grey-green and less of a dropper; and that the
thickly-branched blue spruce is the best at keeping its needles.
In Oxford garden centres, a 4ft-high blue spruce costs Pounds 12.35; in
Sydney Street, it is Pounds 32.95. A 7ft traditional Norway Dropper will
cost you Pounds 7 in the wolds (the traditional pricing of Pounds 1 a foot
still holds up farmers' driveways), Pounds 12 in Oxford, Pounds 21.50 at
Clifton and Pounds 22.95 at the Chelsea Gardener.
I am not sure that sourcing accounts for any of the Oxford-London
differential as all the shops have left previous labels on their blue Norway
spruces. These state that the trees have all been sourced from the same
place - the Yattendon Estate, which flogs them off in a coniferous bit of
Berkshire.
Urban garden centres thrive on impulse and occupy extremely valuable sites,
so who am I to wish them other than the best of luck? It must be fun putting
the stickers on the big specimens which must set somebody's impulses racing:
Pounds 152 for a standard holly at Clifton Nurseries; Pounds 99 for a bay
tree in Chelsea. The latter tempted me mightily with some camellias with
immaculate leaves and upper shoots about 6ft high: they cost Pounds 84 each
for people who cannot wait.
Londoners may be particularly impulsive, but the truth is that shoppers at
garden centres anywhere will go over the top for a plant which looks upright
and 'fully grown'. Why not trim the side stems of your shrubs and sell them
off as standards at five times the price? In Oxford, an ordinary
yellow-berried cotoneaster is costing Pounds 29.95 already in a standard
shape. It might be worth running it up to the Kings Road in Chelsea on spec
to see if you could palm it off on somebody for as much again.
Are my fellow gardeners nits? From a nurseryman, Pounds 5.50 would buy you
my top Christmas present for anyone who is keen and green: the cream and
grey-green rhamnus, which will flourish on a south or west wall. It costs
more in a garden centre; in Little Venice, it is Pounds 9.95, and in Chelsea
it sets you back Pounds 14.95, with no variation in quality.
Certainly, the nits are impatient: if you look on plants as interior decor
which go in a 'room outside', perhaps it is not so nittish to go straight
out and buy one which jumps the queue of two growing seasons and is
needlessly big. I do, however, appreciate the nit traps.
If bigger is better from the buyer's point of view, why not apply the
principle and the index to anything which grows? At Clifton Nurseries, you
can buy a lump of Alchemilla mollis, the unstoppably vigorous Lady's Mantle,
for Pounds 6.95 in an above-average pot. You can add the cypress spurge
which used to be such an invasive menace for farmers in East Anglia until
the grain barons sprayed it. For Pounds 6.25, you can buy enough of a piece
to run wild through a shaded flowerbed and give you stupendous growth on
your investment if only you can find a Londoner who is willing to go over
the top for too much of it.
Christmas shopping is supposed to be bad for the nerves and even worse for
the feet. Gardeners, I suggest, could enjoy a day's comparison from one shop
to the next. We may be peasants underneath, but the impulse index livens up
life even for country mice in towns.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Joust one of those things - Clive
Fewins meets a Black Knight who has fought back from reverses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nineteen years ago, Trooper Anthony Edwards was a Queen's Life Guard when,
aged 22, he fell from a horse and broke his back. Since then, he has broken
his pelvis, too; that kept him out of the saddle for 18 months.
Now, though, he rides again - with the Quorn Hunt - and doubles up each
summer as the Black Knight, staging 'authentic jousting as seen in the 12th
century' and leading a 16-strong troupe of knights, squires, men-at-arms,
assorted jesters, minstrels, falconers, fire-eaters, acrobats, dancers and
story-tellers.
He also owns a restaurant, Squires, which he opened this spring near the
village of Burton-on-the-Wolds, a few miles from Melton Mowbray in
Leicestershire. Squires, which is a partnership with Trevor Eggleston - a
farmer who is Edwards' landlord, old friend and chief backer - is a means of
keeping Black Knight Medieval Entertainments solvent.
The jousts just about break even for the five months a year they operate
with the help of much sweat, many tears, occasional (real) blood and a
Pounds 9,000 overdraft from a sympathetic Leicester bank manager. 'It is too
soon to say if the restaurant will be a success,' said Edwards. 'But the
building was a ruin when Trevor and I got cracking on it last October.
'Trevor paid for all the conversion work, which we did together, and the
building is now worth Pounds 50,000. If the venture should fail, Trevor will
hold all the equity, minus what he pays me for my labours at the conversion
stage.'
So far, the signs are good. Squires operates in the evenings from Wednesdays
to Saturdays and at lunchtime on Sundays, and the 38 covers are increasingly
full. Edwards does the cooking, aided by a commis chef. His wife, Amanda, is
in charge front of house, assisted by several part-time staff.
'When I took on a pub near here in 1974, it was taking in Pounds 200 a week.
Twelve years later, when I left, we were turning over Pounds 250,000 a year
and Pounds 1,000 on a good night in the restaurant we had created,' Edwards
said.
Squires is already beginning to supplement the Edwards' family fortunes,
which were at a low ebb in October 1992 when debts were rising at an
alarming rate. 'Black Knight had been going eight years - I had been running
it in parallel with the successful pub business,' Edwards said. 'But we had
lost Pounds 27,000 on a property and large piece of land near Marbella in
southern Spain that we had unsuccessfully tried to buy as the location for
the first Squires restaurant.
'Under the Spanish trespasso (lease) system, if you can't raise all the
money,you forfeit the money you originally put down. In our case, we were
just Pounds 6,000 short of the Pounds 33,000 needed to buy a plot that made
Pounds 6.35m when it was next sold.'
So when, in 1992, the chance to team up with Eggleston presented itself,
Edwards saw it as the ideal way to restore his fortunes and keep the Black
Knight on his charger. 'The boys would be devastated if Black Knight were to
close down,' Edwards said. 'They are all as fanatical about jousting as me.
Like me, many of them have been enthusiasts since their youth.'
'The boys,' 23 of them, include day-time storemen, carpenters, car
mechanics, a stone mason and several students. All unpaid volunteers, they
gladly pay their own insurance and are the core from which the 16-strong
troupe is chosen when, nearly every weekend in the summer months, the Black
Knight takes to the road.
The troupe owns six horses and a 1976 Scania bus bought from Leicester city
council. The bus transports and sleeps the horses, the performers and two
grooms as they travel around Britain.
The company gives two carefully-choreographed jousting performances which
last 30 minutes and 40 minutes, Black Knight charges Pounds 2,000 for the
total 70-minute show. Every move is rehearsed meticulously.
In a good year, the troupe will do 25 shows, grossing around Pounds 50,000.
Although Edwards aims at 20 per cent profit after paying the expenses of his
volunteers and other costly items such as the upkeep of the horses, he
rarely reaches this figure.
'In 1986, when I gave up the pub, I was earning Pounds 30,000 a year,' he
said. 'But we sold our large house with five bedrooms and three bathrooms to
finance the Spanish venture so, since then, life has been very
hand-to-mouth.'
Edwards' fertile mind has alighted, however, on another grand strategy to
raise capital and run in parallel with both Squires and The Black Knight.
Next spring, he will launch the Black Knight Medieval Banqueting and
Jousting Roadshow.
This is an attempt to move the Black Knight show indoors so that it is
available to both corporate and private clients throughout the year. Edwards
has an interest-free, hire purchase arrangement with the manufacturers for a
200 ft by 50 ft tented pavilion to house the mobile medieval experience. The
tent costs Pounds 65,000 but Edwards will pay for it over two years. He has
had to pay only Pounds 6,500 so far.
The indoor shows will feature a display of skills including quintaining
(tilting at a target post), carouseling (picking up hoops with a lance) and
pig sticking, as well as jousting and much hand-to-hand fighting with
broadswords, double-handed swords, axes, balls and chains and staffs. The
rest of the evening will be taken up with a banquet and music, probably of a
more modern kind.
'This has the potential of being a Pounds 1m business,' Edwards said. 'The
full capacity of the tented structure is 325 and the cost is Pounds 35 a
head. I reckon we need 30 shows a year to break even, but we have the
capacity to do three shows a week for a 44-week season; that is, 132 shows a
year. That's a turnover of more than Pounds 1.5m a year. I am aiming at 30
per cent profit - that is half a million pounds a year.'
Edwards has written to 200 companies seeking sponsorship for the venture, to
the tune of Pounds 35,000. 'So far, 30 have refused, but we still have 170
to go,' he said.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Escaping the annuity trap - As rates
fall, William Burrows suggests ways to achieve better returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BURROWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Budget seems to have satisfied the markets that public spending and
inflation are under control. As a result, the gilts market has rallied and,
consequently, yields have dropped again. This has triggered more falls in
annuity rates; five companies cut theirs last week.
With these rates at their lowest for more than 20 years, some advisers are
arguing that conventional annuities are providing bad value for money
because those holding them are being locked into a low-yielding investment
from which there is no escape.
It is, however, now possible to escape from the annuity straitjacket by
considering some other types of annuity. These include with-profits and
unit-linked annuities, and self-invested annuities. The main advantage of
these options is that those who have annuities are not locked into a
low-yielding investment for life but can benefit from future investment
returns.
The chart shows how annuity rates have fallen by nearly 25 per cent since
1990. Rates move in parallel to medium-dated gilt yields and, if interest
rates fall, so will annuity rates (but not by the same degree).
The timing of an annuity purchase is probably the most important factor when
trying to maximise pension income. But correct timing is affected by three
variables: annuity rates increase with age; they rise and fall with
investment yields; and the accumulated pension fund depends on prevailing
unit prices.
Many people are delaying buying an annuity because they expect rates to rise
in the future. But they may be failing to take into account the real cost of
the lost income.
For example, a male of 65 with a pension fund of Pounds 100,000 can get
Pounds 11,120 a year. If he decided to buy an annuity at 66, then, if the
fund grew by 6 per cent and rates stayed the same, he would receive Pounds
12,050, an increase of Pounds 930. But he would have lost out on that year's
income of Pounds 11,120.
Clearly, there is an opportunity cost in delaying the purchase of an
annuity, and this is difficult to calculate. With annuities which are linked
to investment funds, it does not matter if annuity rates are low because the
starting income need not be calculated with reference to present gilt
yields.
The annual pension with a with-profits annuity is calculated by referring to
the performance of the underlying with-profits fund. As bonuses are awarded
only once each year, an anticipated bonus level is selected at the start.
If, for example, an 8 per cent bonus (at present, the highest allowed) was
selected, the starting income would be about the same as a guaranteed
annuity - but would increase by 2 per cent if a 10 per cent bonus was
declared. If the bonus was only 6 per cent, then the income would fall by 2
per cent.
There is a danger that with-profits annuities can fall if future bonuses are
lower than expected. But as the starting annuity is calculated without
reference to gilt yields, they appear good value when annuity rates are low
and, consequently, are not so attractive when rates are high. Only
Prudential (which has a minimum purchase price of Pounds 100,000) and
Equitable Life offer with-profits annuity contracts.
Unit-linked annuities work in a simpler way but units are cashed to provide
the pension payments. These are a much riskier investment and not many
policies are sold.
Self-invested annuities are a revolutionary idea. Say Pounds 100,000 was
invested and 25 per cent taken as tax-free cash. The balance would be
invested in one or more unit-linked or with-profits pension funds.
A level of income is selected which is somewhere between a minimum of 5 per
cent and the maximum. If, say, 8 per cent is chosen, then the relevant
number of units are cashed each time a payment is made. If the fund grows by
10 per cent a year, the pension fund will grow by 2 per cent (ignoring
charges); but if the fund grew by only 6 per cent, then the fund would
reduce in size.
The level of income can be reviewed each year and the investments switched
between funds. Part or all of the fund can be converted into a conventional
annuity at any time.
One very important aspect is that the managed annuity should continue to be
paid to dependants after the holder dies. Unlike conventional annuities,
spouse's pensions do not have to be bought at the outset. At present, this
contract is offered only by Equitable Life, which calls it the managed
annuity, but other companies are designing similar contracts.
Managed annuities are available only for personal or self-employed pensions.
It might be possible to transfer the pension from a company-sponsored scheme
to a personal plan, but professional advice must be sought.
In deciding which annuity is best for any given set of circumstances, there
are three important considerations:
Value for money. Many people feel that guaranteed annuities give poor value
for money and the other options provide better returns.
Peace of mind and security. This means different things to different people
but some will prefer a guaranteed annuity, where the benefits are known in
advance, to a pension that depends on the stock market. Investment-linked
pensions are not suitable for people who require a guaranteed income or do
not want to take risks.
Flexibility. There is a tendency to view the need for retirement income as
being static, but many people can look forward to receiving lump sums from
insurance plans, inheritances or investments. With managed annuities,
pension income can be tailored to meet specific requirements.
Now that there is more choice, it is important to take professional advice
about your retirement options. You do not need to be a victim of low rates,
but better returns come only with greater risk.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Where accountants can meet Sonic
 -David Carter discovers a bargain PC which is ideal for small business
users and their children / Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earlier this year, Amstrad introduced the Mega PC, designed for small
business users who want to do their accounts and correspondence at home and
relax during the evenings by playing a computer game or two. The advertising
trumpets it as ' . . . the best of both worlds, a fully featured
IBM-compatible PC and a Sega Megadrive-compatible console - all in one
superbly engineered unit'.
Sales were slow, but the price has been reduced from Pounds 999, first to
Pounds 699, then recently down to Pounds 426 plus VAT.
My eight-year old son gave the thumbs up to the Sega Megadrive, but I was
mainly interested in business applications. For some time now I have been
looking for a cheap demonstration machine which I can take round to
prospective customers. With a 386SX, 25 MHz processor, one megabyte of RAM
and a 40 megabyte disk, the Mega PC makes an ideal small business computer.
The great attraction of the Mega PC is the price. I looked through the PC
magazines but could not find anything near Pounds 426. There are one or two
PCs at Pounds 699 plus VAT, but most are at least double the Mega's price.
I rang my local Ryman's Computer Store and asked if they stocked the Mega
PC: 'No sir, it's not powerful enough for a business machine. It's only
suitable for games.' Dixon's told me the Mega PC was not available at all
stores but they would be able to get hold of one for me. If they could not,
what was their cheapest off-the-shelf machine? A PC with 486SX/25 MHz chip,
100 megabytes of disk, and four megabytes of RAM at Pounds 940: nearly twice
the price of the Amstrad.
The PC magazines give the impression that the minimum configuration for a PC
these days is a 486SX/25 MHz processor, four megabytes of RAM, and a 100
megabyte disk drive. This is tosh. I have plenty of customers running their
businesses quite happily on a PC with a 286 processor and a 20 megabyte
disk.
So what's going on? The answer lies in one word: Windows.
My customers running their businesses on a 286 are working under the DOS
operating system. Windows - the 'Graphical User Interface' which Microsoft
has added on to DOS - demands an enormous amount of machine power. So, while
a 286 processor under simple DOS will give you instant response, to get the
same speed with Windows, you need a vastly more powerful, and hence more
expensive machine, such as a 486SX.
Obviously, it is in the interest of manufacturers and retailers to persuade
the public that they must have leading-edge technology running under Windows
and a load of powerful and expensive machinery to run it. But the simple
fact is that they do not.
The key benefit of Windows is in producing on-screen design work. If you
produce reports which need to look good and to impress, or you need to
produce complex documents which combine text, graphs and illustrations,
Windows is great. But if you simply want to produce one-page business
letters or to run your accounts, the two principal reasons for which small
businesses buy computers, Windows is unnecessary.
Indeed the tendency of Windows' to short-circuit (in the jargon, to 'crash')
makes it an unsuitable platform to run a 'mission-critical' application such
as accounting. If your machine crashes at the wrong time you may corrupt the
entire accounting database. For this reason Windows has made negligible
inroads into the accounting marketplace (a recent survey by consultants Tate
Bramald and the Institute of Certified Accountants found fewer than 1 per
cent of companies use a Windows package to run their accounts).
The basic Mega PC comes with the DOS operating system, but you will need to
buy a software package or two to run on it. TAS Books (Pounds 99 from
Megatech, 081-874-6511) is a good accounts package, or for the
non-accountant there is Quicken for DOS (Pounds 42.51 from Intuit
0800-585058).
I would also go for a cheap 'integrated' package combining word processor,
spreadsheet and database. The best, and the one I give my customers, is
Microsoft Works Version 3 for DOS (mail order price about Pounds 89.95 from
Computers by Post, 081-760-0014). But Works presupposes considerable prior
knowledge of computer concepts. PFS First Choice is less sophisticated and
therefore easier to learn (Pounds 76.50 with PFS First Publisher from Best
Buys 0800-317307). Prices exclude postage and VAT .
You may have to shop around for an Amstrad Mega PC. It is available from
retail chains such as Tandy, Comet, Tempo, and some branches of Dixons.
Alternatively try mail order suppliers such as P &amp; P (071-265-4570) or
Evesham Micros (0386-765500).

FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Budget turns CGT into a minefield -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu plots a watchful path through the maze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors calculating their capital gains tax bills since the Budget change
need to be both intrepid and patient since they face formidable
calculations.
The withdrawal of indexation to increase or create losses took effect from
the beginning of Budget day and some readers have asked how to deal with
'pooled' shares - those in the same company bought at different dates.
CGT is complicated partly because the legislation has evolved piecemeal. The
tax was introduced in 1965 but indexation was not implemented - initially,
in a limited way - until April 6 1982 and was extended to losses by
chancellor Nigel Lawson in 1985.
With 1982 as the dividing line, shares bought after April 5 that year are
lumped together in one category while those bought in previous tax years are
treated separately.
If you bought several lots of shares in the same company after April 5 1982,
the cost of each share for CGT purposes is the average cost of acquiring the
shares in the pool (except shares sold within 10 days of acquisition).
The cost of shares bought before 1982 is put at their market value on March
31 1982, if you have elected to ignore the original cost of all assets held
on that day.
You have a separate pool for each company and for each class of share. You
must keep tally of the actual spending and indexed spending of your pool
each time there is a sale or purchase. The indexation allowance is then the
difference between the indexed spending and the actual unindexed spending.
What is the effect of the Budget change on the calculations? The following
examples are provided by chartered accountant Touche Ross.
Pooled shares bought
after April 5 1982
Suppose you bought 1,000 shares in April 1982 (after April 5) for Pounds
2,000 and another 1,000 in the same company in September 1991 for Pounds
7,000. You sold 1,000 shares on November 29 for Pounds 4,000 and the
remaining 1,000 shares on Budget day for Pounds 4,000 as well. You have made
an overall (unindexed) loss of Pounds 1,000, since you paid a total of
Pounds 9,000 for the shares but sold them for Pounds 8,000.
Using the indexation factors released by the Inland Revenue, and published
each month in the Weekend FT, the indexed cost of the April 1982 batch of
shares, up to the purchase of the second batch, is Pounds 3,322 (Pounds
2,000 x 1.661 - the indexation factor from April 1982 to September 1991).
Add to this the spending on the second batch to get Pounds 10,322.
You sold shares on November 29. The new indexed cost is Pounds 10,870
(Pounds 10,332 x 1.053 - the indexation factor from September 1991 to
October 1993, the last month for which figures are available). Since half
the shares were sold on November 29, the indexed cost of the 1,000 shares
sold on that day is half the total indexed cost, namely Pounds 5,435 (Pounds
10,870 / 2). The proceeds from the sale were Pounds 4,000, leaving you with
an allowable loss of Pounds 1,435 (Pounds 5,435-Pounds 4,000).
The situation for the shares sold on Budget day is very different. The
proceeds must be deducted from the unindexed cost of Pounds 4,500 (half the
Pounds 9,000 for which the two batches of shares were bought), leaving you
with an allowable loss of only Pounds 500.
If you had sold all the shares on November 29, your allowable loss would
have been Pounds 2,870, instead of Pounds 1,935 as a result of postponing
the sale of half of them until Budget day.
Pooled shares bought both
before and after 1982
Suppose you held 1,000 shares on April 5 1982 with a March 31 1982 value of
Pounds 2,000. You bought another 1,000 shares in the same company in June
1986 for Pounds 7,000 and you sold the whole lot for Pounds 8,000 last
month.
If you sold them before Budget day, your allowable loss is Pounds 5,720.
This is arrived at by multiplying the price paid for the shares by the
relevant indexation factors to obtain the indexed cost of the shares. The
indexed March 31 1982 value of the first 1,000 shares is Pounds 3,570
(Pounds 2,000 x 1.785). The indexed cost of the second 1,000 shares is
Pounds 10,150 (Pounds 7,000 x 1.450).
The proceeds of Pounds 8,000 must be subtracted from the sum of these two
indexed costs, leaving you with an allowable loss of Pounds 5,720 (Pounds
13,720-Pounds 8,000). If, however, you sold the shares on Budget day, your
allowable loss would be much less.
The deemed cost of the March 31 1982 shares is still indexed to Pounds 3,570
(because that is less than the Pounds 4,000 proceeds); but the second 1,000
shares, which you bought for Pounds 7,000, cannot be indexed since that is
more than the Pounds 4,000 proceeds. Adding the two figures together and
subtracting the total proceeds of Pounds 8,000 leaves you with an allowable
loss of only Pounds 2,570 (Pounds 10,570 - Pounds 8,000).

FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Lenders lower rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the Budget out of the way, most lenders felt safe emerging from purdah
this week, after the half percentage point cut on November 23, to announce
changes to their mortgage and savings rates.
Halifax, the largest lender, said on Tuesday that it was reducing its
standard variable mortgage rate for new borrowers, by 0.35 of a point to
7.64 per cent, its lowest for 25 years. The new rate comes into effect for
existing borrowers from January 1. The reduction means a drop in payments of
Pounds 11.75 a month for a Pounds 60,000 repayment mortgage.
The new mortgage rate undercut Nationwide, National &amp; Provincial, National
Westminster and Lloyds banks which had all lowered their rates by 0.25 of a
point to 7.74 per cent soon after the base rate reduction.
N &amp; P subsequently reduced its rate to match Halifax. There are now two main
mortgage rate camps: those following Halifax with a standard variable rate
of 7.64 per cent which include Alliance &amp; Leicester, Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester, TSB, N &amp; P and Derbyshire, and those following Nationwide with
7.74 per cent. These are Abbey National, Leeds Permanent, Lloyds, NatWest
and Midland Bank.
Savers dependent on deposits face a further erosion in income. Institutions
are following their usual policy of making their savers feel the pain of
falling interest rates well before their borrowers who have to wait, for the
most part, until January before they benefit from the drop in mortgage
rates. Moreover, savings rates are cut more deeply than mortgage rates.
Royal Bank of Scotland, for example, is passing on the full 0.5 point
reduction to borrowers, taking its mortgage rate to 7.49 per cent but it has
also reduced interest on Royal Reward, its 90-day bonus account, by up to
0.9 of a percentage point off the gross rate on most bands. Someone in the
Pounds 10,000-Pounds 24,999 band receives 4.3 per cent gross (with a 2 per
cent bonus if no withdrawals are made in a year).
Leeds Permanent has reduced gross rates on its Liquid Gold instant access
account and Solid Gold, three month notice account by a more modest 0.35 of
a point across most bands. The gross rate on a deposit in Liquid Gold
between Pounds 10,000-Pounds 24,999 is 4.7 gross (3.53 net). It is 5.4 per
cent gross (4.05 net) in the same band in the Solid Gold account.
Britannia building society has cut its mortgage rate from 7.99 per cent to
7.75 per cent and reduced savings rates mostly by 0.5 of a percentage point.
Alliance &amp; Leicester has reduced its Bonus 90 savings account by between
0.25 and 0.4 of a point while Nationwide has cut most of its savings rates
by 0.5 of a point. C &amp; G's London Share postal account now pays 6.05 per
cent gross (4.54 net), down from 6.25 gross and C &amp; G has also cut almost
all its other savings accounts.
Lower interest rates have spawned a batch of fixed mortgage rates (all have
early redemption penalties). NatWest's new rates are 6.25 per cent until
January 31 1996, 7.25 per cent to January 31 1999 and 7.95 per cent to
January 31 2004. The arrangement fee is Pounds 250 and there are no
insurance tie-ins.
Nationwide's new five-year fix is at 7.25 per cent. The valuation is free
and the fee of Pounds 250 is refundable on completion. C &amp; G's five-year fix
at 6.99 per cent, launched last month, is still available for an application
fee of Pounds 250. TSB is offering a capped rate of 7.25 per cent until
February 28 1999 in addition to its existing cap of 6.75 per cent until
February 28 1997. Arrangement fees are Pounds 250 and Pounds 195
respectively. The society's buildings and contents insurance has to be taken
out.
Alliance &amp; Leicester's new range is from 5.45 per cent on a one year fix to
7.4 per cent for five years. The arrangement fee is 0.5 per cent of the loan
up to a maximum of Pounds 300 and borrowers must take out buildings and
contents insurance through the society.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Skiing into trouble - Insurance is a
must on snow holidays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Skiing holidays can do strange things to your perception of risk. Normally
cautious and unsporty types launch themselves down steep, icy slopes towards
cliff edges and pine trees without blinking an eye. Some even watch fanatics
jumping off mountain tops with parachutes and think: 'I could do that.' A
few, feeling their youth slipping away, may try to play teenagers on
snowboards at their own game.
If you are tempted to such recklessness, but then find yourself hurtling out
of control towards a group of American lawyers, it might not be much comfort
at the time to know that you have Pounds 1m worth of medical cover and
another Pounds 1m personal liability. Later, you could be profoundly
relieved.
Insurance is essential for skiing trips, but make sure you know what you are
covered for. Snowboarding is acceptable to most insurers, but many of them
baulk at the idea of parapente - parachuting from mountaintops. Heli-skiing
is equally unpopular.
Off-piste skiing is a tricky point. A few feet the wrong side of the piste
marker is one thing, but swooping across an avalanche-prone slope on the
wrong side of the mountain is quite something else. Most of the specialists
cover off-piste automatically but tour operators' own travel insurance,
besides being more expensive, tends to have more exclusions.
Drinking and skiing can be as dangerous as drinking and driving, although it
remains more socially acceptable (at least in Europe). If you have an
accident after several gluhweins too many, most insurance companies could
theoretically refuse to pay up, citing clauses which oblige skiers to take
'reasonable care.' But since mountain rescue teams do not usually carry
breath analysers, claims are unlikely to be challenged.
Last year, specialist insurer Douglas Cox Tyrie took the controversial step
of excluding theft of skis while unattended and unsecured. Thousands of
pairs of skis are left propped outside mountain restaurants every day, but
this clause meant you could not claim if yours were stolen. Other insurers
refused to take the same view, however, and cover for unattended skis is now
back.
The most important elements of ski insurance are medical expenses and
personal liability cover. After that, you might want cover for general
baggage and ski equipment, plus cancellation, curtailment and delay. Then
there is piste closure or no-snow cover, which pays out if your skiing
holiday turns into a mud-sliding one.
Some policies cover only the absolute essentials: Douglas Cox Tyrie's 'mini
ski' policy is just for medical expenses, personal liability and personal
accident insurance. This is aimed at people whose luggage is protected under
home contents insurance and who can do without cancellation and no-snow
cover.
Fogg Travel also has a basic medical and liability-only package, called
Medicard. The selling point is that, as the name suggests, the insurance
comes with a card recognised as proof of insurance by mountain rescue
services and hospitals in most European and some American resorts.
Thus, those unlucky enough to need assistance do not have to hand over their
credit card first (or have their skis ripped off their feet as security).
Medicard costs Pounds 16 for up to 17 days in Europe, and Pounds 35 for the
rest of the world.
If you go skiing more than once a season, you might be interested in DCT's
Flexiski package. This covers you for the whole season and any number of
trips, although none of them can be for longer than 28 days. The policy
costs Pounds 45 for the mini-ski cover and Pounds 85 for comprehensive
protection.
Some people seem still to believe - dangerously - that paying for their
holiday by credit card and carrying a form E111 is all they need for
insurance. But this is not the case unless yours is one of the few gold
cards which does provide full annual travel insurance.
The E111, which entitles British citizens to reciprocal medical care in the
EC and some other countries, makes it cheaper to consult state doctors - but
it does not run to mountain rescue services or private clinics. Even when
the E111 can be used, you might have to pay cash at the time and reclaim it
when you get home.
The table gives an idea of comparative prices, but details of cover vary and
it is important to check relevant points before choosing a policy.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A daughter's greedy friend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife and I have drawn up reciprocal wills under which all our estate on
the death of one of us will go entirely to the survivor and, in the event of
the latter's death, the remainder will be divided equally between our
spinster daughter and our married son.
However, a problem has arisen in that our daughter is living with a woman
partner whose domination and cupidity lead me to think that she will share
in any legacy bestowed on our daughter. I have no wish that this woman
should benefit under my own will.
Without necessarily obliging my wife to follow suit, I would like advice on
how to make sure that the part of our joint estate which goes to our
daughter does not pass under the control of her lesbian friend.
The estate is to be administered by our solicitors, acting as trustees.
At present, your children would receive the estate absolutely on the death
of the survivor of yourself and your wife. This could enable your daughter's
friend to enjoy the property.
It might be more appropriate for you to draw up a will trust so that, on the
death of the survivor, the income is payable to your daughter but she has no
entitlement to the capital other than at the discretion of the trustees.
It is, of course, crucial that the trustees are chosen carefully, and you
might wish to leave a side letter instructing them how they are to act.
In this event, the income would be your daughter's as of right and her
friend could enjoy part of it - but not the capital.
If, however, your daughter made an adequate case to receive an element of
the capital within the trust, then the trustees could be happy to advance
capital if they were satisfied that her friend would not enjoy that capital
at the same time.
An alternative form of trust which could be even more appropriate is a
discretionary one, under which payments of income or capital could be made
to your daughter only at the discretion of the trustees without her having
any entitlement to payment as of right.
In any case, I suggest that both of you take legal advice on re-drafting
your wills.
This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new management at Trafalgar House is expected to undertake a thorough
house-cleaning operation - including further extensive asset write-downs and
provisions - when the troubled conglomerate reports its full-year results on
Tuesday.
The group took Pounds 120m of provisions to cover restructuring and property
write-downs at the interim stage, and a further Pounds 100m to Pounds 150m
of provisions are expected to be announced. Although the group is expected
to post a small underlying annual profit, the provisions are likely to
result in full-year pre-tax losses of up to Pounds 250m compared with losses
of Pounds 30.3m the previous year. The company has already forecast a
full-year dividend of 3.25p, down from 6p a year earlier.
Asda, the UK's fourth-biggest grocery superstore group, is expected on
Friday to announce an increase in interim pre-tax profits to between Pounds
75m and Pounds 85m. The substantial increase from last year's
pre-exceptional figure of Pounds 46m suggests Asda's recovery is still on
course. But analysts will be keen to hear more details of how last week's
sale of the Allied carpet business to Carpetland will benefit Asda's cost
structure. Exceptional costs of Pounds 70m, and a goodwill write-off of
Pounds 53.3m associated with the Allied sale, will be taken in the full-year
figures and not in the first half.
The Daily Mail and General Trust is expected on Wednesday to publish pre-tax
profits for the year of about Pounds 73m, excluding exceptional items. This
represents good progress compared with last year's profits of Pounds 59m on
a similar basis, and indicates an improving environment for display
advertising. But analysts will be looking particularly at the costs of
recent supplement launches and the company's strategy for the electronic
media.
Greene King, the East Anglia-based brewer, is expected to report first-half
pre-tax profits 11 per cent ahead at Pounds 10.5m on Monday. Beer volumes
are likely to have fallen, but by less than the 3 per cent market decline.
An improvement is forecast in bad debt provisions, and a substantial
increase in food sales will have contributed to a good performance by the
company's managed pubs.
A 7 per cent increase in full-year results is forecast from Vaux Group on
Tuesday, with pre-tax profits, before property and exceptionals, of about
Pounds 26.5m. Brewing and pub operations will be boosted by acquisitions,
although like-for-like beer volumes will be lower. A continued recovery can
be expected from the group's hotels on the back of higher occupancy rates.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sponsors of business expansion schemes are speaking already of only 19 BES
shopping days to go before the scheme ends on December 31. But the shopping
list includes a number of new items.
One is BESSA Portman, sponsored by Close Brothers. This will buy up mainly
properties repossessed by the Portman building society, to be let on assured
tenancies.
The cash-backed fixed rate return is 121p after five years for every 100p
invested, equivalent to an annual return of 14.8 per cent to higher-rate
taxpayers.
Alternatively, investors can choose a fixed return of 80p a share plus 1p
for every 1 per cent rise in interest rates (3 month Libor) each quarter,
above a minimum of 5.5 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
Chiltern Homes III is another scheme sponsored by Downing Corporate Finance
to raise Pounds 3m for the Chiltern Hundreds Housing Association. This is
aimed at providing homes at affordable rents to families on low incomes, and
disabled people.
The fixed return of 128p is cash-backed and equates to an annual return of
14.2 per cent to a higher-rate taxpayer since BES 3 certificates, enabling
investors to obtain tax relief, are not expected until May.
Best BES Advice, an industry analyst, recommends this issue as 'a good value
housing association.' The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
Hodgson Martin has launched the Final Oxford Colleges Company, a 10-year BES
with cash backing for student accommodation at St Hugh's and St Catherine's
colleges.
The exit price is 160p, equating to 10 per cent a year for a higher-rate
taxpayer. After five years, investors have the option of accepting an annual
buy-back offer by the colleges. Minimum investment: Pounds 2,000.
Johnson Fry has launched a range of contracted exit schemes. Bradford &amp;
Bingley has an exit price of 118p (equating to an annual return of 14.1 per
cent to a higher-rate taxpayer) while University of Exeter's exit price is
120p (14.27 per cent per annum).
The exit price on Mortgage Express is 121.2p (14.64 per cent a year) and
University of Anglia has a fixed exit price of 125p (14.7 per cent a year),
but it has no cash or bank backing. Minimum investment in any of the schemes
is Pounds 3,000.
Matrix Securities. meanwhile, has increased - from 125p to 128.5p - the exit
price on its Homes for the Needy for two housing associations.
As ever, potential investors should take professional advice before placing
money in any of the 45 arranged exit schemes, 25 assured tenancy schemes and
at least 26 trading companies now on the market.

transactions

Directors have been doing a great deal more buying than selling, as
reflected in our table this week. JD Wetherspoon is one of the new breed of
pub chain. The company has grown rapidly on the back of a formula which,
among other things, eschews juke boxes.
Timothy Randall the chairman, managing director and founder, has sold
350,000 shares at 330p. They came to market only in October last year but
have outperformed the market since then by almost 70 per cent. Earnings are
forecast to rise by over 20 per cent in the year to July 1994, which would
bring the price/earnings ratio down to below 20.
Desmond Graves, a non-executive director of George Wimpey, has sold a total
of 800,000 shares at prices between 183p and 186p. Construction companies
have been on the mend for the past 12 months, and interim results announced
in September showed Wimpey had returned to the black after reporting interim
losses last time round of almost Pounds 25m. The shares have outperformed
the market by 54 per cent over the past year.
The headline-hitting share purchase of the week was that of Peter Wood at
Royal Bank of Scotland. He bought 1.85m shares at prices between 402p and
412p, taking his holding to almost 2.5m. Wood is responsible for the bank's
Direct Line Insurance arm and profits from that have increased by leaps and
bounds over the past year.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Losers to get compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors who lost money because of unauthorised investment in property by
the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire friendly society must be compensated, the High
Court ruled this week.
The 39,000 policyholders had put money in the society's Capital Secure fund,
believing it was safely invested in cash deposits and gilts. In fact, the
fund invested Pounds 6.8m in a hotel development near Rotherham late in the
1980s. The hotel is now valued at about Pounds 2m and is up for sale.
Another 7,000 policyholders, who were expecting a decision on whether their
lump sum policies qualified for tax-exempt status, will have to wait pending
renewed talks between the society and the Inland Revenue. To qualify for tax
exemption, the policy normally must be funded by regular premiums.
Those eligible for compensation still face a long wait. John Ramsden, who
became chairman of L&amp;Y in 1990 after the hotel was bought, said he hoped
that if the society was able to sell the hotel and get tax exemption for the
disputed policies, it would be able to pay out the compensation by May or
June.
Anticipating the court ruling, L&amp;Y imposed a 12 per cent levy on
policyholders in August for a compensation fund. The amount raised is Pounds
10.1m but the society estimates its maximum liability at Pounds 8.3m, a
figure which includes the 7,000 lump sum policyholders; the compensation
bill could be reduced if the policies finally are deemed tax-exempt.
Surplus money from the compensation fund will be returned to members' funds
although, in a recent letter to them, Ramsden warned that those who leave
the society will not be eligible to receive it. He advised those whose
policies are due to mature to leave their money with L&amp;Y until compensation
is paid and it is clear how much can be returned.
Ramsden added: 'The society's policyholders have a right to be annoyed at
the past but we are doing all we can to put things right.' He is considering
legal action against L&amp;Y's advisers as well as committee members when the
decision to invest in property was taken.
It is hard to quantify the loss to policyholders until the society sells the
hotel. When it has, compensation to those in the Capital Secure fund will be
based on the difference between their policy value and what the fund should
have been worth if the money had been left to grow at commercial rates of
interest.
Ramsden said he very much regretted that some members 'will be worse off as
a result of the matters which led to the court proceedings.' These are
policyholders who have had to pay the levy but are not eligible to
compensation.
Members will vote on the future of the society at its annual general meeting
in the spring.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Car wars spread to cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good news this week for high-spending Barclaycard customers who buy a new
Ford Escort every three years, writes Bethan Hutton. If you spend Pounds
12,000 a year on your Barclaycard, after three years you could save Pounds
1,800 on the price of a new Ford car or van.
Ford is adding to the colourful array of credit cards already on offer to UK
consumers with the launch of its own-brand credit card, in a joint venture
with Barclaycard. The card will be available from April, as Visa or
Mastercard, and will have the same interest rates and benefits as a standard
Barclaycard except that the Pounds 10 annual fee will be waived for the
first year.
Every Pounds 10 spent with the card earns one point worth 50p, which can
build up towards a rebate when you buy a Ford. You can accumulate up to
Pounds 600 worth of rebate points a year to a total of Pounds 1,800 over
three years. The minimum rebate is Pounds 100, earned by spending Pounds
2,000.
As an added incentive, new customers can transfer balances from other credit
cards and get 5 per cent knocked off the debt. So, if you owe Pounds 1,000
on one credit card and transfer it to the Ford Barclaycard, you would end up
owing Pounds 950.
You do not even need a Ford-branded card to benefit from the rebate scheme -
all Barclaycard's 8m customers are eligible. About 3m of them are registered
already with the Profiles scheme, where every Pounds 10 earns you one point
to be spent on gifts or short breaks from a catalogue (although the cheapest
items are 190 points, which means that Pounds 1,900 of spending entitles you
to a screwdriver set or a family day out at Kew Gardens).
Now, the same points can also be used to get a discount on Ford cars. So, if
you have saved up Profile points already, you could get a discount from
January.
Ford's main UK rival, Vauxhall, launched a credit card in October. The GM
Card, named after Vauxhall's American parent company General Motors, is also
available as Visa or Mastercard and accumulates points towards a new
Vauxhall car in a similar way, to a maximum of Pounds 500 a year and Pounds
2,500 over five years.
But the GM card charges no annual fee and its interest rates are lower - at
1.53 per cent a month (APR 19.9) compared with Barclaycard's 1.585 (APR
21.9).

FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: More ups than downs - Philip Coggan
looks at the leaders and laggards of 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a good year to be invested in equities. Strong signs of a UK
recovery, low interest rates and low inflation have combined to make
investors switch out of cash and into shares and bonds. The London stock
market is hovering around its all-time high.
The FT-SE 100 Index has risen 14.9 per cent this year; the FT-A All-Share
Index was up 17.8 per cent. Throw in 3-4 per cent for dividend yield and
investors have enjoyed a gross return of more than 20 per cent. With
deposits paying 6 per cent for most of the year, small wonder that private
investors have been buying unit trusts in record numbers.
As usual, the annual list of leaders and laggards shows that not all
investors will have been lucky. The table of worst-performing Footsie
stocks, for example, includes many companies which investors would normally
consider 'safe'; food retailers such as Argyll, Sainsbury and Tesco, growth
stocks such as Wellcome.
In part, this is a cyclical shift. During the recession, investors
concentrated on defensive stocks. They bought supermarket shares because
consumers would always eat food; they bought drugs stocks because people
would always get sick. Wellcome and Glaxo were the best performing shares of
1991.
Now that the recession seems to be over, investors have moved into the
so-called cyclical stocks, which stand to gain most from recovery. Hence the
appearance of British Aerospace and British Steel, two 1991 laggards, at the
top of this year's leaders list.
But the reasons are not all cyclical. The food retailers are suffering
because of fears that they over-expanded in the 1980s by opening too many
superstores. Competition may force down their margins.
The food retailing sector is the worst performing of all the FT-Actuaries
sectors this year. Worst hit was Argyll which warned that its profits would
be reduced by about Pounds 40m because of its decision to start depreciating
its store values.
In the Footsie leaders list, bank and property shares are dominant. Both
sectors suffered in the recession. Banks now appear to be benefiting from
the effect of lower interest rates on their bad debt problems, buoyant
securities markets and improvements in management.
Property shares have rebounded since Black Wednesday and apart from gold
mines (unrepresented in the Footsie), property is the best performing sector
this year. Lower interest rates have encouraged hopes of a recovery in the
property market and increase the attractions of high-yielding property
shares.
The smaller company lists are their normal eccentric selves. The best
performing share of all, Aminex, is an Irish oil exploration company which
attracted the attention of the Russians, with the state-owned oil group
Zarubezhneftj taking an interest.
Dana Exploration, another Irish oil company in the leaders' list and one of
last year's laggards, also has oil interests in the old Soviet Union.
Property group Merivale Moore has also made the transformation from sinner
to saint this year.
Raglan Property, the worst share of all (apart from those companies which
went bust) had a massive financial restructuring which diluted the share
capital. Hartstone Group is a former 'go-go' stock; the hosiery and leather
goods company is in refinancing talks after breaching banking covenants this
summer.
The biggest casualty is Tiphook, a trailer leasing company that had a market
capitalisation of more than Pounds 600m in October 1991. Old stock market
hands get the shivers when the word 'leasing' is mentioned - bearing in mind
the fate of Sound Diffusion, Atlantic Computer et al.
They will have had their prejudices confirmed by Tiphook, where the heavily
indebted and loss-making company, was this year forced to issue a warning
that it was in danger of breaching its banking covenants. Investors are
awaiting details of the proposed Pounds 830m sale of Tiphook's container
fleet.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: The dangers of the personal pension
 -Debbie Harrison looks at what the salesmen have not been telling you
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to 400,000 people may have been affected by mis-selling of personal
pensions, according to a study commissioned by the Securities and Investment
Board, the financial regulator.
Personal pensions were designed for employees who had no pension provision,
not as an alternative to good occupational schemes. Unfortunately the large
lump sums associated with transfers from company schemes have proved a prime
target for commission-hungry salesmen.
New rules preventing further mis-selling of personal pensions are not yet in
force so it is essential to understand why you are normally better off in
your employer's scheme.
The majority of company schemes in the UK link the value of the pension to
the employee's salary at retirement. This gives scheme members a guarantee
against inflation since wages outstrip prices over the long term.
The employer, who sponsors the scheme, is under a legal obligation to
provide the promised pension even if it means topping up the pension fund.
Most schemes provide a limited inflation link for the pension itself and
'deferred' pensions - the benefits left behind by scheme members when they
change jobs. Public sector schemes offer full index linking of pensions and
also participate in the 'transfer club' which allows employees to change
jobs within the public sector and receive like-for-like benefits.
Most company schemes also provide death and disability benefits.
In spite of these attractions, many thousands of employees, including public
sector workers, have been persuaded to transfer their occupational pension
benefits to personal pensions. They have paid dearly for their ignorance.
Personal pensions do not offer the guarantees and protections available
under a good final salary scheme. The product simply builds a fund which is
used to buy an annuity which pays the retirement income. There is no
guaranteed annuity value and no recompense if poor investment returns result
in an inadequate pension. The risk is entirely with the individual.
Moreover, under a personal pension the employee foots the bill for the
expensive death and disability insurances and is likely to lose the valuable
company contributions since most employers will not pay into a personal
pension if they operate a group scheme.
The most likely time to a transfer is on change of job. If you have been a
member of the company pension scheme for more than two years you will not be
allowed to take a cash refund of contributions but will have three options:
to leave your money where it is, to take it with you to the new employer's
scheme, or to transfer it to a personal pension.
The first, and often most sensible choice, is to leave your money in the
former company's scheme as a deferred pension where it will remain until you
retire. Deferred pensions can be attractive, particularly where good annual
increases are paid. Since January 1991, schemes have been required by law to
increase the whole of the deferred pension by price inflation, up to a
maximum of 5 per cent, and some schemes are more generous.
Second, it may be appropriate to transfer your pension into the new
employer's scheme. Such transfers are complex and you will need professional
help to determine whether this provides better value. The newly redundant
should leave their pension with the previous employer until they have a new
job, so they can examine this option before looking at personal pensions.
Only when the company schemes have been examined should you consider a
transfer to a personal pensions or a buy-out bond. Buy-out bonds are similar
to personal pensions but offer limited guarantees and, in some cases, a
higher proportion of the fund can be taken as tax-free cash.
If you would like to find out whether a personal pension or buy-out is
appropriate, it is vital to obtain independent advice from a pensions
specialist. This should be arranged on a fee basis so that the adviser's
remuneration is not dependent on a sale. The adviser's examination should
cover the following points:
Full details of the individual's benefits under the previous employer's
scheme, including whether any additional voluntary contributions payments
(AVCs) were paid and any penalty on transfer.
Benefits benefits offered under the new employer's scheme.
What the transfer value would be worth in the new scheme. This often appears
to be less than in the old scheme for a variety of reasons. A full 'fact
find' on the individual, including career prospects, attitude to risk and
family insurance.
Brian Hurl, of Lexis Pension consultants, says: 'Only when all this
information is collated, can the adviser calculate the rate of investment
growth required by the personal pension transfer to match the benefits of
the previous or new employer's schemes.'
The adviser must ensure that any quotation from a life office mirrors the
benefit structure of the previous scheme. For example, if the scheme offers
5 per cent inflation proofing and widow's and childrens' pensions, the
personal pension quotation must do so. If these are excluded, the life
office will project a much higher pension.
Finally, if the decision is made to transfer to a personal pension or
buy-out bond, the adviser should conduct an analysis of the provider's
investment performance and charges. It is important that the plan is free of
early withdrawal penalties so you can move your fund if the provider's
performance is poor.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Markets: Gilts also go to the ball - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The equity market made the headlines this week, with the FT-SE 100 index
passing briefly through the 3,300 mark for the first time on Thursday.
Smaller stocks did even better: as the chart shows the FT-SE Mid 250 index,
which measures the performance of the next-largest 250 companies, has again
resumed the pattern of outperformance seen earlier this year helped this
week by big dividend rises from a clutch of regional electricity companies.
But the rally in the gilt market was almost as spectacular. Long term
interest rates in the UK have fallen roughly half a percentage point in the
last month: ten-year gilts, for example, are now yielding less than 6.4 per
cent, compared with nearly 6.9 per cent a month ago. The traditionally
volatile equity market has risen 5 per cent since the day before the Budget.
Long-term gilts, usually much more stable, have risen 2 1/2 per cent in the
same period, as measured by the FT-Actuaries fixed-interest index.
The contribution of the gilts rally to the rise in share prices can best be
measured by looking at the yield ratio, which divides the yield on long-term
gilts by the yield on equities. (It is now printed daily alongside the FT's
London stock market report.) The lower the ratio, the 'cheaper' the equity
market in relation to gilts. Just before the Budget, the yield ratio was
1.93; it is now 1.95. So, though equities have got slightly more expensive
on this measure over the period, much of the impetus behind the share price
rally has come from gilts.
Domestic and international investors sensed that, in the Budget, the UK
government got a handle on the medium-term outlook for public borrowing.
Salomon Brothers, surveying the outlook for world securities markets in a
new report this week, singles out the UK as the only one of the major
European economies which has begun shifting policy towards sorely-needed
fiscal restraint.
If such sentiments are shared elsewhere around the world, they perhaps
explain the enthusiastic reception given to the year's last gilts auction,
which was heavily oversubscribed on Tuesday. The next day, the markets
rallied further, as investors reacted to hints from Eddie George, the
governor of the Bank of England, that another cut in short-term interest
rates was likely early next year if economic growth faltered. George did not
seem to feel a slowdown was likely: he said that the chancellor's
expectation of 2 1/2 per cent gdp growth next year was 'plausible', a rare
tribute to the beleaguered band of Treasury forecasters.
Perhaps more important, however, he played down the risks of a rise in
inflation. The Bank is set to be an increasing influence over interest rate
policy - George revealed that it has been given a month's leeway in deciding
the timing of rate cuts instigated by the chancellor. His tone suggested
that, for the foreseeable future, it is unlikely to bring the full weight of
its influence to bear on the side of monetary restraint.
In anticipation of further cuts in interest rates, bank stocks were again
among the biggest gainers this week. Securities firms have also gained:
their employees are looking forward to big bonuses this Christmas. One
influence here is the record trading volumes for November, announced by the
London Stock Exchange on Tuesday. UK equities worth Pounds 52.6bn were
traded in the busiest month since July 1987, at the peak of the boom that
ended in a market crash that October.
The scale of the gains showed this week in the interim results of one
publicly quoted securities firm, Smith New Court, which reported interim
profits up five-fold to Pounds 31.3m. Prompt profit-taking pushed the shares
down 11p down on the day. But the closing figure, 411p, was nearly double
the 210p at which the firm made a two-for-seven rights issue in June.
The City has made so much money this year - not just because of trading
volumes but because of consistently high levels of activity in all the
various aspects of its business. Corporate financiers, suffering earlier
this year from a shortage of lucrative takeover bids, have been able to
rejoice in modest activity.
These include the first serious hostile takeover bid for a franchised
television company: as the world expected, Granada joined the rush to
consolidate the ITV system by bidding for LWT. Although valuing the target
at Pounds 600m, the bid was a pinch-penny one: at closing prices on Monday,
the day it was announced, the six new Granada shares offered for every five
LWT shares were worth 582p, a discount of 0.5 per cent to the target's
pre-bid share price. For shareholders who would prefer cash, the deal was
even less generous: it included a cash alternative of only 528p.
Still, as Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, said the offer was half
as high again as the LWT share price on June 28 when Granada first bought a
stake in the company. The holding now stands at 17.5 per cent, large enough
to cause problems to any potential white knight - which perhaps explains
Granada's confidence in its relatively low bid. LWT shares closed the week
at 592p, 3.2p below the value of the Granada offer.
The Granada bid, together with the previous week's agreed bid by Carlton for
Central, marks a new era in British television. New eras were in ample
supply this week, though not all were so much to the liking of shareholders.
London International Group, famous for its condoms, also promised a new era.
Alas, this version included interim losses, 'very substantial' restructuring
charges, plans to sell large parts of the business, a passed dividend, and
the imminent departure of Alan Woltz, its non-executive chairman. Nothing
had prepared investors for the scale of the bad news. The shares closed the
week at 117p, down 31p.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Markets: When success is not enough - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Record numbers of Britons are expected to go abroad next year, despite not
liking foreign countries very much.
A recent survey by travel retailer Lunn Poly found that rainy UK summers
were the main reason 9m people were likely to book summer package holidays
through agents in 1994. Only 8 per cent had any curiosity about the
countries they planned to visit.
Investor opinion on Airtours, the second biggest holiday company, bears some
resemblance to the British traveller's ambivalent view of foreign parts.
There is something undeniably attractive about a company which, in a year
still tinged with recession, could increase profits by 49.2 per cent before
tax and the costs of an unsuccessful bid.
Yet, as with the tourist's fear of strange food and locals who speak English
only when they feel like it, there is something which prevents the stock
market from embracing Airtours wholeheartedly.
The ambivalence is not so much about Airtours as about the package tour
sector as a whole. Memories of price wars and corporate collapses have not
faded.
Nor has the feeling that this is a sector which newcomers can enter without
much more than a telephone and a computer.
A newcomer, Inspirations, made its debut on the Unlisted Securities Market
this week. The company has more than a 'phone and a computer; Vic Fatah, its
chief executive, has been in the travel business for over 25 years.
Fatah founded Sunmed Holidays, which merged with the package tour arm of
British Airways to create Redwing Holidays in 1987. He sold Redwing to tour
operator Owners Abroad in 1990.
Inspirations appears to be doing well, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.5m
for the 11 months to September 30 compared with Pounds 749,000 for the year
to October 31 1992. Airtours, however, should serve as a warning to
Inspirations that not even consistent success is enough to impress the stock
market.
Airtours' pre-tax profits in 1993 were Pounds 45.5m, after Pounds 9m spent
on a failed attempt earlier this year to take over Owners Abroad. Profits
before bid costs were Pounds 54.5m, up 49.2 per cent on last year. After bid
costs, they were up 24.6 per cent.
This year's figure after bid costs is an increase of 65.5 per cent on
profits of Pounds 27.51m in 1991 - and 774 per cent higher than the 1989
figure of Pounds 5.21m.
Airtours' shares have not done badly. From a low of 39p at the end of
January 1991, they closed yesterday at 467p. But with expected profits of
Pounds 63m next year and earnings per share of 42.3p, the shares are on a
prospective multiple of only 11, a little mean for a group that has shown
such growth through the recession.
The package tour industry does seem established far better than in 1991,
when Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group, then the second biggest
operator, collapsed. Indeed, Airtours - like its larger rival, Thomson - now
has its own retail chain, ensuring distribution outlets for its holidays.
Inspirations has learned the benefits of vertical integration from its
larger competitors. It has struck a deal with with AT Mays, the
fourth-largest travel retail chain.
This guarantees that around 10 per cent of the shelf space in Mays' 328
outlets will be occupied by Inspirations brochures.
In return, Inspirations has undertaken to acquire 50 retail outlets by the
end of next year, which will be run by Mays for a management fee. Fatah says
the position of independent travel agents is so poor that he can buy them
for 3 to 5 per cent of their turnover, compared with 10 per cent a few years
back.
But however hard tour operators try, investors still fear disaster is around
the corner. When Owners Abroad beat off the Airtours bid it promised
shareholders a rosy future.
Soon after, it announced that profits this year would be half market
expectations and that the chairman and managing director were resigning -
guaranteeing sickly p/e ratios for the whole sector.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Markets: Spot the anomaly, then spot the risk - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The launch of Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's Higher Income Plan was, in
retrospect, perfectly timed. Savers were just starting to wake up to the
impact of falling interest rates on their investment income; a 10 per cent
yield looked too good to miss. Some highly enthusiastic mailshots from
independent financial advisers helped make it an enormous marketing success.
The product was undeniably new (Morgan Grenfell has since launched a similar
plan) and clever. The fund was able to offer such a high income, even after
deducting its charges, by using options. If you sell (or 'write') an option,
you receive a premium. By writing a large number of options, the fund could
generate a high premium income which, through a complex process, was passed
back to investors.
For those of us who were cautious about the fund, this week's developments
have been particularly interesting. First, Save &amp; Prosper abandoned plans to
launch a fund on similar lines; second, the regulators issued 'guidance
notes' on the marketing of high income products.
Save &amp; Prosper was all set to brief journalists on how its computer model
showed that the technique led to capital erosion. Suddenly, on Wednesday
morning, the briefing was cancelled (as was a planned F &amp; C meeting in
response); the following day, both sides issued statements agreeing to
differ.
S &amp; P said: 'There are a number of different approaches to derivatives
investment and it will not comment on the validity or efficiency of any
existing unit trust or offshore fund.' Hypo F &amp; C and Morgan Grenfell said:
'The two companies are confident of their funds' abilities to meet their
stated objectives.'
What should investors think of all this? One can become so distracted by the
detail of computer models and option premiums, that one fails to see the
broader picture.
There is a risk-free return in any market, which represents the return on
short term government debt. At the moment, short-term UK government debt
(Treasury bills) yields around 5 per cent.
Investors can earn more (around 7 per cent) from long dated gilts, but they
do involve some risk. The credit risk that the government will fail to repay
the debt is fairly minimal. But in the short term, there is the risk that
gilts will fall in price; and in the long term, there is the risk that
inflation will erode their real value.
So in current market conditions, a fund yielding 10 per cent, after
expenses, must surely involve some risk to capital. If it did not, why would
all the pension funds bother to hold gilts and Treasury bills?
Now, you may say, I am missing the point. These chaps at Foreign &amp; Colonial
and Morgan Grenfell are much cleverer than you and I, and they have spotted
an anomaly in the market. Indeed, the two companies' statement this week
hinted as much, when it said: 'Based on the discussions with Save &amp; Prosper,
we believe that there are significant features of the two companies' funds
which have not been explored by the models used by Save &amp; Prosper.'
It is perfectly true that market anomalies (what academics call
inefficiencies) can appear. But they do not last for long. Once spotted,
money floods in to exploit the anomaly. The involvement of more investors
makes the market more efficient and the anomaly disappears.
Perhaps Hypo F &amp; C and Morgan Grenfell are exploiting a temporary anomaly,
but I think that investors should concentrate on the risk factor. The funds
are writing call options, giving other investors the right to buy their
shares. If the stock market goes down, then the shares in the funds'
portfolios will fall, and the options will not be exercised. In a long,
steady bear market, the attractiveness of call options would reduce, and the
funds' incomes from premiums would probably fall. In short, there is a risk
that capital and income will not be maintained.
To be fair to Hypo F &amp; C and Morgan Grenfell, they have made this quite
clear. In this week's statement, they say: 'These funds should not be
confused with guaranteed funds; the two funds are actively managed according
to market conditions. Neither capital, nor the level of income, are
guaranteed.' Whether investors who have bought these funds via
intermediaries are aware of these factors is another matter.
The whole issue of high income products is obviously of great concern to the
regulators. In some instances, rather more probably than in the case of the
Hypo F &amp; C/Morgan Grenfell bonds, the 'income' received by investors is
quite likely to represent merely the return of their capital.
In Lautro's guidance note, the regulator states: 'Members must fairly
describe the nature of the investment and the degree of risk it involves. In
the context of high income products, this will generally include a
reflection of the fact that higher-than-average returns are unlikely to be
achieved without higher-than-average risk.'
In other words, there is no such thing as a free lunch, however cleverly it
is dressed up. Investors may indeed do very well out of the Hypo F &amp; C and
Morgan Grenfell plans, but they should understand that there is some risk of
loss involved.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Markets: Unease dilutes the spirit of Christmas - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was more good news on the US economy this week, and more
record-breaking gains in blue-chip stocks. Yet, there was also more concern
about interest rates and the outlook for share prices in 1994.
It might seem to odd to say that investors are feeling nervous when they
keep driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average to new record highs, but it is
clear that Wall Street is not entirely confident that the equity markets can
hold their ground at these levels.
Faced with high share price valuations, analysts who believe the markets
will end the year on a positive note have resorted to the less than
inspiring argument that prices will go up because the markets traditionally
fare well in the final few weeks of the year. The failure of the markets'
other main indices - the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, the Nasdaq composite, and
the Russell 2000 - to match the Dow's recent performance suggests that
investor morale is not especially deep-rooted, whatever history says about
Christmas-time rallies.
The Dow has been doing well - this week, it twice closed at new highs -
because statistics keep showing that economic growth has been accelerating
faster than many analysts and investors had predicted. To cash in on this
growth, investors have been buying cyclical stocks of companies with
earnings tied to the performance of the economy - and there are a lot of
cyclical stocks in the Dow average.
The Dow's performance contrasts with the recent showing from the Nasdaq,
which is weighted heavily toward technology stocks - and the technology
sector took a big hit this week, dragging the index down with it. The
selling of technology stocks began on Monday when a Merrill Lynch analyst
downgraded his investment ratings of two big semi-conductor companies, Intel
and Motorola.
The analyst did this because he was worried about the prospects for the
semiconductor market in 1994. His judgement appeared to be vindicated later
in the week when the Semiconductor Industry Association's reading of monthly
orders showed an unexpected decline. This sparked fresh selling of stocks
such as Intel, National Semiconductor, Motorola, Texas Instruments, and
Advanced Micro Devices.
Although the Dow was able to shrug off the losses in the technology sector,
any suggestion that semiconductor sales will slow down in 1994 should give
investors cause for concern, because the industry plays such a big part in
the economy's overall growth.
If there is still uncertainty surrounding the outlook for share prices,
analysts remain somewhat surer about where interest rates are headed next
year. The problem is, they are sure rates are going up. What they remain
uncertain about is when rates will rise, and how fast.
Although long-term interest rates fell this week - the yield on the
benchmark 30-year government bond edged lower from 6.23 per cent to 6.17 per
cent - it was mostly a reaction to further declines in oil prices.
Underlying sentiment in the bond market remains weak because the economy is
strengthening, and the Federal Reserve is expected to react to that strength
by tightening monetary policy some time next year.
The Fed is not going to wait until inflation shows signs of reviving before
tightening policy, either. David Mullins, its vice chairman, said as much at
the start of the week when he talked of the need for 'vigilance' in view of
the latest spurt in economic growth.
Stock market investors are not just worried about rising interest rates
because of the effect they would have on corporate investment and consumer
borrowing. People are also afraid of what a rate hike, particularly an
aggressive rate hike, would do to market sentiment.
Bond prices have been in a declining trend for the past two months so, to a
certain extent, a monetary tightening by the Fed is priced into bonds
already. Stocks, however, have been either breaking records or staying close
to all-time highs. There is simply no room in share prices at the moment to
handle a rate increase. If the Fed decides to launch a pre-emptive, and
solid, strike at inflation by tightening early next year, the stock markets
could take a big hit.
True, the underlying strength of the economy would help to absorb the impact
of the blow, but investors would be worried not so much over what rising
rates might do to the economy as about what they might do to the flow of
investor funds into stocks.
If short-term interest rates rise decisively next year, investors who
shifted billions of dollars out of short-term money market funds into stocks
might just start thinking about doing the reverse.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Markets: French franc rises - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc climbed back above its old exchange rate mechanism floor
against the D-Mark this week, for the first time since pressures within the
ERM forced a widening of the ERM bands in August. The franc's rise was part
of a more general strengthening of ERM currencies against the D-Mark.
However, on Friday afternoon the franc slipped back below its pre-August
floor, to trade at 3.426 against the D-Mark, after hitting a high of 3.4202.
A week earlier, the franc was trading at 3.355 against the D-Mark.
The Belgian franc pulled back above its pre-August ERM floor last week, and
the Danish krone has also been pushing towards its old band.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Markets: Nikkei stages partial recovery after fall - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tokyo stock market fell for the first half of last week, but recovered
to some extent. The Nikkei index closed yesterday at 17,257.43, compared to
17,459.35 last Friday, having hit a low for the year of 16,078.71 on the
previous Monday. By Wednesday this week the index had fallen to 16,507.95,
but comments by the governor of the Bank of Japan caused the market to rally
on Thursday.
The market's main preoccupations during the week were the prospect of a
government fiscal stimulus package, together with hopes for an interest rate
cut, and the continuing row over possible rice imports. The outlook from the
Tankan survey of business confidence on Friday had little impact, as its
contents had largely been expected by investors.

FT  11 DEC 93 / The icy test of popular democracy in the new Russia:
Russians vote in free elections this weekend faced with a chaotic array of
parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, LEYLA BOULTON and LORI CIDYLO

<TEXT>
At minus 40'C, the doors of aircraft freeze shut and must be prised open
with powerful hot air blowers, standard equipment at all Siberian airports.
When the temperature drops below minus 40'C, natives warn you not to wear
metal glasses or drink from a metal cup - they will stick to your face.
In Kemerovo, an industrial city deep in forest, it is so cold that the air
burns and your breath freezes into fine ice dust.
This is the land to which countless thousands of Soviet citizens were
transported to become slave labourers in Stalin's prison camps. In recent
weeks Siberians have been testing a political structure, unfamiliar to
Russians: popular democracy. Bravely, this weekend they will take part in
the first free elections amid a chaotic array of parties, interest groups
and eccentrics.
Many of those standing have only the haziest idea how political parties
might be organised - or offer a credible agenda for government. Many of
those voting seem bewildered by the dense piles of ballot sheets awaiting
them tomorrow - with votes for both the upper and lower house of parliament
and a constitutional referendum as well.
Galina Parshentseva is one of those gamely battling to make sense of this
blizzard of electoral paper in frozen Kemerovo. A young lawyer known for her
long blonde hair and mini skirts, she came to Kemerovo 17 years ago, and
moved swiftly through the party ranks. Now, as Deputy Director of Social
Protection for 18 cities, she is a candidate for for the Women of Russia
party. As she is taken to the day's first meeting in her chauffeur - driven
Volga, she is briefed by Galina Pushkaryova, a member of the campaign team:
'At two, you meet pensioners, at four, you're giving a speech to medical
students, then at six, we've got the miners.'
She starts off well with the pensioners of Azhero-Subzhensk, a miner's town
in a landscape of tiny wooden houses and red-cheeked women carrying
firewood. Her message could have come straight from the notebook of any
seasoned western politico. 'My mother is in the same situation as you. She
is living on a pension of 30,000 rubles. We need to raise pensions to keep
up with inflation.'
But with the medical students she falters. When a girl in a white coat asks
about protection for medical workers she smiles: 'I don't have a concrete
programme, I am a dilettante in these questions.'
'You have a lot to learn,' her friend Pushkaryova says when they are back in
the car. 'Study, study and keep studying, Lenin said - but you probably
missed that.'
Several thousand miles to the West, in a plush hotel in Novgorod, Igor, a
candidate for the Russian Unity and Accord party, shows a similar touching
naivety: 'Tell me - do you have any contacts with the British Conservative
Party?' he asks. 'I would quite like to join with them, in the name of
international democracy.'
But why? Is not his party's programme for a 'caring' economy, just the
reverse of Thatcherism? Igor shrugs. He believes in establishment and
'conservative' values. 'I mean, why talk about the 'left' and 'right' - who
needs it?' he says.
It is a valid question for voters trying to make sense of the conflicting
ideas, in a completely new kind of politics, where there is little real
debate between the parties. They find themselves in a world where 'left
wing' can mean pro - market, 'conservatives' lean towards preserving some of
the old communist system and communists and fascists may embrace each other
in a 'red - brown alliance'. In this sudden uncontrolled flowering of
democracy, many political disputes are often based on personal rivalries, so
the ironies of the new political language hardly seem to matter.
The obscurity of party names only adds to the confusion. For example, the
Civic Union, supports Russia's still mainly state-owned industry. Russia's
Choice is the pro-western, pro-reform party, closely allied with the
President, Boris Yeltsin. The Yavlinsky group, known by the acronymn 'Apple'
in Russian, wants more private property rights. But learning the names of
the 13 official parties is only a start: the parties contain as many
factions as the characters in a Russian novel.
At least everyone knows what the Agrarian Party stands for: the interests of
the 'red barons' of the threatened state farms. But the Liberal Democratic
Party, now running second to Russia's Choice in some opinion polls, is the
opposite of liberal. Its crypto-fascist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky promises
summary executions and plans to 'curb the power of Jews'.
Of course, all the pro-reform democratic parties promise better social
protection, less corrupt government and market reforms - without mentioning
how the better life is to be achieved.
'To build better cars than Mercedes and better planes than Boeing, we simply
need to work harder,' says Svyatoslav Fyodorov, the wealthy eye - surgeon
and leader of the Russian Democratic Reform Movement.
Westerners may scoff at the amateurishness. But in a country where
advertising has only recently arrived, western-style hype does not
necessarily feel right. The most striking television promotion so far shows
black and white footage of a Soviet world ice hockey championship defeat of
Canada, with a soothing male voice promising to make Russia great once more
 -if voters opt for the Russian Party of Unity and Accord. But the party's
ratings are poor. And the most effective advertisement has been
Zhirinovsky's which simply offers himself. In a Russia where many voters are
so demoralised they might not vote at all - simplicity is attractive.
Yet for Russians this is one of the most serious episodes in their turbulent
history - a second chance this century to shake off its tradition of
authoritarian rule. One chance was lost in the 1917 Russian revolution. The
vote tomorrow will be the first to let them choose their parliament freely.
In Russia's presidential election in 1991, the choice was simple: vote for
reform, or a communist. Yeltsin won 60 per cent of a heavy poll. This time
the questions are much more complicated: what kind of reform? and what kind
of people? Most of the Russian cabinet are running. So are pop stars,
businessmen, cosmonauts - even priests.
And there has been no shortage of ordinary volunteers. In the Urals city of
Chelyabinsk, the selection meeting for Russia's Choice drew dozens of
hopefuls, who faced public interrogation about their motives, salary, mental
balance - and KGB record.
'I'm offering myself because we have to defend these reforms,' declared
Boris Mizrakhy, a local official, who sported a slick business card, and had
financial backing from a local pig processing plant.
Few doubt that Russia's Choice, backed by many of Yeltsin's ministers, has
had access to the most resources. But funds seem to have been flowing quite
freely into some of the rival parties too. The Unity and Accord party, for
example offered free alcohol at its launch in Novgorod.
'This is a great way to have a political meeting. I've never been in a hotel
like this,' said one tipsy delegate from Buryatiya. And who paid for the
luxury? An organiser muttered: 'Businessmen and banks. A lot are backing all
the parties, to ensure that one of theirs gets in.'
Not all parties could rise to hotels. The now-dissident Communists, held
their own launch in a run-down institute and explained: 'This election is a
farce, but we will take part anyway - we cannot abandon the people'.
However, perhaps the strongest protest against this sea of grey suits is
from the group called 'Women of Russia'. It is protesting against the fact
that so few women have achieved political power - only 5.5 per cent of the
last parliament were female.
Like all fledgling political movements, Women of Russia is short on
experience - but this may be its greatest asset among parts of the
electorate wary of the grandiose promises littering the campaign.
However, adjusting to the election spotlight, as Ekaterina Popova, a
candidate admits, is difficult for both sexes. Soviet society discouraged
individualism and so for Russians, western style glitz and the focus on
personalities seems embarrassingly egocentric. 'It's difficult
psychologically. We were raised to believe that the interests of society,
not our own interests, came first.' says Popova. 'Now something in society
has changed. But it's impossible to transform yourself inside.'
Not everyone would be as gloomy. Russia's steps into democracy might be
wobbly, but lessons are being learnt. A political ferment has emerged that
cannot easily be stamped out. But with Zhirinovsky's crypto-fascists rising
in popularity, the crucial question that will hang in the frozen air across
Russia tomorrow is will this 'democracy' outweigh the authoritarian
traditions that have shaped so much of Russia's past?

FT  11 DEC 93 / The Long View: Personal pension blues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal pensions have always carried the potential of a disaster just
waiting to happen; more than one disaster, in fact, because the storm that
broke this week over badly-advised transfers out of occupational schemes
into personal plans is likely to be followed by another when the several
million people who have signed up for rebate-only and other small-scale
plans discover that the eventual benefits will prove to be derisory.
The first crisis, over unwise exits from occupational schemes, has now been
uncovered by the bureaucrats of the Securities and Investments Board who,
five years too late, have found out that the fact-finding and paperwork
connected with some 400,000 out of 500,000 transfers was deficient.
Just because there was corner-cutting in the procedures does not necessarily
imply that the advice was always wrong. At the same time, it does not
follow, either, that if the forms were filled out impeccably, the advice was
always right. The suggestion is that the individuals clearly have lost out
in a significant proportion of the cases - more than 100,000, anyway.
These allegations strike right to the heart of the retail investment
industry. We are not talking here primarily about rogues on the fringe
(although there have been some of those, too). According to Paul Trickett of
the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme, who has watched with mounting concern over
several years as some Pounds 700m has been transferred into personal plans,
the leading recipients of the money have been TSB, Pearl Assurance,
Prudential Assurance, Britannic Assurance and Legal &amp; General.
Who should we blame? There is a parade of candidates, starting with the
regulators themselves for failing to get their act together. In 1988,
freshly-installed under the Financial Services Act, they were apparently too
busy drawing up rules about 'best advice' to check what was actually going
on in the market place.
The life companies obviously can be criticised for accepting the transfer
business eagerly without asking questions about the quality of advice given
to the customers. They might say in their defence, however, that they were
only responding to the political spirit of the time. The Thatcher government
adopted the concept of personal pensions and then promoted them as part of
its drive towards individual responsibility and popular capitalism. But it
was careful to stop short of saying that people should leave occupational
schemes.
You might also attach some culpability to the occupational schemes, which
built up such a bad reputation during the 1970s and early 1980s for
swindling early leavers. That provided the splendid sales line for the
personal pensions peddlers that it was not safe to leave capital at the
mercy of your former bosses (an angle which acquired another dimension after
the Maxwell scandal two years ago). Thanks mainly to legislation, however,
deferred pensioners (who have left a company, but retain future rights in
its pension scheme) are now better protected against inflation than they
were.
Finally, are the individuals themselves partly to blame? They are
notoriously unwilling to pay for unbiased counselling and prefer to accept
'free' advice from salesmen. Perhaps the emerging results serve them right.
The SIB still appears to be pre-occupied with the procedural details. The
idea is that if enough pieces of paper are filled in and enough information
gathered, the investor will somehow be protected. It would have been much
better if, from the start, the SIB had focused on the motivation involved. A
decision on pensions is highly technical and requires advice which is not
only expert but unbiased; the intermediary must be prepared to advise 'no'
as well as 'yes.'
In almost all cases, though, personal pension business has been driven by
commissions. The intermediary is paid highly for persuading the client to
transfer out, but receives nothing for telling him that his best course is
to leave his capital in an occupational scheme. It is a mystery why the
regulators should be surprised in these circumstances to find there has been
widespread mis-selling.
There is talk of upgrading the training of personal pension intermediaries
and introducing special categories of advisers, but such measures are
unlikely to do a lot of good unless the remuneration is detached from the
product sale. But the commercial reality is that investment products are
sold only in big numbers by highly-motivated intermediaries. This is why
many of the life offices have been fighting fiercely against the fairly
modest commission disclosure proposals, now in the pipeline, which might
expose the 'free advice' myth.
Personal pension plans remain perfectly good products in themselves so long
as they retain 40 per cent tax relief on premiums and the right to tax-free
lump sum benefits. In these respects, they escaped damage in the Budget. If
substantial payments - at least 15 per cent of earnings  - are made into a
plan over a long period of years it should deliver fair value. In general,
there is no reason for panic.
Nevertheless, the general over-selling of personal pensions has created an
expectations gap. Most people have a vastly exaggerated idea of the benefits
they are likely to get. Although investment returns generally have been
quite favourable over the past few years, the same cannot be said of annuity
rates, which are worsening all the time as gilt yields fall (see page VI).
For a married couple to buy a fixed pension of two-thirds of average male
earnings (now Pounds 350 a week) transferable to the survivor they would
need a fund of about Pounds 150,000 - and inflation-proofing would cost much
more. Few people can hope to get anywhere near such a level.
Don't book that round-the-world cruise just yet.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Customs to play Scrooge at the office party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HM Customs &amp; Excise will be playing Scrooge at companies' Christmas parties
this year after an over-zealous attempt by an accountancy firm to claim back
value added tax from their festive celebrations.
Companies will now only be able to receive back up to half of the VAT on
parties for their staff, according to a technical briefing issued by
Customs.
'In the past all VAT charged on employee entertainment costs was
recoverable,' said Mr Tony McClenaghan, a partner with accountants Touche
Ross. 'This is bad news for businesses and employees as it pushes up the
cost of Christmas parties.'
Customs' attention was drawn to VAT rebates on entertainment earlier this
year when tax partners in the Birmingham office of accountants KPMG Peat
Marwick decided to fight for more money.
They appealed against the Customs' rule that companies could only reclaim
VAT on expenses incurred on their employees at parties, and not the money
spent on their staff's guests.
KPMG won the case by arguing that guests were merely sharing the staff's
celebrations for their past efforts, and were not present for business
purposes - which would have made them ineligible for rebates.
Customs - which had been quiet on the subject up until then - has since
appealed against the judgment and issued a retaliatory technical bulletin,
which says it will only accept 50 per cent of the costs of employee
entertainment for any refunds of VAT.
If the appeal succeeds, companies will be left out of pocket for substantial
sums. On parties attended equally by employees and guests, the amount they
will be able to reclaim will fall from half to a quarter of the VAT
incurred.
Last night Customs said: 'People can always make a case to get back more
from their local VAT office. But nobody at Customs gets any VAT back on our
Christmas parties. Staff have to pay their own expenses.'

FT  11 DEC 93 / Japan's GDP edges up 0.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's economy defied expec-tations by growing 0.5 per cent in the third
quarter, lifting gross domestic product by an annualised 2 per cent, the
Economic Planning Agency said yesterday.
The figure, bolstered by a recovery in housing-related spending, contrasts
sharply with the mood among Japanese companies reflected in the Bank of
Japan's quarterly survey published yesterday. The survey's index of
sentiment among manufacturers - a comparison of those with positive and
negative outlooks - slipped almost 10 per cent from -51 to a gloomy -56, and
among non-manufacturers from -41 to a record low of -47.
For the July-September quarter, GDP rose 0.5 per cent from the previous
quarter, while GNP gained 0.4 per cent and an annualised 1.5 per cent.
During the quarter, the EPA started using GNP instead of GDP as the official
measure of economic performance.
The Bank of Japan and the EPA agreed that no signs of a durable recovery
have emerged, but the agency suggested that the third-quarter growth was an
indication of the economy's underlying strength. In the previous quarter,
GDP contracted by 0.5 per cent. Most economists had expected a further
contraction.
Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, economist at Morgan Stanley, said the positive
figure for the latest quarter was partly a 'yo-yo effect' from the weak
position in the previous quarter, and the economy was likely to turn down
again in the fourth quarter.
Japan's government is expected to start preparing another stimulatory
package next week.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Trade ministers meet for last-ditch effort to settle Gatt
differences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trade ministers from the four 'Quad' countries of the US, Japan, Canada and
the European Union will meet in Geneva today and tomorrow in an attempt to
settle outstanding disagreements on world trade reform before time runs out
in the Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations.
It was uncertain last night whether there was enough room for compromise. Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, who will be at the talks, said the
odds had 'shifted in favour' of reaching a deal by the December 15 deadline
but 'it's not in the bag'.
Ministers will lend top-level authority to a virtual frenzy of talks between
the 116 countries involved in the round, most of which must be finished by
midnight on Sunday night. They will also give negotiators greater leeway to
make difficult compromises at a time when lobbying pressure both in Geneva
and in national capitals is intense.
The main disputes that could still scupper the talks include US demands for
dilution of proposed anti-dumping rules, and US threats to give unfettered
access to its financial services market to only a small group of industrial
countries. Mr Kantor said yesterday the US would not accept a pact that did
not preserve US rights to retaliate unilaterally against 'dumping,', or
selling goods below cost.
On the European side, France is still digging in over US access to Europe's
film and television markets. The two sides are still arguing over US threats
to withdraw offers to liberalise shipping and port operations.
Differences over a regime to control aircraft subsidies, plans to reconcile
potential conflicts in trade and environment policies and the authority of a
Multilateral Trade Organisation to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade appear to be closer to resolution.
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director general, has set a Sunday deadline for
completion of negotiations so that a final draft of the 450-page text of the
Uruguay Round can be drawn up and translated by December 15, the deadline
for the round.
Intensive negotiations continued late into last night on all outstanding
issues, with Japan facing immense pressure from the EU and the US to make
new market-opening concessions following completion on Tuesday of a
conditional US-EU market-opening package.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Government stands by pension plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government pledged its full backing yesterday to the principle of
personal pensions in spite of the announcement earlier this week of an
inquiry into the sale of up to 400 000 policies.
Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, said that, in the main,
policy holders should not be alarmed: 'We are not talking about fraud or
theft; the security of personal pensions is not in doubt.'
The minister said that the recent study showing that rules regarding
personal pensions were not followed in four out of five cases did not alter
the government's support.
In an interview with the Financial Times, he said: 'The government will
continue to support the personal pension since for many people it will
remain an attractive means for providing for retirement. It would be quite
wrong for us to discourage them.'
The government has faced embarrassment over the inquiry into the sales of
personal pensions to people transferring out of employers' schemes. During
the late 1980s ministers stressed the benefits of personal pension plans
because of their flexibility.
Mr Nelson said: 'My overriding concern is the interests of those who have
taken personal pensions and we have to ensure that they are not
disadvantaged by mis-selling.' He added that providers would have to respond
to those who had been disadvantaged by allowing them to adjust their
personal pension or to rejoin their occupational pension.
Mr Nelson specifically ruled out any review of the Financial Services Act.
He said that, far from indicating a failure of the system, the recent
disclosure of abuse in the sale of personal pensions showed the
effectiveness of the current regulations.
'We have to improve the system and learn from our mistakes. But this is not
a failure of the regulatory system.'
The minister made clear that he expected providers of personal pensions to
produce 'full disclosure of the costs and implications so people could make
a careful comparison of what was on offer'.
He said 'the full-scale study' by the Securities and Investments Board, the
City's chief watchdog, into the extent of the mis-selling of personal
pensions would establish the extent of the problem . 'SIB is undertaking a
thorough review of the selling rules and will then co-ordinate an action
plan to provide redress to those that are disadvantaged,' he said.
The SIB has said that it will also investigate the sale of personal pensions
to people contracting out of the state earnings related pensions scheme.

LWT would swallow an effective poison pill by linking up with Yorkshire-Tyne
Tees. Such thinking is clearly uppermost in LWT's mind as it scrambles to
evade the predatory Granada. Anglia, too, may be thinking similar thoughts
given its own vulnerability to a bid. Shareholders would be right to reject
such manoeuvres if that was their companies' sole intent. A merger between
all four stations could make real industrial sense but that presupposes a
further relaxation of the franchise rules. Mr Peter Brooke may have fondly
imagined he had just solved the ITV ownership conundrum. Clearly not.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment property companies have vigorously resisted the new FRS3
accounting standard, arguing it makes a mockery of their reported figures.
Profits from investment companies should reflect the revenue earned from
letting space, they say. It should not include capital gains and losses
generated from churning portfolios. Having failed to persuade the Accounting
Standards Board, property companies have now adopted another tack. Both MEPC
and British Land have simply continued to report headline profits, ignoring
capital items. The FRS3 numbers are included but given far less prominence.
The property companies' case is compelling. There is even a danger that FRS3
widens the scope for abuse. Given that profits or losses on disposals are
calculated on carrying values, this makes it possible to massage stated
profits by manipulating the timing of valuations and sales. As the Queens
Moat Houses episode has shown, property valuation is a tricky business. That
said, it is dangerous to view revenue profits in isolation. The values a
property company realises from disposals is clearly a critical financial
indicator and may reflect on the quality of its remaining portfolio.

FT  11 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong equities continue to rise above politics. The Hang Seng index
pushed through 10,000 yesterday, despite deadlock in talks on the colony's
future. On a multiple of 14.5 times next year's forecast earnings - against
a long-term average of 12.5 times - the market is now deep in uncharted
territory. Against the heady ratings of Singapore and Malaysia, though, the
Hang Seng looks a laggard.
While the message from China remains soothing, the temptation will be to
press higher. If new issues are any guide, international interest has barely
cooled. The flotation of Kunming Machine Tool, the Chinese company which
made its debut last week, was 628 times oversubscribed.
While capital is flowing into Hong Kong at such a rate, talk of currency
risk might seem far-fetched. The peg with the US dollar has survived 10
years of turbulence, including Tiananmen Square. The authorities have
accumulated formidable reserves and are presently concerned with holding the
Hong Kong dollar down. Still, bonds issued by the Mass Transit Railway
Corporation have been downgraded by Moody's, partly on the grounds that the
peg might not survive a Chinese shock. That is a reminder that flow of
capital could easily swing into reverse.

FT  11 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Welsh Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh is starting to get its act together outside the regulated water
business. The shares have notably outperformed the sector since the turn of
the year, since the ill-considered stake in South Wales Electricity was
jettisoned. Since then, the new management has vowed to get out of hotels -
although that is proving difficult - and is wondering whether to remain in
pipelines. Given the low margins and risks inherent in such contracting
business, an early exit looks desirable.
Acer, the engineering consultancy acquired in February, has proved more
difficult to manage than Welsh envisaged. But a small operating profit in
the first half, together with a firm prediction that the acquisition will
enhance earnings this year, is enough to earn the benefit of the doubt. With
turnover of only Pounds 350m a year in its basic water business - half that
of North West Water - consultancy might make a meaningful contribution to
earnings.
The best that can be said so far, though, is that worries about a serious
error on the road to diversification have been allayed. That has allowed the
strength of the water business to shine through. With dividend cover of four
times and a balance sheet barely geared, Welsh could live with a tougher
regulatory regime more easily than its peers. While the outcome of next
year's review of price limits remains so uncertain, such defensive qualities
will continue to drive the shares.

FT  11 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: High octane yields
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rally in equities since the Budget runs counter to the normal trend. In
part, that reflected the strongly anti-inflationary aspects of Mr Clarke's
measures, with no extension of VAT and the brunt of deficit reduction
falling on spending cuts. Falling oil prices have since further improved
prospects. Expectations that interest rates may fall further and stay lower
were reinforced by Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, who
claims he is 'not an inflation nutter'. Gilts have understandably rallied,
pulling equities up in their wake.
The logic that the low yield on gilts is a support for equities is a strong
pull on the market at present. Yet such relative valuation arguments can
dissipate rapidly, and the market needs better corporate news for direct
support. In the past three years, the FT-SE 100 index has risen by 50 per
cent, while dividends are only up by 1 per cent. Dividend prospects are
improving, but slowly, and several high profile companies have produced
disappointing results. The number of analysts currently lowering profits
forecasts strongly outnumbers those raising their estimates.
Mr Clarke's measures will have done little to help domestic consumption next
year, hence the fall in cyclical stocks and demand for higher-yielding
utilities since the budget. Overseas earnings may well improve from the US,
but that is probably already discounted in prices. Further improvement in UK
equities next year may well depend on positive surprises from continental
Europe.

FT  11 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow hits record on retail
prices report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US blue-chip stocks closed at a record high yesterday, but a tame report on
retail prices and evidence of growing consumer confidence were not enough to
lift other indices, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 10.89 ahead at 3,740.67,
well above the old record of 3,734.53 set last Wednesday. But the more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.25 to 463.93.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 1.03 to 466.28,
and the Nasdaq composite was down 0.74 at 760.75. Activity on the NYSE was
moderate, with 246m shares traded.
After a disappointing finish on Thursday, the market opened on a positive
note, pleased to find no surprises in November's consumer price index. The
Labour Department reported a 0.2 per cent rise in retail prices last month,
or 2.5 per cent at a compound annual rate.
Even though the data matched forecasts, the US Treasury market barely
touched positive territory before prices began to drift lower in
mid-morning.
The mood was dampened by the release of the University of Michigan's reading
on consumer sentiment in early December. With the index rising to 81.7 from
81.2 in November, suggesting a greater willingness by consumers to spend,
the inflation-sensitive 30-year government bond fell to 100 19/32 in light
trading. The yield rose to 6.21 per cent.
For equities, any cheer to be gained from the survey was mitigated by the
downturn in bonds. Most indices hovered at slightly lower levels, but
stronger oil issues helped lift the Dow Industrial Average in the last hour
of trade.
Petroleum-related issues were in demand after crude oil prices climbed in
New York and London. Texaco put on Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 64 1/2 , Chevron
was Dollars  5/8 ahead at Dollars 86 5/8 , Amoco was up Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 52 5/8 and Exxon was Dollars  1/2 ahead at Dollars 62 7/8 .
Among the cylicals, Alcoa was Dollars  7/8 higher at Dollars 72 3/8 and
Inland Steel was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 34. Kaiser Aluminum was down
Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 9 3/4 on news of a restructuring. Bowater added
Dollars 1 1/2 after it said it would raise its newsprint prices.
In the automobile sector, Chrysler climbed Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 56 1/8
after Salomon Brothers raised its earnings estimate on the company. Ford
added Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 64 3/8 but General Motors was unchanged at
Dollars 56 1/8 .
Borden was marked up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 18 3/4 after its chief
executive resigned amid criticism of his efforts to turn around the food
products concern.
IBM advanced after Dean Witter Reynolds said stronger than expected sales
would lift its fourth-quarter profit. The stock gained Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 55 1/4 .
On the Nasdaq, share prices fell for a fifth straight session. In the
technology sector, Apple was down Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 28 1/4 , Intel
dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 56 1/4 but Microsoft was Dollars  3/4
higher at Dollars 81 7/8 .
Canada
Toronto closed slightly lower in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index fell
10.33 points to 4,280.30 in turnover of 60.8m shares. Declines led advances
by 470 to 344. Trading value was CDollars 718.6m.
Among Toronto's 14 sub-sectors, transportation, consumer products and energy
showed solid losses. Financial services, industrial products and golds were
flat, while mining was up slightly.
The heavily-weighted Laidlaw class B shares fell CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 9
1/2 . On Thursday, Laidlaw said that the US Internal Revenue Service's
USDollars 90m claim in unpaid back taxes would not affect the company's
financial results.

FT  11 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo preoccupied by economy and
politics - Emiko Terazono on prospects for Japanese equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Uncertainty over the ability of the Japanese prime minister, Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, to resolve mounting political and economic issues has kept
investors away from the Tokyo stock market in spite of low long-term yields
and falling money market rates.
Political developments have preoccupied investors as the government's
decision to open the rice market and the passage of the political reform
bill have become crucial issues, alongside government-mooted additional
fiscal measures to prop up the sagging economy.
Mr Hosokawa is currently trying to juggle these issues. However, last week's
plunge in the Nikkei index to a year's low of 16,078.71, wiping out the
market's local currency gains for the year, has unnerved government
officials. It has forced them to turn more of their attention to the
economy, and prompted cabinet members to pledge support for share prices
through economic stimulus.
Analysts point out that an income tax cut, designed to lift sluggish
consumption, is already discounted into share prices. Ms Tomoko Fujii,
economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, says that the chances of a market
plunge are high if the government fails to announce an income tax cut of
around Y5,000bn-Y6,000bn soon.
However, the income tax cuts are expected to form part of an overall tax
reform package. Mr Hosokawa will need to twist the arms of bureaucrats at
the ministry of finance, which is staunchly insisting that a tax cut be
coupled with a consumption tax hike to maintain fiscal soundness.
The prime minister does not have time on his side. He still needs to push
political reform through parliament during the current session. If he fails
to implement reform, the cabinet is likely to resign, followed by a lower
house election, causing a delay in the implementation of economic measures.
Meanwhile, some investors point out that even if additional stimuli are
announced, their implementation will take time. 'The underlying fundamentals
won't change in a short term,' says a fund manager at Nippon Life, the
country's largest life insurer. However, he says that the company is ready
to bargain hunt shares around the 16,000 level.
Pessimism over the economy is increasing. Nomura Research Institute, the
research arm of Nomura Securities recently announced that the economy would
contract by 0.4 per cent in the next business year. The NRI forecast
presumes that the government will introduce another economic stimulus
package and an income tax cut, and that the official discount rate will be
reduced from the present record low of 1.75 per cent to 1 per cent.
Concerns over the country's labour market are also heightening as
unemployment is rising and the number of job offers are falling.
Unemployment in October rose to 2.7 per cent, a six-year high, while the
ratio of job offers to job seekers fell to a six-year low of 0.67, or 67
jobs for 100 seekers.
And while the July-September quarter gross domestic product grew 0.5 per
cent from the preceding three months, economists attribute the growth to
last minute output by companies and aggressive discounts by retailers ahead
of the half year book closing.
Most market participants hope that trading will fluctuate around the 17,000
level for the rest of this year. However, the new year may see increased
liquidation of stock holdings by companies ahead of the March book closing.
Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities says that companies have already sold some
Y1,900bn worth of shares this year, and are potential sellers of another
Y1,000bn.
Banks, which still need to write off mounting bad loans are also expected to
continue to realise profits on their long term holdings.
Many brokers hope that a declining trend in the yen will support export
oriented high-technology stocks, whose weakness this year has reflected
sharp falls in profits, due to sluggish consumer confidence and foreign
exchange losses. 'The trading cycle points to electronic stocks,' says Mr
Ueki at Nikko.
Some institutional investors, especially life insurers, which have low
exposure to equities, are looking for higher yielding investments. Many
shifted into the bond market at the start of the year, and total investments
in bonds rose by 42 per cent in the year to June, accounting for almost half
of their net cash flow.
Most investors hope that the government will deliver a boost to share prices
eventually, and that public insurance and postal funds will come in to buy
shares as they did during the first half of this year.
While purchases by public funds have evaporated since the flotation of East
Japan Railway in October, weakness in equities ahead of the March year end
book closing of their books might bring government influence to bear.
Meanwhile, some analysts take comfort in a traditional approach. Mr Geoffrey
Barker, an economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, points out that stock
markets tend to be strong during the first four months of the year.
'Investors come in at the start of the year with a determination to make
money,' he explains.

FT  11 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses settle for
gentle profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After notching up a big midweek contribution to their year-end rally,
bourses settled for gentle profit-taking yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT incorporated Thursday's post-bourse losses to close with the DAX
index 14.67 lower at 2,161.13, still 1.9 per cent higher on the week.
Traders said that the downside yesterday was limited by firmer futures
prices, the December DAX futures contract rising 8.0 to 2,170.5.
Turnover fell from DM11.8bn to DM9.1bn. Falls of around 1 per cent were
commonplace, but in engineering and steels, Deutsche Babcock, Thyssen and
Krupp-Hoesch gained on chart technical factors and small buy orders, rising
DM3.20 to DM231.80, DM5.50 to DM259.50 and DM6.50 to DM159 respectively.
Metallgesellschaft closed another DM28 lower at DM323, a week's loss of
DM69.50 or 17.7 per cent. This followed reports that it had to secure
additional credit lines after having to pay large margin payments for its
hedge positions on petroleum contracts; the group has also passed its 1993
dividend, and announced a number of asset sales this week.
PARIS saw the CAC-40 index end 13.27 lower at 2,198.13, up 0.4 per cent on
the week in turnover of FFr3.75bn, gains attracting more comment than
losses.
Rhone Poulenc rose FFr2 to FFr152.10 in 2.3m shares on good fundamentals,
and on buying from institutions which wanted to top up packets of shares
they received during the company's privatisation.
Eurotunnel put on FFr1.25 to FFr42.10, its followers reassured that the
Channel tunnel would come into operation after the handing over of the
tunnel by builders yesterday.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez lost FFr8 at FFr532 on rumours of a sizeable share
placing, denied by the company.
AMSTERDAM's early advance was wiped out, the CBS Tendency index ending 0.4
lower at 140.0, 0.7 per cent higher on the week.
Shares in tank storage companies were hit by a report that the Netherlands
was moving more than a third of its strategic oil reserves from Rotterdam
port to German salt caves.
Van Ommeren shed Fl 1.70 to Fl 41.50 in spite of a denial that it would be
affected because it did not store crude oil, the only type to be stored in
the German caves. Pakhoed fell Fl 1.20 to Fl 47.60.
Financial stocks were firm on hopes of lower interest rates. Aegon gained Fl
1.40 to Fl 105.30, ING rose 50 cents to Fl 89.30 and Amev climbed 60 cents
to Fl 87.50.
A Fl 2.70 or 6 per cent rise to Fl 47.50 in Begemann, the engineering
company, was attributed to favourable press comment on its recent
restructuring.
ZURICH extended its gains with the SMI index up 2.8 to 2,861.2, up 1.5 per
cent on a week in which records were set on every day but Tuesday.
The annual monetary statement from the Swiss National Bank held no
surprises: the bank said it was adhering to its medium-term target of 1 per
cent growth in money supply.
Nestle rose SFr4 to SFr1,250 as Credit Suisse said the share, still a market
underperformer, could climb as far as SFr1,480.
Ascom, the troubled telecommunications group, shed SFr40 to SFr1,130: the
shares surged SFr90 on Thursday ahead of the announcement that the chief
executive, Mr Leonardo Vannotti, had resigned and the company was being
reorganised into three divisions.
MILAN paused after its recent gains. The Comit index dipped 1.16 to 583.11,
still 6.1 per cent higher on the week. Turnover was reported to have dropped
sharply from Thursday's heavy L800m.
A L99 rise to L8,328 in Rinascente was attributed to a reassessment of the
outlook for the stock: a public buy offer for 33 per cent of the company by
Ifil ended last month and two new shareholders have emerged, Arab Banking
Corporation with 9 per cent and Pictet, the Swiss bank, with 3 per cent.
Among heavily traded blue chips, Sip was L37 lower at L3,351 and Stet lost
L20 to L3,919.
Credito Italiano slipped L47 to L2,388 after this week's successful
privatisation offer.
STOCKHOLM was hit by American selling, the Affarsvarlden General index
closing 9.80 lower at 1,350.60, 1.1 per cent up on the week with Ericsson B
another SKr11 lower at SKr320. In HELSINKI, Nokia reflected the Ericsson
drop with a FM16 fall of its own to FM286 as the Hex index lost 16.9 at
1,550.0, 0.4 per cent better on the week.

FT  11 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes of cut in discount
rate help Nikkei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate prompted short
covering in the futures market; share prices gained ground, led by a rise in
the electronics sector, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index rose 195.52 to 17,257.43, down 1.2 per cent on the week.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 18.97 to 1,456.71 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.69 to 1,190.06.
Following the fixing of the settlement price for December stock futures and
options contracts, the index fell to a low of 16,786.68 in the morning
session. However, index-linked buying by investment trust funds supported
prices and the index hit a high of 17,534.85 in the afternoon.
The afternoon release of the tankan, the Bank of Japan's quarterly report on
business sentiment held little in the way of surprises for investors, and
failed to affect trading in the afternoon.
But market participants were encouraged by a strengthening of the dollar
against the yen, prompted by expectations of lower Japanese interest rates.
The dollar closed up Y0.33 at Y108.98.
Volume surged to 600m shares from 230m on trading linked to the futures and
options settlements. Gainers led losers by 804 to 252, with 106 unchanged.
Foreign investors were seen buying high-tech exporters. Sony jumped Y170 to
a year's high of Y5,200 while Aiwa also rose Y20 to a new year's high of
Y1,820.
Heavy electricals were also strong on active trading. Toshiba rose Y5 to
Y673 while Hitachi gained Y24 to Y810. Automakers gained ground, with Suzuki
Motor up Y38 to Y1,020 and Honda Motor rising Y60 to Y1,430.
Some retailers were lower on fears of a further deterioration in consumer
confidence. Aoyama Trading fell Y890 to Y6,720.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 345.43 to 19,254.78 in volume of 27.2m
shares.
Roundup
More powerful performances were seen in the Pacific Rim. Bangkok was closed.
HONG KONG ended stronger after a day of hectic trading as heavy
institutional demand sent the Hang Seng Index to a record finish, up 237.85
or 2.4 per cent at 10,228.11, for a 10.0 per cent rise on the week.
Trade was dominated by foreign funds, which have sent the main index to
close at a record for four consecutive days. A round of profit-taking
trimmed gains soon after the Hang Seng touched an intra-day high of
10,268.16.
Turnover saw a new peak, at HKDollars 11.94bn against its previous record of
HKDollars 11.17bn set on November 1 and compared with an adjusted HKDollars
10.02bn on Thursday.
SINGAPORE surged 2.5 per cent to an record high, powered by speculative
buying, coupled with selective institutional support for blue chips ahead of
the year-end.
The Straits Times Industrial index rose 54.08 to a third consecutive peak of
2,220.40 for a 3.2 per cent rise on the week.
MANILA closed at a record high, the market index finishing 2.67 ahead at
2,513.29, and 3.3 per cent higher on the week.
SEOUL remained at a record high although low-priced shares lost momentum.
The composite stock index added 17.77 or 2.11 per cent to 861.72 from the
previous year high recorded three weeks ago. The market advanced 6.8 per
cent over the week.
BOMBAY moved ahead in spite of higher than expected carry forward costs
being fixed by the stock exchange. The BSE 30-share index closed 73.32
higher at a year's high of 3,401.90, for a 5.5 per cent rise on the week.
KUALA LUMPUR remained firm on the back of speculative and foreign buying,
with the composite index advancing 8.51 to a new closing high of 1,075.85,
5.1 per cent up on the week.
AUSTRALIA drifted lower as a lack of foreign direction triggered modest
profit-taking. The All Ordinaries index ended 10.8 lower at 2,084.9 in
turnover of ADollars 788.4m , still 1.8 per cent higher on the week.
TAIWAN ended broadly lower on profit-taking after the recent sharp gains,
the weighted index shedding 36.23 to 4,644.03 in turnover that slid to
TDollars 43.2bn from Thursday's TDollars 58.76bn. The market rose 0.8 per
cent over the week.
Sentiment was cautious on newspaper reports that the finance ministry would
finalise a proposal to reintroduce the stock capital gains tax later this
month.

FT  11 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery in Ladbroke shares continued, following denials that Mr Michael
Hirst, the director whose share sale last week triggered a dramatic fall in
the stock, had sold the remainder of his holding. Mr Hirst, who runs
Ladbroke's Hilton hotel division, had around 150,000 shares left after
selling just under half that amount last month.
That sale was accompanied by speculation that Mr Hirst would leave Ladbroke
which was fuelled by admission that his position with the company was under
review. Ladbroke yesterday denied that Mr Hirst had made any further
disposals. The shares added 5 1/2 to 161 1/2 p in brisk turnover of 7m.
There were suggestions in the leisure sector that Forte was considering
putting its motorway service stations up for sale. Analysts estimate such a
move could raise around Pounds 300m for the hotel group but most are
dismissive, pointing out that Forte has recently invested heavily in French
service stations. Forte shares advanced 2 to 248p.
The sale of 5.6m shares in Greenalls Group by Greenall family trusts rattled
the drinks sector as questions were raised over the motives for the
disposal. The move took the family interests down from around 12 to 9 per
cent. The shares, sold at 396p, were placed with institutions by Cazenove at
400p. The stock retreated sharply on the news, but recovered as the company
placated the market over the sale, closing 6 down at 409p.
Exceptionally heavy trades in Goal Petroleum hit the Seaq ticker in early
trading, prompting some expectation that a large corporate move could be in
the offing. Closer scrutiny showed that the deals, involving almost 39m
shares traded at 30p a share reflected Norwich Union, the big insurance
group, carrying out a bed and breakfast or tax-related trade involving its
29 per cent stake in the company. Goal settled a penny off at 51p.
The oil majors suffered from growing worries that US investors have been
reducing their holdings. BP, roughly handled by the market in recent
sessions as many of the big US investment banks have been offering stock in
the company, fell a further 5 1/2 to 315p on turnover of 11m shares. Shell
was resilient ending 2 cheaper at 693p on 4.7m traded.
Burmah Castrol closed 16 lower at 799p, after one broker cast doubts on the
benefits to Burmah and highlighted the impact a a weak world steel market on
Burmah's Foseco subsidiary.
The banks sector came in for a hammering as a leading marketmaker unloaded
stock acquired in a programme trade on Thursday and Kleinwort Benson was
said to have downgraded NatWest. Earlier this week, the sector had been one
of the market's best performing areas, as a build up of institutional demand
uncovered a series of big short positions on marketmakers' trading books,
Abbey dropped 15 to 466p, Barclays 19 to 611p, Lloyds 20 to 621p and NatWest
21 to 594p.
Pharmaceuticals stocks were badly hit yesterday as US investment funds sold
heavily in the afternoon. There was a transatlantic tussle over Glaxo with
UK investors supporting the stock but losing out and seeing it fall 15 to
682p. SmithKline Beecham dropped 7 to 375p in the 'A's and Wellcome lost
another 29 to 627p following investor concern over the company's top-selling
anti-herpes treatment, Zovirax.
Television group Yorkshire Tyne Tees slipped 11 to 161p ahead of full-year
figures next week. Analysts are looking for a loss of around Pounds 8.5m
although one said: 'The real worry is not the exact level of the loss but
the implications of air-time sales prospects for the current year.' There
have been suggestions that LWT might try and ward off the bid from Granada
by forging a link with YTT. But the mechanics of a tie-up are complex and
the market was happy to wait and see. LWT rose 7 to 592p. Granada lifted 12
to 496p.
Building group AMEC announced it had sold its stake of 10.6m shares in
Trafford Park. The shares went to the market at 89.5p and were sold on at
90p. Trafford shares stayed steady at 96p, AMEC gained a penny to 117p.
An upgrade in Cadbury Schweppes by house broker Hoare Govett helped the
shares gain 19 to 479p as other analysts prepared to do likewise in
anticipation of a round of meetings with the company next week. Geest has
also been visiting brokerage analysts and is in upbeat mood. The shares
added 12 to 336p.
Powerscreen International climbed 11 to 283p after issuing a statement
denying any knowledge as to why the shares had fallen so rapidly and
refuting allegations of a tax probe.

FT  11 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo rally on US news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A barrage of adverse press comment following the resignation of Lord Rees as
chairman of Lasmo and the continued weakness in crude oil prices produced
the expected sharp fall in Lasmo shares. However, this was countered late in
the session by news that some US investors have continued to increase their
holdings in the stock.
At their worst yesterday, Lasmo shares fell to 97p, easily their lowest
level since January 1987, with institutions said to be baling out of the
stock after strong indications that the final dividend, expected in March,
would be cut, and with the market increasingly concerned at the poor
performance of oil prices.
These languished below Dollars 14 a barrel yesterday as the oil market
continued to react to the forecast by Sheikh Yamani, the former Saudi oil
minister, that oil prices could fall below Dollars 10 a barrel in the new
year.
However, a strong rally developed in Lasmo shares below the 100p mark, with
sentiment given a big boost by news, issued just before the close of
trading, that Capital Group, a California-based US investment company, had
increased its stake in Lasmo to 4.67 per cent, or just over 35m shares. US
investors have been strong buyers of Lasmo shares this year despite the oil
company's well-publicised problems.
Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management has also been a strong supporter of the
stock in recent months, increasing its stake in Lasmo to around 11 per cent
by the end of November.
By the close Lasmo had rallied to end the session a net 5 off at 104p.
Turnover totalled 13m shares.

FT  11 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was sold back yesterday
prompting a gentle slide in the underlying equity index on the last day of
the current trading account, writes Peter John.
The contract for December, which expires on Friday opened lower at 3,273 and
was pushed up 20 points in early trading. But the gains proved unsustainable
and the contract fell back throughout the day to end a net 5 points lower at
3,268 on turnover of only 11,000 lots.
The spread between the December and March contract widened to 21 points
against a broad fair value estimate of some 14 points. The wide spread has
discouraged many traders from rolling over positions.
Volume in traded options fell back with only 35,000 lots dealt by the close
of business, less than half of which represented the Footsie. The most
heavily traded stock option was British Steel with just over 2,000 contracts
changing hands.

FT  11 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Futures weaken FT-SE Index as account
ends - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The impending expiry in the stock index futures market struck hard at blue
chip share prices in London yesterday, taking 10 points off the most recent
gain in the FT-SE Index. The premium of the December futures contract to the
underlying Footsie Index, which has helped drive equities ahead this week,
opened strongly but was steadily erased during the session.
With the equity trading account period closing tonight, the equity market
followed the futures contract closely yesterday. After opening easier while
awaiting the futures pricing and then drifting down by nearly 17 Footsie
points, the market turned higher when the contract showed a 10 point
premium. But the day's peak of 3,284.4 on the stock market was quickly wiped
out when the December contract plunged from 3,293 to 3,268.
At the close, the FT-SE Index showed a net loss on the day of 10.3 at
3,261.3. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, free from the direct influence of the
stock index market, gained 5.1 to a new peak of 3,601.3. Private investors
have turned to the Mid 250 Index sector in the search for growth stocks.
Aggressive trading between the futures and the equity market held the day's
Seaq volume at 862.5m shares compared with 884.3m in the previous session;
Thursday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.96bn, confirming the presence
of the big institutions in the London market this week.
Last night the Footsie Index showed a gain of 4.8 per cent over the two-week
trading account. The account has taken in the UK Budget from Mr Kenneth
Clarke, which has been received very positively in London by both domestic
and overseas investors. This week saw the Footsie extend its Budget gain by
a further 27.1 points as global stock bourses have shown increasing optimism
for cuts in interest rates across Europe. These hopes have buttressed
expectations that UK interest rates will be reduced in the new year from the
present 5.5 per cent to 5 per cent and, perhaps, below.
Falls in the UK market yesterday were dismissed as little more than a
combination of profit-taking as the equity trading account closed and
frantic reshuffling by market-makers endeavouring to get positions straight
before the December futures contract expires on Friday. The contract and the
FT-SE Index itself must be in line at the expiry.
A significant downward pull on the market yesterday came from the banking
sector, which has risen strongly over the past month and now makes up an
important statistical factor in index calculations. Oil shares, another
important area for the market as a whole, continued to feel the effects of
weakness in global crude oil prices.
Consumer stocks, which have benefited from base rate optimism since the
Budget removed fears of higher personal taxes in the UK, drifted easier
yesterday but strategists saw no change in the positive views underpinning
the sector.
Next week brings a heavy list of data on the UK economy, led on Monday by
the latest figures on producer prices and industrial output, and followed at
mid-week by the UK retail price index, the prime indicator of inflationary
pressure.
In addition, the UK market faces the weekly meeting of the Bundesbank policy
council, which will be watched keenly for any move on German interest rates
in the wake of the cut this week in Bundesbank repo rates.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Markets Report: D-Mark rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark recouped some of its recent losses against the other core
currencies in Europe's exchange-rate mechanism and firmed markedly against
the US dollar, writes Conner Middelmann.
After posting sharp gains against the D-Mark, the French and Belgian francs
and the Danish krone edged lower on profit-taking ahead of the weekend,
during which EC and US leaders will meet in Brussels and Geneva to discuss
the GATT talks. 'Given the high-level talks over the weekend, most people
didn't want to risk running large positions,' said Mr Keith Edmonds, chief
analyst at IBJ International.
The French franc drifted lower, but did not leave its former narrow ERM
band. At its lowest point of the day, it hit the floor of the former 2.25
per cent fluctuation band at FFr3.4305, but closed at FFr3.424, from
FFr3.427 on Thursday.
The Danish krone also eased back slightly after being boosted Thursday by
fresh rate-cut hopes. It briefly pierced the floor of its former narrow ERM
band at DKr3.9016 but closed at DKr3.913 against the D-Mark, after DKr3.918
on Wednesday. The Belgian franc closed at BFr20.91, unchanged from
Thursday's close.
Sterling slipped below DM2.45 as European traders took profits from the
gains earlier in the week. It closed at DM2.5400, down from DM2.5500 on
Thursday but up from its intra-day low of DM2.5357.
Sterling money market conditions were tight amid seasonal pressures. 'It was
a very short day at the end of a very short week,' sighed a London money
market dealer, who expects the tightness to continue next week.
The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 2.6bn, which was
later revised up to Pounds 2.75bn. In early operations the Bank purchased
bills totalling Pounds 1.5bn for resale to the market in equal amounts on
December 29, 30 and 31 at 5 13/32 . In further operations the Bank purchased
band 2 bills totalling Pounds 5m. In its afternoon operation it bought
another Pounds 553m of bills and provided late assistance of around Pounds
710m. The December short sterling futures contract slipped by 0.06 point to
94.63 and the March contract eased by 0.04 point to 94.92.
The dollar shed more than a pfennig against the D-Mark, breaching key
technical support at DM1.6950. It slid to a low of DM1.6932 before closing
in London at DM1.6990. down from DM1.7055 on Thursday.
Traders said there were no strong reasons for the slippage and the extent of
the move was amplified by thin trading conditions. 'Even a small hedging
transaction in the bond market can trigger quite marked and often
counter-intuitive moves in the currency,' said a London dealer.
The dollar rose against the Yen, however, ending at Y109.15, up from
Thursday's close of Y108.65. The Yen was depressed by the Bank of Japan's
latest quarterly corporate survey, which painted a gloomy economic picture
and kept hopes for a near-term cut in the 1.75 per cent official discount
rate alive.
Next week's slew of economic data from Japan and the US is expected to
highlight the divergence of the two countries' economies, further
underpinning the dollar against the Yen. Mr Edmonds at IBJ expects the
dollar to trade at around Y110 by year-end and to rise to Y115 on a
three-month view.
The US sees the release next week of retail sales, industrial production,
capacity utilisation, business inventories and housing starts data, while
Japan is due to publish industrial production, machine orders and the
November trade balance figures.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Economic factors lift
metals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Metal Exchange markets put in their most impressive ensemble
performance for months as price rises ranged this week from tin's 3.1 per
cent to nickel's 9.3 per cent.
Outstanding in the early action was nickel, which was boosted by a report,
later denied, of a strike at Norilsk, the Russian smelting company that
produces the equivalent of nearly 40 per cent of western requirements. But
as the run continued it was aluminium that took over the leading role,
breaking down successive technical barriers.
Performing creditably throughout was lead, which, almost alone among the LME
contracts, was principally supported by fundamental factors - continuing
supply tightness in concentrates and buoyant demand from car battery makers
as the northern winter deepened.
For the rest dealers attributed the more bullish sentiment to general
economic factors, particularly improving US indicators, and the widely-held
belief that the markets had already seen the low points of their recent
downtrends. The cautious optimism thus engendered was the more readily
translated into positive action, the dealers explained, thanks to the
current cheapness of credit.
'For example,' said London trade house GNI, in one of its daily market
reports, 'to fund a nickel position with a stop (stop-loss selling order)
below Dollars 4,000 (a tonne - the recent LME low) will accrue just Dollars
35 a tonne in funding costs for a year, low for a market where historically
prices have shot up to Dollars 20,000 in the not so distant past.'
Similar considerations were thought to have influenced the buyers who drove
the silver price back above Dollars 5 a troy ounce this week. Gold was towed
higher in silver's wake, in spite of its status as an inflation hedge.
Platinum, although now firmly established as an industrial metal, could not
match silver's strength, presumably because it is heavily dependent on
demand from Japan, where the recession is still deepening.
Dealers said silver was continuing to attract keen interest from US
investment funds as hopes of a further weaking of inflationary pressure were
encouraged by a renewed slide in oil prices.
A tentative rally in oil prices was halted in mid-week after the market was
warned not to look to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries for
a 'miracle solution' to the oversupply that was weighing down the market. Mr
Abdullah al-Attiyah of Qatar, the cartel's president, also suggested that it
was time for non-Opec exporters to shoulder some of the burden of supporting
oil prices.
Mr al - Attiyah's remarks, made after informal talks in Damascus with other
Opec ministers, including Mr Hisham Nazer of Saudi Arabia, the biggest
exporter, appeared to have extinguished any lingering hopes that Opec
producers might yet rally round to bolster prices this winter by cutting the
cartel's 24.52m-barrels-a-day production ceiling.
The ceiling, set in September, was left unchanged after last month's
ministerial meeting, precipitating the latest decline in prices to five-year
lows.
At the London Commodity Exchange cocoa prices were held steady until
yesterday, in spite of slack demand, by concern about the situation in the
Ivory Coast, the biggest producer, following the death of President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny.

FT  11 DEC 93 / International Company News: New Paramount bids expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Preparations were under way yesterday for a new round of bidding in the
Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount Communications following a
Delaware supreme court ruling which was hailed by US shareholder rights
groups. Lawyers said the decision could mark a significant shift in legal
mood.
The court ruled on Thursday that the board of film and publishing group
Paramount had to consider a hostile Dollars 10bn bid from QVC Network, a
television shopping channel headed by Mr Barry Diller, on an equal footing
to a friendly Dollars 9.5bn bid from Viacom, a cable television company.
The court, upholding the judgment of the Delaware chancery court, threw out
various Paramount defensive barriers frustrating the QVC bid. It also
criticised the Paramount board's failure to evaluate seriously the QVC
offer.
The board of Paramount is to meet on Monday to draw up guidelines for what
will amount to an auction of the business.
Wall Street is expecting fresh bids from both QVC, whose offer is currently
worth about Dollars 85 for each Paramount share, and Viacom, with an offer
worth around Dollars 80 a share.
However, analysts said the current bids were already extremely high relative
to Paramount's profits outlook, and future offers might not top Dollars 90
to Dollars 95 a share.
On Wall Street, Paramount shares slipped Dollars  1/8 to close at Dollars 81
1/4 yesterday.
Mr Ralph Whitworth, president of United Shareholders Association, a
shareholder rights group, hailed the Delaware court's ruling as 'very
positive'.
Mr Whitworth was referring to the judge's remarks that 'the market should
determine what is in the best interests of shareholders'.
QVC's lawyers played down the legal implications of the ruling, arguing that
it simply reinforced existing Delaware law. Paramount, however, argued that
the verdict 'expanded' the law.
The judgments of the Delaware courts play a central role in US corporate law
because most large companies are incorporated in the state.
Some independent legal authorities said that while the judgment did not
necessarily change the substance of Delaware law, at the very least it
marked a significant clarification of the takeover rules. They said it
spelled out more forcibly the circumstances in which directors were obliged
to seek the highest auction price for their shareholders.
The lawyers said the importance of the case could lie in a perception that
the mood of the court had shifted towards greater scrutiny of directors'
actions and support for shareholder rights.
'This thing is clear,' said Mr Leo Herzel of the Chicago law firm Mayer,
Brown and Platt. 'The Delaware courts are going to be much tougher on boards
of directors.'
Mr Herzel attributed the shift in mood to the growth of institutional
shareholder power in recent years, and to a succession of financial
scandals, notably the collapse of several savings and loans organisations in
the late 1980s.
Since the landmark Revlon case in the mid-1980s, the Delaware courts have
required boards of directors to auction off their companies for the best
price when it is inevitable that the company will be sold.
However, in 1989, in a move seen as a blow to shareholder rights, the court
allowed publishing group Time to reject an attractively-priced bid from
Paramount Communications in favour of a long-planned merger with Warner
Brothers, which Time said offered better long-term potential.
On that occasion, the court ruled that boards were not obliged to abandon a
careful corporate plan for short-term shareholder profits 'unless there is
clearly no basis to sustain the corporate strategy'.
On Thursday, the court rejected Paramount's argument that its case
paralleled that of Time. It said Paramount was obliged to seek the 'best
value' for shareholders because the deal with Viacom involved a change of
control in the company, since the majority of voting shares in the combined
group would be held by Mr Sumner Redstone, the chairman of Viacom.

FT  11 DEC 93 / International Company News: Borden chairman forced to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anthony D'Amato, the 63-year-old chairman and chief executive of Borden,
the US food company, has been forced to quit. His departure comes amid
growing criticisms of his efforts to reinvigorate the poorly-performing
group.
The chief executive's role has been taken over by Mr Erwin Shames, 53, who
recently joined the company as president and chief operating officer. Mr
Frank Tasco, 66, a Borden director, becomes chairman.
Borden is the biggest US dairy company, the world's biggest pasta producer,
and the second-biggest US manufacturer of salty snacks. It is also the
world's largest producer of wall coverings and one of the world's leading
manufacturers of industrial adhesives and food-wrap films.
During the 1980s, the company took on heavy debt to make a large number of
acquisitions. Although in the short term the strategy produced profits
growth, in 1990 net income started to decline. Mr D'Amato - appointed chief
executive in November 1991 and chairman in March 1992 - had been trying to
turn the company around.
In spite of two restructurings in two years, however, profits continued to
fall, and Borden's share price fell to its lowest in nearly 10 years.
Mr D'Amato had been planning to announce a third restructuring before the
end of this year. However, some of the company's bigger shareholders are
believed to have made it known to the board that they wanted a change.
The board said that it was 'in the best interests of everyone' that Mr
Shames become chief executive.

FT  11 DEC 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney audit set to open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney's banks hope next week to appoint an investigative auditor to
conduct a special analysis of the troubled leisure group's finances. They
want the audit before they begin negotiations for Euro Disney's emergency
financial restructuring.
The banks, led by Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Banque Indosuez, have
emerged from a week of intensive meetings in Paris with representatives of
Euro Disney and Walt Disney, the US entertainment company that owns 49 per
cent of its equity.
A senior banker present at the meetings described the discussions as
'workman-like'. However, the banks' steering committee, which includes J. P.
Morgan, Deutsche Bank and National Westminster, as well as BNP and Indosuez,
is understood to have told Disney it would not start serious negotiations
until the audit was completed.
The steering committee has seen presentations from prospective auditors, and
is expected to announce its choice next week. The audit is intended to
analyse Euro Disney's financial position and to assess its future
requirements. It could take up to a month to complete. This means that full
negotiations might not start until mid-January.
The Disney camp, which hopes the banks will agree to a debt-for-equity swap
as part of a package to halve Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn (Dollars 3.5bn) net
debt, is keen for the negotiations to be completed swiftly.
Euro Disney recently announced a net loss of FFr5.3bn for the financial year
to September 30, and risks running out of cash by the end of this year.

FT  11 DEC 93 / International Company News: Sweden merges Gota and
Nordbanken ahead of sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Swedish government yesterday announced the merger of Nordbanken and Gota
Bank, two of the country's five biggest banks. Between them, they have taken
the lion's share of state aid which has been handed out since a loan-loss
crisis last year crippled the banking sector.
The new wholly state-owned bank will become the country's largest in terms
of market share, ahead of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Swedbank and
Svenska Handelsbanken, which all survived the crisis without falling under
state control.
The government said it intended to privatise the merged bank, but not until
late 1994 at the earliest. Yesterday's announcement underlined the extent to
which the government has been forced to use taxpayers' money to keep the
banks afloat, although it said further commitments should not be necessary.
The state is to put up SKr30.4bn (Dollars 3.66bn) in aid to stabilise Gota
before it is taken over by Nordbanken. This will bring to SKr92.1bn the
total amount of aid pledged to the banking sector since the crisis erupted
in 1992.
Gota is to receive a capital injection of SKr20bn and new equity worth
SKr3.1bn. The state will also provide SKr7.3bn in equity and guarantees to
Retriva, the so-called 'bad bank' which will lift SKr43bn in bad loans out
of Gota. Retriva will stay in government hands.
The state has already pumped SKr16.2bn into Nordbanken and SKr35bn into
Securum, another 'bad bank' which took on Nordbanken sour loans totalling
SKr67bn. Despite the scale of support for Nordbanken - which allowed it to
bounce back into profits this year - and for Gota Bank, the government
insisted their merger was not against the interests of competition in
Swedish banking.
Previously SE Banken, Handelsbanken and General Electric of the US - the
only foreign suitor - dropped out of the bidding for Gota. They said the
price was too high.
'The two banks are a compliment to each other, and it is the best
alternative from a competitive standpoint,' said Mr Odd Engstrom, chairman
of the Bank Support Authority. He said the two combined would give taxpayers
a better return when privatised than if they had been sold off separately.
He said the authority would seek to 'claw back' some of the capital it had
injected into Nordbanken when setting a price for Gota. The authority has
set a minimum price of SKr3.1bn, but clearly wants Nordbanken to pay much
more.
Mr Engstrom said independent studies had valued the synergy effects of the
merger at between SKr1.5bn and SKr2.5bn.
The banks will have combined assets approaching SKr400m, less than Swedbank
and SE Banken. However, they will have a leading 24 per cent share of the
country's total lending and deposit market, with 400 branches and 7,000
employees.
Mr Per Lundberg, head of Gota since September 1992, said he would leave. Mr
Hans Dalborg, chief executive of Nordbanken, said the main effect of the
merger would be a rationalisation of head office functions.

FT  11 DEC 93 / International Company News: Renault and Volvo re-examine
alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Renault and Volvo have agreed to examine their alliance on a case-by-case
basis following the collapse of their planned merger. They will also
continue to collaborate, but only in areas of mutual advantage, according to
Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman of the French car group.
In an interview with the news service Agence France Press, Mr Schweitzer
said he had met Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief executive, in Paris earlier
this week to discuss the future of their companies' relationship.
The Renault chairman said they had agreed to preserve activities which
remained in the companies' common interest and which maintained the autonomy
of their operations. Other joint activities included in their far-reaching
alliance, which was formed in 1990, will be stopped.
Mr Schweitzer named a number of projects which had been jeopardised by the
failure of the merger. These included the P4 project to develop a range of
executive cars, and joint purchasing arrangements, regarded as one of the
principal means of cutting costs as a merged group.
Areas where co-operation is expected to continue include the exchange of
components. Renault said it was likely to go ahead with plans to source
engines from the Swedish car manufacturer for use in the Renault Laguna, a
replacement for the Renault 21 to be introduced next year.
A number of grey areas remain. One of these is the creation of joint
dispatch centres in the UK, where cars are held before being shipped to
distributors. Renault said the two companies would discuss the future of
these centres.
Renault described the talks as constructive, and said the two sides agreed
on the need to move from 'the dynamic of a merger' to 'a logic of free
co-operation'. Mr Schweitzer said this co-operation meant holding on to the
cross-shareholdings established between the two groups.

FT  11 DEC 93 / International Company News: Murdoch denies 'super share'
talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, yesterday sought to dampen
speculation that his media and film company will make a new attempt to
introduce 'super' shares - that is, shares with multiple voting rights.
'There has been continued speculation . . . that News Corporation is
formulating a revised super shares proposal to put to the (Australian) stock
exchange. This is definitely not the case,' Mr Murdoch said yesterday.
'News Corporation has no intention of putting a revised super shares
proposal to the stock exchange. Comments and reports that the company has
been negotiating with other corporations regarding equity are incorrect,' he
added.
News withdrew its super share scheme this week after strong criticism from
Australia's investment community. It viewed the scheme as a means for the
Murdoch family to establish an entrenched position of control in the
company. In spite of News' move, the Australian stock exchange - which had
to change its listing rules to allow the scheme to go ahead  - has said it
will still pursue its inquiry into the merits of differential voting rights.
Rumours about a revised News super share scheme, the possible issuance of
non-voting shares, or some sort of off-balance-sheet joint venture have
persisted because of Mr Murdoch's desire to strike strategic alliances.
It is assumed the Murdoch family does not want to see its one-third stake in
News diluted any further. Observers have been speculating about how News
could structure future acquisitions or partnerships without risking this.

FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Andrews Sykes shares tumble after Pounds
2.3m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite last September's warning of a significant fall in interim results,
shares in Andrews Sykes yesterday dropped 14p to 68p, after the specialist
industrial services group reported a 70 per cent decline in operating
profits to Pounds 539,000 and a pre-tax loss of over Pounds 2m.
The Pounds 2.34m deficit for the six months to September 30, which compared
with a Pounds 802,000 profit last time, partly reflected a Pounds 1.8m
charge for goodwill previously written off but now transferred under FRS 3
to the profit and loss account.
In addition, there was a Pounds 235,000 debit in respect of the closure of
the 51 per cent-owned Swedish subsidiary and the sale of Centahire, the
small tool hire business based in the north-east of England.
As foreshadowed in September, the interim dividend is omitted (1.4p). Losses
per share came out at 17.9p (0.3p earnings) or 1.9p (1.5p earnings) adjusted
for disposal and closure losses, redundancy costs and ACT written off.
At the time of the profit warning, the company announced that Mr Peter
Webber, chief executive, was stepping down to be replaced by Mr David Martin
from James Neill Holdings.
Yesterday Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said results reflected the
difficulties experienced in the summer when, although pump revenues were
maintained at last year's levels, reduced demand in the air conditioning and
heating markets severely hit profits.
Turnover dropped from Pounds 27.7m to Pounds 25.1m.

FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Float values Camco at Dollars 375m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The slump in world oil prices since late November has cut into the proceeds
raised by Pearson, the UK-based media group, from the flotation of Camco,
its Houston-based oil services subsidiary.
The company was floated on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday in a deal
which valued it at Dollars 375m (Pounds 252m). The shares were priced at
Dollars 15 each, compared with the Dollars 17-Dollars 19 range at which
Pearson had said it intended to sell a majority stake.
The lower valuation put on the company is in line with the drop in share
prices at other oil services companies in recent weeks.
Lower oil prices prompt companies to cut back or delay exploration and
development work, reducing the demand for drilling and other activities
undertaken by service companies.
Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, said it raised Pounds 200m in
cash from the sale of 55 per cent of Camco.
Part of the proceeds were in the form of a Dollars 105m repayment of
inter-company debt. In addition to the 13.75m shares sold yesterday, a
further 2m could be sold as part of an over-allotment provision.
The initial public offering was part of a move by the UK company to focus
resources on developing its media interests.
Pearson has said it intends to keep its remaining 45 per cent interest in
Camco 'for a limited period.' The shares were trading at their launch price
of Dollars 15 at lunchtime in New York.
The sale comes at a time of consolidation in the oilfield services industry.
A weak oil price, the need to invest in new technology and the growing
tendency of big oil companies to hire service companies to manage all
aspects of a project have combined to put pressure on smaller companies.

<TEXT>
Cheam Group, the south London water supplier, increased pre-tax profits by
40 per cent in the six months to the end of September, from Pounds 1.41m to
Pounds 1.98m.
Turnover was 13 per cent higher at Pounds 7.75m (Pounds 6.85m). Earnings per
share came out at 21.6p (15.2p) and the interim dividend is raised from 4p
to 4.7p.
Mr Andrew Kennedy, chairman, said the company had not felt able to justify a
reduction in the permitted increase of 8.5 per cent in setting water charges
for 1993-94 as requested by Ofwat.
The board did agree not to make use of the 1 per cent previously abated in
1992-93 while retaining the option of recovering it in 1994-95.

<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Syltone, the Bradford-based transport engineering group,
were little changed at Pounds 1.23m in the first half to September 30,
against a previous Pounds 1.22m.
Mr Tony Clegg, chairman, said the company was 'firmly back on course'
following the setback in the second half of last year which reduced total
profits to Pounds 2.13m (Pounds 2.87m).
Earnings per share were 4.24p (4.19p) basic and 4.15p (4.13p) fully diluted.
The interim dividend is raised from an adjusted 1.575p to 1.625p.
Sales expanded 9 per cent from Pounds 17.3m to Pounds 18.9m. Trading profit
came to Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 1.3m) but interest took Pounds 118,000 (Pounds
78,000).
Mr Clegg said the best performers in the group had been Drum Engineering in
the UK and Drum Industries in the US. Trading in continental Europe,
although difficult, was better than expected, he said, and there were clear
signs of an upturn in the US.

<TEXT>
A return to profit in the second half left Widney, a maker of windows and
water treatment, power transmission and electronic equipment, with a reduced
loss of Pounds 150,000 for the year to October 2.
The improvement, from a Pounds 371,000 deficit previously, was achieved on
sales of Pounds 22m (Pounds 19.3m). The sales figure included a Pounds 1.16m
contribution from SPC International, acquired in August.
Mr David Cassidy, chairman and chief executive, said the group would have
reported a small profit were it not for the effects of receivership at two
customers - Leyland Daf and Swan Hunter.
Interests costs were reduced to Pounds 546,000 (Pounds 823,000) aided by
lower interest rates and reduced borrowings. The period ended with gearing
of 60 per cent (277 per cent).
Losses per share were halved to 0.49p.
