<TEXT>
Exceptional costs of Pounds 1.13m left Quiligotti, the USM-traded tiles and
flooring group, Pounds 1.27m in the red for the six months to September 30.
There were losses of Pounds 228,000 last time after an exceptional charge of
Pounds 80,000.
Turnover fell to Pounds 7.01m (Pounds 8.45m) and there was a trading loss of
Pounds 138,000 (Pounds 148,000).
The exceptional charge comprised further provisions against old contract
debtors and problem contracts, reorganisation costs, and management changes
relating to the placing and open offer and the acquisition of Chelsea Group.
The company said its strategy was to concentrate on the terrazzo floor tiles
business, and accordingly it was ending its activities in the ceramics area.
Losses per share deepened from 0.33p to 1.74p.

Higher costs of operating as a listed company since its flotation in May
reduced pre-tax profits at Break for the Border Group from Pounds 149,000 to
Pounds 140,000 for the six months to September 30.
Sales at the restaurant and nightclub operator rose to Pounds 1.95m (Pounds

expenses took Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 1.26m). Earnings per share came to 1.6p
(2.6p).
Mr Ian Howard, chief executive, pointed out that traditionally two thirds of
turnover came in the second half and the burden of overheads fell heavily on
the first half. As December was such an important month the company would
make a trading statement in January.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Carr's Milling Industries jumped 16p to 144p yesterday after the
group, which has interests in agribusiness, flour milling, baking and
engineering, reported significant progress in the year to August 28.
Operating profits from continuing operations advanced 61 per cent to Pounds
2.18m. At the pre-tax level - after exceptionals of Pounds 321,000 (Pounds
490,000) and interest - the company turned a restated Pounds 334,000 loss
into a profit of Pounds 1.19m.
Earnings per share were 10.6p (4p losses) and the recommended final dividend
is increased to 3.3p (2.9p) for a total of 4.3p (3.9p).
Turnover expanded from Pounds 71.5m to Pounds 74.9m.
Mr Ian Carr, chairman, said that although the continuing bread price war
showed no sign of abating, the outlook was more encouraging than for some
time, with benefits coming from recent acquisitions, growth in agribusiness
and an improvement in flour margins.

FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Wolv &amp; Dudley ahead 4% at Pounds 36m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Helped by an extra Pounds 1m contribution from a 53-week reporting period,
Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries increased pre-tax profits by 4 per cent,
from Pounds 35.2m to Pounds 36.5m.
Mr David Thompson, managing director, said that strong consumer resistance
to beer prices had been a feature of the company's markets.
'There is evidence of improved consumer confidence but this has yet to turn
into a sustained increase in spending. We remain cautious for the year
ahead.'
Trading profit for the 53 weeks to October 3 increased from Pounds 39.2m to
Pounds 40.7m on turnover up 6.6 per cent to Pounds 223.5m.
Margins declined slightly from 18.7 per cent to 18.2 per cent, reflecting
continuing intense competition in the free trade. Beer volumes fell 2.5 per
cent against market declines of about 4 per cent in the Midlands and
north-west England.
Banks's increased market share in the take-home trade while Camerons
performed ahead of expectations, expanding distribution and volume of its
brands in north-east England. The company has launched its own premium
lager, Zamek, brewed in the Czech Republic.
Managed pubs raised food sales 72 per cent. Beer volumes fell but gaming
machine income rose 3.5 per cent in the second half after a 10 per cent
first half decline.
Milestone restaurants lifted sales of meals by 11.5 per cent and maintained
expenditure per head; Milestone taverns achieved a similar increase in sales
with a 14 per cent increase in customer spending.
Food, however, still accounts for only 8 per cent of total turnover.
Tenanted pubs traded reasonably, said Mr Thompson. But he added: 'Low
economic activity in the manual trades - particularly the building industry
 -affects many of our pubs on housing estates and in older residential
areas.'
Property profits of Pounds 1.02m (Pounds 628,000) included provisions
against 18 pubs being sold for alternative use.
Earnings rose to 38.6p. A final dividend of 7.9p makes a total of 12.6p
(11p).

FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Lutine Capital struggles toraise Dollars
200m for Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lutine Capital Corporation, the Lloyd's insurance company, was last night
struggling to meet its Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m) capital raising target.
Lutine, which is backed by Donaldson Lukin and Jenrette, the US securities
house, the Anton members' agency and Phoenix Securities, had originally
aimed to raise Dollars 300m to provide support for Lloyd's syndicates in
1994 but has found difficulty in persuading enough US investors to back the
scheme.
Lutine is still hopeful of raising capital but since it must finalise its
plans by December 15 it could soon run out of time. Enthusiasm among US
investors has waned following a flood of financial issues in the autumn. In
addition, it is understood that sentiment among US institutional investors
has shifted against Lloyd's in the wake of adverse publicity over the past
month.
Earlier this week Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, and Johnson &amp;
Higgins, the insurance brokers, withdrew a scheme to launch another Dollars
300m Lloyd's fund, London Market Investors. Another bank and broker team -
JP Morgan and Marsh &amp; McLennan - has also not delivered a corporate capital
project for the Lloyd's market.
Lloyd's has been more successful in raising capital from UK institutional
investors, with some Pounds 860m committed to Lloyd's in 1994.

FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Fuller Smith hits out over beer excise duty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anthony Fuller, chairman of London-based brewer Fuller Smith &amp; Turner,
yesterday attacked the chancellor over the levels of duty on beer, unchanged
in the recent Budget proposals.
'It is extremely disappointing that he failed to consider properly the stark
facts put before him on the dangers to the British brewing industry of
maintaining such a high rate of beer tax.
'We are put at a severe disadvantage by the disparity between UK excise duty
and that of other European countries, and sales across the (company's)
estate are being affected by the enormous volumes of beer being imported
both legally and more disturbingly, illegally, ' he said.
The statement accompanied the USM-traded group's results for the six months
to October 2 which showed pre-tax profits little changed at Pounds 3.76m
after an exceptional loss of Pounds 191,000 on property disposals.
Turnover was also static, at Pounds 41m, reflecting, Mr Fuller said,
difficult trading conditions in the south-east. 'Much has been made of the
recession ending but we have not seen this coming through in our pubs.'
The group's own beer brands showed a volume increase of 7 per cent, helped
by increased sales of London Pride bitter. Free trade sales improved 14 per
cent, although sales in the group's estate were lower.
Earnings per share, under FRS 3, edged ahead to 10.62p (10.13p). The interim
dividend is raised to 2.52p (2.4p).

   By PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
Brown &amp; Tawse Group, the steel and pipes distributor, yesterday reported
reduced interim pre-tax losses, but blamed 'extremely difficult' market
conditions for a further decline in turnover.
The group announced a Pounds 2.03m pre-tax loss for the six months to
October 3, down from Pounds 2.76m.
However, Mr Don McFarlane, who took over as chairman earlier this year as
part of a management shake-up and restructuring plan, said market conditions
'had, if anything, deteriorated further' during the period. Turnover fell by
15 per cent to Pounds 53.5m (Pounds 63.2m), including Pounds 2.29m from
discontinued operations.
Excluding Jay Fasteners, which was sold in July having contributed Pounds
120,000 to the first-half results, the group reported increased operating
losses from continuing operations of Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 1.28m).
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 813,000 (Pounds 1.09m). Losses per share
dropped to 2.7p (8.5p).
The shares closed 4p lower at 36p.

FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Finance charges limit Welsh Water advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh Water yesterday announced a 3 per cent increase in interim pre-tax
profits and lifted its dividend by 8.3 per cent, slightly above the trend
among its privatised colleagues.
Mr Graham Hawker, chief executive, said the dividend increase to 8.45p
(7.8p) from earnings per share of 49.2p (49.1p) illustrated the group's
confidence in a solid outcome for the full year. The shares closed 7p higher
at 699p.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 rose from Pounds 75.3m to
Pounds 77.3m, on sales 41 per cent higher at Pounds 261.8m (Pounds 185.4m).
The pre-tax figure was held back by interest charges of Pounds 200,000,
against a gain of Pounds 5.6m last time.
Mr Hawker repeated Welsh Water's earlier reassurance that Acer, the
consultant engineer purchased for Pounds 56m in February, would be earnings
enhancing this year.
Its order book was running 10 per cent ahead of last year, Mr Hawker said.
Last year, Welsh Water took goodwill write offs of more than Pounds 40m for
Acer.
The engineering services division, which includes Acer, contributed sales of
Pounds 6.4m and operating profits of Pounds 1.6m.
Welsh was less fortunate in some of its other non-regulated businesses. The
future of the pipeline business was under review following a Pounds 1m loss
on a single contract, against a Pounds 1.4m deficit for the division as a
whole.
Together, the non-regulated businesses contributed operating profit of
Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 200,000 loss) on sales of Pounds 102m (Pounds 28.4m).
The hotels operation incurred a loss of about Pounds 100,000.
On the regulated side, there was an 11 per cent increase in sales to Pounds
196.7m, with operating profits ahead 13 per cent to Pounds 77.8m.
Mr Hawker said Welsh Water would be seeking price rises of at least 2
percentage points over inflation when the industry regulator sets the next
round of increases.
He rejected the regulator's claims that the water industry was low risk. The
company has pledged to spend Pounds 1bn between 1995 and 2000. 'We think a
business does contain significant risks when it has a large capital
expenditure programme representing a big chunk of turnover.'

FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: DTI acts against City &amp; Westminster
directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry is seeking to disqualify four former
directors of City &amp; Westminster, the finance house which collapsed in 1991,
from acting as directors.
The department said yesterday that disqualification proceedings against Mr
Aaron Gershfield, Mr Ivor Gershfield, Mr Andrew Greystoke, and Mr Ian
Harries relating to their activities as directors of the finance house had
been lodged with the High Court yesterday.
The action was taken under under Section 6 of the Company Directors
Disqualification Act 1986. This states that directors will be disqualified
for unfit conduct or if they have been on the boards of insolvent companies.
The penalty is disqualification for between two and 15 years.
Each of the four have been directors of several liquidated or dissolved
companies. Some of the active companies in which they are currently listed
as directors are: the Householders Association, where Mr Ivor Gershfield was
recently named as a general manager - Mr Aaron Gershfield and Mr Harries;
Computerised Arts and Typesetting - Mr Aaron Gershfield and Mr Harries;
Mineco Designs - Mr Ivor Gershfield.
The DTI action arises from City &amp; Westminster. A court date has been set for
February 7.
City &amp; Westminster went into receivership on Friday December 13 1991 after a
turbulent two years as a public company. Mr Greystoke brought City &amp;
Westminster to the market through a reverse takeover in 1989. His City &amp;
Westminster Financial, a minor corporate finance house, and some Gershfield
family interests were injected in to AM Group, a quoted film and television
services company.
However, he soon resigned as chairman and chief executive, along with three
other directors, and was replaced by Mr Ivor Gershfield and his son, Aaron.
The following year, the DTI looked into the reverse takeover and a Pounds 5m
capital raising. Questions had been raised over a shareholders circular
which, it was alleged, had not revealed the full impact of a put option
granted by CWF to an Isle of Man company.
City &amp; Westminster also launched legal proceedings against some advisers to
the reverse takeover claiming that full disclosure had not been made.

Norweb, the electricity distributor for the north-west of England, said
yesterday that it intended to freeze tariffs until April 1995 as it reported
interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 65.1m and lifted its dividend by 13.6 per
cent.
While other regional power companies have announced rebates for customers,
Norweb is the first to say it is aiming for a 1994-95 prices freeze. Mr Ken
Harvey, chairman, said the move would mean household customers would be
paying less in 1995 than in 1991.
The interim dividend rise, from 5.9p to 6.7p, is proportionally less than
other regional companies which have lifted pay-outs by up to 20 per cent.
Mr Harvey said the company was considering becoming an equity investor in
'low risk' generation projects overseas and would look at projects in
western Europe, the US and the Pacific basin.
The pre-tax increase from a restated Pounds 53.9m for the half year to
September 30, came on turnover of Pounds 646.8m (Pounds 610.8m). Mr Harvey
said that after the effect of provisions was stripped out, underlying growth
was 11 per cent.
Earnings advanced to 27.1p (21.9p). Mr Harvey said the main reason for the
rise was a 2 per cent increase in units distributed and a 1 per cent cut in
controllable costs in the electricity businesses.
Industrial unit sales fell by 2.7 per cent, mainly through the loss of large
customers.
Unlike other regional companies, Norweb has not made staff redundant since
privatisation. It expects to lose 200 employees this year through natural
wastage, reducing the total to 5,000.
Retailing employment, however, is growing, by 190 to 1,856 over the period,
as the company expands into out-of-town stores. Retailing profit was Pounds
1.9m (Pounds 1.6m) but, with turnover up 35 per cent at Pounds 74.8m,
margins were eroded.
COMMENT
Norweb is an unusual electricity stock. While most power companies are
reducing or ending their involvement in stores, prompted in part by deep
suspicion in the City of their ability to run them, Norweb is expanding
aggressively. It has plans for 130 out-of-town stores by 1997, against its
current 33. It is also strongly committed to power generation, both in the
UK and, it emerged yesterday, overseas. Such boldness is often punished by
the City, especially when it is practised by a utility, but not in Norweb's
case. Although the shares dipped 2p to 707p, putting them on a prospective
yield of about 4 per cent, that still makes them one of the strongest shares
in the sector. One wrong move, whether in retailing or generation, would
cause a rapid reappraisal.

FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Attwoods in Israeli joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods, the waste management group, yesterday announced a joint venture
with Koor Industries, Israel's largest company, to tap the estimated Dollars
250m (Pounds 168m) market which is expected to result from that country's
privatisation programme.
The group also announced a 42 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the first
three months. However, the return had been depressed by currency gains of
Pounds 175,000 against Pounds 4.48m in the first quarter of last year. Sales
rose 19 per cent to Pounds 92m.
Mr Ken Foreman, chairman, said he was resigned to prospects for the first
six months, expecting Attwoods to return a flat performance. Europe had
proved particularly difficult, although Mr Foreman said he thought the
decline had 'bottomed out'.
Trading had been strongest in the UK and US, where sales improved by 15 and
3 per cent respectively. Profits were hit in the US, however, by competition
in higher margin businesses.

FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Resort Hotels deputy chief and adviser quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Resort Hotels was plunged further into difficulties yesterday when both its
deputy chairman and its financial adviser resigned.
The two announcements followed Thursday's news that the company would be
unable to prepare accounts for the year to end-April in time for the annual
meeting on December 31.
The resignation of Mr Tim Barker, vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson, the
merchant bank, and a non-executive director of Resort since February, was
announced yesterday morning.
The company said he had left as a result of a disagreement over the future
direction of the company. Mr Barker confirmed that there had been a
difference of opinion over Resort's future, but declined to comment further.
Then, late in the afternoon, Barclays de Zoete Wedd resigned as financial
adviser, and its broking arm de Zoete &amp; Bevan quit as stockbroker to the
group. BZW refused any further comment.
Resort's shares were suspended in July at 45p, when it said it was calling
in independent accountants to write a report following concern over 'a
number of financing and reporting issues.'
At that time Mr Robert Feld, managing director, was stripped of his
executive duties. He has remained a director, although the company has
started a High Court action to remove him, which Mr Feld is resisting.
Mr Feld said yesterday that Mr Barker had been instrumental in his removal
from executive duties. He said the rest of the board now met as a committee
to exclude him from meetings. He had called two board meetings himself,
neither of which Mr Barker attended, he said.
The board now consists of two executive directors and a non-executive
chairman, aside from Mr Feld, who co-founded the group and speaks for about
8 per cent of the equity.
There was speculation last night that Resort could, like Queens Moat Houses,
be having problems with too much debt and falling asset values.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, In an otherwise excellent review on employee health (December 6) you
failed to mention the major problem of migraine, which affects up to 12 per
cent of the population at some time in their life. It results in absenteeism
with indirect costs estimated at Pounds 1bn annually in the UK alone.
Education initiatives are currently exploring the true impact of migraine as
a measure of severity of pain and the disability it causes. With the advent
of new acute treatments and preventative strategies, it becomes necessary to
inform sufferers that they can be helped and that they are likely to receive
a much more sympathetic approach than was once the case.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Crestfallen investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J D WITTLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is now generally accepted that the Crest share settlement system
will disadvantage the private investor while increasing his costs of
dealing. The Bank of England has virtually abandoned him to his fate on the
grounds that a more efficient method of handling Stock Exchange transactions
is necessary. The result will be to drive the few remaining private
investors into the ever-open arms of the institutions. Is this what this
government, supposedly committed to wider share ownership, wants?
On the premise that it is better to ask a silly question and be a fool for
five minutes than remain silent and a fool forever, I ask: 'Why do we need
Crest?' The clamour for change started with the chaos induced by the large
privatisation issues, mainly BT, which overwhelmed the existing system with
a deluge of paperwork. With all major privatisation issues now behind us
that situation is not likely to recur. Furthermore, this so-called paperless
system appears to me to produce nearly as much paper at more frequent
intervals as that which it replaces.
The government has remained strangely silent on this issue. Is it not time
that the Treasury spoke up in defence of the private investor?

FT  11 DEC 93 / Balladur's bravura balancing act: The possibility of the
French prime minister facing a domestic political crisis over Gatt has
diminished
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By giving a Gatt accord - or at least that portion of it agreed between
Europe and the US - his semi-benediction, Edouard Balladur, the French prime
minister, has gone too far to draw back.
Certainly, his domestic constituency requires him to remain more vigilant
than other European leaders about tying up loose ends at Gatt's headquarters
in Geneva in sectors such as textiles and aerospace. And while France
remains alone on audiovisual broadcasting - the one seriously emotional
dispute with the US still unresolved - Mr Balladur has always acknowledged
his fear of letting Gatt isolate France from its European Union partners.
That is also why, in his quest for stronger EU defences against dumping and
commercial retaliatory powers, as well as for EU guarantees that a Gatt deal
will not push more French farm land out of production, he must settle for
whatever his partners offer. If they offer nothing, French ministers and
officials still claim in private that Paris will not sign a Gatt deal. But
any attempt by the French to pin the blame for a Gatt failure on fellow
Europeans would risk turning France's potential isolation inside Europe into
actual ostracism.
By contrast, the chances of Mr Balladur facing a domestic political crisis
over Gatt have sharply diminished. Furiously punching their pocket
calculators, the farmers are now engaged in a numbers war with the
government. The latter vaunts its success in getting the Blair House cuts
phased in more gently, allowing EU farmers 8.1m more tonnes of wheat and
flour to dump on the world market over the next six years, a period that
covers France's 1995 presidential election. Not good enough, say the
farmers, because the reduction by 2000 is unchanged from that earlier agreed
with the US.
Grumble though they will for months to come, however, the farmers will
almost certainly not exert enough pressure on their deputies to bring down
Mr Balladur in next week's parliamentary vote. Mr Balladur has virtually
ensured this by making the vote one of confidence in his handling of the
Gatt negotiations. And to his great relief, Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR
Gaullist party leader who is much the most dangerous mouthpiece for the
farmers, has praised the government's 'intelligence and firmness' over Gatt.
It has been an uphill struggle for Mr Balladur since he came into power nine
months ago as head of a coalition elected partly on an anti-Gatt platform.
Recently, some leaders of the centre-right UDF partner in the coalition have
spoken up in favour of Gatt: ex-Prime Minister Raymond Barre and
ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. But Mr Barre has little real
following in French politics, and Mr Giscard d'Estaing's presidency of the
UDF is weakening as the party's rank and file feel drawn to Mr Balladur of
the RPR.
The performance of France's industrial lobby has hardly reflected the
country's position as the world's fourth-largest exporter. The Patronat
employers federation has been deadlocked by anti-Gatt hostility among its
sub-groups in textiles, shoes, furniture and other sectors hit by imports. A
few individual bosses - those of the BSN food group, the LVMH luxury goods
group and AXA insurance - came out for freer world trade, but they did not
form a coherent bloc.
The fact that France is the second biggest seller of services abroad had
raised hopes that it might campaign for Gatt. But these hopes proved
misplaced, because the service sector's foreign receipts are grossly swollen
by tourism, which is only indirectly affected by Gatt.
With industrialists confining their pro-Gatt lobbying to back-of-hand
whispers to journalists, it was not surprising that the balance of the Gatt
argument in the press has, until recently, been in favour of protectionism,
or at least a more ordered world market. This Gallic craving for order has
led to the heavy French emphasis on the need to complete what Gatt began in
1947 with a stronger world trade organisation.
Using a new world trade body to restrain the unilateralism of US
administrations, and especially Congress, has been a common French and
European goal. Where the French have differed from other Europeans has been
in depicting so many other issues in the Uruguay Round as a struggle with
the US alone.
French newspaper readers have thus been shielded from the awkward knowledge
that opposition to its farmers' stance has gone well beyond the US, for
instance to the 14-strong Cairns Group of medium-sized food exporters,
chaired by Australia. One exception was Liberation's reprint of an
Australian press headline 'Foutus francais' ('The bloody French'). Only when
it has been convenient have messages from the rest of the world been relayed
in the press, such as that of this autumn's summit of French-speaking
countries endorsing France's demand to keep culture out of Gatt.
But all this general anti-Gatt sentiment is dissolving now into a national
mood of compromise, for three reasons. First, Mr Balladur has deliberately
helped to exhaust his co-citizens' interest in Gatt by consulting everyone
in sight on the topic. More specifically, he has embraced the farmers in a
regular dialogue which has produced extra public money (FFr3bn) for them,
though no agreement from them. The upshot is that most of Mr Balladur's
backbenchers believe the government has at least given the farmers a fair
hearing, if not fair treatment.
Second, Mr Balladur has helped detach trade from the unemployment issue, the
country's biggest concern. He argues the main reason why 3.24m French are
out of work is home-grown and related to the high cost of labour compounded
by steep welfare taxes. This argument has helped to exonerate Gatt as a
scapegoat for unemployment. Backing this up is a recent study by Mr Claude
Vimont, a Paris university professor, that job losses in French industry
that can be directly attributed to low-cost import competition amount to
only 350,000 over the past 10 years.
Third, France listens to voices from across the Rhine. And German industry
and politicians have been quietly urging a Gatt accord on their French
counterparts. Chancellor Helmut Kohl will have been telling President
Francois Mitterrand and Mr Balladur the same thing in Brussels yesterday and
today. The latter cannot gainsay the fact that it is the prospect of a Gatt
deal that has brought the franc back up to where it was against the D-Mark
before last August's monetary crisis.
If Mr Balladur does finesse a Gatt agreement, putting France's signature to
freer world trade without provoking a storm at home, there are several
important consequences.
It gives him an option to run for president in 18 months, and might even put
him in the Elysee, if the French public judges he has pulled off something
valuable in a way Mr Chirac could not have done. Even if he bows to Mr
Chirac's more naked presidential ambitions, Mr Balladur will be seen as the
man who in 1993 helped integrate his country into the world economy, just as
10 years earlier France abandoned the strategy of socialism-in-one-country
and turned decisively towards Europe.
By contrast, France's behaviour in the Uruguay Round has a more ominous
portent for future Gatt rounds. France is determined that EU national
governments and parliaments should exert far more influence on how Brussels
negotiates with the outside world.
This may be democratically proper and squares with the prevalent
post-Maastricht treaty mood. However, it spells an end, in any future Gatt
round, to the negotiating leeway that the Brussels Commission had in the
Dillon, Kennedy and Tokyo Rounds, and for much of the Uruguay Round. This,
in turn, will make the EU harder to deal with for the rest of the world.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Argument about cancer deaths too
simplistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D J COULSTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is far too simplistic to claim that '200 people worldwide may die in
the long term as a result of cancer caused by radioactive discharges from
Sellafield ('Sellafield cancer deaths put at 200 worldwide', November 9). We
have been saying this for weeks and, indeed, the radioactive waste
management advisory committee, on whose letter to environment minister Tim
Yeo the article was based, did as well.
The committee said, in its letter, that the calculation of notional deaths
from radioactivity exposure 'carries with it no certainty, and it is
incorrect to state that 'people will die''. It also said that Greenpeace's
use of these 'theoretical deaths' statistics was 'misleading'.
I agree entirely because not a single actual death may occur. The theory of
collective doses is based upon the assumption that there will be the same
number of deaths from a large number of people receiving low doses of
radiation as there would be from a small number of people receiving large
doses.
Using the same methodology, it is possible to claim that nearly 1m people
worldwide will eventually die as a result of the use of medical radiation
over the coming ten years. On a similar basis, it can be stated that natural
background radiation will cause 650,000 deaths for every year that the
population is exposed to it and the extra cosmic radiation received by
flying in passenger aircraft will cause 510 extra deaths.
Moreover, failure to open Thorp would merely transfer any theoretical deaths
to another cause; for example, to mine fresh uranium which would otherwise
be recycled at Thorp would lead to nearly ten times more theoretical deaths.
Coal stations, oil stations and gas stations will also result in at least as
many theoretical deaths for the same amount of electricity production.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Still a girl's best friend: Antony Thorncroft on the new
sparkle in jewel prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday Elton John will have a clear-out at Sotheby's. Nothing fancy,
just oddments, like the Cartier brooch designed as a Watford Football Club
rosette; the Tiffany brooch spelling out the singer's name in diamonds; and
a diamond-encrusted walking cane. John, a magpie collector, periodically
sells off pieces he no longer wears, and these should add another Pounds
750,000 to his millions.
Or perhaps rather more. Jewels - both jewellery as well as unset cut and
polished stones - have been the unexpected salvation of the auction houses
in 1993. While other works of art have selective markets, the appeal of
jewels has been wider. Moreover, good Impressionist pictures have recently
been as rare as gold dust; demand for Old Masters has been disappointing;
and contemporary art remains a tricky market.
This year's big November jewel sales held by Sotheby's and Christie's in
Geneva were the most successful in years. Sotheby's brought in almost
Dollars 70m from four sessions, including the Dollars 11.8m paid for a
100.36 carat diamond, the second-highest dollar price ever paid for a stone.
Christie's totalled Dollars 41.4m, and sold the Archduke Diamond, a 78.54
carat stone once owned by Archduke Joseph of Austria, for Dollars 6.4m.
No two stones are exactly the same, but Francois Curiel, head of Christie's
jewellery department, offers a guide to the recent price increases. 'Before
the summer a 20 carat diamond, rectangular, D-colour (the best), and
flawless, made around Dollars 47,000 a carat. In November it was going for
nearer Dollars 62,000 a carat.'
Curiel had sensed that demand was growing and approached big cutters in
Antwerp and Amsterdam, who convert rough diamonds into gleaming jewels,
asking if they had any large stones for sale. He was sent seven such stones
and they all sold, making on average 12 1/2 per cent more than the sellers'
minimum prices. Noting a number of unsuccessful bidders, Mr Curiel will be
going back to the cutters for more diamonds to offer at St Moritz in
February to try to catch the super rich in a relaxed mood.
With new buyers competing for the finest items, the auctions last month
resembled the heady days of the late 1980s when Japanese buyers pushed
prices for Impressionist and Modern paintings to unsustainable heights. This
year, jewels will rival post-1870 art as the largest sector of the
international art market, contributing more than Dollars 200m, or about a
fifth, to the turnover of Sotheby's, and Dollars 140m to sales at
Christie's, a 27 per cent rise on 1992.
But amid the glitter and excited bidding there is a worrying undertow to the
sudden rush of interest in jewels. It is concentrated on a few big buyers
for the largest stones. Half the lots by value went to Saudi Arabia and the
Gulf, and Hong Kong, areas of possible political turmoil in the next few
years. Italy, currently redrawing its political map, supplied the
third-largest group of buyers. Jewels - portable, durable, and with a
history of value - look a shrewd investment during uncertainty.
But according to David Bennett, who heads Sotheby's in Geneva, the interest
in expensive diamonds is not motivated solely by considerations of security
and investment. With money earning 3 per cent annual interest in American
banks, the wealthy of the world are considering alternative homes for their
cash. And the new rich of Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore and now mainland
China have followed ancient traditions in using jewellery to display wealth.
d4
Everyone involved has 1980 ingrained on their heart. Then, an investment
boom inspired by high inflation and low interest rates suddenly fell apart.
Since then, however, the rise in jewellery prices has been slow and steady.
It is the unremarkable progress of this price appreciation since 1983,
especially compared to the boom and bust which affected other sectors of the
art market, that has most encouraged the trade.
Both Bennett of Sotheby's and Curiel of Christie's are encouraged that
buying interest is not confined to large diamonds which were traditionally
stored away as investments; buyers want jewels to wear. This is reflected in
the demand for other gems, notably rubies. Traditionally Burmese rubies
carried a hefty premium, selling for about Dollars 150,000 a carat for a 10
carat stone, as against Pounds 20,000 a carat for a ruby mined in Thailand.
In November a 10 carat Thai ruby fetched Dollars 41,000 a carat. Emeralds,
too, are increasingly popular.
This is good news for Elton John. The most costly item in his auction is an
emerald and diamond bracelet made by Cartier in about 1925. The new
generation of jewellery collectors does not share the distaste for the
antique shown a decade or so ago, although most really large stones are
still given new settings by their owners. The brace-let alone should bring a
Pounds 80,000 smile to the singer's face.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Apportioning pension blame (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am concerned that the publicity given to the Securities and
Investments Board's pension transfer review implies that all the wrongdoing
lies with the insurance companies and promoters of personal pensions. Their
sales people may be guilty of the sins of commission but I believe that the
occupational pension schemes must bear some responsibility for sins of
omission.
What type of pension scheme is it that has so badly presented the benefits
it can offer to employees that they can be so easily sold a personal pension
policy? What warnings were issues to the employee, ex-employee, or their
adviser prior to the transfer from the scheme? Were the alternative benefits
 -which may indeed have been superior - properly presented?
Why should the whole burden for compensation be put on the insurance
company, especially when it seems that some schemes are asking for
exorbitant amounts before reinstating members' benefits? Why, indeed, should
schemes be allowed to refuse to take back employees who have made an
incorrect decision? Would it not be possible for the government to amend the
appropriate legislation or Inland Revenue rules?
Obviously, if wrong advice is given, insurance companies should pay the
appropriate costs. However, many pension schemes, and the employers which
bear their cost, will have benefited because of a decision to transfer away
from the scheme. If compensation is to be paid, I trust it will be
calculated in such a way that no party will be better off financially. I
hope the new SIB advisory committee will address these issues.

Sir, Tom Shucksmith makes an important point in his letter ('SIB tackling
pensions transfer problem from wrong end', December 7) and one which must be
of concern to all actuaries. But the bottom line surely is that anyone who
holds himself out as a financial adviser should know that in all probability
a cash equivalent is not equivalent to the deferred benefits given up and
should advise accordingly. It is that end of the problem which is being
tackled - and rightly so.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Smart money riding on a plastic card: John Gapper on a step
towards the global cashless society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is Monday morning. Ms Jane Smith arrives at Heathrow at 8am after taking
a cab from her west London home. She has no notes in her handbag, or change
in her purse. It does not matter. She hands the driver a plastic card
instead. He inserts it in a slot by the meter and deducts the exact fare.
When she arrives in Frankfurt for her business meeting, she buys a German
newspaper at a bookstall, using the same card. She obtained DM30 earlier by
inserting the card in a telephone at her home. It dialled her bank, and
transferred the sum from his account onto a computer chip on the card.
Her 15-year-old son John is at home. It is the school holidays, and he is
bored. He hires a video game for an hour by dialling a local hire shop,
paying by inserting his card in the telephone. His mother earlier
transferred Pounds 10 to his card from hers using a device that looks like a
calculator.
It is the year 2010, and the global cashless society has arrived. The local
bank no longer has queues of customers because all small businesses use
electronic cash. Banks have just announced huge leaps in profits after
finally eliminating the cost of carrying money around.
This vision came a step closer this week when National Westminster Bank
revealed plans to test a smart card, called Mondex. It will give cards to up
to 30,000 people in Swindon, Wilts, adapting public telephones and cash
machines in the town to allow people to transfer electronic money.
It is a tempting prospect for banks and retailers, which bear the cost of
cash. The UK banks estimate that they spend Pounds 2bn a year on cash
distribution, and one study put the cost to retailers at Pounds 800m a year.
Swapping paper and metal for electronic impulses would save huge sums.
The question is: will people want the card? As Mr Tim Jones, the NatWest
executive who jointly invented Mondex admits, money tokens have been around
for hundreds of years because they are very convenient. 'Cash is a great
product,' says the man who is trying to eliminate it.
The attractions for banks and retailers go beyond saving money. In at least
two ways, cash cards might help expand revenues. One is that they do not
involve credit, and so can be given to everyone. The second is that they are
well-suited to paying for new multi-media products such as interactive
television.
The first point is a rather delicate one. Mr Bert Morris, NatWest's deputy
chief executive, bristles at the notion that Mondex will be a down-market
debit card. Nonetheless, many of the market opportunities that banks cite
involve groups like young people who are not trusted with other cards.
Retail outlets that depend overwhelmingly on cash payments for small
transactions, such as fast-food outlets and video stores, may welcome cash
cards. But it is questionable whether the young people who spend money there
will buy more products simply because they can use a card instead of cash.
The second point may be more significant. As telecoms and media companies
scramble to form alliances to sell films and media products down telephone
lines, smart cards look attractive as a means of payment. Money can be
transferred over a line at the same time as a product is ordered. This is
why British Telecom is working with NatWest and Midland Bank on the Mondex
project.
Mr Bruce Bond, BT's director of products and services management, says the
Mondex card is a good means of payment for multi-media products 'that we
believe are going to explode'.
Some observers believe the implications go further. Mr Robb Wilmot of the
Oasis consultancy group says consumers could use smart cards to search
databases for information on the cheapest air fare or the best hotel deal
before ordering and paying with a single transaction.
It is, then, hardly surprising that Mondex was unveiled with such fanfare
this week. But the short history of smart cards in other countries is
littered with disappointments. This has usually been because it has been
difficult to persuade consumers that they should switch to electronic cash
payments.
One example in Holland was a pilot scheme in the town of Woerden near
Utrecht between 1989 and 1991, in which only 3 per cent of purchases were
made by smart card compared with the 15 per cent target the banks had set.
People did not use cards for small transactions in busy shops.
NatWest has attempted to avoid this problem with what is a large gamble.
Transactions in other smart card schemes are authorised when the consumer
taps a PIN number into a machine. But NatWest has made Mondex exactly
equivalent to cash by eliminating this security device.
Thus if a person loses their card, whoever picks it up can spend their money
with no barriers. The only security safeguard is that cards can be
electronically 'locked' at telephones, using a PIN number. If Ms Smith has
set off for Europe with an unlocked card, the risk is hers.
The bank argues that this is the same as carrying cash. Yet consumers could
be wary about using cards with little bulk that hold large amounts in
various currencies. The experiment in Swindon will show whether the bank has
made the correct gamble, and whether the electronic system is safe from
fraudsters breaking the computer code on the microchip.
An even larger problem is pricing. Banks currently do not charge customers
in credit for the costs of cash handling. Yet the cost of smart technology
could be high. The wholesale cost of smart cards is about Pounds 5 each and
that of a telephone with a card reader for use at home is about Pounds 140.
Banks would probably try to charge customers at least for the associated
equipment such as telephones, although NatWest says it has not yet decided
how to finance its scheme. But consumers might question why they should pay
for an intricate cash substitute that could save banks huge sums when notes
and coins are both free and easily understood.
As Mr Willmot puts it, smart cards like Mondex offer banks a chance to
'transfer a lot of labour effort and management activity to the consumer'.
The people of Swindon will soon demonstrate whether they are any more
willing than the citizens of Woerden to accept such a burden.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Retiring hurt but wise to the world: Norma Cohen talks to
those whose plight has led to an inquiry into UK pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jonathan Knowles's problems started with a Metropolitan Police sports day in
1989. Mr Knowles, 29, with seven years of service under his belt, ran into a
fellow officer he had known at training school. 'He told me he had got a
personal pension that was better than the police force's. But he said he
couldn't tell me about it - I would have to go to the main office of the
insurance company.'
The man at the main office of what was then Merchant Investors Group, now
owned by insurance group Cannon Lincoln, was a former police officer. 'I
trusted him,' says Mr Knowles. 'When you speak to an officer, you are
talking to one of your own. And who better to talk to about the police
pension scheme than an ex-policeman?'
Thus began a tale that left Mr Knowles bereft of roughly four years of
pension benefits from one of the best schemes in the country. The
Metropolitan Police have told him it will cost at least Pounds 24,379 to buy
back the pension benefits he gave up.
He only discovered he had been badly advised when talking to The
Donnellsons, the independent financial adviser which does not accept
commissions, about his mortgage.
After a review of his financial affairs, it pointed out how much he had lost
by leaving the police scheme. Mr Stephen Bourne, pensions specialist at The
Donnellsons, says the sales process had been seriously at fault. 'Here's a
chap who is perfectly intelligent, who can understand the benefits once you
sit down and explain it to him, and yet, has got a bad deal.'
Mr Knowles is not unique. Earlier this week, the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, said that as many as four out
of five people who have left employers' scheme in the past five years to
take out a personal pension may have received bad advice. The SIB estimates
that some 500,000 people have been transferred out of occupational schemes
and into personal pensions since 1988.
The SIB, which used the accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick to investigate a
random sample of personal pensions transfers, found that in most cases,
sales agents had not asked for enough information from clients to offer
proper advice.
Because SIB insists that pension entitlements must be restored when clients
have been misled, several hundred million pounds will have to be paid out by
life insurance companies and banks. But many pension holders could still
lose out.
Exactly how a crisis of such proportions could have developed unchecked for
so long is a troubling question. It is also an embarrasment for a
Conservative government which in the late 1980s was actively encouraging the
spread of personal pensions. Though personal pensions remain appropriate for
many people, the regulators, industry officials and the government must now
agree how to prevent misleading advice being given.
In Mr Knowles's case, he says he was overwhelmed by the sales patter, 'You
feel like a bit of a mug,' he says. He is now back in the police scheme but
is in dispute with MI group about how much they should pay the scheme to
restore his entitlements.
The sales agent's pitch, say others in the business, was all too familiar.
Mr Knowles was told that if he contributed Pounds 100 a month to a MI
personal pension it would give him a Pounds 300,000 lump sum at maturity.
'He (the sales agent) told me I would get a lump sum of Pounds 45,000 from
the police . . . Then he took a pencil and started drawing me all these
diagrams,' he says. After all the drawings and numbers - meant to show the
merits of a personal pension - Mr Knowles was convinced.
The Donnellsons says those figures are hard to believe. The police scheme,
which allows full retirement at 50, cannot be matched by any personal
pension plan, it says.
Mr Jon Minchin, who runs Pensionline, an independent financial advisory
service specialising in pensions, says Mr Knowles' sales agent appears to
have followed a often-used script - know as the 'ice-breaker' because it
makes people think about buying a product they were not even contemplating
before. First, the agent asks, what interest rate the prospective client
gets on a building society account. This is then compared with the current
rate of inflation - a comparison likely to show low real returns. 'Is it
really worth going down to the building society on a cold wet day for 3 per
cent? If I could show you an easy way to save and give you 12 per cent,
would that be of interest to you?' could be the sales agents next questions.
'He'll then start drawing you diagrams and you are dead meat from now on,'
Mr Minchin says.
There are other approaches, that critics say are inappropriate for selling
complex financial products. To get an appointment, sales agents try the
'lucky slot' gambit. 'I've just looked in my diary and I'm in your area on
Tuesday and I could fit you in at 2:30. If you say that date or time is
inconvenient, you will be amazed at how many other times he can 'fit you
in'' he says.
Mr Minchin also details the 'fear pitch', sometimes known as 'back up the
hearse and let them smell the flowers'. The agent asks: 'Will your children
be able to eat if you are run over by a bus?'
One former salesman for Pioneer Life, later sold to Swiss Life, the
insurance company, describes the pitch he was taught: 'You get a guy and say
to him 'Do you see yourself staying in the same job for 40 years? How many
jobs have you had so far?'' He would then tell the prospective client that
unless he planned to work for the same employer for the rest of his life
then they needed a personal pension. Under the rules set by Lautro, the
self-regulatory body for the life insurance and pensions industry, agents
are supposed to show a range of possible returns under different interest
rate conditions. But the salesmen would show only the highest, the salesman
says.
One group of workers that proved particularly vulnerable was mineworkers,
says Mr Simon Hill of the Mineworkers Pension Scheme. One pit in
Nottinghamshire, learning it would soon close, sponsored a seminar on
alternative employment at the local town hall. Along with the department of
social security and government-supported employment agencies, came insurance
company representatives. They offered free buffets and beer, and staffed
them with sales agents offering immediate details on the benefit of
transfering to a personal pension. A significant number of those on the
receiving end found the tactics irresistible. Mr Allan Hayes, 38, a former
coal miner at the British Coal Selby pit, was enticed out of the MPS and
into a personal pension with Allied Dunbar, the life insurance company owned
by BAT industries. 'The sales agent asked me what my scheme benefits were
and he turned to me and said 'without a doubt I can do a better deal for
you'. And him being brighter than me, I took his word.'
So in 1989, after 10 years in the MPS - a scheme which provides fully
indexed benefits - Mr Hayes took out a personal pension. 'They come to see
you and they blind you with all these numbers,' he says. While the figures
shown to him looked substantial in 1989 pounds, the sales agent failed to
remind him of the likely effect that future inflation would have on returns.
Matters came to a head in June 1991, when Mr Hayes crushed his forearm in a
pit accident. In November 1992, the MPS wrote to him saying it was offering
to re-admit those who had opted out. Mr Hayes, on sick leave at the time,
jumped at the chance and was allowed to rejoin once he returned to the pit.
After a short time, it became clear his injury made him unfit for work and
he sought early retirement.
Because of the four-year hiatus from the MPS, Mr Hayes is only entitled to a
pension of Pounds 54 per week. Had he not opted out, he would have been
entitled to receive Pounds 106 per week, according to the MPS. 'This is a
cruel thing that they (Allied Dunbar) are doing,' says Mr Hayes.
He says it is ironic because Allied Dunbar initially turned him down on the
grounds that he was better off in the MPS. But the sales agent told him to
sign a letter to the company, which Mr Hayes says the agent dictated, saying
he had already opted out of the MPS and had nowhere to go except Allied
Dunbar. Although that was not the case, Mr Hayes agreed.
In response, Allied Dunbar says the sales agent no longer works for it and
the case is being investigated, although it has taken some time to collect
the relevant documents.
Currently, Mr Hayes says, the insurance company is citing the letter in its
refusal to accept his claim that he should be bought back into the MPS
scheme. The MPS says it will cost Pounds 15,700 to restore his entitlements;
Mr Hayes says Allied Dunbar has offered only Pounds 1,300.
Such a tactic of obtaining a client's signature absolving the sales agent
from responsibility for advice given is apparently not unique. Mr Minchin
cites the case of another client, a teacher in Hampshire, who had approached
the TSB, the high street bank, to discus concerns about the adequacy of her
pension after a seven-year absence from work. She said she was advised to
leave the Teachers' Pension Scheme and buy a TSB pension instead.
On April 10 1990, the sales agent completed a 'fact find' which concluded
that a TSB pension was the most suitable product for her. But on April 25,
she was asked to sign a disclaimer which said she was acting independently
of the advice given by the sales agent.
When the teacher realised she would have been better off remaining in the
Teachers' scheme, she tried to transfer her personal pension back in. But
she found that after paying more than Pounds 2,000 in premiums, the value of
the fund was almost nil because commissions and charges had eaten up the
balance.
After an exchange of letters, TSB agreed to place funds in the Teachers'
scheme to fully reinstate her, a sum estimated at Pounds 8,000.
Aside from the question of how to compensate thousands of people who have
been persuaded to undercut their own retirement benefits, regulators must
now ask whether an unsophisticated public can reasonably be expected to
choose between two alternative forms of pension when a commission-hungry
sales agent is touting the merits of one. The evidence so far suggests the
answer is no.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Men in the News: Reformists with the mostest - Yegor Gaidar
and Grigory Yavlinsky / John Lloyd on Russia's opposing economic champions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reform of the economy is the central issue in Russia, and has been the main
theme of the election campaign. Mr Yegor Gaidar has dominated - not because
his proposals are popular, but because they have commanded the general
support of President Boris Yeltsin and have attracted (not without
compromises) such centrist figures as Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime
minister. Mr Gaidar has never succeeded in going as far nor as fast as he
has wished, but he has been able to stand against a full-scale reversal of
his policies.
In the first fully democratic elections Russia has seen, however, he has
been confronted by a man who proposes an alternative vision of reform - and
who insists that he is more of a reformer than the first deputy prime
minister. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the Yabloko electoral group, has put
before the voters a strategy which, though not fully fleshed out, has the
advantage that it has not been put into practice. Mr Gaidar's way has
inevitably claimed victims.
Between these two youngish men (Mr Gaidar is 37, Mr Yavlinsky 41) there is
little affection. Mr Gaidar, leader of Russia's Choice, was born among the
Soviet elite: his grandfather was a civil war general after the 1917
revolution and a famous children's writer (streets are named after him), his
father a military commentator on the daily newspaper Pravda. The leader of
Yabloko was born of a Russian family in the west Ukrainian city of Lvov,
where his father was a serving officer who ran an orphanage.
Mr Yavlinsky came to government first - serving as a deputy prime minister
in the (Soviet era) Russian government formed by Mr Boris Yeltsin in 1990 -
after co-authoring the '500 day' reform plan. He resigned when Mr Yeltsin
failed to support his proposals, and then worked with Professor Graham
Allison of Harvard University (now an assistant secretary in the US Defence
Department) on the 'Grand Bargain' plan to reform the Soviet economy with
western assistance.
A deputy prime minister in the last Soviet government under Mr Mikhail
Gorbachev, Mr Yavlinksy ended his government service when the latter
resigned two years ago, and has since headed his 'Epicentre' consultancy
group, advising the government of Kazakhstan and the leadership of the
Nizhny Novgorod region, while keeping up a steady stream of informed
criticism of the reform process. Shortly before the elections, he put
together his electoral coalition - sharing the leadership with Mr Yuri
Boldyrev, a former Soviet deputy and Russian government adviser, and Mr
Vladimir Lukin, presently the Russian ambassador to the US.
Mr Gaidar came to government as Mr Yavlinksy left it. After a career which
spanned academia and journalism (for the once-prestigious Kommunist and
Pravda), he was invited by President Yeltsin to spearhead economic reform in
the first cabinet of an independent Russia - later becoming acting prime
minister. As Mr Yavlinsky tells the story, Mr Gaidar asked him to join that
government: after a long and heated talk in Mr Yavlinsky's room on the 27th
floor of the former Comecon building, which has a panoramic view of Moscow,
he refused. Mr Gaidar went on to liberalise prices and trade and to begin
the privatisation process in an increasingly rocky year (1992) which ended
with his forced resignation. Out of government, he formed Russia's Choice,
which swept into it many of the radical democratic groups in parliament and
outside.
Both these candidates for the highest offices of state are of high
intelligence, but they are otherwise different in chemistry and attitude. Mr
Gaidar insists he is a reluctant leader: Mr Yavlinsky has loudly and
frequently announced his intention to stand for the presidency. Mr Yavlinsky
is by turns impatient and jocular, always at the centre of attention or
striving to be: Mr Gaidar is courteous, slightly awkward and formal. He has
found it hard to learn the hand-shaking, back-slapping part of government
and politics, and in a recent phone-in on Moscow Radio his desire to make
himself and his politics attractive was at patent war with his distaste for
giving easy answers.
Where Mr Yavlinsky has had the luxury to condemn most of Mr Gaidar's actions
and to hold up his own - untested - propositions as manifestly better, Mr
Gaidar has been forced during the campaign to defend or at least make the
best of an economy which continues in deep crisis.
His first year was a hard one. In an interview in the newspaper Izvestiya,
he described last year thus: 'Imagine that you know in theory how to fly a
plane. And then someone sits you down in the cockpit - not of a trainer, but
in a real plane. The pilot disappears, the plane is falling rapidly towards
the ground and nobody wants to sit in the pilot's seat. You sit there and
try to think how the plane will react to your commands. But you have no
experience and no feeling of real contact with the engine, without which
your actions are crude and often spasmodic. That's how I felt in my first
period in government.'
No wonder he felt so. Prices, which he had thought would double, went up
10-fold. Support for radical reform, apparently solid after the collapse of
the 1991 August putsch against President Gorbachev and of the Soviet Union,
itself collapsed by the spring of last year. Increasingly, politicians and
commentators told Mr Gaidar that the costs of reforms were being felt above
all by the old, the poor and the sick.
He was derided as a shock therapist, an arch-monetarist, a destroyer of the
Union. There was truth in all of this. Early in 1992, he held a joint press
conference with Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the former Polish finance minister,
whose rapid stabilisation of the Polish currency in January 1990 was a model
for supporters of Mr Gaidar, to stress his 'shockist' credentials. His
programme was for Russia alone, not (as Mr Yavlinsky's) for all the former
states of the Union: he and his circle had, after the putsch, concluded that
the Union's time was up.
Mr Yavlinsky stands against this overall philosophy. In an interview with
the Financial Times on Thursday, he said that 'Gaidar liberalised the Soviet
economy. I will destroy the Soviet economy. In doing what he did, he simply
made state monopolists into private monopolists. My programme is to
demonopolise, to privatise much further, and only then can you stabilise the
currency.'
He said he would also resume the search - which he gave up when the Union
crumbled - for an economic and banking agreement between the members of the
Commonwealth of Independent States. This would co-ordinate their economic
and monetary behaviour. 'I think now they are ready for this. I would say
that if they wished to keep separate currencies they should do so, but
actually Ukraine has shown this doesn't work.' Hyper-inflation is raging
there and the currency has collapsed.
The two men differ on the possibilities for reducing inflation. Mr Gaidar
has pledged, again and again in this campaign, that inflation will come down
to 5 per cent a month by the end of next year from its present rate of 15 to
20 per cent: in his Izvestiya interview, he said that he hoped the average
wage, which he said was now about the equivalent of Dollars 80 a month,
would rise to Dollars 120 or more by the end of next year.
Mr Yavlinsky thinks this is nonsense. 'Inflation will not come down
significantly, whatever happens,' he said. Further, he believes that
unemployment, now hidden, will burst out in the coming year. Under any of
the reform options, harder times are to come: but under his, he says, an
economy still caught in the rigid grip of a socialist system - its props
gone but its internal workings still unreformed - will at least be shaken up
and exposed to market competition.
The difference between the first deputy prime minister and the man who would
be president is thus as much as, say, divides a liberal or conservative
party from a social democratic one in a western state. Both are within the
boundaries of market principles, but both have their own logic.
But this is Russia 1993. As the campaign winds up, the threat of a high
turn-out for the neo-fascist and Communist parties appears to grow.
Mr Gaidar has for some weeks appealed for the reform parties - and
especially the two leaders among them, his own and Mr Yavlinsky's - to come
together. Mr Yavlinsky has been cool.
But on Thursday, after seeing a poll which showed Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
the neo-fascist, running second, Mr Yavlinksy appeared to have changed his
mind.
'There is no reason on my side why we cannot agree. I have no particular bad
feelings for him (Gaidar). The key thing for me is that he can be brought to
see the basic direction of my programme and we can agree. And then we will
see.'

FT  11 DEC 93 / Portrait sold for pounds 1.7m at Christie's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A portrait by El Greco, the only one by him of a woman that is likely to
appear on the market, sold for Pounds 1.7m at Christie's yesterday, Antony
Thorncroft writes. The price was double the estimate and a record for the
artist. The portrait was painted in the 1580s and the sitter is believed to
have been his daughter-in-law. It sold at Christie's in 1851, with another
picture, for three guineas, and was sold at an Old Master auction yesterday
by the estate of the late Mary, Viscountess Rothermere.

The Office of Fair Trading has suspended its investigation into claims that
British Telecommunications manages its telephone directory business in a way
unfair to customers and competitors.
But Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he was doing
so only to allow Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, to investigate the
issues first.
Sir Bryan said he remained concerned about BT's policy of obliging customers
to buy directories and including the cost in the line rental charge. He also
wanted Oftel to examine the cost and other obstacles faced by competitors in
getting customers' telephone numbers into BT directories.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Soluble nappies ready for market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Norfolk-based company plans to market a soluble and biodegradable film
which will allow nappies and female-hygiene products to be safely flushed
down the toilet.
Film Technology is seeking a worldwide patent on the composite film, known
as B9, which will be launched in the new year. It would be used to replace
the outer plastic film found in current brands.
More than 3bn disposable nappies are used in Britain each year, creating an
estimated 70,000 tons of waste. About 40bn are used annually worldwide.
The company, based near Thetford, says the nappy film is impervious to water
on its inner side. But that breaks down when it is flushed away and the
nappy changes into a biodegradable 'slurry'.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Maxwell ruled a fraudster: Three banks win marathon civil
case over shares acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Maxwell, the late publisher, misappropriated pension-fund assets and
fraudulently dealt in a company's shares in a desperate attempt to prop up
his ailing business empire, a High Court judge ruled yesterday.
Giving judgment on a civil action between Macmillan, a Maxwell group
subsidiary, and three investment banks, Mr Justice Millett said the tycoon
had been dishonest in his dealing in shares of Berlitz, the language school
and publishing company. These were repeatedly used to raise money to repay
debts within the Maxwell group of companies.
Ending the marathon litigation, the judge ruled in favour of the three banks
 -Lehman Brothers, Swiss Volksbank and Credit Suisse - saying they had
honestly acquired the Berlitz shares which were later sold for more than
Dollars 137m.
That had been disputed by Macmillan which had begun the legal action in
October last year to claim compensation. It had claimed the banks had known
or suspected that the shares had been improperly acquired from Macmillan.
The judge, dismissing its claim, ruled that staff from all three banks - Mr
Mark Haas and Mr Robert Price of Lehman Brothers, Mr Stephen Foster of Swiss
Volksbank and Miss Julie Maitland of Credit Suisse - had acted honestly.
Mr Justice Millett said that before Mr Maxwell died in November 1991 the
shares in both Mirror Group Newspapers and Maxwell Communication Corporation
had steadily fallen in value. Mr Maxwell had to provide ever-increasing
collateral to his bankers and lost substantial sums supporting the share
price of the public companies.
'After his death it emerged that, in increasingly desperate attempts to
prevent the collapse of the group, he had resorted to whatever assets lay to
hand, whether they belonged to the private side, the public companies, or
even the group's pension funds,' the judge continued.
'Many of these assets thus misappropriated, especially those whose proceeds
were expended in the share-support operations, have been irretrievably
lost.'
Mr Maxwell transferred the ownership of the shares from Macmillan to
Bishopsgate Investment Trust, another Maxwell company, on November 5 1990.
This was done with 'fraudulent purpose' on Mr Maxwell's part so they could
be used to raise money to support his private companies, and was against the
interests of Macmillan. Mr Maxwell did not contemplate honest dealing with
the shares for Macmillan's benefit, the judge said.
Within days, the first shares were offered to Credit Suisse as security for
a loan to one of Mr Maxwell's private companies.
The judge said: 'The Berlitz shares were repeatedly used to secure the
payment of debts owed to many different creditors, often being released from
security by one creditor only to be immediately deposited by way of security
with another.'
All 1.9m shares held by Lehman Brothers were used as security for loans to
Bishopsgate Investment Management, the fund manager of the Maxwell Group
pension fund.
The 2.4m shares held by Swiss Volksbank were taken as collateral against a
Dollars 35m loan to one of Mr Maxwell's private companies. The 1.5m shares
held by Credit Suisse were taken as security for a Pounds 50m loan to the
private companies.
After the hearing Lehman issued a statement saying: 'Our belief that we
acted entirely properly in our dealings with the Maxwell group of companies
has been fully justified.'

FT  11 DEC 93 / Women's share of public jobs rises 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An estimated 40 per cent of appointments to public bodies made by ministers
during the past 12 months have gone to women, it was announced yesterday by
the Cabinet Office.
Mr William Waldegrave, the minister responsible for public services, said
the rise was a welcome improvement. 'This . . . demonstrates our continuing
efforts to ensure women can play their proper part in our public life,' he
said.
Women now make up 28.2 per cent or 12,007 of the mainly part-time and unpaid
posts on public bodies. The posts include health authorities, industrial and
rent assessment tribunals and consumer organisations. This represents a 2
per cent increase since September last year.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, wants to see women make up between a
third and a half of all public-service appointments. At present about 35 per
cent of the 5,000-strong list of people seen as 'suitable for appointments
at national and local level' are women.
The Cabinet Office also disclosed yesterday that 2.3 per cent of public
appointments are held by ethnic minorities - a rise of 0.3 per cent over the
previous 12 months. At present an estimated 5 per cent of the economically
active population are members of ethnic minorities.
The government aims to increase the number of people from ethnic minorities
in public-service appointments so that it 'more closely reflects' their
contribution to national life.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Pit cuts stoke closure fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal has told unions it expects to cut staffing at Ellington
colliery, Northumberland, its last remaining pit in north-east England by
more than half. The move came as Mr Neil Clarke, the corporation's chairman,
indicated there was a need for further mine closures.
Mr Clarke said plans by generators to run down stocks increased pressure on
the need to cut production. His remarks fuelled expectations that the
corporation will announce further closures in the new year on top of the
seven announced in the past two months.
At Ellington unions were told to expect the loss of 650 jobs by 1996, with
180 going by April. The pit employs 1,240. Production in 1994-95 will be cut
from 2.2m tonnes to 1.5m, probably requiring a further 100 redundancies.
Further job losses are likely in 1995-96, cutting staffing to 590.
Meanwhile, British Coal is to offer cut-price coal to generators at
considerably less than production costs. It believes there will be no sales
this financial year but hopes electricity generators will buy several
million tonnes next year.
Even if it achieved that target, it is unlikely that more than 15 of the
remaining 22 pits would remain open by privatisation.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Tartan tidings to Iraq scotched
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Twelve corporate calendars bound for Iraq have been seized by Customs
officers under the United Nations embargo on exports to Iraq.
Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company, had sent out 8,000
calendars worldwide. The Iraq box was held by the Customs and Excise seizure
unit, which told Weir Group that the gift broke sanctions.
The company had been helping to build a sewage treatment works in Iraq when
work was halted by the Gulf war. It sent the calendars to keep in touch with
authorities in Iraq.
Customs and Excise said: 'There is a total UN embargo on the export of all
goods of any kind to Iraq. That means absolutely nothing goes - and we have
to enforce that.'
The company said yesterday: 'We were shocked and flabbergasted.
'We agree with sanctions, but it does seem strange when they apply to
business gifts like this.
'We have been given a month to decide whether to appeal, or otherwise they
will be destroyed. But we are not going to appeal.
'All they show is typical Scottish scenes, and a different piece of tartan
for each month.'

FT  11 DEC 93 / Graduate recruiters' university visits drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graduate recruiters are abandoning the 'milk round' of visits to
universities to recruit students as competition for jobs increases, careers
advisers said yesterday.
For every 100 bookings made with universities to meet students in 1990-91,
only 38 were made this year, according to the Association of Graduate
Careers Advisory Services. At the 'new' universities which were polytechnics
until last year, there have been only 24 bookings this year for every 100 in
1990-91.
Ms Margaret Wallis, president of the association, said employers wanted
graduates who were prepared to take the initiative in looking for work.
Releasing its survey of destinations for graduates in 1992, the association
said total graduate unemployment had risen to 12.9 per cent, from 11.5 per
cent the previous year.
Employers in fact recruited more graduates in 1992; the increased
unemployment rate was caused by a rise of 9.7 per cent in graduate numbers.
But the survey shows those pupils who leave schools in England and Wales
with A-levels are twice as likely as graduates to be unemployed.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Government rejects milk market shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday put at risk plans to open up the milk market in
England and Wales to competition by next April by throwing out proposals by
the Milk Marketing Board to turn itself into Milk Marque, a farmers'
voluntary co-operative.
Farmers fear the widespread criticisms of the board's reorganisation plans
voiced yesterday by the government will delay the timetable for freeing up
the market.
The government is being forced by Brussels to abolish the milk board, which
acts as an intermediary in the market by buying up all milk from farmers and
selling it on to dairies. But the board's plans to transform itself into a
co-operative have fallen foul of the European Commission's competition
authorities.
The commission indicated earlier this week that it was not happy with plans
to transfer the bulk of the board's assets directly to the proposed Milk
Marque, saying this needed further investigation.
The reorganisation plans represent the greatest shake-up in the milk
business since the board was created 60 years ago.
Mr Richard Packer, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture,
yesterday told the board that it should hold talks with dairy companies that
have condemned the reorganisation scheme. He also asked the board to look
again at its proposals for an auction system as a way of rationing milk
supplies to the highest bidder.
In addition, Mr Packer queried the transfer of certain assets such as
National Milk Records, the milk testing laboratories, and Genus, the
breeding advisory service to the new co-operative, and called into question
proposals for transferring all haulage contracts to the new body and
restrictive proposals on how often producers who sign up with Milk Marque
are allowed to leave the organisation.
Mr Andrew Dare, set to become Milk Marque's chief executive, has promised
farmers higher milk prices if they join him in April - saying that prices
will rise because the UK does not produce enough milk for its own needs. His
plans to sign up 80 per cent of producers would still give him great power
in the market.
The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents wholesale milk purchasers, has
criticised the proposed Milk Marque stranglehold on the market.
'The whole principle of reform in the milk market was to create an
environment of free competition and the board's scheme would have severely
limited it,' said Mr Neil Davidson, group executive of Northern Foods, which
plans to buy its milk directly from farmers.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Trade gap prompts fears of import surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in Britain's trade gap with the rest of the world has revived
worries that imports might increase markedly as the domestic economy
recovers.
The difference between imports and exports of merchandise goods and oil  -
the visible trade gap - came to Pounds 1.003bn in September, compared with
Pounds 347m in August.
Even though the low August deficit is regarded as a statistical 'blip', the
relatively large gap in September suggests the recent narrowing this year in
the difference between imports and exports could reverse.
Imports were valued at Pounds 11.3bn in September, up 4 per cent on August,
while exports came to Pounds 10.3bn, down 2 per cent on the previous month.
According to the seasonally adjusted numbers from the Central Statistical
Office, the trade gap for the first nine months of the year was Pounds
8.522bn, compared with Pounds 13.406bn for the whole of 1992.
In last week's Budget statement the Treasury predicted a trade deficit of
Pounds 11.5bn for the whole of this year, narrowing slightly to Pounds 11bn
next year.
The CSO said that taking into account the 'oddball' August deficit figure
and other trends, the visible trade deficit 'continues to narrow slightly'
compared with last year.
In the third quarter the deficit was Pounds 2.390bn, after Pounds 3.056bn in
the previous three months, and was the lowest quarterly number since early
1991.
Excluding oil and erratic items such as aircraft, ships and gems, the gap
between imports and exports for the third quarter was Pounds 3.583bn, after
Pounds 4.311bn in the second quarter. In September, the deficit measured in
this manner was Pounds 1.298bn, up from Pounds 761m in August. In the third
quarter the trade gap for manufactured goods was Pounds 1,174bn, compared
with Pounds 1,678bn in the second quarter.
Although all trade figures this year have been affected by teething problems
with a new European Union system of measuring imports and exports, the CSO
said it was 'confident' the third quarter numbers were sound. On a volume
basis, which adjusts for price movements, exports excluding oil and
erratics, rose 2 per cent in the third quarter compared with the previous
three months, while the same measure of import volumes was flat. In the year
to the third quarter of this year, exports on a corresponding basis expanded
3.5 per cent, while import growth was just 0.5 per cent.
The figures indicate that Britain's trade with other EU countries has been
better than with nations in the rest of the world. In the third quarter
exports to the rest of the EU were slightly higher than imports to the tune
of Pounds 3m, while with countries outside the region, imports exceeded
exports by Pounds 2.393bn.
In the third quarter export volumes to the rest of the EU, excluding oil and
erratics, rose 2.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter, while
imports declined 1.5 per cent.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Nuclear group mounts policy drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Nuclear, the state-owned utility, yesterday risked the wrath of the
government by launching a high-profile campaign promoting an energy policy
which 'balances the merits of the market with long-term sustainability'.
The campaign, involving newspaper advertisements and the mailing to MPs and
large companies of a 20-page document, comes as the government prepares to
publish the terms of its long-promised review of the nuclear industry.
Ministers are likely to view the campaign as an attack on their stated
policy of relying on market forces to determine the sort of energy Britain
uses.
The launch of Scottish Nuclear's campaign comes just two weeks after the
government rebuked Nuclear Electric for pressing for privatisation of the
industry.
Mr James Hann, Scottish Nuclear chairman, said yesterday that the market
framework needed to be adjusted to consider long-term energy concerns
arising from population growth and global warming.
He said there was a danger that the UK would become too reliant on gas for
its energy needs, with a steady decline in nuclear, coal and renewable
electricity generation.
Gas prices were likely to rise as a result, but by then it could be too late
to go back to coal or nuclear generation.
Scottish Nuclear is advocating an 'independent and accountable energy agency
with the task of formulating and implementing a long-term energy strategy'.
It suggests a 'capacity auctions' system by which bidders would be invited
to submit tenders to build particular types of generation plant. Potential
bidders could involve both the private and public sectors.

Employers in fact recruited more graduates in 1992; the increased
unemployment rate was caused by an rise of 9.7 per cent in graduate numbers.
Ms Wallis said unemployment rates for school-leavers showed there was still
a strong incentive for sixth-formers to apply to university. The survey says
pupils who leave schools in England and Wales with A-levels are twice as
likely as a graduate to be unemployed and unqualified school-leavers three
times as likely.
Despite this, the association claims that the rising graduate unemployment
figures of the last few years have deterred many employable graduates from
applying for jobs.
Universities appeared to be taking vocational qualifications more seriously,
with the proportion of BTec students continuing in higher education
increasing from 29.8 per cent in 1990 to 51.7 per cent in 1992.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Eurotunnel to take to the air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel, the operator of the channel tunnel, has been awarded a special
commercial radio licence to broadcast travel news and music along the M20
motorway in Kent.
Channel Travel Radio, funded wholly by Eurotunnel, was awarded the
restricted service licence for eight years by the Radio Authority. 'It's a
service for Eurotunnel passengers, but we are required to give information
about ferries too,' the company said yesterday.
The licence was one of four awarded yesterday by the authority. By far the
largest was a new licence for central Scotland, the last of five new
regional commercial licences to be awarded this year.
The licence went to Central Scotland Radio, a company backed by Grampian
Television. The new station, which plans to broadcast a mixture of talk and
adult contemporary music, will cover Glasgow and Edinburgh and the areas
around and between, reaching around 2.3m people. The Radio Authority also
awarded two local radio licences for Manchester. Faze FM Radio will
broadcast dance music and Fortune will offer easy listening music.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Change to Serps rebates proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax rebates to encourage contracting out of the State Earnings Related
Pension Scheme should grow as individuals age, in order to prevent them from
re-entering the state scheme, a government paper proposed yesterday.
The proposals have concerned life insurance companies because the present
system of flat-rate rebates has boosted sales of personal pensions to young
people. Flat-rate rebates - where personal pension holders aged under 30 are
entitled to an additional rebate of National Insurance contributions - allow
young people to buy better pension benefits than if they remained in Serps.
The life industry estimates that one-half to two-thirds of all personal
pensions rely solely on the National Insurance contribution rebate for
financing.
The Department of Social Security estimates that only 750,000 of Britain's
5m personal pension policyholders are aged 40 or over.
In its paper, the department outlines three options for setting age-related
rebates: an incrementally larger rebate as individuals age; banding several
ages with a single rebate rate; or a hybrid scheme combining both options.
The government is seeking comments on its proposals by January 15.
The paper notes that any move to age-related rebates would increase the
administrative burdens of pension providers by requiring them to keep
documentary evidence of each scheme member's age.
The first option, that of setting a different tax rebate for each age, is
the fairest, according to the document, and the most cost-effective for the
government in that it could ensure that personal pensions were attractive to
all age groups. But administering 49 separate tax-rebate structures could
'place a significant new burden on business' for employer-sponsored schemes.
The second option, age bands of, for example, five years, might create a
situation where individuals found it advantageous to switch periodically
between Serps and private provision. That would also raise some issues of
'best advice' required under the Financial Services Act for financial
advisers, although the burden on employer-sponsored schemes would be lower
than under the first option.
A hybrid scheme could operate by having two broad age bands and continuing a
flat-rate rebate for people under 35 years. Five-year age bands would apply
to those over 35. The scheme would ensure that the majority of working
people would find a non-state pension attractive.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Labour wins first battle in MPs' war of attrition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday won the first skirmish in the war of attrition it has
declared against the government - though the general who had sounded the
battle cry late on Thursday night, Mr John Smith, was away in Ulster and
missed the action.
Leftwing hardliners succeeded in halting a Commons debate on a Tory motion
on business and industry, giving a measure proposed by Mr Ken Livingstone,
the hard-left MP for London's Brent East, some unexpected debating time.
This small but morale-boosting victory came only 12 hours after the party
announced it was breaking off all relations with the government.
The move was in protest at government plans to curtail debate on bills
implementing changes to statutory sick pay and National Insurance
contributions.
Under Labour's protest even non-contentious legislation is being obstructed
and the practice of 'pairing' will end.
Pairing permits MPs to miss a vote by being linked to a member in an
opposing party who agrees to be absent as well. The system is often used
late at night and on relatively uncontentious issues.
It means in practice that hard-pressed government ministers and MPs in
distant constituencies can get away with less time in Westminster than would
otherwise be needed.
Government business managers believe the cushion provided by the
government's 17-strong overall majority means that Labour's gesture will be
an inconvenience rather than a serious problem. Senior government ministers
will almost certainly not have to be bundled out of important international
meetings and into Concorde to register a vote on relatively humdrum matters.
Managers believe there will be little effect on next week's proceedings  -
which include the two guillotined bills - since much of it is subject to a
three-line whip, meaning that pairing would not be permitted. MPs are in any
case due to depart at the end of next week for their Christmas recess,
returning on January 11.
While Labour's declaration of war is not time-limited, government business
managers think hostilities are unlikely to be extended far into the new year
 -not least because the new situation will also inconvenience Labour.
One Scottish Labour MP said last night that the additional hours in
Westminster would not enable him to cut his constituency workload but would
mean he would be more 'worn out' than usual when he undertook it. Another
Labour MP said the decision to sever relations was 'a pain in the backside'.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Sacked printers lose test case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sacked workers at JW Arrowsmith, the Bristol printing company which has been
picketed for nearly eight months, have had their claim for unfair dismissal
rejected by an industrial tribunal.
About 120 staff - the majority of the workforce - were dismissed in April in
a dispute over pay and conditions.
Three of the printers, supported by their union the GPMU, brought what was
regarded as a test case to the tribunal. After a nine-day hearing the
tribunal ruled it did not have jurisdiction because the three had been
offered their jobs back.
Arrowsmith had offered to re-employ the workers at their previous pay, but
said it would no longer recognise the union. It had said it could not afford
to meet the demand for a Pounds 6.50 a week pay rise and the workers were
dismissed after taking industrial action.
Mr John Price, GPMU branch officer, said yesterday that the picketing would
continue while the situation was reassessed.
'Obviously we are disappointed we have lost the first round,' he said. 'We
will be taking legal advice and the general secretary will decide how to
progress the dispute. Even at this late stage, we want a negotiated
settlement.'

FT  11 DEC 93 / Threat to 400 jobs in defence research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A further 400 jobs are likely to be cut at the government-owned Defence
Research Agency in addition to the loss of 2,000 jobs announced just over a
year ago, David White writes.
The agency said it was disbanding its engineering services branch as a
separate unit because of a rapid drop in demand from business clients. This
meant that 470 jobs were 'likely to become surplus'. However, the agency
said some of these jobs would have been lost anyway under the 1992 cuts.
The agency, formed in 1991 from four defence research establishments,
employs about 10,500 people.
The engineering cuts affect eight sites, with the biggest reduction
involving 114 jobs at Pyestock, Hampshire. Plans for market testing in the
engineering unit and possibly moving it to the private sector will be
abandoned.
Final recommendations on the reductions will be put to ministers in January
after consultations with staff and unions.

FT  11 DEC 93 / BNF raises Thorp charges by 3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Nuclear Fuels has warned foreign customers of its Thorp reprocessing
plant that they will face a 3 per cent price increase because of the
government's delay in deciding whether to give the plant permission to
operate.
The final cost of commissioning the plant has risen by Pounds 130m to Pounds
359m because of the delay, according to BNF's October business plan, a copy
of which has been obtained by the Financial Times. BNF has sent the business
plan to Thorp's overseas customers with 'cost-pass-through' contracts which
specify that customers will pay if costs rise above the level budgeted.
BNF said yesterday that its customers were anxious for the plant to start
soon and that none had challenged the increase in charges.
A government announcement that the Pounds 2.8bn plant, which will reprocess
used or 'spent' nuclear fuel, will get a licence to start operating is
expected before parliament rises at the end of next week. An announcement
was planned this week, but the government has been concerned to minimise the
chances of environmental pressure groups overturning the decision in the
courts.
BNF originally expected to press the start button a year ago. Its claims
about the delay costs have been contested by environmental groups.
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group which has been most prominent
in campaigning against the plant, said yesterday that the business plan
raised questions about BNF's claims that the delay was costing money as it
showed that much of the costs were passed on to customers. But BNF says that
it can reclaim only a third of the total delay costs, which it estimates at
more than Pounds 150m.
BNF added that because it had cut its workforce while waiting for a licence,
the costs of delay - after passing on as much as possible to customers - had
fallen to some Pounds 1.5m a week. In June, BNF said that each week of delay
cost it Pounds 2.4m.
The business plan also shows that even where the cost-pass-through contracts
apply, BNF can pass on only some 93 per cent of cost increases. The delay
has pushed the cost of reprocessing a kilogramme of uranium fuel from Pounds
721 to Pounds 746 in current money values, a rise of 3.5 per cent. However,
unit prices charged to customers have risen from Pounds 852 to Pounds 876, a
rise of 2.8 per cent.
Greenpeace said: 'There are so many contradictory figures about Thorp's
economics. That shows that the only reasonable course of action is a full
public inquiry.'

FT  11 DEC 93 / Rise of 25% in NHS managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political arguments over the growth in the number of National Health Service
managers will be intensified by official figures showing a further rise of
nearly 25 per cent last year.
The 24.9 per cent increase in general and senior managers between 1991 and
1992 compares with a 1 per cent rise in hospital medical staff, and a 0.8
per cent drop to 971,000 in total hospital and community health service
staff levels.
The Department of Health said yesterday that relatively little of the growth
stemmed directly from the government's NHS reforms.
Opposition MPs have expressed concern that the NHS is spending too much on
administration. Publication of yesterday's figures follows a government
announcement this week that the cost of providing cars in the NHS rose from
Pounds 53.7m to Pounds 70m between 1991-92 and 1992-93. There were also
claims - based on parliamentary answers - by Mr Alan Milburn, Labour MP for
Darlington, that the service had spent an extra Pounds 1.5bn on managers,
administrators and clerical staff in the past four years.
Yesterday's figures show that by last year there were 16,860 general and
senior managers in England, compared with 13,500 a year earlier. The NHS's
management structure was reformed in the 1980s, making valid comparisons
with earlier years difficult - there were, for example, only 710 general and
senior managers in 1987.
The department said that about 62 per cent of last year's growth resulted
from what had 'in effect been a redefinition of the group'. Senior-manager
terms and conditions had been extended to other staff groups.
According to the government, only 14 per cent of the increase arose from
trust hospitals expanding their management teams as they took on new
responsibilities under the 1991 NHS reforms. Another 15 per cent, it said,
could be explained by measures to strengthen financial, personnel and
information functions in the service.
Hospital, public-health and community-health medical and dental staff in
England grew by 15 per cent between 1982 and 1992 to 62,080.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Branson ready to launch non-profit bid for lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Branson is to launch a bid to run the National Lottery on a
non-profit making basis.
Mr Branson has been working for some time on a plan for a commercial
operating company which would hand profits to a charitable foundation.
He has always emphasised that he would only bid against rivals such as The
Great British Lottery Company and Camelot to run the multi-billion-pound
lottery if he was certain he could offer a wholly commercial package.
Mr Branson's company will be the only one of the eight interested parties
identified so far which will be bidding on a non-profit basis.
Mr Branson declined to comment yesterday, although an announcement is
expected next week. He has always made it clear that he believes the lottery
should devote all its profits to good causes.
The lottery is designed to raise money for five 'good causes' in equal
proportions - the arts, charities, the national heritage, a millennium fund
and sport.
The British proposal to hand the running of a national lottery entirely to
the private sector is unusual by international standards.
The Lottery Promotion Company, a lobbying group, argued recently: 'The
government believes that the lottery will only achieve its full potential
income if commercial profit is the motive of its operators, when a
charitable basis for the operating company might yield more money and more
enlightenment for the nation.'
Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the National Lottery, will publish the
final version of the invitation to apply and the draft licence the week
after next.
Meanwhile, the winner of broadcasting rights to the National Lottery will
face a problem over television coverage.
Most bidders have assumed that one of the main marketing tools in
establishing the lottery will be a weekly prime-time television programme,
which would build up to the draw for the multi-million-pound prizewinners.
The Independent Television Commission has warned the National Heritage
Department that under existing rules such a programme would be impossible on
ITV or Channel 4.
The ITC view is that the lottery is a commercial product and that a
programme entirely devoted to the subject would amount to product placement,
which would be ruled out by the 1990 Broadcasting Act.
The BBC said yesterday that it was keen to carry information on the National
Lottery as a public service.

Centrebank, the direct banking arm of Bank of Scotland, has launched what is
believed to be the first loan scheme for homeowners caught in negative
equity who are not existing customers.
A mortgage for a new property can be provided with a loan covering the
deposit on the new house and the shortfall between the outstanding mortgage
and the selling price of the old property. The loan is secured against the
surrender value of an existing life policy. Borrowing is at 0.5 of a
percentage point above Centrebank's variable mortgage rate.
Abbey National has launched a negative equity scheme for existing borrowers.
Up to Pounds 25,000 of negative equity can be transfered to a new mortgage.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Lautro probes high-income ads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lautro, the self-regulatory organisation for the life assurance industry,
yesterday told its members to send in advertising and marketing material for
high-income products, so it could investigate whether investors had been
misled.
Its guidance said that where an investigation confirmed that investors might
not have fully understood the product they bought, then companies must take
remedial action, which might include sending further information.
The move follows advice to members earlier in the week from Fimbra, the
self-regulating organisation for financial advisers, and a similar guidance
note a few weeks ago from Imro, the regulator for the fund management
industry.
Fimbra's guidance did not mention the prospect of an inquiry, and the
organisation is not calling in marketing material from members.
It is, however, expected to take action next week against one of its
members. Following an intermediary's distribution of misleading marketing
material, Fimbra is likely to insist that a correction and advice to
customers about what steps to take are published prominently in the clients'
newsletter.
Regulators are particularly concerned that misleading comparisons may be
drawn with the rates of return from forms of savings such as building
society accounts.
One of the reasons high-income products have become popular is that
investors have looked for ways to replace the income they have lost as
interest rates on personal savings have fallen.
But some products will not repay capital in full unless conditions - such as
stock market growth - are met.
The differing and overlapping responses from regulators to this issue will
reinforce the argument for the single regulator in this area - the personal
investment authority - which is scheduled to start next year.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Milk marketing reforms thrown out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday put at risk plans to open up the milk market in
England and Wales to competition by next April by throwing out proposals by
the Milk Marketing Board to turn itself into Milk Marque, a farmers'
voluntary co-operative.
Farmers fear the widespread criticisms of the board's reorganisation plans
voiced yesterday by the government will put back the timetable for freeing
up the market.
The reorganisation plans represent the greatest shake-up in the milk
business since the board was created 60 years ago. But the government is
afraid that proposals by the board could restrict the development of
competition as they would in effect control the bulk of supplies in the new
market.
Mr Richard Packer, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture,
yesterday told the board that it should hold talks with dairy companies
which have condemned the reorganisation scheme.
The government is being forced by Brussels to abolish the milk board, which
acts as an intermediary in the market by buying up all milk from farmers and
selling it on to dairies. But the board's plans to transform itself into a
co-operative have fallen foul of the European Commission's competition
authorities.
The commission indicated earlier this week that it was not happy with plans
to transfer the bulk of the board's assets directly to the proposed Milk
Marque, saying this needed further investigation.
Mr Andrew Dare, set to become chief executive of Milk Marque, has promised
farmers higher prices for their milk if they join him in April  - saying
prices will rise because the UK does not produce enough milk for its own
needs. His plans to sign up 80 per cent of producers will still give him
great power in the new market.
The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents wholesale milk purchasers, has
criticised the proposed Milk Marque stranglehold on the market and stressed
that its arrangements for milk sales from April are unworkable.
The government yesterday asked the board to look again at its proposals for
an auction system as a way of rationing milk supplies to the highest bidder.
It also queried the transfer of certain assets such as National Milk
Records, the milk testing laboratories, and the breeding advisory service to
the new co-operative.
Mr Packer called into question proposals for transferring all haulage
contracts to the new body and proposals on how often producers who sign up
with Milk Marque are allowed to leave it.

FT  11 DEC 93 / OFT presses insurers on life policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life companies should be made to publish how many of those who buy their
products cancel them in the early years, Sir Bryan Carsberg, the
director-general of fair trading, said yesterday.
The proportion of life insurance policies lapsing after just a few years has
been a driving force behind demands for the industry to provide better
information to customers.
Surveys have suggested that on average 30 per cent of policies were
terminated in two years with a loss to the consumer, implying that many
products had been sold to people for whom they were not suitable.
Sir Bryan's call ended a week in which the life insurance industry was
fiercely criticised over how personal pensions were sold to people
transferring out of employers' schemes. The Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief watchdog, has launched an inquiry.
'Over-selling or mis-selling of pension policies and endowments is now
referred to as a 'national scandal',' Sir Bryan told the British Insurance
Law Association.
'Disclosure would put public pressure on companies to review their selling
practices and it would signal to regulators which ones were over-selling,'
he said.
His renewed attack on current practice in the industry came as SIB finalised
its plans detailing how life sales agents must tell prospective customers
about the products they sell and their commission rates.
It has dropped the idea of using a graph to show policy charges. Instead, it
has combined the two approaches put forward during the consultation process.
SIB's board will meet on Thursday to approve the new rules, which will go to
the Treasury before Christmas.
On the basis of market research, SIB now proposes that sales agents should
give prospective life insurance customers a four-page document, starting
with a statement of the policy's aims and the customers commitments and
risks. It would then go into a question and answer format on the 'key
features' of the product.
The document will include two short tables, one giving information such as
surrender value and charges in each of the first five years, and the other
giving similar information at five-yearly intervals over the length of the
policy.
SIB's board must also decide whether to support their officials in
recommending that the requirement to disclose commissions should apply not
only to life insurance but to term assurance policies as well.

Angered by repeated Serb blockades of fuel to Bosnian government

Serb-held parts of Bosnia, writes Laura Silber from Belgrade.
'The Bosnian Serbs  ..agreed to these deliveries. They have now reneged on
the deal,' the UNHCR said yesterday.
Despite another pledge in Geneva last week by the leaders of the three
warring parties to allow free access for relief convoys, the Bosnian Serbs
yesterday again blocked a convoy headed for Gorazde, the desperate Moslem
enclave in south-eastern Bosnia designated a UN 'safe area'.

Mexico's Congress has approved legislation that will formally give the
central bank independence from the government, writes Damian Fraser in
Mexico City. The bank's fundamental objective will be to maintain the
purchasing power of the currency.
The new law gives the central bank control over monetary policy, and
severely limits the credit it can extend to the federal government. This is
intended to ensure that government budget deficits do not lead to an
expansion in the monetary base, and a rise in inflation. However, exchange
rate policy will be determined by a commission made up of the central bank
and the Finance Ministry, in which the ministry has the power of veto.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Les Aspin, the US defence secretary, yesterday announced plans to cut the
army reserve and National Guard troop strength by 100,000 over the next five
years, writes George Graham from Washington. The plan to cut the army
reserves to 575,000 in 1999 drew reluctant support from reserve officers and
influential members of Congress who have blocked previous attempts by the
Pentagon to shrink the reserve in line with the reduction in the overall
size of US armed forces.
Some analysts estimate these cuts could save as much as Dollars 2bn a year
when fully phased in, at a time when bad inflation forecasts and Congress's
decision to raise military pay have left the Pentagon Dollars 40bn-Dollars
50bn short of what it believes it needs over the next five years to maintain
its desired force structure.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Monetary Fund credits for Hungary have been put on hold just
three months after it concluded a standby agreement with Budapest, writes
Nicholas Denton from Budapest.
Local and IMF officials said yesterday Hungary would not this month be
drawing down the second tranche of the 18-month SDR340m (Pounds 320m) credit
package concluded in September. World Bank structural adjustment credits are
also delayed.
Budapest, anxious to maintain appearances before international capital
markets and an electorate which will judge the conservative coalition's
economic policies in elections next year, denied that it amounted to a
suspension of Hungary's IMF agreement. The official explanation is that the
central bank's record Dollars 6.1bn (Pounds 4bn) reserves obviates the need
for IMF support.
But the IMF drew attention to deteriorating economic indicators. The
agreement assumed a current account deficit of Dollars 1.5bn this year but
the latest unofficial forecasts put the shortfall at Dollars 3bn, or about 9
per cent of GDP. The government's implied budget deficit for 1994,
equivalent to 6.2 per cent of GDP, is also overshooting the IMF target of
5.4 per cent.
Mr Jozsef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister, has suffered a relapse in
his long-running illness, raising new questions about his ability to lead
Hungary's governing conservative coalition into elections next spring. An
official communique announced yesterday that Mr Antall, who is 61 and
receiving treatment for cancer, had developed heart complications.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Rome agrees steel reforms with EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy and the European Commission yesterday agreed restructuring plans for
the Italian steel industry, which could clear the way for an overall rescue
plan for Europe's troubled steelmakers.
The plans are now likely to be put to European Union industry ministers at a
special meeting next Friday, where they will require unanimous approval.
Discord between Rome and Brussels was the main reason why EU ministers
failed to agree a deal on subsidies for European state-owned steel producers
last month.
The chances of unanimous agreement on state aid to the Italian, Spanish,
Portuguese and east German industries at next week's meeting will now depend
on other member states, notably Britain.
Yesterday's agreement followed a meeting between Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,
the Italian prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president.
The agreement was struck yesterday morning by Mr Karel Van Miert,
competition commissioner, and Mr Paolo Savona, Italian industry minister.
Under the deal, Ilva, the Italian steelmaker that is to be privatised, will
no longer have to close a third reheating furnace at its Taranto plant in
southern Italy.
But to maintain the balance between capacity cuts and subsidies, any private
buyer of Taranto would be forced to close 500,000 tonnes of capacity in its
own flat product activities.
Agreement on state aid to the steel industry is essential to trigger a
co-operative programme of production cuts by private steelmakers, which have
been suffering from lack of demand and overcapacity.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Russians urged to reject neo-fascists: Elections in Russia

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's Choice, the radical pro-government reform bloc, yesterday urged
rival democratic parties to help it fend off the danger posed by the
neo-fascist leader, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, while the government attempted
to woo the electorate with last-minute tax breaks.
After polls showed his neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party might become the
second largest party in the new parliament to be elected on Sunday, Russia's
Choice issued a statement saying 'if it has all been a joke to you so far,
then now it really is frightening'.
Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, a key figure in Russia's Choice, which started off
the campaign by refusing to take Mr Zhirinovsky seriously, even went as far
as saying Mr Zhirinovsky could become president by next autumn.
But Mr Poltoranin, who is particularly given to hyperbole, did not give
details of how this scenario might come about, using it rather as a rallying
call to urge leaders of other democratic parties to persuade their
supporters to back Russia's Choice.
Meanwhile, the government, many of whose members are leading candidates for
Russia's Choice, approved a law on personal income tax, designed to attract
additional votes. It raised the threshold of tax-deductible income for each
member of a household to a minimum wage level of Rbs14,000 a month. In a
decision of interest to foreign companies and Russia's rich alike, it
confirmed that top bracket tax-payers, which include most western
expatriates, would not see their tax rate increased to 40 per cent next
year, as originally sought by the Finance Ministry, but would continue to be
charged 30 per cent.
A decree doubling pensions for 90 per cent of pensioners is also expected to
be signed by President Boris Yeltsin before the elections. Mr Sergei
Alexashenko, deputy finance minister, said it would cost the government
Rbs765bn a month - a very large amount given that the budget deficit for the
fourth quarter of this year alone is projected at Rbs5,500bn. In another
boost for the government, miners in the arctic region of Vorkuta yesterday
called off a strike begun on Monday, presumably after concessions from the
government in a pay dispute.
Meanwhile, Mr Boris Fyodorov, continuing to express confidence that Russia's
Choice would do well on Sunday, yesterday threatened to resign unless
President Yeltsin sacked Mr Victor Geraschenko as central bank chairman
after the elections. 'Either I am right or Victor Vladimirovich
(Gerashchenko) is right,' he said, referring to their conflict over whether
Mr Fyodorov's financial austerity measures are what Russia needs.

Italy's powerful engineering unions yesterday staged a one day strike to
highlight the growing number of plant closures and lay-offs, writes Robert
Graham from Rome.
Union leaders also threatened similar action in January if the government
and employers failed to respond with measures to help offset the employment
crisis.
Demonstrations were staged in all Italy's main industrial cities with 15,000
marching through the centre of Rome shouting angry slogans demanding job
protection and a new industrial strategy.
The protest was held against the backdrop of two benchmark sets of
negotiations over job losses and lay-offs - at Fiat's cars division and at
Olivetti, the computer and office equipment group.
Fiat is proposing to lay off 10 per cent of its car workforce for two years
as of January and is seeking a 5 per cent cut in jobs. Olivetti is seeking
to prune a further 2,000 jobs from its 18,000 strong Italian workforce.
In recent protests Fiat plants have been little affected. But yesterday
there was 80 per cent adherence to the strike call at Arese near Milan, the
Fiat plant most at risk of closure.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jewish settlers seeking to sabotage the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
shot dead three Palestinian civilians yesterday in Hebron, the main focus of
the recent upsurge in violence in the occupied West Bank.
The murders came less than 72 hours before Israel was due to begin a troop
withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho under
the terms of the outline peace accord.
They are certain to exacerbate tensions between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation.
In a fresh sign of the continuing disarray inside the PLO, Mrs Hanan
Ashrawi, who had risen to prominence as spokeswoman for the Palestinian
delegation at the Washington peace negotiations, resigned yesterday.
Mrs Ashrawi has long been identified with a growing body of senior
Palestinians deeply critical of the leadership style of Mr Yassir Arafat,
the PLO chairman. She announced she was going to set up a human rights
watchdog to monitor the new self-governing authority in the occupied
territories.
The killings in Hebron overshadowed last-minute efforts by the PLO and
Israel to resolve outstanding differences on implementing the peace accord.
Since the agreement was signed on September 13, 38 Palestinians and 18
Israelis have been killed.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, confirmed yesterday in Tunis
that Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Arafat would meet in
Cairo tomorrow in a last minute effort to break the deadlock before Monday's
deadline for the beginning of Israeli military withdrawal.
Israel and the PLO remain deeply divided over the size of the Jericho area,
control of border crossings and the future role of Israeli troops in
Palestinian areas.
Israel radio said a Jewish caller claimed the Hebron triple murder was in
revenge for the killing on Monday of an Israeli settler by the militant
Islamic Hamas movement. In Gaza yesterday, Palestinians wounded two
Israelis.
Israel has said it will not let Arab-Jewish violence jeopardise the peace
process. Gen Ehud Barak, army chief of staff, was quoted as saying troops
were on a war footing to combat both Palestinian and Israeli extremists.
Many believe the longer a formal protocol between the PLO and Israel is
delayed the more extremists will try to exploit the vacuum.
Mrs Ashrawi, a professor of English literature, denied her resignation was a
protest against Mr Arafat's leadership. 'You have a leadership which has
been in exile and a people which has been under occupation ..and the
prospect of merging these two and creating a democratic system is a source
of fear,' she said.

Russia

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KRASNOYARSK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Straddling the Trans-Siberian railway, exactly half-way between Russia's
European west and its Asian east, the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk speaks
for the Russian heartland.
In the fight for the great Russian middle, Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the
reformist Russia's Choice bloc, kicked off his campaign there. Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist candidate, did better, visiting the city three
times, and all of Russia's other leading politicians have been careful to
include Krasnoyarsk on their whistle-stop tours of the country.
'We are in the middle of Russia, so we reflect the middle Russian view,' the
energetic young governor of the region, Mr Valeri Zubov, says proudly. 'The
way Krasnoyarsk votes is the way Russia votes.'
But the hardy inhabitants of this frozen region - the centre of Russia's
gold rush in the 1830s and later a place of exile for political dissidents -
have developed a powerful aversion to the blandishments of the capital's
politicians.
Belying their city's name, which translates literally as 'red and
passionate', the citizens of Krasnoyarsk appear largely indifferent to the
forthcoming parliamentary elections and constitutional referendum. Everyone
is heartily sick of what are commonly described as 'the political games'
being played thousands of miles away in Moscow and would prefer to get down
to the difficult business of surviving in Russia's crumbling economy.
'Nothing decided in Moscow has any effect on us here,' says Mr Sergei
Dyakov, a moustachioed 30-year-old machinist who works at one of the city's
chemical factories, as he patiently stands in a queue to buy sausage.' In
our country, laws have less value than the paper on which they are printed,
so I don't plan to vote for any of the candidates or on the constitution,'
Mr Dyakov says.
Mr Ivan Chupriyanov, the barrel-chested director of an alumina factory on
the wind-swept Siberian steppes 250km north-west of Krasnoyarsk, heartily
agrees. 'The past three years,' he says, 'have progressively taught us not
to be political.'
This indifference to party politics is reflected in the decision of many
local politicians to run for seats in parliament on the basis of their
personal reputations rather than party affiliation.
Yet if eyes in Krasnoyarsk roll heavenward when the subject is politics, the
interest in the economy is avid. As in the the rest of Russia, the area is
beginning to feel the pinch of finance minister Boris Fyodorov's tight grip
over the government's purse strings.
In a region where entire cities were built up in isolated areas to serve the
needs of a single factory, the repercussions of this policy are particularly
grim. Unable to pay for fuel, dozens of towns - in areas where January
temperatures regularly drop below minus 40'F - are cutting off domestic
heating. Cash-strapped Krasnoyarsk enterprises are typically at least three
months behind in paying workers' salaries.
Unsurprisingly, this financial crunch means pressed factory directors admit
their political sympathies lie with the left.
Asked whether he prefers the more moderate reforms advocated by Mr Grigory
Yavlinsky over the fast-track approach of Mr Gaidar, Mr Yegor Demianenko,
director of an oil refinery in Achinsk, a city 250km north of Krasnoyarsk,
is offended.
'Are you trying to insult me?' replies the manager, whose refinery, now
operating at less than 50 per cent capacity and running debts of more than
40bn roubles, is one of only two employers in a town of 130,000. 'Both of
them are terrible.' Although he probably won't bother going to the polls at
all, Mr Demianenko says that if he did vote it would be for the centrist
bloc led by fellow industrialist, Mr Arkady Volsky.

central rate from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent and broke the close link
between the franc and the D-Mark. But on Wednesday, after a period of
gathering strength, the French currency breached its previous floor rate of
FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark. It has since traded at around FFr3.4250.
The rise of the franc has been greeted with quiet satisfaction in France's
financial ministries. But it raises several questions; from the reasons for
the rise, to the implications for monetary policy should the franc retain
its vigour.
For French government officials, the franc's fortunes require little
explanation. They have always said the franc's rate within the ERM is
justified by economic fundamentals. They point to France's low inflation
rate, which stands at an annual rate of just over 2 per cent, and the
competitiveness of French industry, which will contribute to a trade surplus
forecast to reach FFr70bn (Pounds 8bn) this year.
Private-sector economists agree that economic factors are underpinning the
franc. But they add that the fundamentals have become influential only as a
result of the collapse of the old exchange rate system. 'In the world of
narrow bands what mattered was the need to keep interest rates high to stay
pegged to the D-Mark,' says Mr Paul Chertkow, head of currency research at
UBS in London. 'With 15 per cent bands it is fundamentals that count.'
For Mr Chertkow and other economists, the fundamentals are pointing in
favour of the franc. 'France clearly leads Germany in the economic cycle,'
says Mr Bernard Godement, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute
in Paris. In this respect the rise of the franc is part of a broader
reappraisal of the D-Mark, which has seen the German currency weaken against
other European currencies.
There are other reasons cited for the rise. The prospect of a deal in the
Gatt trade talks has eased fears about protectionism. Technical factors are
also important. Many currency traders took positions against the franc at
FFr3.4180 to the D-Mark, the rate initially defended by the French monetary
authorities in the battle against the foreign exchange markets. As the franc
again approaches these levels, traders have moved to unwind their positions.
Whether the franc maintains its strength is a hazardous prediction. But the
prospect of a continued easing in German monetary policy as inflationary
pressures weaken, and a revival, if faltering, in the French economy, should
support the French currency. The question then, is how the French
authorities respond.
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, and his political
colleagues are unlikely to rush to reinstate the narrow ERM bands. They are
content with the current arrangement, which presents currency speculators
with a 'two-way risk' by removing the fixed targets set by the former
limits. French officials also suggest that the goal of a single European
currency requires only that currencies follow 'normal' bands for two years,
under the terms laid down in the Maastricht treaty on European union.
An acceleration of interest rate cuts in France, in the near term at least,
is similarly regarded as unlikely. 'We should not expect a change in their
cautious approach,' says Mr Christopher Potts, economist at Banque Indosuez
in Paris, referring to the gradual steps towards lower borrowing costs since
the currency crisis. The low-key response by French officials following the
franc's return to its narrow bands supports this view.
A sustained rally in the franc could, however, provide the scope and even
the need for a more independent stance. Mr Godement argues that the French
monetary authorities will be confronted by 'a clear trend towards an
increase of the external value of the currency', presenting them with the
choice between a rising franc or a faster monetary easing than in other
countries. Given the desire for stability of the currency, and the fact that
GDP growth remains below potential, the decision could be in favour of more
rapid cuts in borrowing costs.
For French monetary officials such a scenario represents an enticing
prospect. But even without further appreciation, most economists believe the
intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, can be brought down to
about 4.5 per cent next year from 6.2 per cent now. For the moment, Mr
Trichet and his colleagues will be more than satisfied to see the franc
settle safely back in its former home.

Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, has been forced to
postpone for a second time an official decision on lifting the ban on rice
imports, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Mr Hosokawa had intended to make an announcement yesterday, but was forced
to reschedule because of opposition from the socialist party, a member of
the seven-party coalition.
Japan is expected to agree to accept limited imports for six years and then
introduce tariffs.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Cheaper oil holds down US inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 2.7 per cent in the
year to November, indicating that the accelerating pace of economic growth
is not yet putting much upward pressure on inflation.
The rise in the index was restrained by a 1.3 per cent decline in energy
costs between October and November, reflecting recent falls in world oil
prices.
Excluding the volatile components of food and energy, the 'core' consumer
price index rose 0.3 per cent, in line with analysts' projections. The
annual rate of core inflation was 3.1 per cent.
The service sector continues to lag behind other industries in containing
inflationary pressures. In the year to November services prices were up 3.6
per cent against 1.5 per cent for goods. Goods-price inflation is being kept
in check partly by a strong rebound in US productivity. Revised figures this
week showed productivity grew at 4.3 per cent a year in the third quarter,
stronger than in previous recoveries.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Gatt clash over US tax is defused
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A row over potential US tax discrimination against foreign companies, which
for three weeks has threatened agreement over the Uruguay Round of talks on
international trade reform, was settled in Geneva yesterday.
After a full week of negotiation, headed on the US side by Mr Les Samuels,
US assistant secretary for tax affairs at the Treasury, the US has agreed to
abandon threats to exempt itself in the Uruguay Round deal from a commitment
to treat foreign and local companies in a non-discriminatory way in so far
as tax policies affect trade.
The Uruguay Round text to which the US had objected has been amended to the
satisfaction of all 116 countries involved in negotiating the round.
The commitment to 'national treatment' - treating foreign companies exactly
the same as local companies - is a founding principle of the multilateral
trading principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The US
threat to exempt itself from the obligation to provide national treatment
for tax purposes provoked a storm among Gatt negotiators just three weeks
ago.
Alongside US threats to offer full most favoured nation treatment in
financial services to just 20-or-so trading partners, the row over tax was
seen by many negotiators as bringing into question US commitment to
international trade rules. This breakthrough reduces the list of potential
'round-breaking' disputes. Those remaining include the financial services
issue, US demands that anti-dumping rules be changed, and a US-EU row over
access to Europe's film and television sectors.
Negotiators conceded yesterday that existing bilateral tax agreements allow
governments to treat local and foreign companies differently for tax
purposes. New Gatt rules would only challenge this right if the rules were
seen to be used for protectionist purposes.
US concerns that the new Gatt rules were not clear enough, and that they
raised the danger of Gatt panels being used as 'courts of appeal' against
domestic tax rulings, have been resolved over the week's negotiations.
Similarly, tax issues falling outside the scope of an existing tax treaty -
and therefore potentially subject to arbitration in the Gatt - will be
immunised against Gatt interference. Only future tax treaties face the
prospect of being subject to the new Gatt powers - except if treaties are
specifically drafted to prevent this.

FT  11 DEC 93 / China doubts hit Hong Kong credit rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's most prestigious borrower, the Mass Transit Railway Corp (MTRC),
yesterday had its credit rating cut because of concerns over political
stability in China and their possible impact on the colony.
The decision by Moody's Investor Service to cut the MTRC's rating to A1 from
Aa2 drew swift criticism from the corporation and its sole shareholder, the
Hong Kong government. But the downgrading of the MTRC's debt, and the
official publication of Governor Chris Patten's democracy legislation, had
little effect on stock market sentiment yesterday. Strong foreign buying
pushed the Hang Seng Index to a record close of 10,228.11 - up 237.85, or
2.38 per cent, on the day.
Chief among the complaints of the government was Moody's questioning of the
robustness of the Hong Kong dollar's link with the dollar. Moody's said that
China was likely to go through periods of political uncertainty in the
future and this could affect political stability in Hong Kong. 'The Hong
Kong dollar remains vulnerable to such political crises,' it said.
In September 1983, in response to financial uncertainty caused by
deteriorating Anglo-Chinese relations, the Hong Kong dollar was fixed at
HKDollars 7.8 to USDollars 1.
The government said the link had ensured currency stability for the past 10
years. During that time the Hong Kong dollar had withstood shocks induced by
the 1987 crash in world share prices, the June 1989 Tiananmen 'event' in
Beijing and the 1991 Gulf War.
'We have extremely strong backing for the Hong Kong currency, including
(accumulated reserves) which stood at HKDollars 287bn at the end of 1992 -
among the largest in the world,' the government said.
Mr Roger Moss, MTRC finance director, said Moody's assessment was a
misreading of the protections afforded to Hong Kong by the Basic Law and the
Sino-British Joint Declaration. They give the MTRC's 'creditors considerable
insulation from Chinese sovereign risk,' he said.
At the end of June, the MTRC's outstanding debt amounted to HKDollars
18.8bn, against shareholders' funds of HKDollars 8.2bn.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Jobs hold key to Japan's recovery: A flood of redundancies
could tip the faltering economy over the edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese executives have just begun their annual bonenkai or
'forget-the-year' parties. With profits down and sales slipping, they have
much to forget, but the results of the latest survey of business sentiment
suggests that it will be forced smiles all round when they toast the year
ahead.
The executives will derive little cheer from the surprisingly favourable GDP
figures for the third quarter, which show growth of 0.5 per cent
quarter-on-quarter. For this is seen as a lagging indicator and the Bank of
Japan's quarterly survey of business found that trading conditions have
worsened in the past two months.
Manufacturing companies told the Bank that their sales will fall by an
average of 4.5 per cent this year, that capital spending is being cut by
15.3 per cent, and that they face a growing surplus of labour, which raises
the prospect of an increase in unemployment in coming months.
But the Bank could point to one positive sign. Companies said the lending
attitude of financial institutions has become more 'accommodating' over the
past three months, reducing the pressure on the Bank to cut the official
discount rate from the present record low of 1.75 per cent.
The Bank of Japan has argued that Japanese commercial banks, burdened by bad
property-related loans, are still willing to lend to traditional customers,
but doubts remain about the readiness to lend to companies not regarded as
core customers or in sectors which are suffering most during the downturn.
Officials at the Economic Planning Agency said their greatest concern was
that companies under pressure would be tempted to dismiss employees, leading
to an erosion of consumer confidence and the stalling of economic recovery
in coming months.
The EPA believes that consumers have the resources but not the inclination
to spend, and suspects that there will be a recovery of demand for cars and
electronic products early next year, two sectors which have been a drag on
the economy for much of the past year.
A cut in income taxes is being considered as part of the government's next
stimulatory package, due to be put together from next week, but further
reductions in overtime and bonuses would work against an increase in
consumer confidence. The Bank of Japan's index of excess employment rose
from 19 to 26 over the last three months.
Other indices suggested that the reduction of excess inventories has slowed,
while the surplus of production capacity is increasing. A range of small
manufacturers, the most likely to cut their workforces, reported a sharp
deterioration of business conditions, with industrial machinery makers,
materials companies and textile makers among the least optimistic.
Japan's official forecasters are still hoping for a recovery in the final
months of the fiscal year ending in March, but the Bank of Japan admitted
yesterday that an upturn is more likely to come next fiscal year and that
the economy's fate hinges on conditions in the labour market.
Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities, said business sentiment
tended to be particularly pessimistic at this stage of the economic cycle,
and there was reason for confidence that there would be a recovery next
year. However, he suspects the economy will shrink again this quarter.
The recovery in housing investment, which rose 9 per cent during the third
quarter and boosted the GDP figure, was linked to falling interest rates for
home loans, an expansion of concessionary finance available to home buyers
from the government, and the recognition among buyers that housing prices
may have hit bottom.
EPA officials described the economy as 'bumping along the bottom', first
touched in April this year. However, they concede that a rush of
redundancies could send the economy into a downward spiral and are hoping
that companies will hold on to their surplus labour for at least a few more
months.

FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Summiteers strain to unite behind Gatt trade pact
 -FT writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting
in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union leaders were straining last night to unite behind the Gatt
world trade deal now likely next week, as Portugal and France hardened their
conditions on textiles and agriculture.
Portugal has twice in the past 10 days threatened to veto a Uruguay Round
settlement unless its partners seek ways of offsetting what Lisbon regards
as an insufficient market access offer by the US on textiles.
Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, referred yesterday to
'vital national interests' at stake - the politest Euro-code for threatening
a veto - but devoted his efforts to winning over fellow heads of government
in a series of bilateral talks.
Portugal won wide sympathy, especially since Mr Cavaco Silva faces local
elections tomorrow. But it was not clear how far its partners would or could
go in offering funds from an already stretched EU budget to help restructure
the Portuguese textile industry.
A European Commission trade official said, however, that 'we think that when
the details of the market access deal emerge, the Portuguese will find a lot
to be satisfied with' on textiles.
France refused to relent on its demand that the EU guarantee farmers would
not have to set aside farm land, or take any more land out of production
because of the Uruguay Round, if the output projections of the reformed
Common Agricultural Policy exceed the limits on subsidised food exports set
by Gatt.
French officials insist that the government must have a plausible guarantee
to offer when France's National Assembly meets to debate Gatt, probably on
Monday.
Such a guarantee could break the EU budget or it could cost nothing, if CAP
projections for the next two years are as accurate as they have been in the
first year of reform. 'Pick a figure,' said one European Commission
official.
He pointed out that if EU cereals prices do not come down to world market
levels as a result of production restraints and price cuts which farmers get
direct compensation for, then every Ecu10 overshoot would cost the Union
Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.52bn) in extra compensation to avoid further set-aside.
There were signs last night, however, of a compromise on French demands  -
strongly backed by Spain and a thin majority of member states, but opposed
by Germany - for strengthened EU trade weapons to put up against the US
Section 301 trade arsenal.
The current Belgian presidency is suggesting that a simple majority of the
12 should be sufficient for Brussels to take anti-dumping action against
imports sold in Europe below production cost or home market price, but that
the higher hurdle of weighted majority voting, normally requiring support
from nine or 10 member states, should be retained for using safeguard
clauses against import surges.
Foreign ministers were due to discuss the wider Gatt deal over dinner last
night.
The 12 heads of government and Commission president Jacques Delors were
expected to examine the farm and textiles issues at a separate, closed
dinner.
According to the Belgian presidency, foreign ministers were also expected to
start a meeting on Gatt on Monday, possibly running through the week until
after Wednesday night's deadline for concluding the Uruguay Round.

FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Paving the way towards Emu - FT writers report on
the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union leaders yesterday prepared the way for much closer
co-operation on macro-economic performance in the run-up to full economic
and monetary union.
They agreed the principle of legally binding macro-economic guidelines,
including a general call for lower interest rates, wage restraint, lower
budget deficits and government debt. But French objections to the details
delayed formal adoption of the proposals.
Mr Henning Christophersen, European economics commissioner, said the
guidelines - required under the Maastricht treaty - would probably be
adopted by EU finance ministers in Brussels on Monday.
The guidelines are a diluted version of the original proposal but Mr
Christophersen said they would still be used 'as a basis for the examination
of the (economic) performance of member states'.
The French difficulties concern the wording on wage restraint - France and
others believe they should be tougher - and binding commitments to the EU
budget limits agreed at last year's Edinburgh summit.
Finance ministers also discussed yesterday the practical work of the
European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of a European central bank,
which will supervise the second phase of Emu, beginning on January 1.
Officials said that European Union leaders were likely formally to endorse
Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, a Hungarian-born Belgian, as first president of the
EMI before the summit ends tomorrow.
Mr Lamfalussy made clear he expected to be heavily involved in the
discussion of EU economic affairs, even though the EMI's statutory role is
mainly supervisory.
Germany and Britain have resisted suggestions by the Belgian presidency and
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, that the EMI's role should be
beefed up.
But Mr Lamfalussy is still likely to work closely with the finance
ministers, Belgian officials said yesterday. He will attend their meetings
when the preparations for Emu are discussed.
The first EMI board meeting is likely to take place on January 3, although
it will take a few months for a working secretariat to be established in
Frankfurt, where the EMI will be based.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said the Bundesbank would restrict
itself to providing technical help to establish the EMI. He added that
Germany would not be among those countries which would allow the EMI to
manage their monetary reserves during the second phase of Emu.
Mr Christophersen played down German opposition to a strong EMI. 'I think
they (the Germans) have been so keen to get it to Frankfurt .. because they
want it to be a real institution, with some influence,' he told journalists.
'Why in heaven have it in Frankfurt unless it has real powers?'

FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Action agreed over frontiers - French plan for
pan-European security conference is accepted / FT writers report on the
first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A French proposal for a pan-European security conference dealing with
minority rights and border problems in the former communist bloc won broad
endorsement at the Brussels summit yesterday.
EU foreign ministers welcomed the latest refinement of the Balladur pact,
the French prime minister's initiative for strengthening political stability
in central and eastern Europe.
The Balladur pact has gained momentum among the 12 EU member states since it
was first floated last spring in response to the failure of European
diplomacy in former Yugoslavia.
European leaders are seeking ways to fulfil the Maastricht treaty's
provisions for joint actions under a new common foreign policy. They are
also responding to signals from the US that the EU should become more
involved in security questions on the continent.
However, several difficulties remain outstanding with the latest proposals,
diplomats at the summit said.
First, east European states such as Poland and the Czech Republic are less
than enthusiastic about attending a peace conference which draws an implicit
line between stable western states in the EU and unstable states in the
former Soviet bloc.
A Polish official said yesterday his country did not have a minority problem
and had signed co-operation agreements with six out of seven of its
neighbours.
Second, those countries seeking EU membership - notably the Visegrad Four of
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - argue that closer
economic links with the European Union are a more effective way of
guaranteeing stability in central Europe than a peace conference.
Third, the question of which states are invited to attend the opening
security conference likely to take place next spring remains contentious.
Some countries want to restrict invitations to countries which have
realistic aspirations of joining the EU in the next 10 to 15 years. These
would include the Visegrad Four, Bulgaria, the three Baltic states and
Slovenia.
Others believe that a genuine security conference must include Russia,
Ukraine, Moldova and the Caucasus region, all of which are suffering from
inter-ethnic conflict. Albania, which has tense diplomatic relations with
neighbouring Greece, is also a prime candidate for an invitation, a Brussels
diplomat said yesterday.
A UK spokesman said the Balladur plan was a 'good proposal' because it did
not attempt to create a new international organisation. Earlier fears that
the Balladur pact could duplicate work by the Conference for Security and
Co-operation in Europe - whose membership has grown since the collapse of
the Soviet bloc - had dissipated.
Intensive diplomacy also appears to have removed objections to earlier
drafts of the Balladur pact which seemed an open invitation for disgruntled
minorities to challenge frontiers. 'Existing borders will not be touched,'
said a UK official.
The idea is to hold a conference starting in spring 1994.

FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Search for new voting formula defeats leaders -
FT writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in
Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EU leaders were struggling yesterday to find a compromise on voting rules in
the Council of Ministers which will preserve the interests of both big and
small member states if up to four new members - Austria, Sweden, Finland and
Norway - join the 12 in 1995.
The Maastricht treaty has brought in more weighted majority voting on EU
decisions, and the five big members want to preserve their influence when
the four small countries join.
Most of the small member states, as well as the four applicants, fear
Europe's balance of influence could be destroyed, leading to a return to
19th-century balance-of-power politics in which the EU would come to be
dominated by a 'directoire' of the big states, mainly Germany, France and
the UK.
Underlying the controversy is the need to adapt institutions designed for
the original six member states not only to the 16 in prospect, but beyond
that to possible additional members from eastern Europe.
Germany, supported by France, has after some initial sabre-rattling opted to
remit any fundamental reform to the next EU constitutional review in 1996.
Bonn fears that otherwise the four applicant countries could lose the
referendums they are to hold on accession.
But the UK and Spain both maintained their hard line against a Belgian
presidency compromise which would extend the existing rules for 12 to cover
16 members. That would set the 'blocking minority' needed to halt a decision
at 27 votes out of 90, instead of 23 out of 76 now.
The current formula usually requires two big countries and one small one for
a blocking minority, and the UK wants this preserved. Spain will accept the
27 threshold, so long as it always contains the votes of two big countries.
An Italian compromise for all member states to surrender one vote looked
unlikely to mollify smaller states; Luxembourg, for instance, would have its
votes halved.

FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Let's have a chat over dinner - Summit Diary / FT
writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in
Brussels

The last visit of a Russian leader to Belgium was in the 18th century, so it
is said, when Peter the Great passed through. Following Boris the Great's
visit earlier this week, Belgian diplomats are hoping it won't be another
250 years before the next visit. They are particularly worried that an
incident at dinner on Thursday night might have put the chill back into
rapidly warming relations between Russia and western Europe.
'Another Berlin Wall has fallen,' Mr Yeltsin said after the EU and Russia
signed a political declaration. But over dinner on Thursday night, the
Russian leader made it clear he thought the thaw in the cold war had not
gone far enough. He petulantly pointed out that Nato's friendly intentions
seemed to stop at the Urals.
Moreover, he went on to cite its apparent chilliness towards Russia as just
the most obvious example of western Europe's deeper reluctance to snuggle up
to Russia - lack of concrete funding pledges being another example.
It took a few calming words from President Francois Mitterrand of France to
prevent the outburst becoming a full-scale diplomatic incident, officials
said yesterday. Next time around, maybe they'll soothe Mr Yeltsin's nerves
with the comprehensive trade pact he really wanted, rather than the
high-sounding promises of a declaration on greater economic and political
co-operation.
* * * *
At least hangers-on at the ministerial meetings have the sun-seeking,
island-hopping, ouzo-drinking Greek presidency of the European Union to look
forward to. It begins on January 1 and after the drizzly Belgian presidency
should be a welcome New Year tonic. Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek foreign
minister, did his bit to raise summit-goers' spirits yesterday by making the
case for at least three special Greek weekend breaks on top of the scheduled
summit of EU leaders in Corfu next June. Book early to avoid disappointment.
* * * *
More demonstrations to mark yesterday's meeting, and an additional traffic
headache for Brussels police. At one point, police were predicting the
chaotic near-coincidence in Brussels of 25,000 Belgian socialist union
members, protesting against their government's austerity plans, 800 striking
teachers, 300 torch-carrying European miners, 400 young Euro-federalists,
and thousands of funereal firefighters mourning the death of a colleague.
Nothing colourful enough, however, to satisfy Sir John Kerr, Britain's top
EU diplomat, who lamented that Brussels demos were always characterised by
'too many farmers and not enough French film stars'.
* * * *
After the Lord Mayor's Show comes the muck-cart: ministers, diplomats and
journalists are bracing themselves for a nightmare on Monday when the
Belgian presidency has committed itself to hold five simultaneous
ministerial meetings in the overcrowded Charlemagne building in Brussels,
many of them charged with clearing up issues unresolved by EU leaders.

FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Little enthusiasm for Mr Delors' big idea - FT
writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in
Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors' idea of pulling Europe out of recession with large
borrowings to finance infrastructure projects yesterday turned out to have
the firepower of a damp squib.
If Mr Delors banked on heads of government giving his financing plan the
go-ahead before it had been properly examined by their finance ministers,
then the gamble clearly failed.
He seems to have underestimated the desire of many governments to show the
financial markets that they are exercising the utmost fiscal rectitude in
reducing their big budget deficits.
Mr Delors' borrowing proposals were yesterday backed by France, Denmark,
Spain and Portugal, but Germany, the Netherlands and the UK all voiced
objections.
Italy - which is making an exceptional effort to promote budgetary rigour
after decades of overspending - offered less than wholehearted endorsement
of the financing plan, even though an Italian spokesman gave the overall
White Paper an effusive welcome.
Britain's well-advertised opposition to the plan for extra borrowing was if
anything toned down.
In view of Germany's political and financial weight, of far greater
importance than Mr Major's reaction was the German move to cast doubt on the
EU borrowing plan.
At the opening session of the summit, Chancellor Helmut Kohl was careful not
to reject outright the idea of extra borrowing for 'trans-European networks'
 -above all, transport and energy projects. He did, however, voice doubts
about the suggested mechanism under which the EU would issue Ecu7bn (Pounds
5.3bn) a year in 'Union Bonds'.
Mr Kohl suggested that the EU's financing arm, the European Investment Bank,
should at first complete the programme of Ecu8bn of extra lending agreed in
December 1992 and June this year. Only about Ecu4bn of this has so far been
committed.
Using words almost identical to Mr Major's, Mr Kohl offered polite criticism
that Mr Delors had published his proposals only two days before the summit,
giving ministers inadequate time to study them.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the German government spokesman, said Bonn showed 'concern'
about plans to make extra demands on already tight credit markets when
governments throughout Europe were trying to rein back borrowing. This was
not the time to give the European Commission extra responsibility in
borrowing, he said, especially when the EIB had more 'technical competence'
in such matters.
Bonn officials made clear their anxiety that large-scale borrowing by the EU
for pan-European projects was a way of channelling individual governments'
fund-raising outside normal budgetary channels.
The German reservations were echoed by the Netherlands, the only country
apart from Germany to maintain full-scale 'hard currency' status after the
August collapse of the narrow-band ERM. Mr Ruud Lubbers, prime minister,
spoke in favour of continuing to channel EU infrastructure lending through
the EIB.
Mr Pieter Dankert, state secretary of the Dutch Foreign Ministry, said his
government was 'open-minded' about borrowing for transport and energy
projects. But he said EU fundraising on its own account would be acceptable
only if borrowing by national governments were reduced by an equivalent
amount.
If met, Mr Dankert's condition would deprive Mr Delors' plan of any
macroeconomic significance. After this barrage of scepticism from some of
the EU's heavyweights, by the end of the first day of the summit Mr Delors'
big idea was looking a lot smaller.

FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Brussels PM trips over his tongue - FT writers
report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<TEXT>
Belgium's francophone Walloons and Dutch-speaking Flemings set prickly
standards of even-handedness in the use of language. They require ministers
often to switch judiciously back and forward between the two, even in press
conferences.
The Flemish community was not amused therefore by a surreptitious deal at
the October Brussels summit by Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's
Flemish-speaking prime minister. With his 11 colleagues, he agreed that the
official languages used by the new European trade marks office to be set up
in Spain would be cut from the nine employed now to five - English, French,
German, Spanish and Italian.
Flemish politicians found out when the Netherlands complained that this
would heap discriminatory costs on Dutch industry. There was a brief flurry
of tit-for-tat vetoes. Since the Dutch were holding up Spain's trade marks
office, Spain blocked the go-ahead for Europol, the EU criminal intelligence
unit to be set up in The Hague. A row erupted over language-use in the
Eurocorps, the joint Franco-German-Belgian army unit (fighting languages:
French and German) which Spain is now set to join.
This particularly exercised the Flemish press. The memory still rankles of
Flemish troops dying needlessly in the first world war because they could
not understand the orders of their overwhelmingly francophone officer class.
They also discovered that the Dutch word for 'fire' is remarkably like the
Spanish vernacular for a more intimate form of engagement.
The 12 found a complicated way round the trade marks office problem this
week, but then Flemish MPs reopened the controversy in the Belgian
parliament.
It was likely the summit conclusions would have to say something
linguistically correct to mollify them. This, one Dutch diplomat said, would
need to be 'All EU languages are equal, but some are more equal than
others.'

FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Major blows hot and cold on growth pla - FT
writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in
Brussels On second thoughts, it's not so bad, PM decides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It was a different audience. So Mr John Major adopted a different tone.
After three days of pouring public scorn on Mr Jacques Delors' prescription
for faster economic growth and lower unemployment, the prime minister
remembered that Britain is supposed these days to be at the heart of Europe.
Mr Major did not retreat from his central objection to Mr Delors' plan to
raise an extra Ecu40bn (Pounds 30.5bn) over the next five years to finance
new trans-European communications networks. There were economic and
political objections.
The so-called Union Bonds would transfer important new spending power to the
European Commission. Britain would object to that at the best of times, but
it was particularly illogical - in fact 'absurd' - at a time when all EU
governments were engaged in a struggle to reduce national fiscal deficits.
Mr Major repeated his government's irritation at the decision of the Belgian
presidency and the Commission to exclude finance ministers from the
substantive deliberations on the Growth, Competitiveness and Employment
White Paper.
He also tilted at the occasional windmill, condemning the 'defeatist
fallacy' - that there was a fixed amount of work - said to be behind
proposals for an expansion of work-sharing. It appeared not to matter that
no-one, least of all Mr Delors, had ever suggested anything of the sort.
But Mr Major's contribution to yesterday's debate on the report's
conclusions had, on the advice of his officials, been stripped of the
bad-tempered hyperbole of previous ministerial pronouncements.
Facing an audience of fellow European leaders rather than one of awkward
Conservative party Eurosceptics, he declared the cup that had been judged at
the beginning of the week to be more than half-empty to be all of a sudden
more than half-full.
The volte-face of course could have had nothing to do with the fact that
every other government around the Brussels table - including the Germans and
the Dutch - had decided to give most of Mr Delors' proposals a fair wind.
Reflecting the general view in the Treasury that the final version of the
White Paper had taken on board many of the liberal ideas promoted by
Britain, Mr Major praised the emphasis on competitiveness, labour market
flexibility, and supply-side economic reforms.
A paper which only hours before had been publicly ridiculed was discovered,
in Mr Major's words, to 'have some very good elements in it'. It recognised
that there were no 'miracle cures' for unemployment, it rejected
protectionism, accepted the need to remove obstacles to employment, and
reaffirmed the limits on the Community's own resources spending.
It was only then that the prime minister came on to the problems. There was
no need, he insisted, for the issue of Union Bonds when the European
Investment Bank had used only half of the increased resources granted to it
at last year's Edinburgh summit. Trans-European networks should also be
private-sector-driven rather than mapped out by officials in Brussels. He
told fellow heads of state: 'The key action is to use the large resources
already agreed; not to invent new instruments.'
By the time the summit closes, tomorrow Mr Major fully expects to be able to
claim a victory on the issue. Even if Chancellor Helmut Kohl was loath to
attack Mr Delors in public, his government has deep-rooted objections to
such off-balance-sheet borrowing. The idea will be remitted to finance
ministers for further study.
But the victory will not be without its price. British diplomacy in Europe
this week has lurched from a full-frontal attack to a begrudging partial
retreat. Neither would have been necessary if Mr Major had adopted the
constructive if sceptical approach of his partners.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Lloyd's Names may be asked for Pounds 8bn more, says survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's Names may face demands for up to Pounds 8.65bn from the insurance
market over the next 10 to 20 years, according to unofficial estimates
released yesterday.
Chatset, the research company, warned that Lloyd's could need the money to
meet escalating claims from pollution, asbestosis and other court awards in
the US.
The figure compares with an estimate of Pounds 5bn made by Chatset last
year. Mr Charles Sturge, co-editor, said some of the rise was due to the
strength of the US dollar during 1992. It also follows an increase last year
in notifications of possible claims.
Chatset investigated more than 200 Lloyd's syndicates which have been unable
to close years of accounts because of uncertainty over future claims. The
fresh money would be needed to build up reserves and comes on top of an
estimated Pounds 6.5bn of losses suffered by Lloyd's since 1988.
Lloyd's reserves for liability business have 'been woefully inadequate',
Chatset said in its report. 'Lloyd's does set minimum requirements for
reserves but history has proved these to be a joke.'
Lloyd's yesterday questioned the basis on which Chatset reached its figures.
'You have to second-guess American juries trying to make forecasts like
this,' said a spokesman. The insurance market has begun detailed work on its
exposures to US liability policies underwritten in 1985 and earlier which it
aims to transfer to NewCo, a new reinsurance company early in 1996.
It is also possible some claims could be reduced by 'commutation', which
involves case-by-case negotiation with policyholders, said Lloyd's.
Nevertheless the figures will cause consternation among Names - whose assets
have traditionally supported the market - especially those on syndicates
which have specialised in long-tail liability business, in which claims can
occur years after policies were underwritten.
The accuracy of Chatset's figures has been challenged by Lloyd's in the
past. However their forecasts have sometimes proved more accurate than those
of the insurance market.

FT  11 DEC 93 / EU leaders back cuts in wages: Summit set to endorse Delors
plan to beat recession and unemployment
</HEADLINE>

European leaders yesterday endorsed tough measures to cut real wages as a
means of strengthening competitiveness and steering Europe out of recession.
At the end of the first day of the Brussels summit, EU heads of governments
appeared poised to adopt the white paper on jobs and growth prepared by Mr
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, as an 'action plan'.
EU leaders seem likely today to approve the white paper as a framework which
offers each member state options for strengthening competitiveness and
attacking unemployment.
The message of the summit was that Europe's workers must accept short-term
pain in order to hold on to their jobs and escape the worst recession since
1975.
Outside the summit building, trade unionists marched in protest against the
Belgian government's plans to cut social security and freeze real wages.
The summit was dominated by the jobs crisis, but tense talks took place
aimed at settling objections over the cost to French agriculture and
Portuguese textiles of a world trade deal.
Heads of government, including Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, praised
Mr Delors' job-creating prescriptions, including more flexible labour
markets, while recognising there were no miracle cures for unemployment.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany stressed that job creation must have
priority over wage increases. When Greek ministers spoke out against real
wage cuts, they were countered by a united front made up of representatives
of the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said people in work should
accept lower wages in the interests of solidarity with the Union's 18m
unemployed.
French president Francois Mitterrand said the white paper was a 'charter for
what is possible' which would 'relaunch Europe.'
But there was opposition yesterday to Mr Delors' proposal for the Union to
borrow large sums on the capital markets to help fund road, rail, energy,
environmental and advanced telecommunications projects.
Anglo-German opposition surfaced towards the European Commission's proposal
to issue 'Union bonds' to boost available EU funding for such projects from
Ecu12bn to Ecu20bn (Pounds 9.14bn to Pounds 15.24bn) a year to the end of
the century.
The borrowing plan is expected to be handed to EU finance ministers for
further review, despite Mr Mitterrand's complaint that this amounted to
'burying' Mr Delors proposals.
Last night, a senior British official signalled a potential compromise. He
said he expected projects to be submitted for scrutiny by finance ministers
who would approve the level of funding for each individual project.
Government heads were expected to focus on the question of how to
accommodate French and Portuguese demands on agriculture and textiles after
extensive bilateral negotiations yesterday.
Portugal's threat to veto a deal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade because of an inadequate US offer on market access for textiles was
treated seriously and with sympathy. But the EU faces strict budget ceilings
which complicate efforts to meet Portugal's request for aid to restructure
its textile industry.
France insists on a guarantee that its farmers will not have to take more
land out of production because of Gatt. This could be very costly if
Brussels has under estimated agriculture output over the next six years.

FT  11 DEC 93 / Major and Reynolds edge closer to Ulster peace deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds last night kept alive the prospect of a
pre-Christmas peace initiative designed to persuade the IRA to end its
25-year campaign of violence in Northern Ireland.
Despite an admission by the two leaders that their second meeting in a week
had failed to surmount remaining obstacles to a joint declaration, they held
out the possibility that such a statement could be finalised within the next
fews days.
Amid conflicting reports of their encounter at the European summit in
Brussels, Mr Reynolds
was said to have been angered by Mr Major's refusal to move further in the
direction of acknowledging the aspirations for a united Ireland of the
nationalist community in Ulster.
The Irish prime minister was said also to be frustrated at Mr Major's
apparent refusal to persuade Unionist leaders that the peace initiative
offered no threat to their present status.
But both leaders appeared ready to acknowledge that the cost of a breakdown
in their negotiations might well be a resumption of uncontrolled violence in
Northern Ireland. So in a public statement after their talks, Mr Major and
Mr Reynolds said that further progress had been made and that they expected
another meeting would be held before Christmas at which they could finalise
the declaration.
Senior British officials insisted it was still possible the statement could
be agreed by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.
The British and Irish prime ministers want the statement to provide a
springboard for an intensive round of negotiations on a permanent political
settlement in Northern Ireland. More immediately, they hope it will coax the
IRA into extending its traditional Christmas ceasefire into a permanent
cessation of violence.
But the two leaders have yet to find the precise language for the most
sensitive passages in the document. They also remain uncertain that the
first attempt since the 1985 Anglo - Irish agreement to balance the
competing claims of Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism would be enough to
restore peace.
The joint statement issued after the talks said Mr Major and Mr Reynolds
hoped 'to bring the process to a successful conclusion' in the next 10 days.
With Mr Major anxious to secure an accord before parliament breaks on Friday
for the Christmas recess, one high-ranking British official commented: 'I
very much hope we get there. I cannot guarantee that we will get there.' He
then added: 'There is still some way to go.'
Officials will attempt to iron out the remaining differences during
intensive contacts over the next few days, opening the possibility of a
final summit in London next week.
Anxious to reassure the Ulster Unionists, British officials said the
declaration would underwrite its guarantee to the Protestant majority in
Northern Ireland that there could be no change in the status of the province
without their consent. Mr Major had also won assurances from Mr Reynolds of
Dublin's commitment to drop its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as
part of a comprehensive settlement.
But Mr Reynolds is determined those assurances to the Unionist majority must
be balanced by public recognition of the legitimacy of the nationalist
aspiration for a united Ireland.

FT  11 DEC 93 / LWT plan for link up may block hostile bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Weekend Television is planning to try to ward off the hostile
takeover bid by Granada, the television, leisure and rental group, by
linking with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, a company in which it already holds 14 per
cent.
Anglia Television would also be involved in the defence, which will be
unveiled to LWT shareholders next week.
LWT chairman Sir Christopher Bland is determined to avoid a takeover by
Granada if there are alternatives that make more sense to his shareholders.
The link would probably take the form of an agreed merger.
If the defence deal is confirmed, LWT, Yorkshire, Anglia and Tyne Tees could
be brought together in a single super-company as soon as government
ownership rules allow.
The four combined would be bigger than the merged Carlton and Central and
control more than 30 per cent of total ITV advertising. Last week Carlton
announced an agreed Pounds 624m takeover of Central subject to parliamentary
approval.
Granada's bid for LWT earlier this week was a share deal worth around Pounds
600m with a 528p per share cash alternative. Granada's shares closed up 12p
at 496p, valuing the offer at around Pounds 610m. As part of LWT's defence
against Granada, a three-way deal is understood to have been agreed.
The reason behind this is the proposal by the government which would mean no
independent television company could own more than two regional franchises.
Because the Yorkshire-Tyne Tees group already holds two broadcasting
licences, any deal with LWT would involve the disposal of one of them.
The franchise change, which will take effect on January 1, has been approved
by the Commons and goes to the Lords on Monday.

<TEXT>
Trebruk, the Swedish paper group, has completed a Dollars 56m limited
recourse financing operation for Kostryzynskie Zaklady Papiernicze (KZP)
which leaves it with a 51 per cent stake in the former loss-making,
state-owned Polish paper company.
Trebruk acquired control of KZP for a nominal sum in October.
The new financing will provide working capital, pay off creditors, fund a
Dollars 40m capital investment programme to raise production of fine papers
to 250,000 tons annually and pay for a Dollars 5m environmental clean-up.
Funds have been provided by a group of Swedish investors and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
Of the Dollars 56m total, Dollars 25m will be provided by Trebruk and a
group of Swedish investors. These include the Nordic Environment Finance
Corporation and Swedfund International AB, which will each take 16 per cent
of the increased equity, and Rottneros Bruk AB, a Swedish producer of
chlorine-free pulp and a group of trade investors.
The EBRD is committing Dollars 32m but is still finalising syndication among
a group of Polish and West European banks.
Samuel Montagu acted as adviser to Trebruk in a deal which will guarantee
1,000 jobs in Kostryn whose proximity to the German border and low
production and distribution costs was one of the determining factors in the
Swedish company's decision to take over the Polish company.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ascom, the troubled Swiss telecommunications equipment maker, yesterday
sacked its chief executive, Mr Leonardo Vannotti, and announced the latest
in a long series of divisional restructur-ings.
Ascom was formed in 1987 when three suppliers to the Swiss PTT merged. It
has been struggling ever since to unify the three companies and to develop a
strategy to cope with liberalised telecommunications markets.
Mr Vannotti, a highly-rated Swiss manager, became chief executive at the
beginning of 1991. He had previously held senior positions with ABB-Asea
Brown Boveri and Mr Stephan Schmidheiny's Unotec group.
He scored an early coup, acquiring Timeplex, a leading US supplier of
corporate telecoms networks, enabling Ascom to increase its non-Swiss
business rapidly.
However, in the past few months, the combination of recession and weak links
in the corporate structure proved his undoing.
In April, Ascom shocked investors by announcing it would incur a 1992 net
loss of SFr46m (Dollars 31.4m) and pass its dividend. Days earlier, it had
forecast a profit of around SFr25m.
Mr Vannotti took full responsibility, but rashly predicted a return to
profit this year. That forecast came back to haunt him in August when the
group reported a loss of SFr79m in the first half and admitted it would face
a 'marked loss' in the full year.
Ascom bearer shares have been falling virtually ever since the merger, when
they were worth about SFr8,000, and yesterday closed at SFr1,180, up SFr95
in advance of the announcement.
Directors said Mr Fred Sutter, deputy chief executive, would succeed Mr
Vannotti, and they have formed a committee to direct the group during its
restructuring phase.
Analysts said managing Ascom was made difficult by the interventionist
policy of the Hasler Werke foundation, which holds 54 per cent of the voting
power with 22 per cent of the capital.
Mr Serge Ledermann, head of equity research at Geneva bankers Lombard Odier,
said there was no reason to have more confidence in the new management than
the old. 'Management by committee is always wrong,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's two-day-old Transitional Executive Council (TEC) tested the
limits of new black political power yesterday, with far-reaching orders to
the police and the KwaZulu black homeland, Reuter reports from Cape Town.
The multi-party TEC, the country's first statutory body to give executive
powers to blacks, adopted proposals initiated by Mr Nelson Mandela's African
National Congress and the South African Communist Party.
One resolution instructed police to move into northern Natal, including
parts of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's largely autonomous KwaZulu
homeland, to deal with the unrest there. 'The KwaZulu police have been
standing by, doing nothing when people are being killed and injured,' Mr
Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC delegate, said. 'Units of the South African police
should be deployed in the area. Some of these areas fall under KwaZulu.'
South Africa's white-led police have traditionally respected the nominal
autonomy of Chief Buthelezi's local police. Chief Buthelezi has refused to
join the TEC, vowing to defy its authority.
The TEC also appointed a delegation to talk to police about the activities
of its controversial internal stability unit, the police branch which
replaced the riot squad.
The UN yesterday agreed to unrestricted resumption of shipments of oil and
petroleum products to South Africa, ending a 16-year embargo widely observed
but not mandatory, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York.

The cabinet's Government Information Office would offer 29 more FM radio

Mr Peter Tapsell, an orthopaedic surgeon, will be the first Maori and first
representative of an opposition party to be speaker. The appointment will
make it easier for National to govern. With 50 MPs in Parliament, against
the 49 from the three opposition parties, National would have faced deadlock
on much legislation with a speaker chosen from its own ranks.

FT  10 DEC 93 / EIB finance for Polish railways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Investment Bank (EIB) has agreed an Ecu200m (Dollars 228m) loan
to finance modernisation of Poland's 630km section of the Berlin-Warsaw
railway line, the main east-west rail-link.
The EIB, the long-term finance institution of the European Union, is also
providing an Ecu50m loan to the Polish Development Bank for the financing of
smaller industrial projects in Poland.
The loan to the Polish state railways, PKP, will partially finance an
Ecu487m modernisation plan to upgrade and relay track, improve stations and
install new fibre optic signals, telecommunication and power systems. The
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is also expected to help
fund the project which will upgrade the main passenger and freight link
between the European Union and the Polish capital when completed by 1997.
The latest loans bring total EIB lending to Poland upto Ecu553m.
Poland is seeking further funds for its planned development of a 2,000km
north-south and east-west motorway network. This will form a key link in the
projected north-south motorway link from the Baltic states to the
Mediterranean and a similar east-west link from Berlin to the Belarus and
Ukrainian frontiers.
Poland's reliance on finance from the international financial institutions
like the EIB and the World Bank is greater than other central European
states which still have access to commercial credits.
But Poland's debt negotiators resumed talks with commercial bank creditors
this week to seek an end to the impasse over the country's demand for a 50
per cent reduction in its Dollars 13bn commercial debt. An agreement would
open the way for both commercial bank and equity finance.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Romania yesterday signed a letter of intent for a new stand-by arrangement
with the International Monetary Fund, signalling an end to months of
uncertainty over the government's commitment to reform.
The IMF board is expected to approve loans worth Dollars 700m under its
stand-by and systemic transformation facilities early next year if the
Romanian parliament accepts the reform programme agreed yesterday with the
Fund.
IMF officials said the principal aim of the programme was to curb inflation
sharply and restore domestic confidence in the leu, the Romanian currency.
Inflation hit 314 per cent in the year to October, its highest level since
the 1989 revolution. Economists have warned that, unless action is taken
quickly, the country could slip into hyper-inflation.
Mr Maxwell Watson, the IMF's chief negotiator with Romania, said the
programme's main structural objectives were enterprise restructuring,
financial sector reforms and measures to protect competition. He said the
IMF was still working with the left-wing minority government on improvements
to the social security system and on fiscal measures to fund emergency
heating and other supplements to help the most needy through the winter.
The agreement with the IMF comes at a critical time for the government. It
is under increasing attack from pro-reform opposition parties seeking a
no-confidence vote, and from trade unions which in recent weeks have
organised the biggest street demonstrations since 1990.

Denmark will enjoy the fastest-growing economy in the European Union in both
1994 and 1995, according to forecasts published by the economy ministry
yesterday.
The ministry predicts a gross domestic product growth rate of 3.0 per cent
in 1994, rising to 3.3 per cent in 1995.
The stimulus will come mainly from private consumption, expected to rise in
real terms by 4.1 per cent next year and 4.5 per cent in 1995.
This will generate a recovery in business investment and housing as well,
the ministry predicts.
Exports, which fell by about 5 per cent this year following devaluations by
Sweden and the UK, will also revive, increasing by about 2.7 per cent next
year and by 4.8 per cent in 1995.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Japan's economy forecast to contract 0.4% next fiscal year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's economy will contract by 0.4 per cent next fiscal year, according to
the Nomura Research Institute, which blamed the expected shrinkage on a
continuing fall in corporate earnings and capital spending in coming months.
The gloomy forecast by the leading private research institute was followed
by a Daiwa Research Institute prediction that Japanese corporate profits
will fall for the fifth successive term in the year from April.
Responding to indications of a deepening downturn, leaders of Japan's
coalition government said yesterday that preparations for a package to
stimulate the economy were likely to begin next week, when a supplementary
budget is expected to end its passage through parliament.
Meanwhile, Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the leading
business grouping, said the government should stimulate the property market
to assist banks attempting to clear away their mountain of bad property
loans.
The NRI forecast for next year was based on the presumption that the
government will introduce another spending package and cut taxes, and that
the official discount rate will be reduced from the present record low of
1.75 per cent to 1 per cent by the Bank of Japan.
In the current year to March, NRI expects the economy will contract by 1.1
per cent, and it can see no signs of the recovery officially expected to
arrive in the first few months of next year.
For next fiscal year, the institute forecasts that private consumption will
grow 0.7 per cent, against an expected 0.1 per cent decline this year, and
that industrial production will slip 3.2 per cent compared with a 4.7 per
cent fall this year.
Daiwa Research Institute said consumer and capital spending levels had
remained lower than generally expected in recent months, and pre-tax
corporate profits would fall by an average 25.6 per cent this fiscal year
and another 8.8 per cent next year.
The institute said many manufacturers would have difficulty clearing
inventories next year, although it expected an upturn in sales for the
automotive and electronics industries. It said profits would rise in only
four of 33 industrial sectors and materials suppliers would be under the
most pressure.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Jobs and trade threaten summit: European leaders split over
costs of Gatt and need to tackle unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European leaders gather today for a two-day summit likely to be disrupted by
internal rows over the cost of a world trade deal now within sight.
Further tensions are expected to surface in the debate on how to tackle the
continent-wide unemployment crisis, and on a white paper on jobs and growth
prepared by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission.
The summit is likely to expose an ideological fault line in the EU, centring
on the degree of labour market deregulation necessary to create jobs and the
cost of infrastructure investment needed to make Europe more competitive.
On Gatt, the 12 member states must accommodate French insistence that its
farmers will not have to take more land out of production to meet the
requirements of a new world accord on subsidised food exports.
This has pitted Paris against Bonn, which is also resisting French demands
that the EU puts in place tougher trade defence mechanisms equal to those of
the US.
France's hard line has encouraged other member states such as Portugal,
Greece and Spain to bring pressure on their partners to compensate for
shortcomings in the likely Gatt accord on textiles, maritime transport and
Mediterranean farm produce.
Belgium, which holds the rotating EU presidency, will push hard for a
commitment to act on the white paper's conclusions. 'There is quite a lot of
agreement on the orientation; the debate will centre on the financing of
it,' a senior Belgian official said.
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, is expected to try to paint Mr Delors'
blueprint as a free-spending, interventionist recipe. But other British
officials at the summit played down the likelihood of confrontation and
described the white paper as an intellectually respectable document.
Another source of contention is Mr Delors' proposal for the EU to spend up
to Ecu20bn (Dollars 22.8bn) a year to the end of the century as a catalyst
for heavy pan-European investment in roads, rail, energy, environment and
advanced information networks. The projects are to be funded partly through
new European Union bonds amounting to Ecu8bn a year.
Britain may get backing from Germany to oppose the new bonds, but French
officials predicted that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would support the scheme on
the basis of a yearly review. The budget-conscious Dutch have already
signalled support for the scheme.
In London Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, attacked Mr Delors' plans,
saying there was no evidence of the need for Community borrowing for
infrastructure improvements across Europe.
Commission officials warned that promises of financial compensation in
relation to the Gatt deal risked wrecking the seven-year budget deal struck
a year ago at the Edinburgh summit after highly divisive negotiation. The UK
and Germany are adamant that the budgetary ceiling agreed at the time cannot
be breached.
Mr Delors, who is approaching the end of 10 years in charge of the
Commission, intends to sell with some of his old vigour his prescription for
a Europe which creates more jobs while becoming more competitive. He also
intends to leave European leaders in no doubt that they face additional
responsibilities following the entry into force last month of the Maastricht
treaty.
With support from the Belgian presidency, he will tell leaders that their
national economic policies are a matter of 'common interest'. He will also
suggest that he favours a stronger role for the European monetary institute,
the precursor of a future European central bank which will manage the
planned single European currency.
Summit leaders must also tackle the delicate question of how the prospective
enlargement of the Union to embrace Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway will
affect the balance between big and small countries' voting strengths.

FT  10 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Pilkington rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers were surprised at the market's strongly positive reaction to interim
results from glass manufacturer Pilkington. Although the group's half-year
profits came out at Pounds 30.5m, well up on last year's Pounds 15m and
ahead of most expectations, the dividend was cut.
Some traders said there was relief that the results had not been accompanied
by a rights issue, but others said a cash call had been unofficially ruled
out by the company in response to market rumours some weeks ago. And
specialists were impressed with the post-results company meeting.
The general impression in the market, however, was that the shares had
responded mostly to a substantial squeeze of marketmakers' short positions.
'Once the shorts are unwound, there could be a reaction in the share price,'
said one marketmaker, who added that the building materials sector had
outperformed strongly in the past couple of months. The shares advanced 11
to 168p on turnover of 15m.
The pharmaceuticals sector experienced switching from Wellcome to Glaxo on
concern over one of the former's key treatments.
The New England Journal of Medicine published a report showing that Zovirax,
the anti-herpes product, had proved ineffective in treating genital herpes
in an otherwise healthy man. Analysts said problems in treating one patient
were unlikely to lead to big worries over Zovirax, which represents around
37 per cent of Wellcome's turnover. But they added that it could hinder an
application to sell it over the counter in the US. Wellcome shares fell 14
to 656p, while Glaxo rose 9 to 697p.
Turnover in Standard Chartered was a hefty 2.8m as the share price gyrated
between a record 1259p and 1201p, responding to intermittent bouts of
renewed strong buying by institutions seeking to buy market weightings in
the stock and flurries of profit-taking. A leading broking house was said to
be putting a Pounds 20 a share price target on Standard, which lost 8 at
1229p.
Royal Insurance was the pick of a busy composite insurance sector, closing
15 up at 317p after a positive judgment on industrial pollution in the House
of Lords.
London International Group fell 28 to 111p on reporting a Pounds 5.1m
interim loss, against forecasts of a Pounds 4m to Pounds 5m profit. Analysts
were quick to cut back forecasts for the company, which has been dogged by
problems. Hoare Govett has pencilled in a loss forecast of Pounds 6.5m,
against a previous profit estimate of Pounds 10m for the full year, but said
everything depends on the timing of disposals and restructuring.
Powerscreen International, the Northern Ireland-based manufacturer of
screening and stone crushing equipment, came under renewed pressure as
rumours persisted of an inland revenue inquiry. The company said it knew of
no reason for the decline in the shares, which have collapsed from 372p a
week ago to yesterday's 272p, a net fall of 31 on the day.
Burmah Castrol was the outstanding performer in an otherwise depressed oil
sector, the stock racing to an all-time high of 833p at one point before
easing to close a net 13 up at 815p as the market focused on potential
beneficiaries of weak oil prices.
The majors, on the other hand, suffered from yet another dose of afternoon
selling. Dealers said US institutions, which have been the big supporters of
BP over the past year or so, have begun to reduce their holdings, certainly
in BP and possibly also in Shell Transport.
US holdings accounted for around 24 per cent of BP at the last count. BP
settled 9 1/2 lower at 320 1/2 p - the shares' lowest closing level since
September - after heavy turnover of 12m. Shell retreated 11 to 695p on 3.9m
traded.
Second liner Clyde Petroleum was firm as recent hints of exploration success
gathered momentum, driving Clyde shares up to 53p before finishing 5 ahead
at 51 1/2 p.
Analysts refused to rule out a series of rationalisation moves in the oil
exploration and production sub-sector.
Improved UK car sales gave a boost to motor-related stocks. Among component
manufacturers, T&amp;N advanced 8 to 199p, Motor World 3 to 326p, BBA Group 7 to
189p and Laird 6 to 335p. Distributor T. Cowie climbed 8 to 258p.
The arrival of furniture group DFS in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index helped the
shares appreciate 9 to 304p. However, Betterware's exit was said to be
behind its fall of 9 to 140p.
Profit-taking marred respectable results from Great Universal Stores, the
shares giving up 9 to 573p. Signet Group, formerly Ratners, continued to
decline on talk of slack sales. The stock slipped 2 3/4 to 15 3/4 p.
In a quiet drinks sector, Guinness bore the brunt of a downgrade from Lehman
Brothers, the shares sliding 10 to 468p. The US broker was said to have
lowered its 1993 profits forecast to Pounds 835m from Pounds 890m, and to
Pounds 902m from Pounds 920m for 1994. Greenalls moved forward 8 to 415p on
the back of positive comment after results on Tuesday.
Results from Compass Group included a 31 per cent profits rise and saw the
shares jump 19 to 514p. Hoare Govett moved from 'hold' to 'buy' on the stock
following a positive results meeting. UBS was said to have recommended
Granada Group, 11 higher at 484p.

FT  10 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed pressure on Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Storm clouds gathered over Lasmo, the troubled oil exploration group, as the
market reacted to another front-line resignation from the group's board, the
third in a year. Lord Rees said he is stepping down as chairman after the
annual meeting next year.
Lord Rees's move follows the resignation earlier this year of Mr Chris
Greentree, the former chief executive and leading light in Lasmo's
acquisition of Ultramar some 18 months ago, and the recent ousting of Mr
Michael Pavia, former finance director.
'It is now virtually certain that the final dividend will be cut, and to
make matters worse the stock is not worth Pounds 1 with oil at Dollars 13 a
barrel,' said one oil sector specialist.
Lasmo shares, already suffering the effects of the steep decline in crude
oil prices, which were trading around the Dollars 13.50 a barrel mark
yesterday, fell 6 to 109p, their lowest level since January 1987. The latest
fall in oil prices followed bearish remarks made by Sheikh Yamani, the
former Saudi Arabian oil minister and leading light in Opec, who said prices
could well drop to Dollars 10 a barrel in the new year.

FT  10 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 3,300 touched before
profit-takers arrive - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The brakes were slammed on hard when the UK stock market burst briefly
through the Footsie 3,300 mark yesterday morning, and the session ended on
the downside in moderate selling pressure. With both gilt-edged and sterling
quieter at first, equity investors decided to take profits ahead of the
closure tonight of an extremely successful two-week trading account.
However, government bonds moved up at the close when there were buyers as
well as sellers for equities. The final reading on the FT-SE 100 Index, down
5.8 at 3,271.6, compared with a day's low of 3,263.6. The new equity trading
account is extended for three weeks to cover the Christmas holiday. Dealers
expect plenty of action as brokerage houses and the investment press
disclose their share recommendations for the new year, and were unwilling to
be short of stock yesterday.
Early dealings saw completion of the last of the buying orders put in by the
big institutions on Wednesday. Backed up by initial strength in the December
futures contract, the Footsie gained nearly 23 points to register a new
intraday peak of 3,300.1, showing a rise of 100 points since the Budget
speech. Buying has been led by the overseas institutions, with US investment
funds making the running.
But stock index futures, continuing to exercise a powerful influence, turned
sharply downwards and share prices quickly followed. Bank shares, which have
been a prime driving force behind the latest upswing in the Footsie, dipped
sharply, with marketmakers only too happy to mark prices down in order to
attract stock to refill their depleted trading books. Marketmakers have
taken heavy punishment this week as prices have raced ahead.
Oil shares also took punishment, extending their losses in the late
afternoon when US sellers made an appearance. Weak oil prices continued to
take their toll of the exploration issues, with Lasmo hit by the departure
of the chairman.
But across the broader range of equities, activity was more 'stock specific'
and investors sought out shares thought to have been overlooked. Stores
shares gave back only a few pence. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, extending the
range of the Footsie down into second line issues, continued to make
headway, rising 6.3 to a new peak of 3,596.2. The Footsie Mid 250 is the
area which attracts private investor interest. After falling sharply during
the pre-Budget sell-off, the Mid 250 has recovered ground rapidly and once
again remained positive in spite of profit-taking in the blue chip stocks.
Seaq volume, measured in numbers of shares traded, was high at 884.3m
shares, against 821.4m on Wednesday, when retail business worth of Pounds
1.72bn was at the higher end of this year's daily figures.
Company statements, while spurring interest in the stocks themselves, did
little to change perceptions across the market. Traders stressed the
volatility of the equity sector, which was seen as indicating that
profit-taking was absorbed easily and quickly, with investors showing no
serious signs of doubt regarding the market's gain over the past two weeks.
The slower trend of the other leading European bourses did nothing to dim
London's conviction that interest rates are on the way down, and that this
will confirm predictions that UK base rates will be cut again early in the
new year.

FT  10 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
December Footsie futures broke through 3,300 yesterday but failed to hold
their gains after a rumoured Pounds 100m sell order kicked in when the
underlying market hit that level, writes Peter John.
December opened at 3,297 and drove forward to 3,313 while maintaining a high
premium to cash. However, some dealers suggested one house had sold a big
tailor-made call option, or OTC, which would automatically cancel out if the
underlying FT-SE 100 broke through 3,300.
If that were the case, the buyer would only have benefited from rises in the
stock market up to the knock-out level. A ceiling on possible returns would
have made it cheaper to buy.
The seller of the option would have to be able to supply stock but once the
contract was void, stock bought as a hedge would have to be sold back into
the market.
The market did indeed turn when underlying equities nudged above 3,300 and
the futures were at a 13-point premium. Dealers added that the recent bear
squeeze had dissipated.
The subsequent slide received further impetus from strong producer price
figures in the US which revived concern that US investors might begin to
repatriate their holdings.
December swung back to 3,281 by the official close on strong turnover of
more than 16,200 contracts.
Among options, there was strong turnover of 54,423 lots, almost half of
which represented the two classes of FT-SE options. The most heavily traded
stock options were HSBC on 3,831 lots, followed by Bass.

FT  10 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow weighed down by
technology sector
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
In spite of a firm bond market, an early rally by US blue chip stocks
fizzled out yesterday as losses in the technology sector mounted, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator closed 4.75 off at
3,729.78 and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.11 to
464.18. The American SE composite was 1.56 down at 467.31, while technology
issues again hurt the Nasdaq, which surrendered a further 6.40 to 761.49.
New York SE volume totalled 287.6m shares.
In early trading, the tone in equities was guided by the US Treasury market,
which reacted with initial disappointment when the Labor Department
announced that the core producer price index - excluding the more volatile
energy and food components - had increased by 0.4 per cent last month. While
the figure suggested that inflationary pressures were still modest, bonds
declined on the unful-filled expectation of a 0.2 per cent rise.
However, once traders realised that a 2.1 per cent advance in car prices was
mostly responsible for the headline figure, the market retraced ground and
equities followed suit. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government
bond was up  5/32 at 101 9/32 , yielding 6.15 per cent.
With bond prices on the rise, investor optimism resurfaced, lifting those
issues most sensitive to broad economic trends. At one stage, the Dow
Industrial Average was 14 points ahead, but the gain was eroded in late
trading as firming cyclical issues failed to offset mounting losses in the
technology sector.
During the afternoon, Alcoa watched a Dollars 1 gain turn into a Dollars 1
loss and closed down at Dollars 71 1/2 . Among other cyclical stocks,
Caterpillar, the heavy equipment manufacturer, advanced Dollars 1 to Dollars
86, Rockwell added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 35 5/8 and Union Carbide finished
Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 21 3/8 .
The car makers were positioned near the top of the NYSE's most active list.
General Motors was Dollars  7/8 stronger at Dollars 56 1/8 , Ford ahead
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 63 1/2 and Chrysler Dollars  1/4 firmer at Dollars
53.
As a Delaware appeals court panel heard testimony over the proposed takeover
of Paramount Communications, the company's stock moved up Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 81 3/8 . Shares in the competing bidders lost ground, with Viacom's
'B' stock softening Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 44 1/2 and QVC down Dollars 1
1/8 at Dollars 43 5/8 . After the market closed, the court announced a
ruling which favoured QVC.
Xerox tumbled Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 88 1/4 amid profit-taking. The stock
had risen sharply on Wednesday's announcement of a big restructuring
programme.
The embattled semiconductor sector suffered a further blow after a trade
group issued a disappointing report on orders. Motorola weakened Dollars 2
3/4 to Dollars 91 1/8 and Texas Instruments dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars
60 3/8 .
The damage spilled over into Nasdaq technology shares, with Microsoft
falling Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 81 1/8 and Apple Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars
30. Novell plunged Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 19 7/8 . Dataware Technologies
plummeted Dollars 7 1/4 to Dollars 8 3/4 after a profits warning.
Canada
Toronto relinquished some ground in moderate trading after Wednesday's surge
to an all-time peak.
The TSE 300 index ended 17.0 down at 4,290.6, with declines leading advances
by 446 to 360 after volume of 58.7m shares valued at CDollars 730m. All but
one of the 14 stock groups declined. Mining recorded the largest decrease,
falling 0.92 per cent.

FT  10 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt gains despite
profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses added to recent gains, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT paused to draw breath with the DAX index closing the official
session 27.67, or 1.3 per cent higher at a new closing high of 2,175.80; but
this incorporated an Ibis-indicated rise to 2,165.95 at Wednesday's
post-bourse close, and followed a further gain to around 2,181 in the
pre-bourse yesterday. It was followed, furthermore, by a fall to 2,162.90
yesterday afternoon.
Turnover rose from DM10.4bn to DM11.8bn. Mr Werner Kahs at Bak Julius Bar in
Frankfurt said that after the pre-bourse surge, profit-taking came in from
London and kept gains among most senior blue chips within bounds. The best
rises, he said, came among second line blue chip stocks.
In banks, Berliner put on DM16 to DM462 on the official session, and
Bayernverien DM10.50 to DM579. One of the biggest gains in the second-string
blue chip category came in Schering, recovering from a flat day on Tuesday,
and reflecting a dividend increase from DM13 to DM14.22 which, for German
shareholders, would offset a reduced tax credit on dividend income. The
shares rose DM39 to DM1,124.
Volkswagen fell from a pre-bourse DM429 to a post-bourse DM423.50 after the
carmaker said that it would post a 1993 group loss of DM2.3bn, following a
DM2bn loss forecast late in November.
ZURICH remained in record territory with liquidity continuing to be
attracted by the outlook for interest rates, although an element of caution
was noted ahead of Sunday's Russian election and the outcome of the Gatt
talks.
The SMI index rose 14.6 to 2,858.4, with the market also awaiting today's
statement from the Swiss National Bank on the monetary outlook for 1994.
Ascom, the troubled telecommunications company, surged SFr85 or 7.8 per cent
to SFr1,170 as reports emerged that Mr Leonardo Vanotti, the chief
executive, was about to be replaced.
Sandoz bearers rose another SFr40 to SFr3,930, profiting from planned and
realised options issues, together with this week's positive corporate
announcements. Sulzer certificates added SFr18 to SFr792 on rumours of a
forthcoming strong buy recommendation.
A SFr100 rise to SFr3,950 by Electrowatt was attributed to positive press
comment.
MILAN was heartened by the success of the Credito Italiano privatisation and
the Comit index rose 10.81 or 1.9 per cent to 584.27.
Credito added L77 or 3.3 per cent to L2,435: the public offer of 840m shares
was six times subscribed and closed two days early. BCI rose L269 or 5.7 per
cent to L4,990 as the government pressed for its privatisation to be brought
forward to February from April.
CIR added L100 or 6.8 per cent to L1,575 in response to AT&amp;T's sale of its
remaining 10.1 per cent stake.
AMSTERDAM advanced into record territory during the session before a dull
opening on Wall Street made investors more cautious. The CBS Tendency index
ended off 0.4 at 140.4, having edged forward to 141.7. Royal Dutch was a big
influence on the broad market, dipping Fl 4.70 to Fl 196.00 as the pice of
crude continued to soften. Hoogovens added 10 cents to Fl 44.70 after
announcing that unions had agreed a pay freeze for 1994/1995.
PARIS inched forward with the CAC-40 index closing 6.09 ahead at 2,211.40.
Turnover was FFr4.8bn.
Trading in Rhone-Poulenc was halted briefly late in the session owing to
extremely high volume in the stock. The shares closed 60 centimes higher at
FFr150.1 with some 1.7m shares changing hands.
Euro Disney came back into the news on reports that US hotel chains were to
build accommodation near the resort, undercutting prices there. The shares
dipped FFr2.15 to FFr34.80.
STOCKHOLM noted another decline in Ericsson B shares, which closed off SKr25
at SKr331. The Affarsvarlden general index ended up 1.2 at 1,360.4.
Turnover was SKr2.5bn.
MADRID improved higher following its closure for public holidays earlier
this week. The general index put on 3.17 to 308.09 in turnover of Pta30bn.

FT  10 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Peruvian equities enter a new period of
maturity - Sally Bowen finds that trading has calmed down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lima's small but turbulent stock market looks set for a period of calmer
trading patterns. Investors can expect less spectacular gains than hitherto,
but their Peruvian holdings should cause them fewer sleepless nights.
The Lima bourse - the second most profitable in the world in 1992 with a
dollar gain of 125 per cent, according to IFC data - is showing signs of
greater maturity. For example, a new law requires purchase orders to be
handled in strict rotation, while regulations outlawing insider trading and
introducing consolidated balance sheets, both in the pipeline, are further
indications that the equity market is coming of age.
Expansion since the introduction of liberal economic reform in 1991 has
maintained a dizzying pace. Daily turnover now regularly reaches Dollars
10m, against Dollars 300,000 just two years ago, and this year's total has
already topped Dollars 1.5bn, up from Dollars 550m in 1992.
Until 1993, some eight major shares accounted for 80 per cent of all
trading, whereas now that same percentage includes more than three dozen
issues. Foreign investors are still responsible for two-thirds of daily
trading but, say local brokers, the more speculative investors are moving on
elsewhere and there is less volatility.
Lima's general share index has put on an impressive 70 per cent in the year
so far, even though 22 per cent was knocked off values last month. Some
analysts attribute the November slide to an unenthusiastic 'yes' vote in
October's referendum on the constitution. Others say that it was a
predictable adjustment to over-valuation.
Spectacular price rises in the past few years 'have been entirely due to a
revaluation of assets', says Mr Federico Laffan, Peruvian fund manager of
Foreign and Colonial Emerging Markets. Blue chips were 'so ridiculously
cheap you just had to put money in - even though reliable information on
companies was non-existent', he adds.
Distortions originating from the hyper-inflation of the late 1980s has meant
that standard indicators are all but useless to measure the real worth of
Peruvian shares, and foreign fund managers have had to resort to makeshift
indicators such as market capitalisation and sales.
'If you saw a company with sales of Dollars 100m and market capitalisation
of Dollars 10m, then the share was extremely cheap,' remarks Mr Laffan. 'Now
the markets have emerged from that initial revaluation phase. Even with
November's price correction the blue chips look expensive and the earnings
tendency is uncertain.'
Foreign and Colonial's Peru Fund has done well, however, showing 25 per cent
appreciation since it got fully under way in late June. This year's profits
have come largely from riskier 'second tier' stocks subject to a revaluation
similar to that which the blue chips experienced last year.
Selected second liners - often companies bought by foreign investors - have
risen by up to 900 per cent this year.
But such bargains are no longer to be found and future price rises, say
brokers, will be more rational and orderly.
'Peru is coming out of recession and once sales pick up and companies are
working nearer full capacity, price/earnings ratios will look attractive
again,' says Mr Jose Almenara, general manager of the stock exchange.
According to Mr Jose Picasso of Argos, a Lima stockbroking firm, buyers in
1994 will be 'much more selective, looking closely at who is managing a
company and how well prepared it is for the changed economic environment'.
Mr Picasso predicts that next year's growth will be in consumption oriented
companies and mining, a long depressed sector where foreign capital is
entering strongly.
Most analysts agree that consolidated balance sheets will be a key step in
the transformation to modernity. At the moment companies do not disclose the
extent of their holdings in other activities.
'If that law comes through,' says Mr Laffan, 'I would turn from my currently
neutral position into a raging bull.'

FT  10 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei jumps 3.4 per
cent in a strong region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei average jumped 3.4 per cent, rising above the 17,000 level for
the first time in four trading days following comments by the governor of
the Bank of Japan, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor, said that further falls in the stock market
would dampen business sentiment and have an adverse impact on the economy.
The 225-issue index, which had fallen by 2.3 per cent on Wednesday,
rebounded 553.96 to 17,061.91. The Topix index of all first section stocks
rose 41.20, or 3 per cent, to 1,437.74. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
put on 2.54 at 1,174.58.
The governor's comments sparked a late afternoon rally, pushing the Nikkei
up to a day's high of 17,089.01 just before the close, having opened at a
low of 16,545.15.
Activity was also supported by index-linked buying prompted by Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the prime minister, pledging on Wednesday that he would do
whatever possible to ensure a market recovery.
Volume was 232m shares, against Wednesday's 286m, while rises overwhelmed
declines by 1,015 to 65.
Investors were also encouraged by the passage of the supplementary budget
through the lower house and reports that some leaders of the coalition were
calling for the establishment of a public entity to buy land held by banks.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y35,000 to Y720,000 and East Japan
Railway gained Y10,000 at Y423,000.
Index-linked buying supported banks, Industrial Bank of Japan adding Y60 at
Y2,840 and Fuji Bank Y80 at Y1,900.
Construction companies, which have been battered by the recent spate of
bribery scandals, were bought by institutional investors, who believe that
most of the bad news is now in the market. Taisei moved ahead Y17 to Y640,
Obayashi Y14 to Y595 and Shimizu Y20 to Y770.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 575.14 to 18,909.35 in volume of 27.8m
shares.
Roundup
The region saw strong performances yesterday.
HONG KONG surged 2.5 per cent to a record high, powered by hefty gains in
index futures on the back of strong US demand. The Hang Seng index added
240.03 at 9,990.26, surpassing the previous intraday high of 9,937.36 set on
December 7 and Wednesday's closing record of 9,750.23. Turnover came to
HKDollars 9.31bn.
In subsequent London trading, the indicative index rose a further 126 to
10,117.
December futures contracts touched a high of 10,215 before closing at
10,190, a 200-point premium to the local market, having ended at a 60-point
discount the previous day.
Mr Michael Franklin of James Capel commented that the market had become
increasingly technical, with futures trading reflecting options hedging. He
added that a convincing break through 10,000 on the Hang Seng today could
open the way for a rise to the 12,000 level although, because of the
technical nature of trading, the market could also fall back very quickly.
SINGAPORE followed Hong Kong's lead, climbing to a new closing peak amid
strong demand for banking and infrastructure stocks. The Straits Times
Industrial index put on 7.11 at 2,166.32.
BANGKOK forged ahead 3 per cent to a record high, with the SET index rising
43.71 to 1,480.63 in Bt25.92bn turnover.
Finance and securities issues have been favoured on the expectation that the
increased daily turnover in the stock market would raise these firms'
profits, while the property sector has found support from lower interest
rates.
JAKARTA edged higher in moderate late trading and the official index added
2.0 at 525.32. Strong demand which took Indah Kiat Rp175 higher to Rp2,250
surprised some analysts following the company's recent lower than expected
third-quarter earnings.
KUALA LUMPUR saw demand for speculative and laggard stocks, while a rebound
in Telekom Malaysia helped to lift the composite index 6.55 to a closing
1,067.34. Telekom finished 50 cents ahead at MDollars 19.90.
SEOUL saw a continuation of Wednesday's strong performance as turnover
soared to record levels. The composite index ended 7.24 up at 843.95 after a
day's high of 855.30. Turnover came to Won1,430bn.
KARACHI was pulled higher by active foreign interest in major issues. The
KSE 100 index rose 14.87 to 1,868.31.
MANILA eased in spite of a solid rise in the mining sector, which advanced
after the price of gold firmed in New York overnight. The composite index
slipped 8.30 to 2,510.62, as the mining sub-index soared 375.61 to 5,250.16.
Turnover dipped to 697m pesos from Wednesday's 762m pesos.
AUSTRALIA also declined slightly as profit-taking in the industrial sector
was balanced by a surge in resource stocks. The All Ordinaries index lost
just 0.3 to 2,095.7, after hitting a high in early trading of 2,107.2.
Sentiment was dampened by News Corporation, which retreated 62 cents to
ADollars 10.28 after the company withdrew its plan to issue shares with
'super voting rights'.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Markets Report: D-Mark slightly weaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark weakened slightly against some of the currencies in Europe's
exchange rate mechanism, with the French franc and Danish krone hitting new
highs since the ERM's revamp last summer, writes Conner Middelmann.
The German currency has been easing on expectations of more domestic
interest rate cuts, as well as unwinding of long D-Mark positions against
short positions in other ERM currencies. 'Most of the price action has been
driven by position adjustments rather than by real fund flows,' said Mr Mark
Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets.
Germany's call money rate eased again amid ample money market liquidity,
slipping to around 6 per cent, from some 6.07 per cent on Wednesday. The
three-month Euromark future edged ahead 0.01 point to 93.91.
The downward revision of western Germany's November inflation rate had
little impact, although traders said it added to the D-Mark's softer tone.
Month-on-month inflation was 0.2 per cent, with the year-on-year rate at 3.6
per cent. That was below the 0.3 per cent and 3.7 per cent preliminary rates
initially published.
Denmark's stocks, bonds and currency were buoyed by comments from Mr Erik
Hoffmeyer, the governor of the Danish central bank. In an interview with the
Danish financial daily Boersen, he said he saw the present strength of the
krone as paving the way for more rate cuts.
He was also reported as saying that the central bank would test the market
with a series of gradual, small rate cuts, allowing Denmark to eventually
lower its rates to the German level.
The Danish central bank has cut money market rates six times in the last 11
weeks.
The Danish krone rose to its highest level since the ERM shake-up on August
2. After hitting an intraday high of DKr3.9040 against the D-Mark, it ended
at DKr3.918, barely changed from DKr3.915 on Wednesday.
The Dutch guilder set a five-year high against the D-Mark on the back of
heavy foreign buying at this week's government bond tap issue, which raised
Fl 11bn in three days.
The guilder peaked at Fl 111.87 per DM100 before ending at Fl 111.90,
unchanged from Wednesday.
The currency's strength had some dealers calling for another cut in the
Dutch special advances rate at the next open-market operation on Tuesday.
Some traders expect to see a small rate reduction on that day, while others
said the Dutch central bank could set a two-day pact expiring on Thursday to
coincide with the next meeting of the Bundesbank's central bank council.
The French franc continued to strengthen against the D-Mark, breaching
technical resistance at FFr3.4230 and approaching the key FFr3.4180 level.
After reaching a high of FFr3.4193, it shed some of its gain in the
afternoon and ended little changed at FFr3.427, after FFr3.424 the previous
day.
Subduing the franc in the afternoon were reports that the Bank of France was
selling francs against the D-Mark and the dollar in a continued effort to
shore up its foreign currency reserves, which were sharply depleted during
last summer's currency crisis.
Its latest statement for the week ending December 2 indicated that French
net currency reserves rose by FFr1.8bn, putting reserves some FFr11.02bn in
the black. 'That was rather less than we were hoping for,' said Chris
Furness, a currency analyst at market analysis firm IDEA.
Most traders do not expect the franc's recent appreciation to trigger more
aggressive easing by the Bank of France. This was reflected by the March
Pibor futures contract, which slipped 0.01 point to 93.50.
The pound finished a slow session unchanged at DM2.5500 against the D-Mark.
Money market conditions remained on the tight side, and traders said the
Bank of England's market operations indicated a desire to quell market
speculation of near-term rate cuts.
A money trader commented: 'They are putting a small brake on by keeping
liquidity tight - I am getting the impression that they do not want the
market to roar ahead.' However, he does not expect any strong signals from
the Bank ahead of Wednesday's data on retail price inflation and Thursday's
Bundesbank meeting. The December short sterling contract eased 0.02 point to
94.67.
The Bank announced a shortage of Pounds 1.95bn which was later revised to
Pounds 1.9bn. In an early round, it purchased Pounds 110m of bills outright
and Pounds 592m for resale to the market at a later date. In further
operations, it bought a total of Pounds 655m and provided late assistance of
around Pounds 550m.
The US dollar edged slightly higher to end at DM1.7055, up from DM1.7050 at
Wednesday's close. Against the yen, the dollar finished at Y108.65, compared
with Y108.60 a day earlier. New York trading ended with the US currency at
DM1.7036 and Y108.65.
US producer price data had little overall affect on the currency. While the
headline rate was unchanged on the month, the core rate was up 0.4 per cent,
slightly above expectations but not enough to fuel speculation that the
Federal Reserve would start tightening soon. Traders will be looking to
today's CPI numbers for a clearer picture on US inflation.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (6): Winter is not yet
over - The Japanese Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The past few years have been a long winter for Japan's commercial vehicle
industry. The country's truck and bus makers have been forced to take
unprecedented measures to survive the business downturn.
Nissan Diesel, the maker of heavy duty trucks and buses, last month agreed
with its labour union to cut back its winter bonus payment by an average 7.2
per cent. It is the first time the company has had to renegotiate the bonus
payment after agreeing the level in the spring.
Meanwhile, Hino Motors, Japan's largest maker of medium and heavy duty
trucks, has embarked on an unusual diversification path which it hopes will
enable it to derive about 10 per cent of its sales from new businesses by
2001. Hino has set up three separate companies to sell vertical parking lots
and to provide consulting services in such areas as distribution and
corporate identity.
The moves reflect the severity of the decline in demand facing Japanese
commercial truck and bus manufacturers. Last year, sales of trucks in Japan
fell for the fourth consecutive year, while those of buses declined for the
second year in succession. As the economic slowdown continued unabated, new
registrations of trucks were down 10 per cent while those of buses declined
by nearly 6 per cent.
What is more, the expected recovery in business investment and consumer
demand has not materialised in 1993, leading the country's large commercial
vehicle makers to brace themselves for another year of disappointing
results.
Strong demand for trucks that was expected from public works projects under
the government's economic stimulus programme has failed to emerge so far, in
the face of a series of bribery scandals that has rocked the construction
industry and its local government customers.
Furthermore, Japan's economic recovery, when it comes, 'will be an
exceedingly gentle one,' notes Hino Motors. As a result, commercial vehicle
makers will have to wait some time before demand picks up, the company says.
As they face up to the undeniable changes in their business environment,
commercial vehicle makers have adopted a number of emergency measures aimed
at containing the damage.
To begin with, companies have been slashing costs across the board by hiring
fewer seasonal workers, reducing overtime work and reining in general
expenses. The large truck makers are aiming for double-digit reductions in
their seasonal workforce over the next few years not only to reduce their
costs but also to increase efficiency at facilities which have been running
at below capacity.
The cost-cutting exercise has extended to capital investment, which is being
focused on a more narrow range of products. For example, Hino Motors cut
capital expenditure by 19 per cent last year.
In common with Japan's car makers, commercial vehicle makers are also
attempting to reduce the number of models they offer and to standardise
parts. The move is a reaction to the years of expansion in the late 1980s
when many Japanese manufacturers increased their product range and line-up
of options with little regard to cost efficiency.
But with the contraction of the Japanese market and rapid appreciation of
the yen, which has made commercial vehicles less competitive abroad,
manufacturers have been forced to concentrate their energies on fewer models
and trim product options to cut costs.
Going a step further, some automobile makers have taken the plunge in tying
up with rival companies to provide each other with product and thereby curb
development and production costs.
Nissan, Mazda and Fuji Heavy, for example, agreed earlier this year to
supply each other with commercial vehicles on an original equipment
manufacture basis. Nissan will thus sell Mazda trucks under its own badge
and vice versa.
The arrangement allows the companies to cut development and production costs
on models which are not profitable enough to justify the expensive
investments required but which are needed to complement their product range.
Meanwhile, Isuzu has pulled out of passenger car manufacture altogether.
Instead of splitting its energies between commercial and passenger vehicle
production, Isuzu will concentrate on the commercial side where it has
proven strength.
To continue providing its customers with its range of cars, Isuzu is buying
them from Honda and supplying its partner in turn with recreational vehicles
 -the Jeep-like cars that are closer to trucks in construction.
Another trend in the recessionary trading en- vironment is the growing
interest in Asian markets, particularly China. While Japan's domestic market
remains in the doldrums and markets in the west remain under pressure,
buoyant dem- and from Asian countries has given firm support to the oper-
ations of Japanese commer- cial vehicle makers, although earnings from these
markets have also been adversely affected by the high yen.
Expectations of a slow Japanese market and growing demand in Asia have led
many Japanese automobile makers to place their hopes on plans for the
regional market.
Hino Motors, for example, has set up a joint venture company with one of
China's big five bus makers to manufacture and market buses. Nissan is also
setting up a joint venture in China to produce pick-up trucks.
While the cautious moves into China by Japanese vehicle makers are modest
steps, compared with their investments in the US or Europe, they reflect the
growing need of Japanese companies to develop new markets overseas and
reduce their dependence on the home market.
In the short term, as the companies themselves would be the first to
concede, Japan's market is unlikely to provide the commercial vehicle
industry with the strong recovery it would need for a marked rebound in
their business performance.
Nevertheless, as more public works projects start to come through, demand
for trucks is bound to pick up while in the more medium term, the corporate
restructuring and moderate consolidation taking place in the industry should
start to bring benefits as well.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (7): US truck orders run
in high gear - The factors contributing to a surge in sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the number of heavy-duty trucks rolling off US assembly lines were a sure
indication of gathering economic strength, the Clinton administration would
have good cause to be cheerful.
Manufacturers of class 8 lorries - mostly large, over-the-road
tractor-trailers - are enjoying a boom year, with retail sales in the first
nine months of 1993 running more than 35 per cent ahead of last year's
level.
More importantly, current production or 'builds', which analysts use to
gauge quarterly earnings, and orders, which point to future performance,
have risen to their highest levels since 1979, just before deregulation
brought greater efficiency to the freight haulage industry and reduced
demand for new vehicles.
Industry analysts agree that new truck orders lead the economy by a year or
more. Output of heavy lorries generally shows a close correlation with
manufacturing activity, as well as trends in freight movements. Big US
trucking fleets, the theory goes, buy vehicles in the expectation of
increased demand by factories, mines and utilities for hauling raw materials
and semi- finished goods.
In the event, industrial production has resembled a big rig driving through
city traffic. It has moved in fits and starts, showing signs of smooth
acceleration only during the past two months.
By contrast, heavy duty truck orders are running in high gear. Analysts have
raised their estimates of 1993's retail sales to nearly 155,000 vehicles, a
30 per cent increase on last year's figure.
The modest recovery in US manufacturing and strong capital investment
spending are helping to lift the heavy duty market, while a mix of unrelated
factors is also fuelling the sales surge, analysts say.
Some of these broad developments have boosted demand for trucking services,
while others - such as a heightened emphasis on fuel efficiency, heavy
turnover of trained drivers and more stringent emission standards - have
encouraged fleet operators to upgrade their equipment more frequently or
ahead of schedule.
The pattern among foreign manufacturers to build more of their products in
the US, rather than import them, has had some impact. Mercedes, for one,
announced plans last month to build a car plant in Alabama - its first
outside Germany.
Ms Maril Macdonald, vice- president of corporate communications at Navistar
International, which leads the industry in combined sales of heavy and
medium-duty trucks, says that the relocation of foreign-owned factories to
the US in recent years has boosted trucking tonnage and, in turn, lorry
orders.
The extra push has come at a propitious time. During the recession of
1989-91, many large trucking operators and truck-leasing companies, which
normally replace their equipment every five to six years, withheld their
orders. With the onset of renewed economic optimism in mid-1992, the pent-up
demand began to feed into the market. As a result, net orders by the end of
last year rose 74 per cent above depressed 1991 levels.
Since then, says Mr Gary McManus, an analyst with Kemper Securities in New
York, lorry makers have allowed their backlogs to build to a 13-year high.
The six leading heavy duty truck manufacturers - Freightliner, Navistar,
Paccar, Ford, Mack and Volvo-GM - are now operating at nearly full capacity,
which allows for much more efficient production.
Paccar, considered by many to be the best run truck-maker in the US, this
year opened a truck assembly facility in Renton, Washington. By early 1995,
Freightliner, part of Daimler-Benz, plans to increase annual production
capacity by 25 per cent.
Full production schedules have brought slightly firmer prices in recent
months, according to Mr Matt Stover, who follows the market for Bears
Stearns in New York. In general, however, the pricing environment has been
fiercely competitive, with most of the demand coming from well-financed
fleet operators which can command bigger discounts than owner-operators.
Navistar says that comparable prices have risen by only 1 per cent in the
past eight years.
Freightliner, thanks in part to Daimler-Benz's deep pockets, has shown most
willingness to undercut its rivals to gain market share. After taking the
lead in 1992, it has stayed on top in 1993, with about 23 per cent of the
heavy duty market, which represents a 10-point gain over the past decade.
Nevertheless, after pulling out of the red in 1992, Freightliner says it has
turned a substantial profit this year, a claim only one of its competitors -
Paccar - can make. Daimler-Benz does not report separate results for
Freightliner.
By contrast, Mack, which is wholly owned by Renault of France, says it has
cut its losses and expects to become profitable in the second quarter of
1994. Volvo-GM, controlled by the Swedish automotive group, also expects to
turn a modest profit this year.
For Navistar, this year has brought a return to profitability. In the second
quarter, the group - the surviving operations of once mighty International
Harvester - edged back into the black after 10 consecutive quarterly losses
on the back of strong sales volume. In its fourth quarter, the group's net
income was 28 cents a share compared with a loss of Dollars 1.46 in the same
quarter last year.
The red ink had resurfaced in the third quarter, but the Dollars 312m loss
reflected a one-time charge of Dollars 513m relating to a landmark deal
agreed with the United Auto Workers to cut post-retirement benefits. The
plan, approved in July, is expected to save the company Dollars 200m a year.
'Navistar is making money, but it's not printing it,' says Mr Robert
McCarthy, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. He raises doubts over
whether the group will be able to sustain its momentum when the market
returns to more normal, single-digit growth.
In the short term, Navistar, along with other manufacturers, has benefited
from the desire of truckers to maximise the fuel efficiency of their
vehicles and lower operating costs. New trucks are 5 to 7 per cent more
fuel-efficient than models built in the late 1980s, says Mr John McGinty, an
analyst with First Boston.
Navistar's 9200 series, which features lighter weight and more aerodynamic
styling, has helped lift the group's class 8 market share in the first nine
months of 1993 by nearly a point.
Mack, with its CL and CH series of fuel-efficient heavy lorries, has gained
about half a point to nearly 11 per cent. By contrast, Ford, which has made
no changes in its product line since 1988, has dropped below Mack in sales.
Navistar, leader in the class 6 and class 7 medium-duty segment, is poised
to take advantage of an expected acceleration in the intermediate segment.
An upswing in orders for retail delivery trucks, school buses and lighter
construction vehicles is forecast if the consumer side of the economy begins
to pick up steam in 1994.
In the first nine months of this year, the medium-duty market - from class 4
(where Ford continues to dominate) to class 7 - grew at a more moderate 11.5
per cent.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (8): Screws will tighten
again - Emissions and Noise Regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stricter exhaust emission limits for new trucks came into effect throughout
the European Union two months ago.
Despite some grumblings when the standards were announced several years ago,
truck manufacturers have had relatively little difficulty meeting them -
though the investments in new technology have been substantial.
In the mid-1990s, the screws will be tightened further.
'Euro II' standards will come into force for new designs of trucks from
October 1 1995, and for all trucks emerging from production lines from
October 1 1996.
The standards will require further cuts in emissions of oxides of nitrogen -
a cause of acid rain - carbon monoxide and particulates - the well-known
diesel 'soot'.
To achieve the Euro II standards, the petroleum industry must become
involved, as the sulphur content of diesel fuel needs to be reduced if
particulate emissions are to be cut substantially.
Under a EU-set timetable, the 0.2-0.3 per cent sulphur content usual in
diesel fuels will have dropped to a maximum of 0.05 per cent by the time
Euro II is fully effective. To cater for the first stage of the Euro II
standards, by October 1 1995 at least 25 per cent of the diesel fuel
available in EU member states must be below the 0.05 per cent ceiling.
Around the end of the decade, yet another tightening can be expected, with
the standards based on a new test driving cycle reflecting 'real life' road
conditions in Europe.
The current EU test driving cycle - simulating a supposedly typical journey
and on which emissions are measured - is a much-criticised slow speed one,
still not reflecting that 80 per cent of the EU's goods are moved by truck
and across ever-longer distances along high-speed motorways.
Despite such measures, says Mr Sten Langenius, president and chief executive
of Sweden's Volvo Truck Corporation, technology's advance is such that
emissions will cease to be an issue by 2005.
By then, he predicts, emissions of nitrogen oxides, for example, will be
more than halved compared with the Euro II standards, to 2 grammes per brake
horsepower. Emissions of particulates - accused of being a carcinogen - will
fall proportionately more as fuel formulation improves.
Volvo Truck, one of the world's biggest truck makers, earlier this year
underlined the industry's long-term commitment to the diesel with the launch
of its new FH heavy truck range - the result of a seven-year development
programme costing Pounds 600m.
The trucks are powered by an all-new 12-litre diesel engine which accounts
for nearly half the total spending.
Using a combination of old and new technologies, it is capable, says Volvo,
of meeting all current environmental standards anywhere in the world. More
important, Volvo expects it to meet all future standards to the end of the
decade without any significant redesign. The unit uses new, high-pressure
fuel injection technology from Lucas, the UK motor components and aerospace
group. The 'EUI' (electronic unit injector) operates at very high pressure -
1800 bar - and can make instantaneous adjustments to fuelling quantity and
timing in each injector, under the control of a central computer which takes
readings from various sensors around the engine.
Other leading truck makers have little choice but to make similar
investments if they wish to stay in the game - and some, like DAF with its
excursion into receivership this year, have had great difficulty in doing
so. Iveco, Fiat's commercial vehicles arm, is spending around Pounds 1bn on
truck engines as part of an overall Pounds 2.5bn vehicle renewal programme.
Mr Leif Ostling, general manager of Scania Truck and Buses, Volvo's Swedish
rival, says that technology improvements linked to emissions will have other
pay-offs. Engines that have to work less hard also produce fewer emissions
and there should be further scope for a reduction in energy consumption from
non-engine related improvements. Aerodynamics, rolling resistance and weight
reduction improvements have already cut energy consumption by one half per
tonne-kilometre over the past 20 years, he points out.
Emissions, however, are not the only major environmental issue confronting
trucks. The other is noise.
Under an EU directive to become effective in October 1995, an 80-decibel
limit will be introduced for trucks, based on the vehicle passing a pair of
microphones at 50kmh.
Manufacturers will find it a difficult target to meet as a relatively small
drop in decibel rating can mean a large reduction in perceived noise.
As Mr Ostling points out, the noise emitted by Scania (and most other)
trucks has fallen by 8dB (A) over the past decade - equivalent to an 84 per
cent drop in perceived noise. But this remains well above the planned EU
level and truck makers are arguing that the problem now lies more with the
way noise is measured than the actual amount of noise made by the vehicle.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (4): Making it in Latin
America - Rise of an innovative vehicle industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAT KENNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin America used to be one of the largest and most lucrative markets for
commercial vehicles from Europe and North America. In the 1950s and 1960s,
extensive industrial-isation required vast numbers of trucks and buses,
while the size of the continent, 7,000 km from the Caribbean coast to Cape
Horn, meant that each and every one had plenty of work to do. In 1960, for
example, Leyland alone was supplying 1,000 buses to Buenos Aires, 500 to
Montivedeo, 100 to Jamaica and 240 to Havana, with corresponding truck
numbers to every part of the continent. Mercedes, GM, MAN and Ford did
similar volumes of business later in that decade.
All that has gone, not because the suppliers are less able, but because many
countries decided to develop their own vehicle industries. They encouraged
manufacturers to establish assembly operations, leading to progressive
manufacturing, and set up formidable barriers against vehicle imports. The
Mercosul scheme currently carries out that task.
The progress of such well-meaning projects was far from smooth. Restrictions
or bans on imports meant that vital components, which were difficult to make
locally, were excluded along with complete vehicles.
Consequently, manufacturers struggled to produce the required quality of
vehicle and, as in India and elsewhere, they learned how to solve technical
problems the hard way, by going back to basic engineering principles.
The result is that today's Latin American commercial vehicle industry is
both innovative and technically strong. Some European senior managers,
including Mr Helmut Werner of Mercedes-Benz, reckon that Brazil is one of
the most exciting countries in the world as far as trucks are concerned.
Several Latin American nations have become vehicle producers, while some,
including Argentina and Mexico, combine production and imports in their
increasingly dynamic economies.
Brazil not only provides all its own commercial vehicles - a few special
designs excluded - but exports in quantity to other Latin American
countries, the US and Canada, numerous African states and even to Europe.
Fiat's Fiorino light van, for example, is made exclusively in Brazil.
Mexico also provides for most of its own needs. In 1992, it built or
assembled 304,000 commercials, mainly under 3000kg GVW. Assembly takes place
in Venezuela and Peru, but substantial numbers are imported, partly from
other Latin American countries.
Different strategies are employed by some of the big players. Mercedes-Benz
has developed a range of medium and heavy truck designs in Brazil which,
apart from the star on the grille, bear little or no resemblance to their
distant European cousins. Thirty years ago, when Mercedes set up in
Argentina and Brazil, the products were simply export versions of European
originals.
The VW-Ford venture, Autolatina Brazil, has also developed along lines that
owe little to North America or Europe; hence, there are VW trucks up to 35
tonnes with MWM engines. Dedicated US market truck chassis are built in
Brazil by several makers, such as the 'baby' Kenworth Class 6 &amp; 7 medium
trucks.
But while some manufacturers freely develop designs found only in Brazil,
others go to great lengths to ensure that their Latin American products,
including components, are identical to and interchangeable with those in
Europe.
Scania, which has manufactured in Brazil and Argentina for more than 25
years, uses its Latin American plants as part of a global manufacturing
network. Engines made in Sao Paulo and gearboxes made in Tucuman could find
their way into chassis built in Iran or France or Holland just as easily as
those from Sweden, depending on production balance at any particular time.
Among the old world manufacturers to be found in Brazil are Mercedes, Volvo,
Ford, Scania and VW, although Iveco pulled out some years ago.
Significantly, there is, as yet, little Japanese presence: it accounts for
less than 1 per cent of truck output in Brazil's total of well over a
quarter of a million.
Mexico's industry is, perhaps inevitably, closer related to the US, its
next-door neighbour, than to those in countries further south. US
manufacturers with Mexican operations include Ford, Chrysler and GM,
Freightliner in conjunction with Mercedes' international operations,
Volkswagen, Cummins engines and Rockwell components among many others.
The European presence is less prominent, but Perkins has had a diesel engine
joint venture, as have a number of component specialists.
Just as the major manufacturing operations of the 1990s began in a modest
way a quarter of a century ago, so others have more recently begun the long
industrial haul.
Cuba builds its own diesel engines in a rationalised range of V6 to V12
units from 200 to 450 bhp, powering literally everything that moves, from
trucks and urban railcars to fishing boats and combine harvesters. It has a
surprisingly extensive components industry, making a variety of parts, from
fuel injectors to semi-automatic gearboxes.
The country's expanding population and free movement of labour demand
extensive public transport, and Cuba's bus production is numbered in
thousands rather than hundreds a year. There was a promising export trade in
buses until the collapse of the east European bloc, but nowadays just a
trickle goes out, mainly to African nations with leftwing governments. Given
reasonable political stability, Cuba has every chance of joining that
growing band of third world nations which aspire to 'supplier' rather than
'consumer' status.
Modest assembly operations have been going on in Peru and Venezuela for more
than a decade, but to date they show little sign of development into viable
manufacture. Colombia assembles a modest number of light commercials, mainly
of Chrysler and Renault origin, but heavy trucks are imported.
In a relatively short period and largely by its own efforts, Latin America
has been transformed from a large market for old world suppliers to
something approaching self-sufficiency. Indeed, the US buys more commercial
vehicles from Latin America than it sells there. That trend can be seen
elsewhere in the world, simply because it makes economic sense.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (3): New drive in Asia -
The continent's exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAT KENNETT

<TEXT>
The shape of global commercial vehicle manufacture is inexorably changing.
The big truck market growth areas are the world's developing nations, rather
than those already industrialised. High production costs in the old world
have already ruled out many of those sources for much of the developing
world's transport.
In Asia a clear trend is developing. Nations that a few years ago ranked as
third world have developed their own industries to the point where they have
become net vehicle exporters. Countries which have partly or wholly achieved
this status are India, South Korea and China.
While China has developed its own industry dramatically, it has such a huge
internal demand that it will be some time before it can become a major
exporter. Malaysia and Vietnam have also embarked on ventures to become
vehicle producers.
After a 30-year gestation period during which engineering techniques
required to produce durable trucks and buses were learned the hard way, with
very little help or money, India has blossomed into a world class producer.
This year it will build about 175,000 commercial vehicles and is expected to
exceed 200,000 by 1995.
While many of these are developed from European chassis of 20 years ago, an
increasing proportion are modern designs, much in demand in Africa, the
Middle East and Asian territories.
Most of what India calls heavy trucks would be termed medium-weight in
Europe. As two-axle 12-16 tonners, they are well suited to many developing
markets. This heavy sector is shared by two makers: Tata, a member of the
Telco manufacturing group based in Bombay, and Ashok Leyland, based in
Madras, with Iveco holding a 51 per cent stake.
Tata was a CKD operation set up with Mercedes' help in the 1950s, but the
Germans reduced their direct interest as Tata developed its own designs and
technologies. This year it signed a deal with Cummins to build B-series
diesel engines in the 120-210 bhp class.
In the light commercial sector Tata has an excellent new product range
called the 207 based on a sturdy 4x2 chassis with a modern 2.0 litre diesel,
bodied as a truck, a large estate car or a utility in the Range Rover class.
Tata is into more than a dozen markets with this versatile vehicle,
including Europe, where it is already approved in France.
Once a Leyland-based CKD operation set up in the late 1950s, Ashok Leyland
has in recent weeks begun manufacture of a version of the Ford Cargo which
was built at Langley, near Heathrow Airport, until last December.
Ashok is a key element in Iveco's strategy outside Europe. The company has
invested around Pounds 140m to build the 6-10 tonne Cargo and a further
Pounds 100m will go on larger versions in the next three years. Production
of 25,000 units will be possible, more than doubling Ashok's capacity in the
6-16 tonne classes. Pressings for the Indian Cargo cab will be done for
Ashok by Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, and assembled in a new shop near Bangalore.
Mahindra itself has ambitious expansion plans. The group is best known for
utility vehicles of less than three tonnes, including several Jeep variants,
but also builds light trucks. In 1993 it began production of the Armada
which can carry 11 people in its passenger variant.
For its new low-emission two-litre diesel, to be built in India, Mahindra
went to world-renowned engine R&amp;D specialists, AVL of Graz, Austria. Now the
group reports a waiting list of 1 1/2 years, but is resisting the temptation
to increase production until quality is absolutely assured. Then, the
Armada, like the 207 Tata, is set to become a highly attractive export item.
China is undoubtedly the largest potential market for commercial vehicles,
but direct imports have always been difficult. Increasing oil production,
both on land and in the Yellow Sea, has accelerated its industrial
programmes, including numerous commercial vehicle joint ventures, mainly
with western manufacturers. Among these are Eaton and Rockwell, producing
gearboxes and axles respectively, ZF (gearboxes and steering gear), Steyr
(heavy trucks and diesel engines for automotive and industrial uses),
Cummins, building large generator and locomotive engines and small truck
engines; and Iveco, producing vans and minibuses.
The Cummins jv with China's Dong Feng group is particularly interesting. It
embraces volume production up to 60,000 units annually, to power a new 8-12
tonne truck replacing the ancient Dong Feng. Production began early in 1993,
with locally built chassis and axles, the Cummins B-series engine and a
Nissan design steel cab. In each case these joint ventures begin with a
small number of fully built-up units, followed by increasing local content
increments to eventual 100 per cent.
The Steyr operation is now producing about 5,000 heavy trucks a year in the
17-28 tonne class and the figure is expected to double by 1997. The Iveco jv
will produce about 15,000 units this year, with about 30 per cent local
content, against a 1998 target of 60,000 with virtually 100 per cent local
content.
Potentially, China is likely to become a world class commercial vehicle
manufacturer by the end of the century, but such is the huge domestic demand
estimated at more than 250,000 medium and heavy duty vehicles before 1997
that it is likely to be some time before significant exports occur.
Malaysia's truck-building efforts are concentrated in Proton light
commercials, but several heavy vehicle makers are looking at this territory.
In Vietnam, Iveco this year established a joint venture to build Daily vans
and minibuses, again beginning with CBU units, graduating to a majority of
local content. Korea currently builds or assembles around 400,000 light
commercials, with Hyundai accounting for nearly half. Heavy trucks are still
imported, mainly from Europe.
Although the choices for direct imports into Asia are diminishing steadily,
the opportunities for joint manufacturing ventures more than compensate for
that trend.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (2): How Daf rose again
from the ashes - The new image of the Dutch truck maker, back in business
after a spell in receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of the constituent parts of the old Daf group are back in business
despite the collapse into receivership of the former Dutch truck maker in
early 1993.
The ownership and financing structure of the new companies are radically
different, and more than half of the jobs in the old group have been
eliminated, but to the customer at least the new federation of Daf companies
is seeking to present an unchanged image.
The product range - one of the most modern in Europe and sold under the Daf
name in continental Europe and Leyland Daf in the UK - is little changed,
and the group has sought to hold on to the core of its European dealer
network.
The old Daf group filed for protection from its creditors in the Netherlands
on February 2 with total debts of more than Fl 3bn, while Leyland Daf, its
UK subsidiary, went into administrative receivership in the UK a day later.
Daf was brought down by the severity of the recession in the UK, its main
market, by doubtful financing operations and by an over-ambitious product
development programme. Lacking the sales volumes - and the financial
resources - of its bigger competitors, Daf still tried to match its rivals
in the breadth of its product offering. As a result, it spread its resources
too thinly.
It suffered total accumulated net losses in the three years from 1990 to
1992 of Fl 880m, before any account was taken of an envisaged restructuring
charge of Fl 700m for 1992 chiefly to finance the closure of its UK van
operations.
As its problems deepened, Daf had already cut its workforce by more than a
quarter from 16,782 in 1989 to 12,289 in 1992 including 5,401 in the UK,
4,906 in the Netherlands, 1,461 in Belgium and 521 in the rest of the world.
The various companies that have been formed out of receivership now employ
around 6,200, including some 2,700 jobs in the UK.
The core Daf heavy and medium-weight truck operations based in the
Netherlands and Belgium have re-emerged under the ownership of the
newly-formed Daf Trucks, with majority state ownership by the Dutch and
Flemish governments.
In the UK Daf Trucks has also taken over the sales and marketing arm of the
former Leyland Daf operations in order to secure control of its distribution
and dealer network in the UK.
The remainder of the UK operations has been rescued by a series of
management buy-outs in the case of the former Leyland Daf van and truck
operations, and management buy-ins for the parts operations and the
components businesses in Glasgow (Albion) and Leyland.
The crucial first step in restoring the viability of the former Daf group
was the rescue of the Dutch and Belgian operations. The newly formed Daf
Trucks has an equity capital of Fl 385m, of which the Dutch and Flemish
governments have subscribed Fl 209m, with Fl 75m coming from a group of
banks, Fl 80m from institutional investors and Fl 21m from private
investors, including some components suppliers, dealers and importers.
Including subordinated loans, Daf Trucks has a total risk-bearing capital of
some Fl 450m. A group of banks including ABN-Amro, Rabo Bank and Credit
Lyonnais have provided credit facilities of more than Fl 500m.
Daf Trucks has managed to hold on to a share of around 7 per cent of the
west European heavy truck market above 15 tonnes, and Mr Cor Baan, chairman
of the management board of Daf Trucks - as he was of the old Daf group -
maintains that the dealer network has remained largely intact.
It now has a network of some 250 main dealers and around 750 sub-dealers and
service outlets.
The new Daf Trucks includes the manufacturing, product development and sales
operations in the Netherlands, the cab and axle plant and local sales
operations in Belgium, as well five wholly-owned sales operations in the UK,
France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
The workforce now totals around 3,500 with about 2,500 in Eindhoven, 750 in
Westerlo, Belgium and 250 in the various sales organisations outside the
Netherlands.
The organisational structure has been kept 'as flat as possible', insists Mr
Baan, with a relatively small number of staff in non-production jobs. Of the
total workforce 2,440 are engaged in production, 340 in research and
development, 610 in sales and marketing and 120 in the central staff.
Daf Trucks is aiming at a production level of around 40 trucks a day at the
Eindhoven plant, although by November it was still only producing 30 trucks
a day, as it was working to reduce its stock levels and was supplying from
stock especially in Germany.
The formation of Daf Trucks allowed the receivers in the UK to proceed with
the rescue of the British operations. The formation of Leyland Trucks
Manufacturing through a management buy-out team depended crucially on
reaching a supply contract with Daf Trucks, which continues to sell the
UK-built Daf/Leyland Daf 45 series light truck through its European sales
network.
The rescue of the truck operations also created a viable business base for
the UK parts operations and components manufacturing, which have bought by
management buy-in teams. Only the UK van operations have been saved outside
this federation of companies. The management buy-out team at Leyland Daf
Vans in Birmingham is not selling its products through the new Daf Trucks
dealers but through its own network, which is largely confined to the UK.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (5): Pay first, save
later - The single market and the road haulage industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traditionally one of the most highly regulated transport sectors, the road
haulage industry has undergone considerable liberalisation in recent years.
The creation of the single European market, on January 1 1993, has created a
new working environment, the full impact of which has still to be assessed.
The removal of most border controls by customs has speeded up trans-European
journey times but has also swept away a host of small freight-forwarders
with their specialist skills in export documentation. The burden of handling
VAT forms and compiling trade data has been passed back to the trader.
Customs and Excise has estimated the cost to British business of adapting to
the single market at Pounds 100m in the first year, with net annual savings
of Pounds 135m likely to come through in later years. But it is not yet
clear that many businesses are aware of the savings in both time and cost
which can result from faster journeys.
There have been complaints that hauliers have not passed on the savings that
they have made and it is clear that this will come under closer scrutiny as
an understanding of the new regime spreads.
The advantages to the haulier of the changes are a reduction in waiting
times at many borders, particularly in southern Europe, and a more efficient
use of his vehicles and drivers' time. In northern Europe, though, where
many countries had already streamlined their customs procedures, the savings
will be less marked.
One result of the formal creation of the single market has been the removal
of restrictions on permits allowing hauliers to operate throughout the
European Union. Many European countries had maintained highly restrictive
regimes but from January 1 1993 hauliers have been issued with an
authorisation which allows them to make as many international journeys as
they want between member states.
A second grievance which is also in the process of being alleviated relates
to cabotage, the right of a haulier to pick up a load in another country and
deliver to a destination in the same country. From January 1 1994, the
number of cabotage authorisations available will go up from 18,530 to
30,000.
This allocation will increase by 30 per cent a year from 1995, with the aim
of achieving full liberalisation in July 1998. Hauliers' organisations
welcome this move but say that it has been achieved only at the expense of
allowing some European Union members to introduce special permits to use
their motorways.
Germany had refused to open its roads to outside competition until common
charging had been agreed but its attempt to impose an annual DM9,000 (Pounds
3,000) on non-German trucks was outlawed as discriminatory in May 1992 by
the European Court of Justice.
In an agreement reached in June, the 20-year wrangle over cabotage was ended
when member states gave approval for Germany and four other countries to
introduce a common fee or vignette for trucks of 12 tonnes and over
travelling on motorways.
Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Luxembourg have said they
will charge nearly Pounds 1,000 a year per vehicle for a permit to use their
roads from January 1995.
Operators with vehicles registered in one of these countries will have their
excise duty reduced to cover all or part of the permits' cost. But operators
based in other countries will get no such dispensation and so will be placed
at a competitive disadvantage, the UK's Freight Transport Association (FTA)
warns.
By charging for permits, these north European countries will in effect be
bringing themselves into line with France and Italy, where tolls are are a
standard feature of motorways. And while Britain does not yet impose
motorway tolls, Mr John MacGregor, transport minister, seems set on moving
to charging motorists for the use of roads to help fund the government's
Pounds 23bn road-building programme.
The UK government favours a system of electronic tolling, probably requiring
vehicles to carry a windscreen-mounted smart card which can be read at the
tolling point. The Freight Transport Association says it has no objection in
principle to plans for road tolls providing the funds raised are devoted to
road construction.
Road tolls would represent an additional cost to the haulier on top of the
vehicle excise duty already paid. Duties vary sharply from country to
country although the European Commission is making attempts to harmonise
rates.
A minimum rate of tax will apply to vehicles of 12 tonnes and over from
January 1995 but the thresholds have been set so low as to have little real
impact.
The rate for a 38-tonne vehicle, for example, has been set at Ecu454 (Pounds
350), far below that currently levied in the UK so it will do little, if
anything, to increase excise rates in the cheaper countries. The floor rates
will be reviewed but that will not be until January 1988, when the
transitional period ends.
The UK government argued for a higher minimum threshold but says it regards
the rates that have been set as a useful first stage.
'The agreement to establish floor rates marks a step towards ultimate
harmonisation but only if the higher taxing states voluntarily peg back
future increases,' the FTA says. Unfortunately for hauliers in countries
which impose high levels of excise duty, no maximum figure has been imposed.
Despite the move to liberalise the haulage industry in Europe, considerable
cost differences remain between the different countries. The creation of the
single market is intended to open up previously restricted local markets and
road haulage is unlikely to escape this trend. The commercial pressures on
the sector can only increase in the years ahead.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (1): No let-up in the
pace - The collapse of the Volvo-Renault merger has created fresh turmoil in
the European truck industry. Overall, the market is continuing to shrink,
but a strong upturn in demand has occurred in the US and recovery is in
sight elsewhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The world market for commercial vehicles is continuing to shrink, under the
burden of contracting demand in Europe and Japan.
Japan is enduring its fifth year in succession of declining truck output,
while sales in west Europe have suffered an unbroken four years of decline.
The crisis in the European truck market has intensified this year with sales
set to fall by around a quarter.
In North America the picture is brighter. The market has turned from famine
to feast, as the fortunes of the truck industry continue to follow their
traditional wild fluctuations.
Some US manufacturers are now struggling to keep pace with the strong upturn
in demand, with production up for the second year running by around 19 per
cent. US output of heavy duty trucks is expected to exceed 153,000 this
year, the highest level for 12 years.
Several leading European truck makers, notably Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and
Renault, have a strong presence in North America, and the rapid financial
recovery of the US operations is now helping to support the parent companies
as they face mounting losses in Europe. Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and Scania are
also benefiting from an upturn in the Brazilian truck market, where they are
the dominant producers.
Fluctuating market cycles, heavy investment demands and intensifying
competition are allowing no let-up in the pace of rationalisation and
concentration in the world industry. The restructuring has been most intense
in Europe, where tens of thousands of jobs are being eliminated. Several
producers including Mercedes, Iveco and Renault Vehicules Industriels are in
loss.
The restructuring process is proving unpredictable, however, and fresh
turmoil has been created in the European truck industry by the collapse this
month of the much-heralded merger between Volvo of Sweden and Renault, the
French state-owned vehicle maker, which had been set to create the world's
second largest heavy truck and bus maker and the only producer able to
challenge the volumes of Mercedes, the world leader.
At the same time, the recession in Europe has claimed its most notable
victim this year with the financial collapse of Daf, the Dutch commercial
vehicle maker. Daf plunged into receivership under the burden of debts of Fl
3bn and accumulated losses of Fl 880m in the three years to end-1992.
However, many of the old Daf group's operations have survived, although they
have been drastically rationalised with the elimination of more than half of
the previous workforce. The rescue was led by the Dutch and Flemish
governments which are now the majority owners of the newly formed Daf
Trucks.
This company no longer owns any UK operations other than distribution,
whereas it previously included UK van and truck assembly, axle and
components manufacturing and significant parts distribution in the wake of
its takeover of the Leyland Vehicles business in the second half of the
1980s.
The UK operations have also gradually been rescued individually from
receivership, however, by a combination of management buy-outs and buy-ins,
and they are still linked with Daf Trucks through long-term supply
agreements.
The Daf brand - Leyland Daf in the UK - still commands around 7 per cent of
the European heavy truck market, and in spite of the severity of the
recession, continues its battle against bigger rivals, which in some cases
still confront restructuring challenges.
The greatest uncertainty now faces Volvo Truck and Renault Vehicules
Industriels, the commercial vehicle operations of the Swedish and French
manufacturers.
The two groups, which have been linked through a far- reaching alliance for
the last three years, were set to complete a full merger on January 1 with
the establishment of a unified management structure. Amid great drama the
merger has been halted, however, because of the combined opposition of
leading Volvo institutional shareholders and the group's senior management.
As the two groups have already taken many important steps to combine their
operations and because they are bound together through significant minority
shareholdings - Volvo and Renault still hold 45 per cent stakes in their
respective truck and bus operations - the failure of the merger plan has
plunged them into serious difficulties.
The two managements now face an agonising period of reappraisal, as they
seek to examine what can be saved from their existing network of
collaborative projects, which activities have been rendered impossible by
the breakdown of trust between the organisations, and which areas may lend
themselves to future collaboration with other rivals among the dwindling
corps of the world's vehicle makers.
Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the former Volvo chairman, has declared that 'the
alliance will not remain. It will be dismantled by a Renault management
which has lost its confidence in Volvo. To dissolve the alliance will
require time, energy and will be demoralising.'
Understandably, Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman of Renault and the man who had
shared Mr Gyllenhammar's vision for building Europe's second largest vehicle
maker, has reacted with more caution.
The choices facing the two companies are bleak, as the fiercely competitive
landscape of the global vehicle industry, that encouraged the two companies
to look at merger as a road to survival in the next century, has not
changed.
The world's car and commercial vehicle makers are still haunted by
overcapacity, minimal growth in demand, continuous upward pressure on
product development costs, increasing price competition and the need to
overhaul radically their components and materials supplier bases to reduce
components costs.
The number of independent European manufacturers of heavy trucks has fallen
dramatically in the past two decades from 40 in 1965 to 20 in 1980 and to
only 10 in 1992.
In trucks Volvo and Renault were making heavier weather of the alliance than
in the car sector, but they had still embarked on a number of joint
development projects for basic components (such as engines and
transmissions), as well as on broad co-operation in procurement and
research.
The two groups had planned to establish a 'common architecture' for families
of engines, which would lead to joint development of engine components.
Common specifications were to be developed for rear axles and gearboxes.
Production and procurement were to be co-ordinated to reduce the unit costs
of components.
From Renault's perspective, the merger was particularly important in
commercial vehicles, where Volvo is stronger. Studies to assess the benefits
had suggested that cost savings of up to FFr42bn could be achieved by the
year 2000 from the combined car and commercial vehicle operations because of
economies of scale in production, combined R&amp;D efforts and joint purchasing
programmes.
Renault and Volvo must now examine the financial weakness of the French
group's truck operations and the Swedish group's car division. Both 'require
significant equity injections in the near future to recapitalise their
balance sheets following substantial losses over the last few years,'
according to recent Volvo statements to its shareholders.
As the two groups seek to limit the damage from the failed merger they can
expect little help from the European market. Truck sales (above 6 tonnes
gross vehicle weight) have been falling for four years from a peak of
302,000 in 1989 to a forecast 197,000 this year. Mr Rudolf Rupprecht, chief
executive of MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, Germany's second largest truck maker, warned
recently that sales next year were unlikely to show any significant recovery
with registrations expected to be virtually unchanged at around 199,000.
The pick-up in demand through the rest of the decade was also expected to be
subdued with sales reaching only 239,000 by 2000, said Mr Rupprecht,
although forecasts from elsewhere in the industry have been less cautious.
Some comfort can be drawn from the UK, however, where the recovery from the
depth of recession has been accelerating in recent months with overall truck
registrations rising by 15 per cent in the first 11 months.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Exploration pays golden
dividend for Ashanti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING

   OBUASI, GHANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ghana's Ashanti Goldfields, after more than 100 years of operation during
which it has produced in excess 21m troy ounces of gold, is poised for a
substantial expansion, according to Mr Sam Jonah, the company's managing
director.
He says that this probably makes Ashanti unique in the gold mining world and
that 'there is no reason why this mine should not go on producing 1m ounces
a year for the next 50 years, particularly now we have an aggressive
exploration programme for the first time in our history'.
The company's USDollars 300m, four-year expansion programme is already ahead
of schedule to take annual output - which dwindled to only 220,000 ounces in
1987 but rebounded to a record 765,250 ounces in 1992-93 - to more than 1m
ounces by 1996. That would place Ashanti among the world's top ten gold
producers.
The recent boost to exploration efforts has paid off handsomely.
A number of new and promising gold deposits have been located within the
company's concession area, about 180 miles north of Accra, the capital,
including one called Bekansi that already has an identified potential
resource of some 32,000 ounces of gold but continues across the western
border of the company's concession of 200,000 square kilometres.
Ashanti has applied to the Mining Ministry for a licence to extend its
operations on to the adjoining concession - which would add another 169,000
square kilometres for it to explore.
The company is hopeful that the licence will be granted in the middle of
next month, just ahead of its flotation on the London and Ghana stock
exchanges early next year.
Mr Joe Amanor, Ashanti's chief geologist, suggests that, as well as having
about 21m ounces of gold in reserves of various categories, Ashanti's
potential resources are at least 31m ounces and possibly as much as 50m.
Since 1969 Ashanti has been jointly owned by the Ghanaian government, with a
55 per cent stake, and Lonrho, the London-based conglomerate that also
manages the mine. The government hopes to raise about USDollars 250m by
selling 25 per cent of Ashanti. Lonrho says, however, that as mining is one
of its core businesses it has no intention of selling a single share.
Mr Jonah makes it clear that, once Ashanti gains more financial flexibility
via the flotation, it intends to become much more like a traditional mining
house by developing operations both elsewhere in Ghana and also beyond its
borders.
Its ownership has forced Ashanti to raise loans for expansion - a banking
consortium lead by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector
arm of the World Bank, put up Dollars 140m towards the present programme -
and Mr Jonah suggests that this has 'shackled' the company financially.
'Banks are not very willing to grant loans against assets on which other
banks have prior charges,' he explains.
Nevertheless, Ashanti is sitting on one of the richest and highest-grade
gold deposits in the world and this has enabled it to remain highly
profitable and to pay dividends.
The 1992-93 profit is still be audited and adjusted for the flotation by
auditors Price Waterhouse, but the trend is clear.
Accounts drawn up for the year to September on the same basis as those for
the previous 12 months would show a net profit of about 65bn cedis (Dollars
109m) against 27.2bn cedis the previous year.
Mr Jonah points out that the expansion programme is allowing Ashanti to mine
ore of a lower grade (rock with less gold per tonne in it). 'We are
concentrating on volume and on keeping the cost per tonne down.'
Consequently, even though Ashanti is mining lower-grade ore, its cash costs,
which were above Dollars 200 an ounce before the expansion started, should
average Dollars 175 for the next few years, placing the company among the
world's lowest-cost gold miners.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Doubts surround Indian oil
expansion - Fears are growing about excess capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India is planning a USDollars 30bn expansion of its oil refining and
petrochemicals industries as part of its wide-ranging programme to modernise
its economy.
Undaunted by the recession in world oil and oil-product markets, the Indian
government and private companies are planning to invest Rs500bn (Dollars
16bn) in existing and new refineries, to add 63m tonnes of capacity to the
country's current total of 52m tonnes. They also plan to spend Rs240bn on
nine new petrochemical ventures and double output of petrochemicals products
to about 6.3m tonnes a year by the late 1990s.
The total proposed outlay is greater than for any other sector except power.
Most of the investment will be funded by Indian money.
Mr Anil Ambani of Reliance Industries, a petrochemicals and textiles group,
which is the first company in the private sector to obtain government
approval to build a grassroots refinery, says 'the government will not be
able to wave a magic wand and change the industry overnight, but at least
they have started moving in the right direction'.
The government believes the investments will help ease India's critical
shortage of home-grown energy as well as greatly increasing supplies of
oil-based industrial raw materials such as feedstocks for plastics and
artificial fibres.
But critics believe that if a substantial number of projects go ahead India
could be saddled with expensive excess capacity in industries that already
have plenty of capacity world-wide. They point out that oil-based industries
are protected by stiff import duties and benefit from high
government-controlled prices, without which the projects could be unviable.
'There's every likelihood there will be excess capacity,' admits one senior
government official.
The surge of private investment is highlighted by the government's recent
clearance of Reliance's 9m-tonne, Dollars 3bn refinery project at Jamnagar
in Gujarat, which will be the first for 11 years. The government has also
cleared five other refinery projects - three in the public sector and two
private. The nine new petrochemicals projects include Reliance's Rs40bn
(Dollars 1.27bn) natural gas liquid/naphtha project at Hazira, Gujarat, and
the state-run Gas Authority of India's Rs35bn project in Auriya, Uttar
Pradesh.
These plans are a radical departure for India, which until the late 1980s
retained tight government control over the industry, partly to promote
traditional materials such as wood and clay. The government now regards
oil-based products as an essential part of a modern economy and wants to cut
imports of petroleum-based materials. Private companies are being called
upon to invest because of the shortage of public funds.
India's oil fields produce only about a third of its requirements and
petroleum topped the country's import list in 1991-92, accounting for
Dollars 5.4bn or 27.7 per cent of the total.
The country also has a vast potential demand for petroleum products. Per
capita energy consumption of 231kg of oil equivalent is less than half of
China's and a fifth of the world average. Its annual consumption of plastics
at 1kg a head is way below the world average of 16kg. Demand for petroleum
products is expected to grow at a rate of 6.9 per cent a year, from 62m
tonnes in 1993-94 to 80m tonnes by 1996-97.
The euphoria generated by liberalisation may be short-lived, however.
Industry watchers say recession, coupled with excess capacity in many
countries around the world, has led to a sharp decline in the prices of
petrochemicals products. Indian companies, which will have to rely on
exports to bolster their profits once domestic demand slackens, will find it
difficult to survive in an already overcrowded marketplace.
Moreover, new producers may be unable to rely on the high administered
prices that the industry currently enjoys. The government is steadily
dismantling price controls - last month it liberalised the prices of
lubricant oils. The profitability of the planned investments will depend
critically on how future price decontrol is managed.
Indian producers will also suffer competitive disadvantages on the world
market. Finance is scarce and capital costs are high; labour costs are low,
admittedly, but refineries and petrochemicals plants are capital- not
labour-intensive. In addition, infrastructure like pipelines and ports are
inadequate and will have to be expanded, at substantial cost. Electric power
is in short supply and tariffs are considerably higher than in other
countries. Duties on imported capital equipment add to costs.
The industry will face increasing foreign competition from low-cost
production centres such as the Middle East and Singapore as import tariffs
decrease. The sector will be crippled unless planned duty reductions are
carefully co-ordinated with changes in domestic prices for products and
inputs like power.
Mr Ambani warns that the industry could 'perish overnight' if the government
does not take adequate steps to co-ordinate reforms. 'The government will
have to reconsider feedstock and energy prices, which are very high, and
make it difficult for Indian industry to compete internationally,' he says.
Mr KK Mathur, a senior official at the ministry of chemicals and
fertilisers, says: 'We have to allow for a certain adjustment process and
introduce the reform process in phases. The total impact of the reform
measures can only be assessed over a period of time. It is imperative that
we do not force the pace'.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium prices resume uptrend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodity Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumours yesterday of a Russian smelter closure and buying by New York
investment funds sent the London Metal Exchange aluminium price bouncing up
to its highest level for two months.
Fund buying in the morning was probably stimulated by the buoyancy of other
metals prices this week, analysts said. But it was met by aggressive selling
by producers.
Then came widespread rumours that the Krasnoyarsk smelter in Russia, an
800,000-tonnes-a-year monster and the biggest in the world, was to close and
be refurbished. Kaiser Aluminium of the US is known to be working on a
Dollars 50m project to upgrade about 90,000 tonnes of capacity at the
smelter. There was no confirmation of the total closure rumour so the market
then concentrated on suggestions that the smelter involved was the smaller
Novokuznetsk plant in Siberia. VAW of Germany has said it will help
modernise this 280,000-tonne-a-year plant in stages.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said the
market reaction - short-covering sent the three-month aluminium price to
Dollars 1,138 a tonne - was 'a bit overdone.' By the close the price had
eased to Dollars 1,127.50 a tonne, up Dollars 26.75.

With only one week to before the Christmas recess in the Australian selling
season wool auction reports continue to indicate firm prices. The tendency
if anything is slightly dearer, with the market indicator reaching 477cents,
9 cents higher than a week before. The Australian wool production forecast
was revised upwards from 690m. kg to 717m. kg last week but the figure is
still 12% lower than last season and much of the wool has already been sold.
Some traders expect a degree of shortage in the second half starting in
January.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo in Malian project
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo American Corporation is to develop a Dollars 200m open pit gold mine
in Mali in partnership with the Mali government and Iamgold, the Canadian
concession holder.
Anglo, South Africa's largest mining house, announced yesterday that a
feasibility study of the 'world-class' deposit at Sadiola in south-western
Mali had been completed and said it hoped to start development early in
1994. A business vehicle will be formed by Anglo, Iamgold and the Malian
government - in the ratio 40:40:20 - to undertake the development.
Mr Neville Keys, projects director at Anglo's New Mining Business division,
said the mine was expected to be a cheap producer. The pit is shallow, the
grade is good, 2 grammes a tonne, and there are no metallurgical
complications - the gold will be recovered by conventional carbon-in-pulp
technology. The mine has more than 50m tonnes of treatable ore and, at an
annual mining rate of about 4m tonnes, should have a life-span of about 13
years. Peak production will be about 11-12 tonnes of gold a year, with total
production of 116 tonnes anticipated over the life of the mine.
Mr Keys said that although the project was not technologically complex,
sparse infrastructure made it logistically challenging. Accordingly the
group is cautious about how soon the project will be operational, though it
is contractually bound to be commissioned by the beginning of 1997.
Agreement was reached just over a year after Anglo signed the initial option
agreement with Iamgold. Mr Keys said Anglo would be looking to finance its
stake in the project mostly through offshore loans. He said it was a good
project and maximum project finance was being sought.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts continue to benefit from
post-auction euphoria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds continued to rise yesterday, benefiting from
post-auction euphoria, the favourable inflation background and hopes of
another base rate cut.
In spite of all the new supply, the gilt market managed to rise a further
3/4 of a point at the long end yesterday.
The Bank of England - which succeeded in selling Pounds 3bn of 6 3/4 per
cent stock due 2004 at Wednesday's auction - sold at least another Pounds
800m of assorted tap stocks yesterday as investor appetite for gilts
remained strong.
The Bank sold out two of the four tranches announced on Wednesday afternoon:
a Pounds 400m tranche of 6 per cent stock due 1999 and a Pounds 400m tranche
of 8 per cent stock due 2013, both of which were exhausted early in the day.
Dealers said the low inflation background was generating a lot of interest
in longer-dated gilt issues, especially since the November RPI figure due
out next week was expected to be good.
In addition, some investors appeared keen to put any surplus cash into the
market for the year-end.
'No-one wants to be seen sitting on cash, given the shape of the yield
curve,' said one dealer.
European government bonds showed strong gains on hopes of lower interest
rates and led mainly by a technical rally in the German market.
The German long bond futures contract, which opened at 100.46, reached an
all-time high of 100.87 before slipping back to 100.77 by late afternoon.
Dealers said once the contract broke through its previous high of 100.66, it
spurred a flurry of buying which drove the market higher. The long end of
the market outperformed the short end, leading to a flattening of the yield
curve.
Also providing a welcome lift for bunds was the downward revision yesterday
in western Germany's November inflation rate to 3.6 per cent year-on-year
from a preliminary 3.7 per cent.
French government bonds continued their rally, taking their cue from the
German market and helped by the strength of the franc which stayed
comfortably within its former European exchange rate mechanism bands.
'People are expecting to see a German rate cut and that would pave the way
for the Bank of France to ease,' said one dealer.
The March futures contract on the Matif ended up 0.26 at 129.30, while in
the cash market, investors were mainly interested in longer-dated issues.
The November consumer price data is due to be released today and is expected
to show a rise of 0.1 per cent from October, giving a year-on-year rise of
2.2 per cent.
The high-yielding European bond markets of Spain and Italy spurted, but the
sharp rise was more a sign of them catching up with the other European
markets after the recent public holidays, rather than a reaction to domestic
news.
The Italian government bond future rose to a high of 117.00 up from
Wednesday's close of 116.61.
In recent days, investors have been shifting out of three-year bonds and
switching further up the yield curve to the five-10 year area.
The US Treasury market bounced back yesterday from a setback that
immediately followed news that an important measure of producer prices had
risen at a slightly higher-than-expected rate.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/32 ahead at
101 9/32 , with the yield easing to 6.15 per cent. On the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 5/32 , to yield 4.149 per cent.
With traders widely anticipating a very positive reading, the release of
November price data was somewhat of a letdown. The Labor Department said
that core prices, excluding the more volatile food and energy components,
had increased 0.4 per cent, while the overall index was unchanged. Forecasts
had centred on a 0.2 per cent rise in the core rate.

FT  10 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Argentina increases global bond
offering to Dollars 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong demand from US investors, confident that the Republic of Argentina
would achieve an investment-grade rating before too long, enabled the
sovereign borrower to increase the size of its first offering of global
bonds to Dollars 1bn from Dollars 750m.
Demand was such that the 10-year bonds were priced to yield 280 basis points
over US Treasuries, at the low end of the indicated range of 280 to 285
basis points. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread tightened to
276 basis points.
Mr James Quigley, managing director in charge of global debt syndicate at
Merrill Lynch, one of the three joint leads, said that Argentina had secured
a yield spread which reflected a strong double-B rating rather than a
single-B rating.
'The market expects further upgrades in Argentina's rating in 1994,' he
said. The sovereign borrower is rated B1 by Moody's and double-B minus by
Standard &amp; Poor's.
A total of Dollars 1.25bn was allocated to investors, of which Dollars 200m
was placed in Argentina, leaving some underwriters with short positions. Of
the remainder, 60 per cent was placed in North America and 40 per cent in
Europe and Asia.
Mr Quigley said at least half of the bonds which were sold in the US were
bought by traditional, investment-grade portfolio managers, as opposed to
junk-bond or emerging-market investors.
Mr Daniel Marx, Argentina's finance under-secretary, said the proceeds of
the issue would be used to re-finance maturing debt.
The larger-than-expected issue would enable Argentina to build up its
currency reserves and be less active than planned in the debt market early
next year.
Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Hotels, which owns the Peninsular Hotel in Hong Kong,
tapped the Eurodollar sector with a Dollars 150m seven-year offering of
convertible bonds.
Lead manager BZW said the indicated conversion premium of 16 per cent to 19
per cent, which was more generous than other recent convertible offerings
from Hong Kong issuers, reflected the issuer's desire for good placement.
Elsewhere, the sterling bond market was swamped with new issues as issuers
took advantage of the strength in the UK government bond market to raise
money before the end of the year.
Scottish Amicable became the first UK mutual life insurance company to raise
debt capital in the international bond market with its Pounds 100m issue of
undated subordinated bonds.
More mutual life insurance companies could well follow suit, now that the
Department of Trade and Industry has indicated that insurance companies may
raise external capital prior to the implementation in the UK of the European
Community's third life directive.
Mr Roy Nicolson, Scottish Amicable's managing director, said the proceeds of
the offering would fund potential ventures in the UK and Europe. The bonds,
via Kleinwort Benson, were priced to yield 190 basis points over the 8 3/4
per cent gilt due 2017.

FT  10 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: French group issues first
warrants on SBF 120 stock index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Societe Generale Equities &amp; Derivatives has issued the first warrants on
France's new SBF 120 stock index, launched on Wednesday.
The SBF 120 includes medium-sized as well as large companies, representing
more than 80 per cent of the capitalisation of the Paris stock exchange,
compared with 56 per cent for the CAC-40 index.
'The SBF 120 is more sensitive to an economic upturn than the CAC-40, with a
higher representation of sectors which should benefit earlier from the
recovery,' according to Mr Frederic Redel, French strategist at SGED.
Sectors with greater representation in the SBF 120 include construction,
durable goods and retail.
The issue consists of 1m call and 1m put warrants, exercisable from December
30 1993 to December 30 1994. There are four tranches of call warrants, with
strike prices of 1,400, 1,500, 1,600, 1,700 and four tranches of put
warrants with strike prices of 1,300, 1,400, 1,500 and 1,600.
The index, compiled by the Societe Francaise des Bourses, is computed only
at the market's opening and closing, but will become continuous in March.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd has launched two issues of call warrants on the
three-year Italian swap rate denominated in Swiss francs.
The warrants are aimed at Swiss investors who wish to position themselves
for declines in Italian interest rates.
The issue consists of 20,000 six-month call warrants on the three-year swap
rate with a strike price of 7.96 per cent and 30,000 one-year call warrants
with a strike price of 8.23 per cent.
Both issues are European-style warrants.

FT  10 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Sweden plans to expand
foreign currency loans

<TEXT>
Sweden said yesterday it expected to borrow an additional SKr20bn-SKr30bn in
foreign currency next year to meet its financing requirements.
This means its foreign currency borrowing requirement during 1994 will
amount to SKr85bn-SKr95bn, including refinancings of maturing debt.
The country is one of the biggest borrowers in the international capital
markets as its budget deficit has climbed to 15 per cent of gross domestic
product, one of the highest levels in western Europe.
The government said net currency borrowing of SKr20bn-SKr30bn next year
meant the foreign currency element in the funding of state debt would fall
slightly.
According to the national debt office, Sweden's total debt in foreign
currency at November 30 1993 amounted to SKr374bn, equal to 34 per cent of
central government debt.

FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Western cash fuels Chinese
growth 0 New fund targets China's auto parts industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Clissold and his colleagues at Pacific Alliance Group, a Hong Kong
merchant bank, have spent months travelling around China with one purpose:
to examine motor components factories needing money and technology for
expansion.
Within the next few months, his trips to nearly 100 factories, many in
remote areas, should start to bear fruit. Pacific Alliance is a sponsor of a
fund, launched recently, which will invest solely and directly in production
of Chinese auto parts.
China Automotive Components Group, also sponsored by Trust Company of the
West, a US asset management concern, and Dean Witter Capital Corporation,
the New York brokerage, is a limited partnership which is being privately
placed mainly in the US. The aim is to raise Dollars 150m in minimum amounts
of Dollars 1m. The partnership is domiciled in the Cayman Islands.
If successful, the investment vehicle will be unusual among the 40 or so
funds which profess to invest in China. Since opportunities for direct
participation in China by portfolio investors are limited, most funds direct
a significant proportion of investors' money into the Hong Kong stock
market.
Some funds do target unlisted Chinese companies with the aim that the
companies obtain stockmarket listings as they (and the Chinese markets)
develop.
Investors in China Automotive Components Group will, however, be tied
directly to unquoted companies in one sector of one industry. Moreover, they
will be tied specifically to three Chinese entities in an elaborate form of
joint venture.
The aim is not simply to use the knowledge of the sponsors to pick
investments, but to help build a group within China with a critical mass
sufficient to have a strong impact on the market. The sponsors have already
identified 25 components factories, making such items as pistons, clutches
and spark plugs, at which they would form joint ventures and inject capital
and technology.
The Chinese partners are China National Automotive Industry Corporation
(CNAIC), the government body which co-ordinates the Chinese motor industry;
China North Industries Corporation, generally known as Norinco, the leading
arms producer which has turned increasingly to civilian products and is
China's largest integrated automotive manufacturer, with 70 components
factories; and the municipal government of Changchun, a north-eastern city
which is China's equivalent of Detroit.
The rationale for investing in the motor industry is clear, with China's
economic boom raising incomes and creating enormous demand. As Mr Clissold,
managing director of Pacific Alliance, says: '700m Chinese have bicycles and
would prefer to have motorcycles.' Norinco factories already have 40 per
cent of the motorcycle market and are looking to expand their output both of
parts and the finished product.
China has carefully controlled the expansion of the motor vehicle industry,
and car production remains low: only 164,300 passenger cars were built last
year. However, according to Pacific Alliance Group, CNAIC expects production
to grow at about 30 per cent a year to reach 1.53m in 2000.
The main assemblers of cars and light trucks, which are joint ventures with
foreign manufacturers or have other types of foreign involvement, are under
pressure to increase local content. However, foreign investment in the
Chinese component industry has been relatively slight.
'What we're looking for are factories which want to increase their
production and need the money to expand,' says Mr Clissold. In some
ventures, there is also a need to inject new technology. Where a projected
investment is large enough to justify it, the bank's team is followed to a
factory by a team from A. T. Kearney, the US consultants, who develop an
operating plan. A separate team with experience of the US car industry also
visits factories.
The aim is that the ventures in which the partnership invest should be ready
to be listed publicly within three to five years.

FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Banks losing patience with Esco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, the Japanese commercial bank, is close to cutting
the loan lifeline to Esco Leasing, a troubled finance company which has
borrowed a total of Y220bn (Dollars 2.02bn) from 33 Japanese institutions.
For the past two years, Hokkaido Takushoku has been attempting to
restructure Esco, but the company has been unable to recover its own Y200bn
loan to another finance company, Easy Capital and Consultants, which pumped
much of the money into the property market.
Esco is also based on the northern island of Hokkaido, and expanded
aggressively during the so-called bubble years of the late 1980s when stock
and property prices soared.
The ensuing collapse in asset values left many financial companies exposed
and forced their banks to bail them out.
A restructuring plan for Esco was agreed by the 33 banks in March last year,
when they accepted a cut in their interest repayments for two years.
However, the banks are close to concluding that Esco is a hopeless case and
that their exposure should be written off.
Hokkaido Takushoku, often known as Takugin, has a ratio of non-performing
loans to total loans of 5.39 per cent, the highest among Japan's 11 leading
commercial banks. However, these official totals are generally regarded as a
conservative estimate of the banks' exposure.
Japanese banks are becoming more aggressive in writing off bad loans, and
the Esco case would be a warning to other troubled financial companies that
their banks are not prepared to extend unlimited support for a
restructuring. Banks are likely to follow the lead of the main bank, which
in this case is Takugin.
The 33 banks say they have collateral worth about 60 per cent of their
Y220bn exposure.
However, as many banks have discovered, the value of property collateral can
be far less than the book value of three or four years ago.

sales

<TEXT>
Israel is reviewing how best to continue with the sale of the country's
leading banks after the privatisation drive suffered a setback recently on
the Tel Aviv stock exchange.
One option being considered by the finance ministry is the sale of a
controlling stake of 20 per cent in Bank Leumi by tender, before any more
shares are sold in Tel Aviv or New York. The offering values the bank at
around Shk5bn (Dollars 1.7bn).
A public offering of 10 per cent of shares in Bank Leumi was cancelled last
month after an issue of 10 per cent of Bank Hapoalim, Israel's biggest bank,
flopped. In September an issue of 10 per cent of Bank Leumi was heavily
over-subscribed.
Mr Gil Leidner, managing director of MI Holdings, the government
organisation overseeing the sale of bank shares, said yesterday that selling
a controlling interest in Bank Leumi by tender was one of many options, and
a final decision would be taken in two to three weeks. 'At the moment
everything is speculation,' he said.
Bankers, however, said the government was being forced to consider other
options for the sale of Bank Leumi. They said an early sale by tender was a
possibility, as a share issue in New York would be complicated and could be
harmed by negative political developments.
Meanwhile, the central bank is reviewing the financial records of four
groups interested in a controlling share of United Mizrahi Bank (UMB), the
country's fifth largest banking group, before issuing the contenders a
licence to qualify for the tender.
The government plans to sell a block of between 25.1 per cent and 51 per
cent of the issued share capital of UMB, which last year posted net profit
of Shk115m. The central bank is expected to complete its review within six
weeks, and the bidding for UMB would start in April or May next year.

New Zealand's court of appeal yesterday ordered Robt Jones Pacific, a
subsidiary of Tasman Properties, to pay NZDollars 73m (USDollars 40.5m)
damages to McConnell Dowell for withdrawing from a contract in 1990 to buy
New Zealand's tallest building.
The decision reverses a high court ruling that Robt Jones Pacific did not

The damages are believed to be the highest in New Zealand history. McConnell
Dowell said it also intended to seek up to NZDollars 23m in costs. If
awarded, the costs would exceed Tasman's shareholders' funds of NZDollars
83m.
Robt Jones Pacific signed a complex agreement in 1988 with McConnell Dowell
under which it agreed to purchase the 41-storey building in Auckland.
However, when the building was near completion Robt Jones Pacific said it
would not buy it, as conditions specified in the contracts had not been met.
McConnell Dowell said it was delighted with the latest ruling, saying it
totally vindicated its view that Tasman Properties had unlawfully breached
the contract.

FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Canadian banks go their
different ways - A report on the disparate results produced under the same
conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's hard to believe a group of companies in the same country doing much the
same kind of business can produce such disparate financial results as
Canada's big banks have in their latest fiscal year.
The six banks' return on equity for the year to October 31 ranged from a low
of 2.4 per cent at Royal Bank of Canada to a middling 9.9 per cent at
Montreal-based National Bank to Bank of Nova Scotia's impressive 14.4 per
cent.
While Bank of Montreal's loan-loss provisions grew by 23 per cent to
CDollars 675m (USDollars 510m), Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce reported
a drop of almost 50 per cent to CDollars 920m.
'I can't easily recall - except for the time of LDC provisioning - when
there was less comparability between banks,' says Mr Robin Korthals,
Toronto-Dominion's president.
If the stock market is any guide, the one common thread in the banks'
performance is that business prospects are improving after three years of
spiralling loan losses and slack credit demand. Bank of Nova Scotia's share
price has risen by 27 per cent on the Toronto stock exchange this year.
Despite its lacklustre performance, Royal Bank's shares have jumped from
CDollars 24.62 to CDollars 28.
Ms Donna Toth, analyst at Nesbitt Thomson in Toronto, says her firm has the
bank sector at the top of its list of recommendations. The optimism is based
on early signs that the banks' non-performing loan portfolios are starting
to shrink as economic recovery takes hold. With the banks' prime lending
rate at 5.5 per cent, its lowest level in 30 years, investors are banking on
a revival in credit demand. Ms Toth adds that dividend yields are
attractive.
Mr Korthals takes a more cautious view, predicting that credit demand will
be 'anaemic' for at least the next six months and stiff competition will
continue to compress margins.
He says: 'Borrowing is predicated on anticipation of price movement more
than economic activity.' Although the North American recovery is gathering
steam, inflation remains low.
The wide disparity in 1993 earnings is partly explained by various charges
and recoveries, whose size and timing is largely a matter of discretion.
Several banks cushioned the impact on their income statements of loan losses
in the hard-hit North American real estate and natural resource sectors by
reversing provisions made during the 1980s on loans to then-troubled Third
World borrowers, mostly in Latin America.
Toronto-Dominion and Royal were hit by charges to cover the cost of
integrating the operations of recently-acquired trust companies. But their
accounting treatment varies.
Toronto-Dominion set aside CDollars 140m as a special item for its purchase
of Central Guaranty Trust, which involved closing 90 branches of the
now-defunct trust company. Royal's takeover of Royal Trust will mean closing
only 43 branches.
But it charged CDollars 300m against fourth-quarter earnings, in the form of
a non-interest expense.
The writedown will probably enable the bank to report a huge improvement in
next year's earnings, which Ms Toth estimates at CDollars 3.08 per share, up
from 46 cents in 1993.
The banking industry is buzzing with rumours that a good performance in 1994
will clear the way for Mr Allan Taylor to step down as Royal's chief
executive.
The banks' divergent performances may continue for several years as each
responds in its own way to regulatory reforms and fast-changing markets.
'They all looked like one big homogenous glob in the 1980s,' says Ms Kathy
Humber, analyst at Wood Gundy. 'They are now starting to differentiate
themselves.'
Royal, Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto-Dominion have all snapped up trust
companies this year to broaden their exposure to the 'wealth management'
services, which are expected to be in increasing demand from an ageing
population.
Bank of Montreal has eschewed this strategy in favour of building on the
trust business of its Chicago-based subsidiary, Harris Bankcorp. It contends
that Canadian banks do not need more branches, and that much of the trust
companies' business is no different from the banks.
Bank of Montreal is also the odd man out in the banks' recent rush into
insurance. Its attitude - at least for the time being - is that it can add
little value to an insurance company, and that bank branches cannot easily
handle the sale of insurance policies.
Mr Anthony Comper, Bank of Montreal's president, says that his bank's main
growth areas will include Harris' retail network, North American investment
banking and US corporate business. In five years' time, 'we will be
significantly bigger in the US than now', he says.
The other banks are also keen to make a splash in the US and Latin America,
especially Mexico. The three which have recently bought trust companies,
however, may have their hands full in Canada for the time being.

FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Provision news hits Pechiney
share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Pechiney International, the French packaging company, fell sharply
yesterday following Wednesday's announcement that it would take a provision
of up to Dollars 75m to cover the purchase of excessive amounts of metals at
unfavourable prices. The shares closed down FFr10.4 at FFr198.
The company, a subsidiary of Pechiney, the state-owned aluminium producer
slated for privatisation, said it would still record significant profits
this year. It planned to maintain its 1993 dividend at the FFr5 per share
paid last year.
The provision was taken largely to cover long-term purchases of aluminium,
mainly by American National Can (ANC), the company's US subsidiary. Pechiney
said ANC had agreed forward purchases of the metal for 1993, 1994 and 1995
on the basis of prices of about Dollars 1,400 a tonne. Prices have fallen to
below Dollars 1,200 since the contracts were agreed in the first half of the
year.
Pechiney said the price conditions were 'likely to result in an exceptional
expense'. It said the expense could reach a net charge of Dollars 75m,
although this could be reduced through financial management measures to be
taken soon.
Ironically, Pechiney's group results have suffered from the fall in the
aluminium prices, a result of cheap imports from eastern Europe and the
republics of the former Soviet Union.
However, Pechiney's aluminium plants are principally in Europe, and ANC buys
the metals it uses for packaging on the US market.

FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Newmont Mining combines assets
with subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Newmont Mining, the Denver-based gold company, and its partially-owned
subsidiary, Newmont Gold are combining assets and operations in a
complicated stock transfer that will make the two publicly-traded companies
virtually identical.
Together, they constitute the world's sixth-largest gold producer.
The deal stops short of a full merger, which the company said could not be
effected without creating a large accounting charge.
'It nevertheless is tax-free and satisfies the operating and financial
purposes of a full merger,' said Mr Ronald Cambre, chief executive officer
of both companies.
Shares of the two companies will continue to trade separately on the New
York Stock Exchange, but they should trade at nearly identical prices since
they would have the same outlook, operating results and dividends.
Analysts welcomed the transaction, which still must be approved by New-mont
Gold's public shareholders.
'This should clear up a lot of investor confusion about what the differences
are between the two companies,' said Phillip Martin, a gold company analyst
at Gordon Capital.
Newmont Mining, once highly diversified, has shed Peabody Coal and other
mining operations since 1986, and is now a worldwide gold mining and
exploration company that owns 90 per cent of Newmont Gold.
Newmont Gold has 19.5m ounces of gold reserves, mostly in Nevada's rich
Carlin Trend. Their combination will give shareholders in both companies
ownership of the same properties worldwide.
Their combined gold reserves will be approximately 26m ounces, and the
company projects worldwide gold production will approach 2m ounces of gold
annually by 1996.
The plan calls for Newmont Mining to convey all its operating assets and
liabilities to Newmont Gold, as well as 8.6m shares of Newmont Gold stock.
The stock transfer is intended to balance the existing price difference
between the two companies.
Newmont Mining shares will then be split 1.25 shares for each existing
share, bringing its outstanding common stock to 85.8m shares, equal to the
number of common stock outstanding in Newmont Gold once the transaction is
complete.
After the combination, Newmont Mining's assets will be shareholder interests
in Newmont Gold.

<TEXT>
Hughes Aircraft, the General Motors aerospace subsidiary which is the
world's largest owner and operator of satellites, is to build a Dollars 660m
satellite system to provide specialised telecommunications services in the
US market.
The company said it has applied to the Federal Communications Commission for
permission to launch and operate two satellites in 1998.
The satellites will service a system called Spaceway, which will provide
residential and business subscribers with specialised services such as
two-way video telephones and interactive computer transmissions.
Although Spaceway is intended to supplement terrestrial telecommunication,
Hughes said it could eventually compete directly with ground-based telephone
line and cable systems.
Mr Steven Dorfman, senior vice-president of Hughes' space and
telecommunications division, said Spaceway would send its signal to
subscribers via satellite dishes that will be smaller and cheaper than
existing dishes. Hardware that now costs between Dollars 5,000 and Dollars
10,000, could cost as little as Dollars 1,000 with Spaceway.

The proposed joint venture between Tele-Communications, the US cable
operator, and Televisa, the Mexican media group, has fallen through.
Under the joint venture TCI would have bought 49 per cent of Televisa's
cable subsidiary, worth an estimated Dollars 200m-Dollars 400m. The two
companies planned to combine to provide cable television and other services
throughout Latin America.
The collapse comes ahead of next week's Dollars 1bn secondary equity
offering by Televisa, which will take the media group into the New York
Stock Exchange. In the offering, Televisa will sell 10 per cent of its
equity.
TCI said the joint venture needed to be re-evaluated in view of the
company's proposed merger with Bell Atlantic.

<TEXT>
Litton Industries' oil services subsidiary, Western Atlas, is to pay Dollars
558m to buy back a block of its own shares as part of a series of measures
to shape it as a free-standing company.
Western Atlas will pay Dollars 358m in cash and Dollars 200m in seven-year
notes to buy the 29.5 per cent of its shares held by Dresser, another oil
services company.
Western Atlas, which derives 60 per cent of its annual Dollars 2bn sales
from oil services and the rest from industrial automation, is expected to be
spun off before the end of the year. Litton shareholders will receive one
share in the new company for each Litton share they own.
Litton added that it would take an after-tax charge of Dollars 172m in the
current quarter to reflect the accelerated depreciation of some of Western
Atlas' assets. The subsidiary specialises in the use of information
technology in exploration and drilling operations and demand for the newest
technology had been stronger than expected, forcing the accelerated
write-downs of older equipment.
Mr Alton Brann, president and chief executive, said the purchase would allow
both Litton and Dresser to concentrate on their core businesses.

One large Televisa shareholder said Bell Atlantic's stake in Iusacell

Mr Emilio Azcarraga, chairman of Televisa, said: 'We concluded that it was

of both parties' long-term objectives.'
He said Televisa will continue to seek strategic alliances to expand

FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Tofas public offer withdrawn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Turkish government has cancelled plans for a Dollars 550m public offer
on the New York Stock Exchange of its 21 per cent shareholding in Tofas,
Turkey's largest carmaker.
It has done so after objections from Fiat which owns 42 per cent of Tofas.
The Italian motor group is understood to have opposed the full SEC listing
on legal and disclosure grounds.
Turkish officials confirmed that Shearson Lehman Bros and J. Henry Schroder
Wagg, the banks mandated to sell the government's shares, were preparing a
more restricted private placement with US institutional investors.
The Public Participation Administration, the government agency handling
state asset sales, is due to meet the company in Istanbul today. It hopes to
conclude the Tofas share sale by the end of March.
Koc Holding, Turkey's largest industrial conglomerate, holds 34 per cent of
Tofas.
Tofas would have been the first full registration of Turkish stock with the
SEC. Bankers say Fiat was concerned that the offering could expose the
company to potentially costly legal disputes with individual shareholders.
Brokers point out that by restricting the sale to big institutions, Fiat
will be in a better position if at some future date it decides to seek
majority control of Tofas.
The decision is a setback for the PPA, at a time when it is trying to revive
the government privatisation effort.
A World Bank team is due back in Ankara on Monday to conclude negotiations
on a Dollars 30m loan to support privatisation. The government is poised to
award a mandate to implement the sale of Tupras, the state refineries
concern and Petrol Ofisi, the petrol retail arm.
The government is planning to sell its 18 per cent stake in Tofas Otomobil
Ticaret, the retailer.

FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Nova takes control of methanol
producer
</HEADLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nova, the Alberta natural gas pipeline and petrochemicals group, is
acquiring 24 per cent of Methanex, the Vancouver-based methanol producer, in
a series of cash and stock deals.
Nova estimated the total value of the transactions, including the eventual
public offer of part of Fletcher Challenge's Methanex holding, as CDollars
1.14bn (USDollars 861m). It will finish with effective control of Methanex,
whose total annual capacity is 4.2m tonnes. Methanex will be the world's
largest producer, with 14 per cent of total capacity.
Nova is acquiring its stake from Germany's Metallgesellschaft and from New
Zealand's Fletcher Challenge resource and construction group.
In the deal, Nova will put its own methanol assets into Methanex for
Methanex stock, and subscribe for new Methanex shares. It will buy 6.4m
Methanex shares from Metalgesellschaft and 15.5m shares from Fletcher
Challenge.
The balance of Fletcher's holding will be sold later via a public offer.
Nova, which has been restructured into a pipeline and petrochemicals group,
last month sold its gas production unit in western Canada to Seagull Energy
of the US for CDollars 275m.
'The Methanex deal gives Nova the opportunity to participate in one of the
world's leading suppliers of methanol,' said Mr Terry Poole, Nova's senior
vice-president.
Nova already has a strong methanol marketing presence in North America and
Asia. Methanol, derived from natural gas, is used widely as a clean-burning
fuel and in making additives for petrol.

FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft to reduce
foreign holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER, NIKKI TAIT and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, SYDNEY, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the loss-making Frankfurt-based mining, metals and
industrial conglomerate is to reduce two of its biggest foreign
shareholdings. The sales follow agreement between the group and its bankers
this week over new lines of credit to avert a liquidity crisis.
Metallgesellschaft has sold the bulk of its indirectly-owned 14 per cent
stake in the Brisbane-based MIM Holdings for ADollars 250m (USDollars
168.9m). It also intends to sell 11.6m directly-owned shares in Metall
Mining Corporation, a Canadian mining group, for CDollars 124.7m (USDollars
94.5m), reducing its holding to 50.1 per cent.
Separately, Metallgesellschaft and Deutsche Bank denied a report that Mr
Heinz Schimmelbusch, Metallgesellschaft's chief executive, had come under
the surveillance of a specially-created committee of senior German managers.
This was alleged to be have been formed last month at the initiative of Mr
Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director and chairman of the
Metallgesellschaft supervisory board, but Deutsche said the report was
groundless.
The Frankfurt group said the sales of the shareholdings were unconnected
with its current liquidity situation, and had been planned before it went
into negotiations last Friday with Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank.
News of the talks earlier this week prompted a 12 per cent fall in
Metallgesellschaft's share price on Monday. However, the stock has recovered
much of the original losses following the group's insistence - backed by its
bankers - that its liquidity problems are temporary. It blames them on
technical aspects of futures contracts taken out to hedge its oil delivery
business in the US.
Although proceeds of the sale of the 11.6m shares in Metall Mining Corp will
flow directly to the German parent company, the money raised in Australia on
Wednesday via the sale of 100m shares in MIM Holdings will remain with
Metall Mining, through which Metallgesellschaft owns the stake. However, the
immediate proceeds are to be invested in the development of the Canadian
company's copper activities, Mr Klaus Zeitler, the Canadian company's chief
executive said yesterday.
Analysts said the sale of the Australian company's shares could give rise to
a book profit in Metallgesellschaft's current-year accounts, and that the
German company could benefit from an increased dividend from its Canadian
subsidiary.
The 100m shares in the Australian company were sold to institutions by two
firms of stockbrokers at ADollars 2.35 each.
Bernard Simon in Toronto adds: Metallgesellschaft yesterday raised almost
CDollars 70m by selling 6.4m shares in Vancouver-based Methanex, which is
one of the world's biggest methanol producers, to Nova, the Canadian
petrochemicals and pipeline group. Metallgesellschaft was Methanex's
second-biggest shareholder with a stake of 13 per cent.

FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: NEC pledges more cash to bolster
ailing Groupe Bull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics company, said yesterday it would invest Y7bn
(Dollars 64.5m) in Groupe Bull as part of a recapitalisation plan for
France's loss-making state-owned computer manufacturer.
The investment, which will add to the FFr8.6bn pledged by the French
government and France Telecom, will maintain NEC's stake in Bull at 4.43 per
cent. The two companies said they would expand co-operation in activities
including computers, electronic components and communications.
The Japanese company said it was essential to maintain its relationship with
Bull if it was to continue developing its business in Europe. 'Bull is an
important strategic partner,' said one NEC official.
The French company is an important customer for NEC's memory chips, of which
it buys about Y1bn worth annually. It it also buys liquid crystal displays
and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) from the Japanese
company.
The two companies have co-operated on the development of mainframe
computers, particularly for the business market.
According to the agreement outlined yesterday, Bull and NEC will extend
their collaboration in both hardware and software, as well as in mainframes
and personal computers. NEC will continue to supply Bull with liquid crystal
displays, ASICs and dynamic random access memory chips. Bull will help
market NEC's communications and computer products in Europe, particularly in
eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union.
For Bull, yesterday's announcement is the second significant development
since Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries took over as chairman in October. His
task is to restore the computer group to profitability and prepare it for
privatisation.
Last month, Mr Descarpentries announced a restructuring of the group's
organisation, including the establishment of a new senior executive board,
the creation of new operating divisions and a shift towards service
activities.
The injection of fresh capital, however, is critical to the company's
recovery. Accumulated losses over the past three years amount to almost
FFr15bn (Dollars 256.8m), and the group's debts are estimated at about
FFr10bn.

FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T breaks ties with De
Benedetti
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
One of the longest, but ultimately least fruitful, cross-border partnerships
in high technology has been wound down after the sale by AT&amp;T of its
remaining share in Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir holding company.
AT&amp;T has placed 54.75m Cir shares, representing 10.1 per cent of the
ordinary share capital, with a group of unidentified financial
intermediaries. The transaction, at L1,398 a share, followed a gradual
reduction in its stake earlier this year. By late July, AT&amp;T informed
Italy's stock market authorities it had sold about 7 per cent of its Cir
stock.
Yesterday's transaction was at a 5 per cent discount to the L1,477 closing
price of Cir's ordinary shares on the Milan bourse on Tuesday, before
Wednesday's national holiday, when the market was closed. As with the July
transaction, the deal coincided with a period of relative strength for Cir
stock, which has risen sharply from depressed levels in early 1993.
AT&amp;T had for some time indicated it considered the Cir stake as a purely
financial investment, with no industrial overtones. The biggest asset of
Cir, in which the De Benedetti family is the main shareholder, is a large
stake in Italy's loss-making Olivetti computers group.
The sale eliminates the last link between AT&amp;T and companies associated with
Mr De Benedetti after almost 10 years of high - and then unfulfilled -
expectations. AT&amp;T first invested in Olivetti in April 1984, when it bought
100m ordinary shares, representing about 21.8 per cent of the group, for
L430bn (Dollars 257.5m).
Under the deal, AT&amp;T acquired almost 500,000 Olivetti personal computers
during the mid-1980s, allowing the Italian company substantial economies of
scale. The US presence also allowed Olivetti researchers access to AT&amp;T's
famous Bell Laboratories, and reinforced the Italian group's financial
standing.
The advantages for AT&amp;T, which has taken a substantial loss on its
investment, were always less obvious. One observer suggested yesterday the
link gave the US company its first taste of international collaboration. It
may even have helped to create the understanding of the computers industry
that eventually led to AT&amp;T's acquisition of NCR.
With hopes for a high-tech partnership between a US company - then
exclusively in telecommunications - and Olivetti never reaching fruition,
AT&amp;T in October 1989 swapped its Olivetti stock for 17.1 per cent of Cir.
The investment has not been particularly successful in view of the recession
and trading problems at Cir, which has been forced into loss owing to the
difficulties at Olivetti. After indicating its desire to sell its shares,
AT&amp;T reached agreement with Mr De Benedetti on a broad timetable for
disposal until mid-1994.
The sale should help Cir's share price by removing an element of
uncertainty, in view of the publicity given to AT&amp;T plans to sell its stake.
Investors may still be concerned, however, that the stake is being held by
various brokers, pending a longer-term placing.

<TEXT>
Ascom, the troubled Swiss telecommunications equipment maker, yesterday
sacked its chief executive, Mr Leonardo Vannotti, and announced another
restructuring.
Ascom was formed in 1987 when three suppliers to the Swiss PTT merged. It
has struggled to develop a strategy to cope with liberalised markets.
Mr Vannotti became chief executive in 1991. He had previously held senior
positions with ABB-Asea Brown Boveri and Mr Stephan Schmidheiny's Unotec
group.
In April, Ascom shocked investors by announcing it would post a 1992 net
loss of SFr46m (Dollars 31.4m) and pass its dividend. Days earlier, it had
forecast a profit of around SFr25m.
Mr Vannotti took full responsibility, but rashly predicted a return to
profit this year. In August the group reported a loss of SFr79m in the first
half and admitted it would face a 'marked loss' in the full year.
Directors said Mr Fred Sutter, deputy chief executive, would succeed Mr
Vannotti, and they have formed a committee to direct the group during its
restructuring phase.

FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Volkswagen revises loss forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen, the German carmaker, expects to lose DM2.3bn (Dollars 1.4bn)
this year, some DM300m more than the company forecast two weeks ago.
However, it aims to break even in 1994, according to Mr Ferdinand Piech,
chairman.
The turning point at the German parent, Volkswagen AG, had already been
reached, he said yesterday, predicting 1993 net earnings of between DM60m
and DM80m - around 50 per cent lower than last time.
Mr Piech attributed the 'improvement' at the parent, which was reported as
losing DM768m after nine months, to the delayed arrival of dividend payments
from successful subsidiaries.
These included Autolatina in Brazil, which has benefited from a 37 per cent
rise, to 440,000 cars, in Latin American deliveries, and the Shanghai plant,
which contributed to a 46 per cent rise in Chinese sales of 132,000 units.
The VW AG result, he suggested, would allow the company to pay an unchanged
DM2 dividend.
Group turnover for 1993 would fall 10 per cent to DM77bn, well short of the
expected DM80bn on which Mr Piech based his summer predictions of a
break-even result.
Full-year sales at the parent were likely to be 19 per cent lower at DM43bn.
Group deliveries would drop 12 per cent to 3.1m vehicles. These had been hit
by a 21.6 per cent decline in western Europe, where VW said it retained
market leadership despite a one percentage point fall in market share, to
16.5 per cent.
Mr Piech based his predictions for the new year on assumptions of unchanged
volumes and enhanced profitability and productivity. He claimed group costs
had already been reduced by DM6bn this year.
Cost-saving measures include the shedding of 23,000 jobs worldwide and
reduced prices for bought-in components. Capital investment was also reduced
in the past year by 40 per cent to about DM5bn. Medium-term plans allow for
further cuts, including a standstill on building and extension work at the
company's new factory at Mosel in eastern Germany.
Further savings are expected from the closure of a Barcelona factory owned
by VW's Seat subsidiary, which will remove some 9,000 more workers from the
payroll, and the planned introduction of a so-called four-day week in six
German factories.
However, negotiations over the Spanish closure are currently deadlocked, and
Mr Piech has demanded a solution before the end of next week.
Although talks on shorter working hours in Germany are still continuing, it
is becoming apparent that annual savings will be less than the DM1.8bn
expected, and that the 28.8-hour working week is only a stop-gap measure.
Mr Piech said yesterday a return to 35-hour working was 'hardly likely'
after the expiry of the planned two-year agreement currently being
discussed.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Kleeneze makes Pounds 1m and pays 1p
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleeneze Holdings, the home shopping company, reported profits of Pounds
1.06m for the year to August 31, compared with losses of Pounds 456,000,
restated for FRS 3.
The company is returning to the dividend list with a recommended final
payment of 1p paid from earnings per share of 6.08p (3.18p losses).
Turnover was Pounds 56.6m (Pounds 46.4m), of which Pounds 2.92m (Pounds
6.14m) related to discontinued activities.
Continuing sales were split between Innovations Pounds 35.3m (Pounds 31.6m)
and the direct sales division Pounds 18.3m (Pounds 8.61m).
The company said that its 'shrink to grow' strategy was complete.
During the period it sold Molly Housewares, Kleeneze Hygiene and Dalton
Young, giving a total profit of Pounds 470,000, which was taken above the
line, and acquired Stockingfillas and 50 per cent of Hawkshead.
Operating profit was Pounds 724,000 (Pounds 155,000 loss) including losses
of Pounds 291,000 (Pounds 254,000) from discontinued activities.
Since the end of the year Kleeneze has announced the intention to sell 50
per cent of The Leading Edge and has bought Xtend from the George Davis
Corporation.
The company said the first quarter's sales in the direct selling division
continuing to grow strongly.
Innovations catalogues were enjoying their best level of response in three
years.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Titon moves ahead to Pounds 2m in difficult
market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Titon Holdings, the building products maker, reported pre-tax profits
slightly ahead at Pounds 2m for the year to September 30, against Pounds
1.94m.
The USM-quoted company said despite the continued fragile state of the
building industry, sales had risen from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 11.3m. The
window refurbishment and replacement market had been the strongest.
The pre-tax figure was struck after a Pounds 125,000 provision against a bad
debt and lower interest income of Pounds 170,000 (Pounds 182,000).
Earnings per share were 12.07p (11.69p) and the proposed final dividend of
2.9p leaves an increased total of 4.2p (3.7p).

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Enterprise Computer back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Computer Holdings, the Berkshire-based computer services group
which has repositioned itself in the market, has returned to profit after a
period of substantial losses.
The pre-tax profit of Pounds 90,000 for the six months to September 30
included Pounds 677,000 from the disposal of an investment in an associated
company. The previous first half suffered a Pounds 3.41m deficit and the
loss for that year came to Pounds 6.03m.
Turnover for the latest six months fell to Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 35.5m) earned
entirely from mainframe sales and service. Last year's figure also included
Pounds 6.63m from operations now discontinued.
Mr John Small, chairman, said the sales decline reflected 'the general fall
in demand for second-user mainframes,' However, the group's change of focus
towards providing corporation-wide network systems meant that mainframes
represented less than 30 per cent of sales.
Interest payments jumped to Pounds 286,000 (Pounds 51,000) but the company
said they were running at a much reduced level than in the second half of
last year.
Losses per share were shaved to 0.02p (4.3p).
Mr Small added that SRH, in which Enterprise is a minority shareholder, was
selling its communications division to TSB International of Canada.
Consequently a Pounds 3.5m loan owed to Enterprise would be redeemed early
in 1994.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Compass lifted by acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compass Group, the healthcare and catering group, yesterday announced a
sharp rise in both profits and turnover for the year to September 26 on the
back of recent acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 41.5m, compared with Pounds
31.8m.
Turnover was ahead 44 per cent at Pounds 497m, including a contribution of
Pounds 156.2m from acquisitions, mainly reflecting the purchase in July of
SAS Service Partner's airport catering business via a rights issue, and last
November's acquisitions of Travellers Fare, the station caterers, and
Letheby &amp; Christopher, the sports and events caterer.
Turnover from continuing operations fell from Pounds 345.1m to Pounds
340.8m. The group attributed the decline to continued 'demanning' in the UK
because of recession.
Operating profit from continuing operations rose from Pounds 36.9m to Pounds
39.4m. A contribution of Pounds 7.4m from acquisitions took total operating
profit to Pounds 46.8m.
Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive, said the full benefits of the
acquisitions had yet to be seen as purchasing and other affinities were
sorted out over the next year or so. 'All the acquisitions have performed
well. There are no skeletons or black holes and we have not lost a single
contract in all the business we have brought on board.'
Last December Compass reorganised its catering activities into seven
divisions which target core markets from schools to boardrooms. The New
Famous Foods division, which has agreements with Burger King and Pizza Hut,
is designed to offer clients branded catering outlets.
Earlier this month Compass paid Pounds 900,000 for the 11 catering contracts
managed by the Roux brothers. Mr Mackay described the deal as the 'final
piece of the jigsaw' in the group's new strategy.
'We have created a unique catering company with enormous potential in all
market sectors. We are capable of expanding the business and we have the
wherewithal to do it,' he said yesterday.
UK catering profits were up from Pounds 24.5m to Pounds 30.6m, overseas
catering profits from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 3.1m, and healthcare profits
from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 13.1m.
Interest payable edged ahead from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 5.3m. Adjusted
earnings per share rose from 33.1p to 35.9p; a final dividend of 8.56p is
proposed, giving a total for the year of 13p (12.3p).
COMMENT
These results were very much in line with expectations. Next year will
depend on how well the group digests its acquisitions, and on the rate the
contract catering market expands in the UK. The group has a toehold in
Europe through the airport catering business and the City will be watching
to see how well it tackles expanding its business outside the UK. Growth in
the healthcare sector is likely to be slow for the next couple of years.
Profits of Pounds 53m next year give a prospective multiple of 14.8, making
the stock an undemanding hold.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Scantronic restricted by high component
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High semiconductor chip prices held back the first-half profits advance at
Scantronic Holdings, the security components manufacturer and distributor,
despite a 10 per cent gain in core UK sales reflecting new product launches.
Pre-tax profits were virtually unchanged at Pounds 1.59m in the six months
to September 30, compared with Pounds 1.55m, on turnover ahead 12 per cent
to Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 18.5m).
Mr Chris Brookes, chief executive, said high component costs in the first
half, related to a fire at a Japanese resin plant in the summer, had
squeezed margins and adversely affected performance. However, he said chip
prices had since subsided and margins had now returned to previous levels.
Overall operating profits edged higher to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.71m) while
net interest charges increased to Pounds 175,000 (Pounds 167,000).
The UK operations reported reduced operating profits of Pounds 1.49m (Pounds
1.6m) on turnover which grew to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 11.3m).
Since the end of September the group has acquired the Alarmexpress wholesale
distribution business which is expected to broaden the UK customer base and
contribute to profits in the second half.
International operations, mainly in continental Europe, reported slightly
higher operating profits and turnover. The North American operations again
showed a small operating loss but turnover grew strongly to Pounds 4.93m
(Pounds 3.97m) reflecting an additional Pounds 600,000 spent on sales and
marketing, and they are expected to be profitable in the current half.
Earnings per share edged up to 1.88p (1.84p) and the interim dividend goes
up from 0.79p to 0.843p.
The group also restated its latest full year results to comply with FRS 3.
In particular a Pounds 1.5m charge previously reported as an extraordinary
item - mainly related to a damages claim against the former owner of
Arrowhead, a US acquisition - has been reclassified.
As a result the pre-tax profit for the year to March 31 has been restated to
Pounds 1.59m with losses per share of 0.3p.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Murray Enterprise net assets jump
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Murray Enterprise, the investment trust which now focuses on smaller listed
companies, achieved an improvement in net asset value per share from 124.63p
to 248.84p over the 12 months ended September 30.
The improvement was principally due to an investment in Nextel
Communications of the US, which rose in value over the year from Pounds 4.9m
to Pounds 8.1m.
Available revenue fell from Pounds 126,000 to Pounds 64,000. Earnings
emerged at 0.53p (0.94p) assuming full conversion of the loan stock.
A single dividend of not less than 1.5p (1.31p) would be payable if all the
loan stock was converted by December 31. Should no loan stock be converted
the dividend for the year would be 1.9p.
For the 1993-94 year the board is forecasting a dividend of not less than
4p. A proposed 1-for-1 scrip issue would reduce that payment to 2p.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Birkby shows sharp advance to Pounds
581,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Steady progress in its three key business areas enabled Birkby, which is
involved in the provision of managed workspace, vehicle hire and instalment
credit, to lift interim profits from Pounds 204,000 to Pounds 581,000
pre-tax.
The results for the six months to end-September included a three months'
contribution from Hill Hire, the full benefit of which will be apparent in
the second half.
They also took account of an exceptional provision of Pounds 525,000
relating to the disposal of New Range Systems. Turnover was Pounds 5.24m
(Pounds 2.2m).
The interim dividend is lifted to 1.2p (1p) from earnings of 6.6p (4.8p).
Directors intend to recommend a 'substantially increased' final dividend
should the current positive level of trading continue.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Low rainfall hits Scottish Hydro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Hydro-Electric yesterday increased its interim dividend by 10 per
cent as it reported pre-tax profits at the lower end of expectations.
The 12 per cent profits rise, from Pounds 40.6m to Pounds 45.6m, follows
unusually low rainfall which restricted its ability to generate hydro
electric power.
However, Mr Roger Young, chief executive, said he did not expect the rain
shortfall to affect its final dividend and the company expected to stick to
its target of 6 to 8 per cent real growth for the full year.
That implies an 11 per cent increase at most, against market expectations
for the recs of at least 14 per cent.
For the six months to September 30, Hydro increased operating profits by 4.4
per cent to Pounds 52.5m on turnover up 14 per cent to Pounds 343.8m.
Earnings per share were 11 per cent ahead at 8.81p (7.93p); the interim
dividend is 3.96p (3.6p).
Mr Young said low rainfall reduced pre-tax profit by about Pounds 1.6m from
the normal level. Rainfall has remained low in the second half of the year.
Unlike Scottish Power, Hydro chose not to include the benefit of improved
coal contracts in its half year results. The contracts are for five years,
backdated to April.
The contracts would have increased pre-tax profits by about Pounds 400,000
but Hydro wants to finalise the deal before reporting the improvement. If,
as seems likely, the deals are concluded by the end of the year, the full
year effect will be about Pounds 1.2m
Hydro has committed Pounds 69m to projects in England and Wales and by 1995,
when the Keadby power station is expected to be operational, over 15 per
cent of capacity will be in England.
Gearing fell from 20.6 to 14.9 per cent. If the effect of Keadby, which is
not on the balance sheet, was included that would be 31.7 per cent.
Mr Young said gearing would rise to 18 per cent by the year-end, excluding
Keadby, and 40 per cent including it.
COMMENT
It may sound like a lame excuse but Hydro has every right to blame its
unspectacular performance on the weather. In only three years in the last 25
has rainfall been so low. Effects on the pre-tax rise are severe because
last year's rainfall was unusually high. On fundamentals Hydro is doing well
enough, and the policy of using the balance sheet to provide future
unregulated earnings in England and Wales is sound. Hydro also faces less
regulatory threat than regional power companies south of the border.
Assuming a 12.5p full year dividend, the shares are on a prospective yield
of 3.6 per cent following yesterday's share price fall. The potential
problem for Hydro, as for Scottish Power, is that investors may be more
tempted by the higher yielding English generators if the regulator decides
against referring the English generators to the MMC.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: LIG warns on restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New management at London International Group appears to have taken the
opportunity of yesterday's interim results to clear the decks.
The group predicted a 'much stronger level of sales and operating profits in
the second half year' although warning there would be 'very substantial'
restructuring charges.
For the six months to end-September losses of Pounds 5.1m before tax (profit
Pounds 15.5m) included a Pounds 7.4m swing to losses in its photo-processing
business, which is now up for sale, and about Pounds 8m of 'one-offs'
according to Mr Nick Hodges, the new chief executive.
Group sales rose 1.2 per cent to Pounds 197.1m but operating profits
collapsed to Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 22.4m).
In health and personal products, operating profits fell from Pounds 16.1m to
Pounds 3.5m, while photo-processing incurred a deficit of Pounds 1.1m
(profit Pounds 6.3m). The latter normally makes most of its profits in the
summer months.
LIG revealed that the comparable figures had included Pounds 5m of exchange
gains and from the release of provisions not previously disclosed.
This year's number had been depressed by about Pounds 2m following 'the
adoption of more conservative accounting practices'.
Mr Hodges said there had also been a negative effect from a change of the
policy to push sales, through higher promotional activity, at the end of
each half year.
He said this would have a significant effect on the second half too, but
thereafter would not recur and would reduce working capital.
The UK made a loss of Pounds 1.5m (profit Pounds 8.6m) largely because of
the photo-processing division. In the rest of northern Europe there was a
Pounds 100,000 loss (profit Pounds 1.5m). In southern Europe, where LIG was
hit by recession in Italy and a cut back in the government's drugs bill
which reduced customer flow in pharmacies, profits fell from Pounds 6.9m to
Pounds 2.4m.
North American profits were Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 2.5m) with Africa,
Australasia and the Far East contributing Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.9m).
Losses per share emerged at 4.33p (earnings 6.37p) and the the interim
dividend is omitted - 3.2p was paid previously.

Shares in The British Bloodstock Agency rose 19p to 102p yesterday, after
its December sales provided evidence of the bloodstock market's strong

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Kleinwort plans trust for European
privatisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson is planning to launch the first investment trust to
specialise in European privatisation shares.
The trust, which is expected to be launched in January, will give the
private investor a chance to participate in the forthcoming slew of
continental privatisations.
European governments are expected to raise between Dollars 100bn and Dollars
150bn (Pounds 101bn) over the next five years via privatisation issues, with
France, Italy and Spain in the vanguard.
Issues are also expected from former Iron Curtain countries.
Kleinwort argues that in an era of low inflation and low economic growth,
companies which can rationalise and cut costs are likely to have above
average potential for profit growth. Companies which are emerging from the
public sector are likely to have more scope for efficiency gains.
For private investors the procedure for investing in an overseas
privatisation issue can be complex. An investment trust is also likely to
have more success in getting allocations.
The trust is likely to have a simple capital structure and to be launched
via a public offer.
Because most of its portfolio will be in the European Union, the fund will
qualify for a personal equity plan status.
Applications for shares in Kleinwort's Second Endowment Policy Trust have
had to be scaled down after the public offer was 3.18 times subscribed.
Applications for 1,000 shares will be met in full. Those who applied for
between 2,000 and 90,000 shares will receive 1,000 shares plus 15 per cent
of the amount applied for; those who applied for more than 100,000 shares
will get 1,000 shares and approximately 12.6 per cent of the shares they
sought.

Losses in the import division and a Pounds 600,000 provision against
property values left Stirling Group, the Marks and Spencer clothing
supplier, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 223,000 for the six months to
September 30, against Pounds 1.37m.
The company said that the import division had been hit by the acquisition of
Boftex, the loss of a large shirt importing contract and larger than
expected reorganisation costs.
On turnover of Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 7.9m) there was an operating loss of
Pounds 708,000 (Pounds 414,000 profit).
The shares fell 10p to 59p.
Group turnover was Pounds 46.7m (Pounds 45.6m). Losses per share were 0.06p
(1.07p earnings). The interim dividend, however, is raised to 0.55p (0.5p).

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Property groups worth over Pounds 1bn seek
listings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several private property companies are in discussions for a Stock Exchange
listing in the new year with a potential total market value of about Pounds
1bn.
The moves are being fuelled by investor enthusiasm for the property market,
the slow recovery of which earlier this year has accelerated rapidly in
recent months.
Expected to lead the way is Pillar Properties, the former fund management
vehicle which has property investments totalling some Pounds 200m. Analysts
said a further Pounds 100m is likely to be added before flotation.
Argent Group is also said to be taking soundings from stockbrokers and
advisers. It has substantial investments totalling Pounds 230m in central
Birmingham and elsewhere. Several other smaller companies are said to be in
discussions.
Growing direct institutional investment in selected properties has been
matched by investor appetite for listed property companies. Many shares have
reached, and in some cases passed, their pre-recession highs.
Mr Elliott Bernerd, chairman of Chelsfield, the property company which is
seeking a listing, said investor enthusiasm for property issues remained
strong. 'In all our presentations prior to the offer, the attitude of
investors was extremely enthusiastic.'
However, with banks remaining cautious over lending on other than the most
prestigious and secure developments, private funds for the property market
remain limited. 'The only way forward for the medium-sized private company
is to float,' said one analyst.
Mr John Slade at Richard Ellis, the property agent, said: 'They are
positioning themselves for the next boom, and now is the ideal time. It is
the only way they will get bigger.'
As the market has recovered, the listed companies have taken advantage by
raising extra funds through rights issues. More than Pounds 1.5bn has been
tapped from shareholders this year. 'Private companies being denied this
facility have not had the same flexibility of investment.'
Mr Peter Freeman, chief executive of Argent, said: 'The banks have been
quite willing to borrow on properties with long leases, strong rental stream
and blue chip tenants, but beyond that they are still relatively
unreceptive.'
He added that if a property company wanted to go outside that remit and
consider developing, other sources of finance had to be considered.
Demand for the well-let central London office block remained strong, with
institutions particularly keen to use it as an alternative investment to
bonds. Shopping centres, as well as small prime shop units offering good
yields were also being targeted.
Mr Brian Jollee, managing director of Capital and Counties, the property arm
of TransAtlantic, the insurance concern, said he was not surprised at the
level of interest in companies seeking a listing.
'The stock market is valuing property companies at a premium to their net
asset values at the moment after being at a huge discount earlier this
year.' Mr Jollee denied market rumours that his division is to be floated.
Mr Humphrey Price, chairman of Pillar, said yesterday that a flotation was
'one option under review,' but declined to give any other details.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hiscox launches new Lloyd's investment
trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hiscox Syndicates, the Lloyd's managing agents, yesterday announced that it
had raised Pounds 11.2m to form a new Lloyd's investment trust, Hiscox
Dedicated.
Applications under an offer for subscription were received for 2,240,600
units.
Accordingly 11,203,000 partly paid ordinary shares and 2,240,600 warrants
have been allotted.
Hiscox Dedicated had been seeking to raise up to Pounds 25m, but Mr Robert
Hiscox, a director of the new trust, said he was 'pleased to have achieved
an application level significantly in excess of the minimum, because Hiscox
Dedicated was launched after a large number of other Lloyd's funds had
already approached the capital market for investment.'
The Roberts &amp; Hiscox members agency raised Pounds 30m for the Hiscox Select
Insurance Fund in October.
The trust is one of the most popular of the 11 Lloyd's investment vehicles
currently listed on the stock exchange and is trading at a premium to its
net asset value.
Charterhouse Tilney Securities, which placed the issue, has informed Hiscox
Dedicated that it expects a matched bargain facility to be available for the
investment trust under the stock exchange rule 535(2).

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: British Steel cannot confirm sale of plants
to Vallourec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL reacted last night to speculation about the future of its
seamless tube business by saying it could not confirm that there was any
intention to sell its two Lanarkshire plants to Vallourec of France, writes
Andrew Baxter.
The steelmaker was responding to reports that it was in talks to sell the
Clydesdale and Imperial plants, which employ about 400 people, to the French
steel tubes producer.
There has been speculation for some time over British Steel's intentions in
the seamless tube business, which according to some estimates suffers from
excess production capacity of as much as 50 per cent worldwide.
It is understood that British Steel has had talks with Vallourec, but that
it has also been in contact with other seamless tube producers.
British Steel shut its outdated, high-cost rotary forge - used for making
the tubes - at Clydesdale two years ago, and now imports 'green' or
unfinished tubes from Vallourec and other suppliers.
It retains heat treatment equipment at Clydesdale, while the Imperial plant
finishes and threads the pipes, and also produces a sophisticated internal
coupling for the tubes under licence from Vallourec.
The tubes are used principally for 'downhole' and other applications in the
North Sea.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Pilkington turnover up 16%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher volumes, acquisitions, and the weak pound helped group turnover at
Pilkington rise by 16 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn in the half year to
end-September, against Pounds 1.2bn.
Mr Andrew Robb, finance director, said better volumes contributed 7
percentage points of the gain and exchange gains made 6 percentage points.
The Pounds 95m purchase of Heywood Williams' glass division added 4
percentage points, but lower prices cut sales by 1 percentage point.
Group operating profits rose from Pounds 44.1m to Pounds 57m, after
exceptional profits of Pounds 300,000 (losses Pounds 1m). European glass
profits fell from Pounds 23.8m to Pounds 16.5m, but those from North America
bounced from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 15.4m, helped by higher volumes and
prices.
The Heywood Williams business contributed Pounds 3.4m to operating profits.
The Sola spectacle lens subsidiary, sold after the period end, made a profit
of Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 5.6m).
Mr Roger Leverton, chief executive, said capacity utilisation in Europe was
about 88 per cent, after taking two float lines out for 3 and 4 months. Weak
prices in continental Europe - down 6 per cent in Germany  - had prevented
an 8 per cent rise in UK prices from sticking.
In North America, higher volumes had increased capacity utilisation to over
90 per cent had enabled a 5.5 per cent price rise in June and a 6.5 per cent
rise in November.
Profits from the southern hemisphere rose from Pounds 19.1m to Pounds 25.3m.
Cost cutting more than offset the effects of inflation on costs, and the
group had taken Pounds 200m out of annual costs over three years, with a 20
per cent reduction in jobs.
Earnings were 0.4p (losses 0.8p).

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Fine Art up 11% at Pounds 5.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While pre-tax profits at Fine Art Developments, the mail-order and greetings
cards group, increased 11 per cent from Pounds 4.95m to Pounds 5.51m in the
six months to September 30, turnover declined almost 4 per cent from Pounds
120m to Pounds 115.4m.
The shares fell 18p to 556p.
The profits rise was helped by reduced interest charges of Pounds 2.99m
(Pounds 4.84m) - thanks to lower rates, said Mr Keith Chapman, chairman -
and a Pounds 565,000 three-month contribution to operating profits from
James Galt, the toymaker acquired in July for Pounds 13.5m cash. Also, last
time there was a Pounds 2.17m profit from the sale of Fine Art's stake in
Next.
Group operating profits on continuing operations was up 4.3 per cent to
Pounds 7.94m (Pounds 7.61m).
The mail-order division, and Express Gifts in particular where sales were 9
per cent lower, had been constrained by the problems of consumer spending,
said Mr Chapman - 'there's an awful lot of concern out there'. Excluding
Galt, the division's sales fell 4 per cent to Pounds 54m.
Mr Chapman said that by next year Express' mail-order system would be 'one
of the most sophisticated and efficient' and would be able to dispatch
personalised items along with other goods.
Fine Art had spent Pounds 1.5m more this time on 'an aggressive marketing
campaign' backing Express - some Pounds 15m was spent last year - though
with less benefit than expected. The marketing strategy will be radically
changed next time.
It was 'a tough time for charities', said Mr Chapman. In this sector, sales
fell 9 per cent as a result of the planned contraction in trading by Fine
Art's largest customer. Excluding this one account sales were up 4 per cent.
The particular charity has 'reversed its decision and next year will seek to
rebuild its volume', said Mr Chapman.
Sales of the cards and paper products division were Pounds 55m, also down 4
per cent. Hambledon Studios and Gallery Studios, the wholesale supply
companies, continued to perform well.
The branded business of Britannia Products had been the star performer,
though its private-label side encountered 'problems of our own making', said
Mr Chapman. By delaying order information, 'we shot ourselves in the foot
and the warehouse systems didn't help either', he added.
The interim dividend is lifted to 3.3p (3p), payable from earnings per share
of 4.87p (4.54p).

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Seeboard 9% ahead at Pounds 36m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seeboard, the electricity distributor for the south-east of England outside
London, yesterday warmed the market with news of a 1-for-1 scrip issue and a
16 per cent increase in the interim dividend.
Pre-tax profits for the half year to end-September were 9 per cent higher at
Pounds 36.3m, up from a restated Pounds 33.2m, and earnings per share were
20.3p, 10 per cent ahead from 18.4p.
However, Mr John Quin, finance director, said that underlying growth, after
stripping out the effects of restructuring costs, was about 16 per cent both
in profitability and earnings.
Unlike some regional companies, which have already reported dividend rises
of up to 20 per cent, Seeboard did not attempt to rebalance dividend
payments between the two halves of the year.
Sir Keith Suart, chairman, said the 16 per cent rise was based on
performance and ability to pay. Analysts interpreted this as meaning 16 per
cent was possible for the full year too.
The interim dividend of 3.3p (2.85p) is being paid on the increased capital.
Seeboard is the first regional electricity company to announce a scrip.
Sir Keith said it would improve marketability, particularly for small
shareholders. 'There are 200,000 small shareholders and we take them very
seriously,' he said.
In the opening six months turnover rose 2 per cent to Pounds 534m. The
distribution business saw a 0.6 per cent growth in units and increased
profits from Pounds 37.3m to Pounds 39.3m. Supply losses were slightly less
at Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 6.8m). Retailing broke even on turnover of Pounds
27.1m whereas in the comparable period of last year it lost Pounds 300,000.
The company has Pounds 48m in the bank, compared with Pounds 6.1m in 1992
first half. Seeboard said that as a result of tight controls it would pay a
rebate of about Pounds 8 to all domestic and quarterly billed business
customers during the quarter beginning next April.
COMMENT
Seeboard bore gifts yesterday for both shareholders and customers. The
rebate to customers will on average match almost exactly the value added tax
the government is imposing on domestic fuel bills from April. For
shareholders the present is the scrip which is likely to increase the total
value of holdings, if only marginally, and provides the company with a first
among recs. Both moves are typical of a company which has always marketed
itself effectively. But there is more than just show to Seeboard as a 6.4
per cent real reduction in controllable costs in the half under review
demonstrates. Contracting, which reported an operating loss of Pounds
200,000 was disappointing but the brake on outperformance for the shares is
that they are already highly priced. If Seeboard pays out 23.4p for the full
year the prospective yield is about 4.1 per cent, lower than most and
possibly all other recs.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: European recession leaves JFB at Pounds
3.06m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The warning from the directors of Johnson &amp; Firth Brown in August that
second-half profits were expected to be below those of the first half was
borne out yesterday.
The full year to end-September saw pre-tax profits of the specialist
engineering group fall from Pounds 7.15m to Pounds 3.06m, including a
second-half contribution of Pounds 996,000 - compared with the first half's
Pounds 2.07m.
Earnings fell to 1.4p (3.3p) and a final dividend of 0.35p makes a total of
1.35p (3p).
The shares fell 2p to 36 1/2 p.
Acquisitions added Pounds 8.5m to total turnover of Pounds 130m (Pounds
124m) and Pounds 613,000 to operating profits of Pounds 4.83m (Pounds
6.94m). Interest took Pounds 1.77m (added Pounds 212,000).
The directors said the results reflected a lack of demand in mainland Europe
in markets that were of 'increasing relevance' to the group.
They added that in addition to a generally weak economic environment, group
companies experienced considerable pressure on margins.
European competitors were 'increasing their export efforts outside Europe
and attempting to win market share to maintain volume, almost regardless of
margins.'
The directors are reviewing the group's strategy with the intention of
concentrating resources on a more tightly defined core of businesses.
The changes would take time to achieve and were not expected to benefit
results in the near future. They saw little to encourage them that the
current year would be 'much different from last.'

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hartstone drops to Pounds 0.4m but relief
lifts shares 9p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hartstone Group, the hosiery and leathergoods company which is in
refinancing talks after breaching banking covenants this summer, suffered a
sharp drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 428,000 in the
first half.
The return was struck on a 14 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 185m
(Pounds 162m), partly due to acquisitions. Profits were also depressed by a
Pounds 179,000 currency loss, against a Pounds 3.4m gain previously.
The shares rose 9p on the news of the results, which were prepared on a
going concern basis, to close at 42p.
The dividend is passed. Earnings fell from 6.7p to 0.3p.
Mr Shaun Dowling, the chairman appointed by banks in June, said refinancing
talks were well advanced. He expected to make an announcement before the
January 16 deadline for the standstill agreement. He would not comment on
details of the talks.
However, it is thought that Hartstone is already negotiating the sale of
part of its business with potential buyers as part of the refinancing. A
debt for equity swap is believed to be unlikely.
The company, which grew rapidly via acquisitions in the US and Europe,
suffered from severe competition in the European hosiery markets in the
first half and supply difficulties arising from its financing problems.
Mr Dowling said Hartstone had improved significantly since August by ceasing
promotional activity, improving supply to supermarkets and pushing its three
brands, Bear in the UK, Marie Claire in Spain and Well in France.
The leathergoods division was fuelled by strong growth from Etienne Aigner,
which improved margins from 32.9 per cent to 39 per cent.
COMMENT
The shares rose yesterday on relief that Hartstone had just squeaked by with
a profit and even appeared more confident about its survival than in recent
months. There is also likely to be a faint attraction on the dividend front
for shareholders when and if the refinancing is concluded. But it is still
too early to allow Hartstone off the speculative list. The refinancing is
not complete and questions remain over how much Hartstone will have to sell
to get off the hook. Furthermore, the price war in hosiery is far from over
in continental Europe and the grim comments from Courtaulds Textiles leave
many wondering how the struggling Hartstone can buck the trend. Forecasts
range from Pounds 2m to Pounds 5m pre-tax for a multiple of between 13.5 and
16. Which ever way one looks at it, this is not a stock for the faint
hearted.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Unit trusts call truce in high income war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Full scale war in the unit trust industry was averted yesterday, when rival
parties Save &amp; Prosper and an alliance of Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial and Morgan
Grenfell agreed to differ on the issue of high income unit trusts.
Hostilities seemed set to break out over the weekend when Save &amp; Prosper
abandoned plans to launch a trust offering a 10 per cent yield, citing
doubts that such a return would have been achieved without erosion of
capital. That implicitly raised doubts about the backing for funds run by
Hypo F &amp; C and Morgan Grenfell, which between them have raised Pounds 490m
from investors.
Save &amp; Prosper had arranged meetings to brief journalists on Wednesday; Hypo
F &amp; C had also organised to meet the press in order to respond. Instead, the
two sides decided to talk and the press briefings were hurriedly cancelled.
Yesterday, each side issued a statement with the aim of defusing the row.
At the heart of the issue is the use of options to generate income. Both the
Hypo F &amp; C and the Morgan Grenfell funds use a combination of shares, cash
and options to achieve their 10 per cent yield. The funds earn premiums by
writing call options against the shares they own - in non-jargon terms, that
means they give other investors the right to buy the shares at a certain
price.
While the premiums can be passed through to investors as income the funds
miss out on some capital growth, since the options will be exercised if
share prices rise.
What is less clear is whether the above strategy is likely to lead to the
erosion of investor's capital. In its statement yesterday, Save &amp; Prosper
said 'it felt that it could not launch such a unit trust if it had doubts
about the trust's ability to pay a 10 per cent income on a continuing basis
without there being the probability of erosion of capital built into the
portfolio structure.'
However, S&amp;P added 'there are a number of different approaches to
derivatives investment and it will not comment on the validity or efficiency

For their part, Hypo F &amp; C and Morgan Grenfell issued a joint statement,
which said 'The two companies are confident of their funds' abilities to
meet their stated objectives. Based on the discussions with Save &amp; Prosper,
we believe that there are significant features of the two companies' funds
which have not been explored by the models used.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Salvesen's Pounds 41m disappoints City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Christian Salvesen fell 17p to 331p yesterday after the
international distribution, specialist hire and food services group reported
flat underlying profits for the six months to September 30.
Under FRS 3, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 53m to Pounds 41.1m but the
comparative figure was flattered by a Pounds 12.6m gain on the disposal of
Salvesen's oilfield technology business, which now goes above the line.
Excluding exceptionals, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 40.4m to Pounds
41.1m.
Sir Alick Rankin, chairman, said: 'Under all the circumstances of a most
difficult international marketplace . . . this to be a creditable
achievement and we feel able to raise the interim dividend by 3.1 per cent.'
Operating profits from the specialist hire division fell from Pounds 15.4m
to Pounds 15m. The group said Aggreko, which hires out generators and
temperature control equipment, had seen strong performances in the US and
south-east Asia offset by difficult trading conditions in Europe.
Light and Sound Design, which the group bought in 1991, made nothing in the
first half. Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said the company had been too
slow to reduce its reliance on depressed pop concert markets, and it was
being restructured, with a number of senior management changes.
In distribution, operating profits grew 7.1 per cent to Pounds 18m. The UK
business was down 5 per cent at Pounds 9.6m, but this was partly offset by
growth in continental Europe and particularly strong growth in the US.
Mr Masters said he accepted that grocery distribution in the UK was a fairly
mature market, but said there were considerable opportunities for multi-user
depots in the US.
In the food services division, profits fell from Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 7.5m.
Salvesen Brick maintained profits at Pounds 1.5m.
Earnings under FRS 3 fell to 10.29p (14.03p). The interim dividend is
increased to 3.3p (3.2p).
COMMENT
The drop in the share price reflected disappointment over the profits
figure, which was slightly below expectations, and that currency translation
had contributed no less than Pounds 3.1m. However, the main concern of
analysts is that growth of Salvesen's marvellous Aggreko business might be
running out of steam. Mr Masters accepts that the days of annual 20 per cent
growth are in the past, but says there is no reason why Aggreko should not
maintain annual growth of 10 to 15 per cent, as it supplies bigger and more
complex contracts. Forecast full-year profits of about Pounds 80m put the
shares on a prospective multiple of 17.5. At that level they are still on a
deserved 10 per cent premium to the market, but they are unlikely to advance
much until the City is convinced that the specialist hire problems are only
of a transitional nature.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered in Pounds 100m
preference issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered, the UK-based international banking group, yesterday
strengthened its capital base with a Pounds 100m issue of non-cumulative
preference shares, writes John Gapper. The issue raises its core tier 1
ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets.
Standard's share price has risen sharply recently, driven by its exposure to
emerging markets in the Asia Pacific region. But there has been speculation
over whether it would be forced into a rights issue to strengthen capital.
The bank is also exposed to the appreciation of the dollar against sterling
because its capital is sterling-denominated, while most of its assets are in
currencies which are more closely linked to the dollar.
It has had a lower ratio of tier 1 capital - comprising equity, risk capital
including non-cumulative preference shares, and retained earnings - to its
risk-weighted assets than many US and European banks.
The issue, which was jointly placed by J Henry Schroder Wagg, Cazenove and
Salamon Brothers, will raise its tier 1 ratio of 5.4 per cent by 50 basis
points, and its total capital ratio of 10.7 per cent by a percentage point.
A sterling rather than a dollar issue is thought to have been chosen because
of regulatory requirements in the US, and because dollar preference shares
would only provide a limited hedge against currency movements.
Non-cumulative preference shares are counted by the Bank of England towards
regulatory tier 1 capital because they are considered to carry investor
risk. The issue was placed at a net yield of 7.375 per cent.
The shares lost 8p to 1229p.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Total Systems falls to Pounds 12,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Slow economic recovery was blamed by Total Systems, the USM-quoted computer
systems company, for a slump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 424,436 to
Pounds 12,330 for the half year ended September 30.
Sales fell to Pounds 1.08m (Pounds 1.36m). Operating losses were Pounds
31,690 (Pounds 364,791 profits) but there was interest income of Pounds
44,020 (Pounds 59,745).
Earnings were 0.078p (2.85p) and the interim dividend is passed (1.5p last
time).

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts GUS 9% to Pounds
213m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Universal Stores, the mail order, retail, financial services and
property group which recently enfranchised its shareholders, yesterday
reported a 9.4 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits - underpinned by
higher trading profits in all four main trading divisions.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 194.8m to Pounds 213.2m in the six
months to September 30 on turnover ahead by 11.5 per cent to Pounds 1.39bn
(Pounds 1.25bn).
Earnings per share increased to 14.3p (12.9p) and the interim dividend is
raised from 3.44p to 4p.
Operating profits, including Pounds 28.6m (Pounds 27.5m) in net property
rental income, increased by 16.6 per cent to Pounds 155.9m (Pounds 133.7m).
Net interest receipts declined to Pounds 51.6m (Pounds 58.5m) resulting in
an overall trading profit of Pounds 207.5m (Pounds 192.2m.)
Profit on the sale of investments and property after professional fees of
Pounds 2m for the capital reorganisation implemented in October, contributed
a further Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 2.6m).
The core home shopping division, which includes the Kays and Great Universal
mail order catalogues, boosted trading profit by 22 per cent to Pounds 68.5m
(Pounds 56.2m).
That was achieved on turnover which jumped to Pounds 818.4m (Pounds 780.5m)
reflecting a vol-ume increase, mainly in the UK.
The Burberrys &amp; Scotch House division also performed well and lifted trading
profit by 54 per cent to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 8.5m) on turnover up 20 per
cent at Pounds 85.4m (Pounds 71.2m).
The overseas retailing division made a modest increased contribution with
operating profits rising by 10 per cent to Pounds 11m (Pounds 10m) on
turnover of Pounds 88.2m (Pounds 83.3m).
The consumer and corporate finance, banking and business information
operations also performed well, lifting their trading profits to Pounds
25.8m (Pounds 18.4m). Among these operations GUS said General Guarantee
experienced strong demand for both consumer and corporate advances,
particularly for cars and other vehicles.
Rental income in the property division increased by 7.2 per cent from Pounds
25m to Pounds 26.8m despite the number of rent reviews being at a low point
in the 5-year review cyle.
The group generated a Pounds 140.7m positive underlying cash flow from
trading activities during the first half and maintained a virtually ungeared
balance sheet which included Pounds 1.12bn of cash at the end of September.
COMMENT
GUS's shares closed 9p down at 573p yesterday, perhaps reflecting some
disappointment that following enfranchisement, there were no further
developments on corporate structure. The results themselves were solid, in
line with expectations, and reflect the benefits of the group's continuing
investment in technology. Pre-tax profits this year should be about Pounds
510m producing earnings of about 33.7p per share. At current prices the
shares are trading on a forward p/e of 17 and, despite a pronounced run over
the past year, appear to have little downside risk.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Union criticism as Ferranti sheds 630 more
jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Receivers at Ferranti International yesterday announced 630 redundancies
among the 3,600-strong workforce.
The job losses, which had been expected since the company went into
receivership last week, are to be spread across the group's operations
throughout the UK.
Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot, the two Arthur Andersen receivers
appointed to the ailing electronics business after GEC withdrew takeover
plans, believe the job cuts will save Pounds 1m a month in operating costs.
This should allow them to run the business activities without further
immediate losses if all Ferranti's customers can be persuaded to agree
various contract changes.
Mr Talbot said they remained optimistic about their ability to sell the
businesses as going concerns.
'What this means is that anyone wanting to buy any of the businesses will
now be able to pick them up without having to fund the cost of
redundancies,' AEEU, the engineering union, said last night.
Mr Paul Gallagher, leader of the union's electricians' section, said the
news was worse than he had feared.
'It is a bitter pill to swallow, especially as the government could easily
have saved these jobs by awarding outstanding Ministry of Defence contracts
to Ferranti.'
The redundancies are higher than management had wanted - it had planned for
500 - but the receivers hope the job losses will allow them the breathing
space they need to make the businesses viable.
In the past three years Ferranti had reduced its workforce from 22,000.
The redundancies follow the same pattern as those at Leyland Daf last year
where Mr Talbot and Mr McKillop also made severe job cuts after they took
over as receivers.
An industrial tribunal chairman, awarding compensation to sacked Leyland
workers in November, criticised the receivers for failing to meet their
statutory obligations.
Under employment laws, workers should receive more than 90 days notice of
redundancy. The receivers said, however, they were unable to comply with the
requirement.
Mr McKillop said he sympathised with the employees who were losing their
jobs.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Slimma likely to raise Pounds 5m in new
year float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slimma, the women's clothing manufacturer specialising in outsize garments,
will seek a flotation in the new year.
Although no details have been settled, it is likely Slimma will aim to raise
about Pounds 5m in a placing of new shares, sponsored and brokered by Henry
Cooke Lumsden.
As the management - led by Mr Stephen Thwaite, and Yorkshire Bank
Development Capital, Slimma's venture capital backer - intend to retain a
majority of the enlarged capital, the group will probably be valued at about
Pounds 12m.
Mr Thwaite led a management team which bought out two divisions of Tootal,
part of the Coats Viyella group, in October 1991 for Pounds 3.3m.
Since then Slimma has expanded from one plant in Leek, Staffordshire. It has
taken another factory in the same town and additional plants in Sandbach,
Cheshire and Cannock, Staffordshire.
In two years its payroll has risen from 370 to 525 people.
If the placing is successful, Slimma will use the funds to broaden its
clothing range from skirts and trousers partly to protect itself from other
groups which are moving into the under-exploited outsize clothing market.
The funds would also clear residual bank debt taken on at the time of the
buy-out. Gearing is about 50 per cent.
Slimma's accounts for the year to last September are expected to show
pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 1m on turnover of up to Pounds 16m.

FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: British Land advances 28%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Land, the commercial property company, yesterday reported pre-tax
profits up 28 per cent to Pounds 13.1m in the six months to September 30,
against Pounds 10.2m.
The company also said it had so far spent more than Pounds 135m in property
purchases for the British Land Quantum Property Investment Partnership
announced in June.
Gross rental income was Pounds 72.7m (Pounds 69.4m). Earnings per share came
out at 2.9p (3.9p) and the interim dividend is increased to 2.45p, compared
with 2.28p.
Mr John Ritblat, chairman, said: 'We are very happy with these results' and
expressed strong confidence in the recovery of the property market. He
reiterated his comments from June last year that the property market had
turned for the better and continued to recover to a semblance of normality.
He said that the company traditionally had a 'quiet first half' with the
timing of its quarterly rent collection dates pushing more revenue into the
second half of the year.
Mr Ritblat attacked FRS 3 as 'so inappropriate for our accounts' because of
its requirement that capital items be included. He preferred to emphasise
revenue profits which showed a 60 per cent advance to Pounds 18.2m (Pounds
11.4m) during the half year.
Current funds and facilities exceed Pounds 775m. The company said its
weighted average debt maturity was now greater than 22 years.
The Quantum partnership, under which British Land will spend Pounds 500m in
property, was set up with a Pounds 250m equity subscription from Mr George
Soros' Quantum Fund. British Land said it now had first refusal over the
Quantum interest.
COMMENT
The market seemed slightly disappointed in British Land's results, with the
shares closing down 11p at 433p while the sector was stable. The reason was
the false expectation, based on previous experience, that there would be
other news at the same time: perhaps an acquisition, or a revaluation or
balance sheet at the half year. Some analysts also felt the company was
falling behind in its spending plans for its property-buying partnership
with the Quantum Fund at a time when they consider the market is becoming
more competitive. The company denies it has set any targets and seems
willing to bide its time. Overall the shares seem fairly priced, with the
company well geared for recovery and rich in cash for potential
acquisitions.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Swedish banks set to merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A merger of Nordbanken and Gota Bank to create Sweden's biggest bank in
terms of market share appeared certain yesterday after Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken, the only other bidder for Gota, broke off negotiations.
A combination of the two state-owned banks would have 24 per cent of total
deposits and lending, although in asset terms it would still be smaller than
Swedbank and SE Banken. The merged entity could be privatised as early as
1995.
SE Banken said its decision to withdraw its bid was based 'on judgments and
analyses of the information that has continuously been made available during
the negotiations,' but it declined to elaborate.
Its statement echoed that of its rival, Svenska Handelsbanken, which pulled
out of the bidding earlier this week because of information received during
the valuation process. Handelsbanken also said the government was seeking
'far too high' a price for the bank.
SE Banken's withdrawal means Nordbanken is the only remaining bidder for
Gota Bank.
A government statement on the future of Nordbanken and Gota is expected
today, when details of the recapitalisation of Gota Bank may also be
published. The bank is likely to receive an injection of at least SKr20bn
(Dollars 2.5bn) to support its problem loans. A formal separation of Gota's
healthy activities from SKr43bn problem loans, dumped in a 'bad bank' entity
called Retriva, is expected to take place at the year-end.
Analysts believe the state was deliberately asking a high price for Gota
because it had concluded that the synergy benefits from a Nordbanken/Gota
Bank merger would be considerable and would enable the state to get a better
price for the combined entity than the two components.
Nordbanken and Gota Bank both collapsed into state control last year after
suffering huge losses during Sweden's financial sector crisis.
Nordbanken, which saw the bulk of its problem loans hived off into a unit
called Securum early this year, recorded a SKr2.5bn operating profit in the
first nine months. Gota Bank incurred a SKr8.48bn operating loss over the
same period, excluding the impact of state guarantees.

FT  10 DEC 93 / A deal to trade shares for reform hangs in the air: Hopes of
a breakthrough in talks between United Airlines and its workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year United Airlines overtook American Airlines as the biggest US
carrier in terms of passenger miles flown. In the third quarter, it reported
a leap in net income from Dollars 6m to Dollars 149m. It is sitting on a
cash mountain of Dollars 2bn. Surely it must be the happiest airline in the
business?
Actually, no: it is in trouble. Its third-quarter profit was largely due to
windfall gains from a slump in jet fuel prices, and fell far short of
producing an acceptable margin on revenue of Dollars 4bn. Mr Stephen Wolf,
chairman and chief executive, has said that UAL will still report a loss for
the fourth quarter and the year as a whole.
Worse, the company is failing to fend off growing competition from low-cost
carriers such as Southwest Airlines, which are encroaching on its markets
and driving down fares.
Any other airline company in such difficulties would look vulnerable to a
takeover. United is no exception. In United's case, however, it is not a
competing airline that is bidding to take over the company, but the
carrier's own employees.
For months, United's management has been conducting on-off talks with its
labour unions over a deal to secure the company's future. This week the
negotiations entered what appeared to be a make-or-break phase as the two
sides met again to discuss a deal that could give union members up to 60 per
cent of the company's equity in return for billions of dollars' worth of
labour concessions. The company's market capitalisation is about Dollars
3.7bn.
The two sides have been driven together out of a mutual recognition that
United has little future in its present form. Small carriers offering
no-frills services are turning domestic air travel into a low-margin
commodity business in the US, and the larger carriers must cut costs to
survive.
United wants to respond by setting up a low-cost subsidiary to take over its
short-haul domestic services. But that would mean shedding thousands of
jobs, cutting wages and benefits and increasing productivity through changes
in work rules.
With both sides anxious to avoid a potentially ruinous strike, the airline
and its unions have been seeking a deal that would allow employees to take
the net present value of the stream of earnings flowing from their labour
concessions and trade it for shares in the company - a path already trodden
at Northwest Airlines, where employees own 37.5 per cent of the equity, and
Trans World Airlines, where they own 45 per cent.
Leaked details of the negotiations suggest the unions want 60 per cent of a
recapitalised United Airlines in return for a package made up mainly of
labour concessions. It would also comprise loan notes. They value the
package at Dollars 5.5bn, but United says it is worth less. The company is
believed to have made a counter-offer of a 50.1 per cent stake in return for
an improved package from the workers, with an arrangement for the stake to
rise to 60 per cent if certain performance criteria are met.
It has been hard to inject urgency into the talks at a time when United
appears to be in financial health. The deals at Northwest and TWA were done
only when the airlines were on the brink of collapse.
But the pressure is building up. United has threatened to pull out of
short-haul domestic flights and to shrink the business down to a profitable
core if it does not get a deal with the unions soon. Last month it agreed
the sale of its flight kitchens business, employing 5,200 people.
This week the talks took a new turn with the arrival of a powerful
intermediary: Mr Felix Rohatyn of Lazard Freres, the Wall Street investment
bank. Mr Rohatyn is a respected deal maker who played a key role in saving
the city of New York from bankruptcy in the mid-1970s.
Hopes are high that Mr Rohatyn will achieve the breakthrough that all
parties desire. If he fails, United will unilaterally embark on a
contraction of its business that will cut thousands of jobs from its 86,000
total. Nobody knows quite how the unions will respond, but they are unlikely
to take it lying down.

FT  10 DEC 93 / No payout as LIG slumps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London International Group surprised the market yesterday by announcing
interim losses, warning of 'very substantial' restructuring charges and
passing the dividend.
Its plans include the sale of large parts of the business and a capital
reconstruction. Mr Alan Woltz, non-executive chairman, is to resign once a
replacement is found, probably by the financial year-end in March.
The shares slumped to 95p initially before recovering to 111p, a loss of 28p
on the day. They have fallen from 272p in January. The results followed a
profit warning and the resignation of Mr Tony Butterworth as chief executive
in September.
Yesterday Mr Nick Hodges, the new chief executive, said 'we are aware of the
criticisms of the group over the non-delivery of promises. We intend to
start a new era at LIG.' He added that the new management team, which
includes Mr James Tyrell as finance director, had 'only got one chance' to
sort out the group's problems but he was sure it could be returned to an
acceptable level of profitability.
A strategic review of the business had already been carried out, and LIG had
decided to sell its ColourCare photo-processing division and some of its
health and beauty brands. It would concentrate on its 'thin film technology'
products, notably condoms, surgeons' and specialist gloves. It would build
on global brands such as Durex condoms and Biogel surgeons' gloves.
There would also be further rationalisation, and 2,000 of the 7,000 jobs in
the health and personal products division would go worldwide. Analysts said
they could not predict full-year figures because of the exceptional charges
of these moves which could run into 'tens of millions,' one said.
The half-year showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.1m compared with a profit of
Pounds 15.5m. Net debt had risen from Pounds 127.7m on March 31 to Pounds
153.9m on September 30. Shareholders' funds were Pounds 109.4m and there
were Pounds 53.9m of intangible assets on the balance sheet.
Mr Hodges said a rights issue was not necessary as disposals should raise 'a
substantial sum'. He said the group was not breaching covenants on its loans
and had the full support of its banks.
The loss-making photo-processing division, which has more than 30 per cent
of the UK market, was valued in the books at more than Pounds 30m, he said.
It was now 'a question of getting the best available price not waiting for
what might come'.
The group could also sell some of its toiletries brands, which include
Woodward's gripe water, Wrights Coal Tar Soap, Galloways and Buttercup cough
mixtures, Eucryl tooth powder, and, in Italy, the Mister Baby range of baby
products.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Overseas side holds North West back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North West Water, the privatised utility, yesterday announced a 6 per cent
increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 138.2m and a slightly higher
than expected dividend.
But its share price slipped 17p to 567p as the company reported a sharp drop
in profits from non-regulated businesses, in which it has invested some
Pounds 140m since privatisation. In particular the group's process
engineering operation in the US saw operating profits plummet from Pounds
7.3m to Pounds 3m.
The shares may also have been hit by North West's decision to delay paying
the interim dividend until April 6. This will save the company advance
corporation tax, but result in a lower tax credit for pension funds.
Mr Bob Ferguson, finance director, said the company had sought to compensate
for the delayed dividend by increasing the payout from 7.13p to 7.67,
against an expected 7.65p.
Earnings per share rose 16 per cent to 39.3p. Group sales were 7.5 per cent
ahead at Pounds 455.3m.
Analysts also said the group was suffering from uncertainty over management
succession following the abrupt departure last month of Mr Bob Thian, the
chief executive linked to the group's international expansion. 'The shares
are likely to underperform because there seems to be a lack of senior
management at the top,' said one analyst.
North West suffered a 54 per cent decline in profits from non-regulated
businesses to Pounds 3.2m on sales 10 per cent higher at Pounds 85.4m. Mr
Ferguson said exchange rate movements had contributed about Pounds 9m.
The division had been hit by recession in the US. Mr Ferguson said the
outlook was encouraging, however, with order books 27 per cent ahead of last
year at Pounds 70m.
North West has also been successful in winning international contracts, and
yesterday announced the signing of its latest joint venture to extend and
operate Malaysia's sewerage system. The international contracts were
expected to begin to contribute to earnings next year, said Mr Ferguson.
The UK regulated water business showed a 16 per cent increase in operating
profits to Pounds 168.3m. Turnover rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 369.6m.
There was a Pounds 4.6m decline in industrial and commercial volumes.
North West also announced the appointment of its seventh non-executive
director, Sir Peter Middleton, deputy chairman of Barclays Bank.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Recovery signs in Pilkington's doubled profits: Glass
group's shares advance, but cautious note on auto demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pilkington has made the most of a glimmer of recovery in some of its markets
by doubling pre-tax profits from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 30.5m, in the
half-year to end-September.
The glass maker suffered badly in the recession with annual profits plunging
from Pounds 302m in 1989-90 to Pounds 41m in 1992-93. But yesterday Sir
Anthony Pilkington, chairman, said: 'Things are moving in the right
direction.' The group's shares rose 11p to 168p.
Sir Anthony remained cautious. He warned, for instance, that short-time
working at Ford and Nissan car plants in the UK would affect the second
half.
The interim dividend was cut from 2.93p to 1.5p. The group said this was to
restore the balance, after the second dividend had been cut twice.
Although Pilkington's largest subsidiary, the German glass-maker Flachglas,
has been exposed to a 20 per cent downturn in German car production,
continued strength in the housing market kept Flachglas in profit in the
half year.
Continental Europe was still worsening, Pilkington said, while the UK was
showing early signs of recovery. Results were improving in the US and were
good in the southern hemisphere, including Latin America and Australia.
Results from Libbey-Owens-Ford in North America showed how a rise in volumes
could lead to firmer prices and sharply higher profits. Volumes to
automotive manufacturers rose 6 per cent, to the replacement windscreen
market 13 per cent and to the residential market 14 per cent. Operating
profits from the US rose sixfold from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 15.4m on sales
28.5 per cent higher at Pounds 341.3m.
Group borrowings rose to Pounds 1.02bn from Pounds 932m at the year-end,
following the Pounds 95m acquisition of Heywood Williams' glass division,
giving gearing of 87 per cent. However, since September Pilkington has
received Pounds 200m in cash from the sale of Sola, its spectacle lens
business, which also added Pounds 56m to shareholders' funds, and cut
gearing to 67 per cent. An exceptional profit of Pounds 38m will be
recorded.
The group is aiming to bring gearing below 50 per cent by 1995. Further
disposals are expected, although nothing substantial in the second half.
Mr Andrew Robb, finance director, said cashflow had been marginally positive
before capital expenditure and acquisitions. Mr Roger Leverton, chief
executive, said, with capital expenditure held below depreciation and
working capital being constrained, the group should be cash positive for the
year for the first time since 1989.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Chancellor attacks Delors plans to create jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government yesterday attacked plans by Mr Jacques Delors, European
Commission president, to create jobs by borrowing money to pay for
environmental and transport projects such as the Channel tunnel rail link.
On the eve of the European summit in Brussels, Mr Kenneth Clarke,
chancellor, said there was no evidence of the need for borrowing for
infrastructure improvements across Europe.
'Here are the Commission for the first time saying they are going to borrow
billions of Ecu as a Commission and dish it out to as yet unspecified
projects across Europe,' he said on BBC Radio. This would push up the
average rates of interest, he said. All European Union governments were
trying to reduce borrowing to create the right conditions for growth.
Mr Clarke added: 'It really is rather perverse for the European Commission
to say: 'Oh, but we are going to have a public sector borrowing requirement
of our own now and we are going to start borrowing billions of pounds' which
might start driving things in the wrong direction.'
Asked if money from Brussels would be helpful to finish the Channel tunnel
rail link, Mr Clarke said: 'There's no shortage of money for these projects.
Private sector finance will go into well-judged projects.'
He said: 'We don't want these white papers produced on a Monday, trundled
through a heads of government conference at the weekend, accompanied by a
press release indicating that something like Pounds 100bn worth of borrowing
can speed up the construction of the networks across Europe.'
The government's reaction to the Commission's proposals was criticised by Mr
Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor.
'Many of the proposals the government now rejects out of hand are modelled
on the December summit agreement in Edinburgh in 1992 for which the prime
minister once claimed credit,' he said.
Mr Brown added: 'It is clear that the negative, destructive, anti-European
attitudes now being expressed even by declared pro-Europeans like the
chancellor are designed to hold the Conservative party together.'
He asked: 'Why does the government refuse to back action that would clearly
be of benefit to the Channel tunnel rail link and prevent the national
humiliation until 2002 of trains travelling at 185mph from a link already
opened from Paris to Calais but at only 47mph from Dover to London?'

FT  10 DEC 93 / Clinton and Assad to meet as Syria-Israel talks resume
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, yesterday announced
Syria's formal return to direct peace talks with Israel and said President
Bill Clinton would meet President Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader, early
next year in Geneva.
Syria has for three months refused to resume bilateral talks without a prior
Israeli undertaking to withdraw fully from the Golan Heights, captured in
the 1967 war. The last round of bilateral talks, the 11th, took place in
September.
At a press conference in Damascus, Mr Christopher declined to reveal what
undertakings Syria had been offered, saying any revelations might hurt
progress in the negotiations.
Mr Clinton is expected to meet Mr Assad in Geneva after January 15, adding a
stop to a European tour already embracing Brussels, Prague, Moscow and
Minsk. It will be the first meeting of US and Syrian leaders since Mr George
Bush met Mr Assad in November 1990 during efforts to create the
multinational coalition which ejected Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, Syria's foreign minister, said the summit would 'help
to push the peace process forward', adding: 'Such a meeting is so important
 -I think it would produce results.'
The summit will mark a significant opportunity for Syria to press for the
lifting of the economic sanctions imposed because the US and other western
nations consider it to be a state sponsor of terrorism.
However, Mr Christopher said that nothing had changed in the US assessment
of Syria either in this regard or in respect of its human rights record.
Mr Christopher also announced that Lebanese and Syrian heads of delegation
had agreed to meet in Washington on January 18 to discuss a full resumption
of peace talks with Israel, either at the end of the month or early in
February. Mr Christopher said he was confident that such agreement would
follow.
The fruitful climax to Mr Christopher's latest Middle East shuttle came as
Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, and Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign
minister, met in Spain in an attempt to inject momentum into their own
stalled negotiations. They restated their hope that Israeli forces could
start withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho on schedule next Monday.
However, Mr Nabil Shaath, head of the Palestinian negotiating team with
Israel, said in Cairo that 'major differences' remained.
Mr Arafat and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, are to meet in Cairo
on Sunday in an attempt to bridge outstanding differences.
The urgency of meeting Monday's deadline was underlined by continuing
violence in the occupied territories.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Ulster Tories warn PM over peace initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Northern Ireland Tories have warned Mr John Major that he may
'destroy himself, the party and the union' by pursuing the peace initiative.
In a letter to about 1,000 prominent Conservatives including the prime
minister, Mr Leonard Fee, the senior unpaid Tory in the province, claimed Mr
Major could 'destroy us all' by allowing himself to be enticed by
'media-hype, Irish blarney' and 'honeyed words'.
His warning emerged as the government moved to reassure Unionists on the
Major-Reynolds initiative by signalling that it may decide to give the
go-ahead for a Northern Ireland parliamentary select committee within the
next month.
Under current plans, clearance for the committee could be given as a gesture
of reassurance to Unionists if London succeeds in agreeing a joint
declaration with Dublin to persuade the IRA to give up its campaign of
violence.
It is thought that a government undertaking to set up a body which has been
long sought by Unionists would make them less likely to reject text that
emerges from the Major-Reynolds process.
An early decision to press ahead with the committee would risk antagonising
nationalists, however. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and
Labour party, warned this week that such a move could endanger the Ulster
talks process.
London and Dublin are voicing mounting confidence that a joint declaration
can be agreed before Christmas. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland
secretary, yesterday gave cabinet ministers their first briefing on last
Friday's Dublin meeting between Mr Major and Mr Reynolds.
In his letter to fellow Tories, Mr Fee, chairman of the party's voluntary
wing in Ulster, said: 'If the government agrees to any form of devolved
legislative government for Northern Ireland, it will be ensuring the
break-up of the United Kingdom.
'The impression is given that 'talks' are designed to produce a solution
which will appease the IRA. We do not see how this can be done without going
back on the guarantees about Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom
 -nothing less would satisfy the IRA.'
He said last night that the letter - which he cleared with the Conservative
Northern Ireland area council which he chairs - had produced favourable
responses from a 'significant' number of Tory MPs.
There was further reassurance for Unionists last night when Mr Andrew
Hunter, the pro-Unionist MP for Basingstoke, beat Mr Peter Temple-Morris, MP
for Leominster, for the chairmanship of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland
committee.
In Dublin, a spokesman for the Irish government said it was prepared to make
a written commitment to downgrade its territorial claim to Northern Ireland
to an 'aspiration' as part of an overall settlement package.

FT  10 DEC 93 / European summit heads for discord over Gatt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
European leaders gather today for a two-day summit likely to be disrupted by
internal rows over the cost of the world trade deal now within sight.
Further tensions are expected to surface in the debate on how to tackle the
continent-wide unemployment crisis, and over a white paper on jobs and
growth prepared by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission.
The summit is likely to expose an ideological fault line in the EU, based on
the degree of labour market deregulation necessary to create jobs and the
cost of infrastructure investment needed to make Europe more competitive.
On Gatt, the 12 member states must accommodate French insistence that its
farmers will not have to take more land out of production to meet the
requirements of a new world accord on subsidised food exports.
This has pitted Paris against Bonn, which is also resisting French demands
that the EU puts in place trade defence mechanisms as tough as those of the
US.
France's hard line has encouraged other member states such as Portugal,
Greece and Spain to put pressure on their partners for compensation over
shortcomings in the likely Gatt accord on textiles, maritime transport and
Mediterranean farm produce.
Belgium, which holds the rotating EU presidency, will push hard for a
commitment to act on the conclusions of Mr Delors' white paper. 'There is
quite a lot of agreement on the orientation; the debate will centre on the
financing of it,' a senior Belgian official said.
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, is expected to try to paint Mr Delors'
blueprint as a free-spending, interventionist recipe. But other British
officials at the summit played down the likelihood of confrontation and
described the white paper as an intellectually respectable document.
Another source of contention is Mr Delors' proposal for the EU to spend up
to Ecu20bn (Pounds 15.2bn) a year to the end of the century as a catalyst
for heavy pan-European investment in roads, rail, energy, environment and
advanced information networks. The projects are to be funded partly through
new European Union bonds amounting to Ecu8bn a year.
Britain may get backing from Germany to oppose the new bonds, but French
officials predicted that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would support the scheme on
the basis of a yearly review. The budget-conscious Dutch have already
signalled support.
In London Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, attacked Mr Delors' plans,
saying there was no evidence of the need for EU borrowing for infrastructure
improvements across Europe.

FT  10 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: LIG
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having lavished much time and money on building up its photo-processing
business, London International Group has concluded that its disposal is now
essential. That complete reversal of strategy highlights the financial
depths to which LIG has sunk following its unexpected Pounds 5m half-year
loss. With increased borrowings of Pounds 154m supported on shareholders'
funds of just Pounds 109m, LIG badly needs to raise money. The additional
cash costs of its drastic rationalisation programme will have to be funded
from selling toiletries brands.
LIG's plight has been compounded by the alarming deterioration in its health
and personal products business, where operating profits have slumped from
Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 3.5m. But it now transpires that the comparable
half-year's figures were boosted by special factors not previously
disclosed. The devaluation of the pound created a Pounds 3m windfall profits
gain on foreign currency holdings. LIG also booked Pounds 2m from the
release of surplus provisions. It seems astonishing LIG did not reveal such
important factors at the time.
The more prudent accounting practices now adopted would have depressed last
year's profits by a further Pounds 2m. But even so, it is hard to comprehend
the severe slide in the division's underlying profits on 3 per cent higher
sales. The 20 per cent fall in LIG's shares yesterday was a rather muted
response.

FT  10 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: North West Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
North West chose a sensitive moment to part company with Mr Bob Thian, the
chief executive who left unexpectedly a fortnight ago. With the regulator
poised to set price limits for the second half of the decade, and a
portfolio of international contracts now stretching from Malaysia to Mexico,
a firm hand on the tiller would be comforting. This is all the more so since
North West's process engineering side has taken a turn for the worse.
Without the benefit of foreign exchange, turnover in this area was lower in
the first half and operating profits halved. After interest payments on the
Pounds 140m cost of acquisitions, the business will do well to cover its
costs this year.
North West may prove more adept at operating water treatment plants overseas
than managing US engineering companies. The risk capital involved in such
projects is also modest compared with the cost of acquisitions. Having
raised equity through May's enhanced scrip dividend to pay for such
investment, though, the onus is on North West to prove that it can earn a
decent rate of return. The tax credit which boosted earnings in the first
half was a direct benefit of the scrip, but will not be felt again.
If North West can avoid trouble overseas, the more immediate risks lie with
the regulated water business. Efforts to scale back capital expenditure
plans should allow it to live with a lower price cap and probably lessen the
risk of a rights issue. Even so, with capital expenditure of around Pounds
500m a year for the next 10 years, North West badly needs a favourable
settlement with the regulator.

FT  10 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Pilkington
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken a frustratingly long time to achieve, but Pilkington appears at
last to be getting a real grip on its business. A further Pounds 30m of cost
savings in the first half has helped reinforce an encouraging productivity
trend. The sale of the Sola spectacle lens business, netting some Pounds
200m, has now cut gearing to a more manageable 67 per cent. And, following a
squeeze on working capital, Pilkington even promises to become marginally
cash positive this year - for the first time since 1989. The doubling of
interim pre-tax profits represents the first tangible fruits of such
developments.
It would even be tempting to grow quite excited about Pilkington's prospects
if the company could replicate its US performance in Europe. A combination
of price rises, volume improvements and cost reductions resulted in US
operating profits leaping from Pounds 2m to Pounds 15m, highlighting the
wonders of operational gearing. Greater sales of higher added value glasses
further gilded the profits rebound. The trouble is Europe shows few signs of
following the same pattern in the immediate future. Severe over-capacity
still undermines Pilkington's attempts to tickle prices higher in the UK.
Despite recovering demand in the UK and the resilience of the German
building industry, sales remain desperately weak. Moreover, Volkswagen's
continuing assault on costs threatens a further downward spiral in
automotive glass prices. Pilkington's shareholders must retain their
extraordinary patience.

FT  10 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: VW's economy drive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite Volkswagen's persistent protestations that it would break even in
1993, the market long suspected there would be plenty of red ink. VW
recently admitted as much, and yesterday raised the estimated loss to
DM2.3bn. Being ahead of official pronouncements is one reason why the shares
were unmoved by the news. Keeping VW's equity at a high for the year might
be justified because the outlook for 1994 is more favourable.
Still, an improved operating performance will come entirely from cost
cutting, as European car sales are unlikely to increase next year. Germany
and Italy, VW's biggest markets, will probably be among the poorer
performers. The strong D-Mark is also a disadvantage for German car makers
in export markets where devaluation has sparked some recovery.
Retrenchment is yielding lower component and labour costs, but VW's need to
standardise components will take years to implement fully. Short-time
working at the main Wolfsburg site is presented by Mr Piech, VW's chairman,
as cheaper than incurring high redundancy costs. Yet that only serves to
emphasise the tightness of his straitjacket. Few believe that all of the
30,000 workers moving to a four-day week will be needed full time once the
cyclical upturn comes. Perhaps Mr Piech is a shrewd judge who knows the
limits to painful change, and thinks that to make yet more workers redundant
would be to lose all co-operation. He may equally have side-stepped the
difficult decision needed to put Wolfsburg on a viable long-term footing. At
present the market seems content to ignore the more worrying signs and give
Mr Piech the benefit of the doubt.

Have the fertile minds from the new issues department of Morgan Stanley
International come up with the 'dog' of the year?
Observer ran the office slide-rule over yesterday's issue of
sterling-denominated zero coupon perpetual bonds. They don't pay interest;
there is no repayment of principal; there is no listing. A question as to
whether the bank would be making a market in the paper after the offer
closes in mid-January merely elicited a giggle. No wonder the underwriting
group is taking no fees.
PS The issuers milking the market on the tightest terms of the year are the
Samaritans, Relate, and the Depaul Trust. The yield is 'a warm feeling' over
Libor (WFOL). Paid semi-annually or monthly? The offer telex doesn't

It's been known for some time that the Royal Academy was looking for an
architect to front its bid to take over the adjacent Museum of Mankind,
which falls vacant in 1996, and turn it into a Museum of Architecture. So
the smart money was always on the next president of the Royal Academy being
an architect.
Few surprises then that Sir Philip Dowson has been tapped to succeed Sir
Roger de Grey as president of the Royal Academy. He is an architect, as was
his close rival for the presidency, Colin Wilson. But whereas Wilson will be
remembered for the unloved new British Library, Sir Philip, one of the
founders of Ove Arup, was responsible for the admired Broadgate development
in the City.
He has one other advantage. At 69 he is an excellent time-filler until the
more flamboyant artists who aspire to be president, such as Allen Jones and
Tom Phillips, calm down a bit.

Who says the Brits revile the notion of a common European currency? A small
group from north London has even commenced lobbying the Bank of England, EU
embassies, and the European Commission with a design for the Ecu coin.
The 'Campaign for Benny Hill's head on the Ecu' advances the dead British
comic as 'the perfect popular non-political continental personality to grace
the face of the Ecu'. His having sent up a number of his fellow Europeans by
dressing up in lederhosen and so forth somehow makes him a 'poignant and
intelligent choice' for the Ecu.
Founder campaigner John Hulme admits the idea was born at a 'slightly tipsy
moment'. But the Danish embassy, at least, seems to like it.
Those convinced that Benny Hill is their man should contact the campaign at
42 Hawthorn Avenue, London N13 4JT, telephone or fax 081-886 8951.

Today's celebration of the construction of the Channel tunnel would not be
complete without an unseemly squabble about how best to celebrate. Observer
hears that the contractors had been given the green light to hire a train to
take a party of revellers (including British Rail chairman Sir Bob Reid)
non-stop from Victoria to the partying on the French side.
All seemed to be going swimmingly at first. BR's InterCity had promised a
luxury express and was confident that its driver could find his way through
the tunnel.
However, when the powers that be at BR heard what was happening, word came
back down the line that the revellers would have to make an unscheduled stop
at Folkestone and change trains. There are no technical reasons for the
disruption. Probably something to do with the wrong sort of publicity,
rather than the wrong sort of snow.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest row bugging John Major's cabinet is at least about a
down-to-earth issue. Board of trade president Michael Heseltine and treasury
chief secretary Michael Portillo have been baiting each other with letters
about maggots.
The wrigglies that fishermen impale on their hooks have been reeled into
affairs of state by Hezza the prezza's approval of the National Rivers
Authority's suggestion that post offices be allowed to sell anglers' fishing
licences. He thought the idea fully in line with the government's commitment
to deregulation, as did environment secretary John Gummer.
Then up popped Portillo with a letter to Heseltine objecting that the
proposal would undercut the trade of the fishing-tackle shops where anglers
now buy their licences along with rods, lines, maggots and the like. For
some obscure reason the chief secretary's commitment to economic liberalism
does not extend to breaking the monopoly of tackle shops.
The prezza seethed, especially since he prides himself on being one of the
few members of the cabinet who has ever bought a fishing licence. Back went
a stinker of a letter informing Portillo that the licence is an annual
purchase. Maggots must be bought weekly.
Whereas tackle shops might be threatened if post offices sold maggots and
such, Heseltine adds, that is hardly in prospect. Hence 'get your hook off
my line and let me get on with running my department'.

FT  10 DEC 93 / The untouchables in the spotlight: Recent cases and an
independent review are putting pressure on the UK's Serious Fraud Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcry over the community service order imposed on Mr Roger Levitt, the
self-confessed City of London fraudster, has thrown the credibility of the
UK's Serious Fraud Office back under an uncomfortable spotlight.
This is not the first bad publicity for the SFO. However, the latest
criticism has come at a sensitive time, as the first independent review of
the SFO's operations, expected to lead to a widespread shake-up, gets under
way.
The inquiry, by a senior Treasury official, will assess the performance and
'value for money' of both the SFO and the division of the Crown Prosecution
Service which also handles fraud cases. At stake is whether the scale of the
SFO's work and budget should be extended by taking over some fraud cases now
handled by the CPS - a move that would appeal to some ministers.
After the review, the SFO could be turned into an executive agency with the
CPS, along the lines of the Benefits Agency or the Employment Service. This
might increase the flexibility of its management, but could raise a question
over the lack of direct parliamentary accountability through the
attorney-general.
At issue in the current review is the SFO's ability to prosecute
successfully the largest cases of fraud and to maintain effective internal
management controls.
Recent adverse media comment over failed prosecutions has struck at its
reputation. 'It is important from the point of view of the City and the
general public that people believe that fraudsters are convicted and
punished appropriately. I suspect that is not the public perception at the
moment,' says Mr Paul Phippen, a partner with City law firm Macfarlanes, who
has experience of dealing with the SFO.
One important episode that tainted its image was its admission that it
mishandled legally privileged documents belonging to the former chairman of
Polly Peck, Mr Asil Nadir, which ended up in the hands of his prosecutors.
The discovery was not only embarrassing to the SFO, but could compromise any
trial of the fugitive businessman.
Whether the Nadir case reflects administrative error or worse is being
investigated by the SFO internally. However, such incidents cause unease. Is
the SFO, set up five years ago by the government to tackle fraud cases that
had proved impenetrable for the police or Department of Trade and Industry,
achieving its aims?
The office, with an annual budget of Pounds 21m, was given unique powers to
investigate fraud under Section Two of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. A
multi-disciplinary internal structure was put in place, intended to bring
lawyers, accountants and police officers together as a team, pooling their
talents.
But disappointment followed initial high expectations. At the heart of the
SFO's difficulties lies its inability to find a general strategy that works
in court - a central part of its original brief. Its conviction rate has
risen steadily to 71 per cent. However, this has resulted largely from a
tactical switch to an increasing use of plea-bargaining. This stems from an
SFO desire, first, to emulate the swift and pragmatic practices of America's
financial securities industry watchdog, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and second, to minimise damage to the office's public face.
So there have been more guilty pleas to lesser offences, where a conviction
is more likely but where sentences have been lighter. Several offenders,
such as Mr Terry Ramsden, the former City dealer in Japanese stocks, have
received suspended sentences, after pleading to reduced charges.
Mr Levitt pleaded guilty to a charge that represented only a small part of
the SFO's case. The SFO was thus left open to the criticism that, as one
involved lawyer said, it had 'bottled out' - a charge that has proved
particularly wounding. Some observers believe it would be better for the
office to be seen to fight and lose than to appear to cave in.
But plea bargaining has not been the only flaw in the SFO's approach. It
foundered at first by mounting prosecutions that were too large, notably the
1991 Blue Arrow trial of seven prominent City advisers accused of
manipulating the stock market. Overturning four convictions, the Court of
Appeal attacked the year-long trial.
Keeping proceedings short and sharp, as commentators urged, did not prove
more successful. The final Guinness trial, of US lawyer Mr Thomas Ward,
which lasted just three weeks and never touched upon the share-support
operation at the centre of the 1986 Distillers takeover scandal, was a
failure for the SFO. Mr Ward was acquitted.
Mr Phippen, commenting on such cases, said: 'The SFO appears to be left in
an uncertain state as to its strategy.' The loss of authority has had
damaging consequences, he added. 'Defence lawyers need to feel that there
are serious risks for their clients in fighting SFO prosecutions. At the
moment, most defence lawyers are optimistic that, if they keep fighting,
they will get a result in the end.'
However, many barristers agree that the SFO faces several problems not of
its own making. Few High Court judges have enough experience of criminal
trials and juries to try complex fraud cases properly, they argue. Lawyers
support the growing calls from the bar for a formal plea-bargaining system
to be set up to ensure fairer - at times less lenient - sentencing.
Despite their partial support, many lawyers join some police in pointing to
the weakness of the SFO's multi-disciplinary structure. In the Polly Peck
case, for instance, complaints about a breakdown of teamwork were
vociferous. 'The atmosphere became so bad that lawyers weren't talking to
the police and there were no regular conferences,' says one insider. 'We
were facing a 'them and us' atmosphere when we were meant to be working on
the same teams.'
Mr George Staple, the SFO director, acknowledges that 'in some cases
teamwork does work better than in others', and remains convinced that the
basic principle is sound.
One constant criticism levelled by outsiders concerns the quality of the
SFO's permanent staff of 20 senior lawyers - 'the talent problem', as one
criminal solicitor in private practice puts it. 'George has a problem,' he
says. 'If we hire someone who turns out to be no good, we can fire them. All
George can do is resort to the traditional civil service solution of
sidelining them.'
Mr Staple insists the general level of ability inside the Office is high.
Those inside the SFO point out that the accountants and barristers called in
to advise include some undeniably heavyweight names.
The SFO can point to some successes. First, the three-pronged organisation
appears to work effectively in its use of accountants, as the investigations
into the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International and Mr Ramsden
indicate. City of London police admit that, before the SFO was set up,
budget constraints would have meant far fewer accountants being used.
Without such back-up, investigations would have been less intensive and
prosecutions on a smaller scale.
Second, the removal of a suspect's right to silence under Section Two of the
Criminal Justice Act 1988 has led to more guilty pleas at an early stage,
prosecution and defence lawyers agree. Parallel powers enabling the SFO to
seize documents have also permitted banks to co-operate with investigators
because their obligations to respect client confidentiality have been
overridden.
Despite its far-reaching legal weapons, only the expansion of the SFO would
give it the 'critical mass' needed to carry out its tasks efficiently, Mr
Staple believes. He would probably welcome a recommendation by the review
that the SFO take over the largest Crown Prosecution Service cases.
The other main option under review is to bring the SFO into the CPS to
operate as a 'discrete unit' - thus avoiding the administrative problems of
having two bodies.
Whether either development would alleviate public worries is unclear. What
is certain is that the final report, to be passed to the attorney-general in
February, will not be published, so there will be little opportunity to
debate its findings. Nor will its contents have any impact on the SFO's
greatest public test - the trial of Robert Maxwell's two sons and four
others over the disappearance of millions of pounds in pension funds,
scheduled for next autumn.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Reform boost for Whitehall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government has been subjected to mounting criticism over its
programme of civil service reform. Numbers of civil servants have been
rising, the market-testing programme has made disappointing progress, and
measures to open top jobs to outsiders have been watered down. Some critics
have concluded that reforms have been undermined by the opposition of senior
Whitehall mandarins and ministerial weakness.
Yesterday's announcement that the government is stepping up the pace of
privatising executive agencies is therefore welcome. Over 90 agencies have
now been established, delivering a wide range of services from the payment
of benefits to the registration of patents. Another 44 candidates have been
identified, and by the end of 1995, four out of five civil servants will be
in agencies. The creation of agencies has been a success story, with
improvements in service and a new focus on the job to be done. But it has
become an end in itself which has preserved largely intact the Whitehall
machine.
Many agencies perform functions which could be privatised, such as the
payment of wages and scientific research. Others could be put under
commercial management in the same way as the Atomic Weapons Establishment at
Aldermaston. In local government, public services are routinely provided by
the private sector - even in sensitive areas such as the collection of
council tax and the payment of benefits. A greater use of private provision
in central government could provide similar benefits in efficiency and
quality of service.
Civil service departments are supposed to examine alternatives such as
privatisation and contracting out before each agency is established and at
regular intervals thereafter. In only one case so far has the outcome been
privatisation. The message coming out of the Cabinet Office yesterday is
that the examination of alternatives will henceforth be more rigorous.
Departments will be required to consider privatising agencies much more
thoroughly before renewing their mandates. More important, companies which
think they could take over agency activities or manage them more effectively
are to be encouraged to bring forward their proposals. The premium will be
on innovation and value added, rather than on simply taking over the
existing civil service organisation and making it work better.
Whether this initiative produces the potential benefits will still depend on
the enthusiasm of top mandarins for radical change. They may remain
reluctant to cede parts of their empires to the private sector. However, the
freeze on civil service running costs imposed in the Budget should encourage
a new realism in Whitehall's top echelons. Permanent secretaries now face a
period in which scope for pay rises will depend entirely on their ability to
find efficiency savings. With 'more for less' the rule for the next three
years, the civil service will find the help of the private sector essential.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Euro-plugs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Young, when trade and industry secretary, remarked that Europe would
truly have one market when it used one electric plug. Now that just such an
idea is under study in Brussels, it is turning out to be less
straightforward than it seemed. With Labour party support, UK plugmakers are
out to scotch proposals for a standard Euro-plug, claiming it would be
dangerous and would eventually require Pounds 20bn to be spent re-wiring
homes throughout Britain.
But British readers should pause before complaining to their MPs about
another piece of Euro-lunacy. There are practical advantages to
harmonisation. The European Commission estimates that scale economies would
enable Euro-plugs to be made for only one tenth the cost of the moulded
plastic plugs which UK law will soon require electrical equipment
manufacturers to fit to their products in the factory.
There would be further savings for electrical equipment makers, which have
already standardised many of their products and are increasingly
concentrating European production in fewer plants. Their freedom to match
supply to demand would be increased if they no longer had to juggle with 20
different plug standards. Meanwhile, cross-border shoppers would be spared
the chore and safety risk of changing plugs on electrical products when they
got them home.
The issue is not the desirability of this nirvana, but the difficulty of
attaining it. Since fitting suitable Euro-sockets would be practical only in
new houses or when re-wiring existing ones, the change-over would be
lengthy. If new products were wired to Euro-plugs as standard, they would
require special adaptors to work in existing sockets. That would involve
some inconvenience. UK plugmakers say it would also be unsafe, as consumers
would be tempted to stick Euro-plugs directly into British sockets.
How real that risk would be is debatable. It does not appear to apply to the
18m foreign tourists who visit British every year. Like many of the
plugmakers' arguments, it smacks of special pleading. Rather than welcoming
harmonisation as an opportunity to sell throughout Europe, they seem more
concerned with the threat it poses to their existing markets, where the UK
standard has limited competition.
Nonetheless, the affair poses a genuine conundrum. Harmonisation makes sense
in a Europe where crossing national frontiers is becoming increasingly
routine for both individuals and businesses. Yet, experience suggests that
attempts to standardise banal but highly visible items such as plugs often
provoke the fiercest popular resentment about bureaucratic meddling from the
centre. In such cases, the challenge for proponents of standardisation is to
mount a persuasive case that inevitable short-term dislocation is outweighed
by the benefits, many of which may only be realised over the longer term.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Dumping Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US has consistently told its partners in the Uruguay Round that it would
rather reach no agreement at all than reach a bad agreement. Yet as the
negotiations reach their climax in Geneva, it is beginning to look as if a
bad agreement is exactly what is in prospect - thanks, ironically, to a
barrage of last-minute demands by the American administration.
For all the progress made by the US and European Union in settling their
differences in recent days, it is a stiff enough challenge to produce a
universally acceptable agreement by the deadline of December 15. Now the
task looks like being further complicated by controversy over Washington's
insistence on a significant weakening of multilateral restraints on its
ability to impose anti-dumping duties. More than that: if the other Gatt
parties bow to the US demands, they might vitiate many of the gains that the
Uruguay Round was supposed to yield.
Anti-dumping actions - against imports alleged to be sold at below cost -
are a poison eating away at the liberal trading system, and the US has long
been the principal, though by no means the only, culprit. The calculations
by which goods are found to have been dumped are often highly questionable,
and dumping actions are less often a just redress than a particularly
insidious form of protectionism. One of the more laudable features of the
Gatt text now being finalised - the so-called Dunkel draft - was its attempt
to tighten the rules regulating how anti-dumping actions could be brought.
What the US seems intent on is a wholesale reversal of that effort. Not only
has it demanded the abandonment or dilution of all the Dunkel restrictions;
it has made further proposals that would actually make it easier for
aggrieved parties - including trade unions - to bring anti-dumping actions.
To avoid the perceived danger of circumvention, it wants the power to impose
duties on 'like goods' from third countries without further investigation.
It wants to be able to impose duties indefinitely, rather than having to
prove dumping afresh after five years. It rejects rules allowing exporters
to charge below-cost prices for a limited start-up period. It objects to
Gatt panels re-evaluating evidence in anti-dumping cases.
Small wonder that many exporting nations who feel victimised by existing US
rules are up in arms. If its proposals were implemented to the letter, the
already easy task of 'proving' dumping would be rendered almost automatic,
thus producing the mercantile equivalent of a witch hunt. And where the US
led, others - especially the EU, under pressure from France to stiffen its
own anti-dumping regime - would follow.
Rather than undermining the potential achievements of the Round, the US
should be taking the lead in curbing anti-dumping. If it presses its current
demands, it risks being held responsible either for failure or for an
agreement that would be a lot less worthwhile.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Personal View: More jobs, the same interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN FELDSTEIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European governments can stimulate demand and increase employment even if
German interest rates remain high. Any country can increase spending on
business equipment and construction without reducing interest rates and
therefore without the possible inflationary consequences of currency
devaluation that might accompany lower interest rates. Moreover, such a
stimulus need not increase the budget deficit and national debt.
The key to stimulating capital investment is an investment tax credit (ITC)
financed by higher taxes on business profits. An ITC is easy to implement
and is effective as a stimulus to investment. The US has used an ITC to
stimulate investment on several occasions and a substantial amount of
research has shown it to be quite effective.
The simplest form of ITC reduces a business's tax liability by a percentage
of the firm's spending on eligible investment. For example, with a 10 per
cent investment tax credit a company that spends FFr1m on eligible
investment reduces its tax obligation by FFr100,000. Eligible investment
could be defined narrowly (eg, restricting it to equipment) or broadly
(including all construction). Taken by itself, an ITC would reduce the
government's tax revenue and increase the budget deficit. But it could be
financed by a higher tax on business profits without reducing its
effectiveness.
Although a typical business might pay the same total tax as it would without
the ITC, the shift in the structure of the tax system would provide a strong
incentive to spend more on new investment. The increased corporate tax is
essentially a tax on profits of prior investments while the ITC is a subsidy
for new investment.
Indeed, an ITC's impact on a company's incentive to invest is very similar
to the effect of lower interest rates. Either change makes prospective
investments more profitable: the ITC reduces the initial cost of the
investment, and the lower interest rates reduce the annual cost of servicing
the debt. The ITC rate could be set to provide the same effect on the
profitability of investments as an interest rate reduction of, say, 2
percentage points.
By using an ITC, each government can tailor its policy of stimulating
interest-sensitive spending to its own domestic circumstances. The
acrimonious debates about easing German monetary policy in order to serve
the needs of other European countries would become unnecessary. Because of
reunification, the German situation is different from the situation in other
countries.
Even if it were not, German citizens and the Bundesbank are entitled to
pursue a more vigorous anti-inflation policy than others if that is what
they want to do.
I have emphasised the feasibility of substituting an ITC for a reduction of
interest rates because of the manifest distaste of several European
governments for lowering interest rates and for the accompanying decline in
the currency value. But such a substitution is not satisfactory when the
country has a trade deficit as well as a demand deficiency at home. When the
country's external account is in balance, though, an ITC has the advantage
of providing a domestic stimulus without weakening the demand of foreign
countries and without imposing a trade deficit on the country's trading
partners.
One technical point should be noted. An ITC, like any fiscal stimulus, will
only be effective if it is not offset by higher interest rates and an
associated currency appreciation. A country that adopts an ITC should
therefore adjust its monetary policy to maintain unchanged short-term
interest rates.
There is finally the more fundamental question of whether European
governments should try to deal with the unemployment problem by increasing
demand. It seems clear that most of the dramatic rise in European
unemployment rates over the past two decades cannot be attributed to a lack
of demand. Reducing that unemployment requires greater flexibility in the
level and structure of employee compensation. Any attempt to reduce the
unemployment rate by demand stimulus alone would lead to an explosive
increase in wages.
Nevertheless, some stimulus to demand may be warranted. Countries differ and
the amount of stimulus that is right for one may not be right for another.
To the extent that increasing aggregate demand is warranted, an investment
tax credit financed by an increase in other taxes can be a desirable
alternative to a reduction in interest rates.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Respect for the elderly: The influence of the independent
Bank of Italy on its centenary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Behind his desk, Mr Antonio Fazio, governor of the Bank of Italy, has placed
an oil painting of the martyr Saint Sebastian being pierced by arrows.
Mr Fazio, who took over as governor six months ago, jokes: 'It reminds me of
all the agonising problems I face.'
However, this week the 57-year-old expert in monetary theory is momentarily
casting aside his problems to celebrate, along with some 40 other central
bank governors, the centenary of the Bank of Italy.
The bank, which started life as a joint stock company and which only became
the sole bank of issue in 1926, has reason to celebrate.
Its imposing structure in the heart of old Rome was conceived as the
'strongbox of unified Italy'. This is what it has been, and still is: the
one institution in modern Italy to have preserved its dignity and
reputation. Alone during the recent wave of corruption scandals, the bank
has stood aloof and untainted.
In tribute to the bank's special status, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor
for 13 years, was chosen as prime minister in May. He was accepted as the
sole figure with the necessary authority and impartiality to govern Italy in
a difficult period of political and economic transition.
Since the early 1980s, by agreement with the government, the bank has
gradually divorced itself from the Treasury, so that today its independent
status is similar to that of Germany's Bundesbank.
Today, both formally and legally the governor decides interest rates and is
not obliged to underwrite the Treasury's financial needs. 'Monetary
financing of the treasury has been abolished, de facto since 1990 and by law
just a few weeks ago,' says Mr Fazio. The government, he insists, is at
arm's length. 'No representatives of the government participate in the
bank's decisions on monetary policy, nor do these decisions require formal
ratification by the government.'
The moves towards independence reflect the trend in European central
banking. But in the Bank of Italy's case, independence also represented a
deliberate distancing of itself from its role in the 1960s and 1970s under
Mr Guido Carli (1960-75) and Mr Paolo Baffi (1975-79) when the bank acted as
adviser to the government. Mr Carli in particular saw the bank as a clearing
house for power struggles between members of the nation's ruling class,
according to economic historian Prof Vera Zamagni.
The price of such influence was that the bank became the scapegoat in 1979
for a credit scandal in state industries which led to politically-inspired
judicial prosecutions. Mr Baffi, the governor, and his deputy, Mr Mario
Sarcinelli, were forced to resign. Although both men were subsequently
exonerated in full, the incident bruised bank morale.
But if 'divorce' from the treasury has brought independence, that has not
necessarily been translated into greater authority outside the spheres of
monetary policy and banking supervision. 'It is by no means certain that
independence is synonymous with influence,' says one senior member of the
bank.
During the last government of Mr Giulio Andreotti from 1989-92, the Bank of
Italy had a free hand with monetary policy and ministers accepted its strict
adherence to fixed exchange rates in the European exchange rate mechanism,
despite protests from industrialists. Yet no amount of advice from Mr Ciampi
about the public sector deficit and the increasing mountain of national debt
had any effect on the politicians who controlled fiscal policy. As prime
minister, Mr Andreotti never had a single formal meeting with Mr Ciampi in
three years.
In contrast, first with the government of Mr Giuliano Amato and then with
the Ciampi administration, the relationship has been both warmer and more
constructive. Mr Fazio, for his part, has not been intimidated by the
prospect of lecturing his former boss. The 1994 austerity budget, he
recently told parliament, does not go far enough in attacking the deficit.
This could well be a point of conflict with future governments.
Mr Fazio sees the bank as having a strong educative function in economic
policy, using the full resources of its large research department. Arguably
this is the most important economic think tank in the country and working
there has become a compulsory rite of passage for bank high fliers. The bank
always housed a wide intellectual range and never discriminated against
marxists. Today, the prevailing flavour may be monetarist but labels are
disliked.
Mr Fazio is a devout Catholic who, for a central banker, is surprisingly
open about his social conscience. He has been outspoken on unemployment.
'The objectives of the Bank of Italy reflect the ultimate goal of defending
the external and above all the internal value of the lira in a setting of
orderly economic activity and growth. For Italy, in particular, this means
defending the economically vulnerable and protecting savings,' he says.
So far the new governor has had an easy ride on foreign exchange policy with
the lira floating since September 1992. He is not prepared to hazard the
future. 'As regards the lira's floating, the problem is not so much deciding
on the lira's re-entry into the ERM at some stage, as deciding what that
mechanism is or should be.'
Critics fault the bank for complacency over its own remarkable record that
allows officials to live too much in an ivory tower, and not sufficiently
attuned to the fast-moving world outside. The bank was, for instance, stung
by criticism that it should have foreseen and prevented the collapse of the
Ferruzzi empire, Italy's second biggest private company, because of the
information on its central credit register.
But the bank has made an important contribution the development of modern
Italy, especially after the second world war. And, as Italy now moves
towards a general election early next year and the disappearance of an
entire political system, an added burden falls on the bank to ensure
financial stability and economic continuity.
The governor himself occupies a unique position in Italy being the sole
institutional official not directly appointed by the government and whose
term of office is indefinite. This means Mr Fazio could be the only
institutional figure to span the full period of the transition: an
uncomfortable position for the governor of the bank whose role in economic
policy was described by his predecessor, Mr Carli, as like 'driving a car
with only an accelerator and a brake'.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Why the west must support the role of
women in Russian politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms LESLEY ABDELA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your correspondent, Leyla Boulton, writing on women in Russian politics
('Few ladies in red', December 4/5), highlights a truly critical factor the
British and other western governments should be taking seriously and putting
money into - namely, the manner in which women throughout the former Soviet
Union and satellites are being shoved out of politics and civic life to a
really startling degree.
Over the past year I have been putting on workshops for women would-be
politicians in central Europe from Bucharest and Budapest and Brno and
Warsaw to Prague, for Harvard University's Project Liberty. A fortnight ago
we put on a two-day workshop in Prague on 'handling the press and media in
the post-totalitarian era'. Our workshop presenters included Gemma Hussey,
former Irish cabinet minister, Bernadette Vallely, director of the Women's
Environmental Network, Dr Jara Moserova, a Czech MP and former Czech
ambassador to Australia, the BBC's impressive local 'stringer', Zdena Tomin,
and me, as the founder of the all-party 300 Group for women in politics and
public life in the UK.
The weekend was incredibly successful. We need to repeat such events at
least six times a year in each of the central and eastern European
countries. But it is harder for Project Liberty (because, I presume, we are
energising, educating and training women for democracy) to get decent
funding than the proverbial chimera to prod a western government in the
place it matters - the pocket not the rhetoric.
How come we can subsidise tobacco growing in regions where they would be far
better off growing food crops for under-nourished populations, yet Project
Liberty and the marvellous resources it can call on from trainers in the UK
and the Irish Republic and US has to look like it is begging?
Without women taking a full civic role in central and eastern Europe we and
our children will have a thousand Bosnias to watch on television for decades
to come.

FT  10 DEC 93 / On a wing and a prayer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Church of England, established by law, gains no advantage in Heaven from
its association with the Crown of the United Kingdom. I discerned this by
listening to Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, then Bishop of Masasi, some 30
years ago. His concern, while we walked together in the hot African dust,
was the salvation of mankind as an act of worship of God, not a free pass to
visit the prime minister or the Queen.
Since those heady days I have been a consistent disestablishmentarian. The
case for separating the British state from its official church is best
argued on its merits. These have been considerable since . . . let us say
since attendance at public worship ceased to be compulsory. In a week in
which parliament has ceded the sabbath to Mammon, by allowing virtually
unrestricted shopping on the seventh day, the case seems overwhelming.
Christian ayatollahs may have been in the ascendancy in a quasi-theocratic
state when Queen Elizabeth I assumed the title of Supreme Governor of the
church, but that was nearly half a millennium ago. Queen Elizabeth II may
well be the last to hold this purely nominal office.
None of the above has anything to do with the personal life of the Prince of
Wales. That is an after-dinner topic - unavoidable, but not serious. It is a
phase through which we must all pass before growing up. The national mind
has been drugged by the ingestion of too many tabloids. Give me a lightly
grilled sole, a little spinach and a Havana of reasonable purity and length,
and after devouring the first two I'll puff on the third while competing in
scurrility with everyone else. But that is an abuse of the spirit. Even a
long-standing agnostic like myself cannot be proud of it. We should focus on
the church.
First, let me clear away one further, more fundamental, distraction. I have
argued here before that the British polity would be healthier if the formal
apex of power was the will of the people, protected by a declaration in a
written constitution. That would remove the opportunity open to the
executive to abuse its authority by affecting to act on behalf of the
monarch. Thus democratised, the head of state could continue to wear a
crown, if that is what the populace wanted. This topic, like royal
behaviour, should be detached from the thread of the argument about
disestablishment.
Pause a moment, to tick off what I hope is agreed so far. There is only one
heir to the throne. He is Prince Charles. End of story, although not the end
of gossip. There are many churches, mosques and synagogues in Britain; only
one has been so bound by history in seductive ermine that it is unable to
concentrate on its true religious function, for fear of disconnection from
the political process. Some of its ministers register near panic at the
prospect of being reduced to the status of priests in a minority Christian
sect.
These long-standing fears must be felt all the more acutely at present.
Financial mismanagement has diminished the Church of England's earthly
riches, and obliged its parish clergy to scratch around ever more piteously
for fresh sources of support. The decision to permit women to become priests
has split the church. Some recalcitrants are running off to Rome while
others stay behind in miserable defiance, or plain confusion. An explosive
debate about disestablishment could damage this fragmented church beyond
repair.
We disentanglers can wait. Granted, the present may not be an ideal moment.
Yet the truth is that separation of church and state is proceeding in the
usual English way: by fits and starts. The prime minister, acting on behalf
of the Queen, appoints the bishops - but does so from a short list prepared
by the church. The House of Commons, in which heathens appear to be the
majority, votes on matters such as the ordination of women - but follows the
general synod of the church. The next monarch may be 'defender of the faith'
but not 'supreme governor'. It is progress, but we are still stuck with 26
Anglican bishops in the House of Lords.
None of this changes the essence of the case. That is best put as a
question. At a time when many people, particularly young people, are
searching longingly for spiritual guidance, what on earth are the Anglican
disciples of Jesus Christ doing in their centuries-long embrace with the
descendants of Caesar? Surely not merely preserving their position? It may
be that in the coming century the vacuum left by the materialism of the 20th
is filled by institutions other than the Church of England. True believers,
rising above institutional concerns, should welcome that.
A more enduring future may lie in store for the world-wide Anglican
communion, whose member churches were founded by missionaries who risked
their lives to preach the gospel, or by British settlers in what became the
white Commonwealth, or by America's Episcopalians. There are Anglicans in
India, and in Japan, and of course in the Church of the Province of South
Africa. Most of the world's 70m Anglicans are black Africans. This
international community would be strengthened if its mother church ceased to
be part of the British state. The opposite view is expressed by Michael
De-la-Noy, press officer to the archbishop of Canterbury in 1967-70. In his
recent book, The Church of England (Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 16.99), Mr
De-la-Noy notes that establishment 'provides links with the Foreign Office,
so essential to the Church's dealings with governments overseas'. He must be
right about the institution, but could be wrong about its purpose.
It would be naive to insist that that purpose, which is in essence to
sustain a transcendental view of the universe, can only be served by
volunteers uniting in worship. The influence of both Islam and Christianity
was expanded by the sword. Crusades - and, we must hope, jihads - are,
however, a thing of the past. The task, for some exalted individual, some
doctrine, some institution is to find 21st century ways of keeping human
faith alive. Lambeth Palace, which sits across the Thames in
mock-equilibrium with the Palace of Westminster, does not seem a likely
source of such inspiration. The original 12 disciples would have found the
link incomprehensible. The C of E should float free. It might then save
itself and - who knows? - some of the rest of us.

prices (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Breaking the power duopoly', discussed a number of
options but it appeared to favour referring National Power and PowerGen to
the Monopolies Commission. The justification was based on the popular
assumption that prices in the electricity pool are too high.
Pool prices are not high. In 1990, at less than 2p per unit, they were
absurdly low and my association told your newspaper that unrealistic prices
would damage the emergence of competition. Today, still far below 3p, they
are at best barely adequate. The pool price may not be a perfect market
price but it is vitally important for every company that makes and sells
electricity. Producers must have a reasonable rate of return to stay in
business.
As for the concern that there may be too much generating capacity, for
consumers that is not a problem, but a comfort. There can be little doubt
they like electricity to be plentiful, reliable and reasonably priced. Most
have fared well since privatisation, as the regulator, Professor
Littlechild, stated in his annual report in May.
Britain has a generating industry which in many respects is leading the
world. Producers large and small are investing increasingly in clean and
efficient electricity production. I doubt whether many of them would regard
an MMC referral as helpful to themselves or to the industry's millions of
customers.

<TEXT>
Sir, May I be allowed to moderate your editorial comment ('Breaking the
power duopoly', December 7) that coal-fired power stations 'have higher
running costs than nuclear or gas-fired stations'.
Once a gas-fired plant has been built and 15-year gas purchase contracts
have been entered into on a take-or-pay basis, the avoidable running costs
of a gas station may well be less, particularly where a coal station has
been forced off the base-load duty for which it was designed. The
electricity consumer, however, will undoubtedly pay for the complete costs
of building and running of the gas-fired station, which, as your editorial
implies, simply adds to the 'massive overcapacity' in the industry.
Moreover, the real costs of nuclear are still shrouded in mystery and
provide grounds for much debate.
The running costs of at least some of the old Magnox stations may well be
higher than those of some coal-fired stations, unless we all accept that
long-term contracts (currently unsigned) between two state-owned industries
(Nuclear Electric and British Nuclear Fuels) accurately reflect the
underlying cost structure.
Your editorial shows your awareness of the complexity of the power
generation issues: it would be a pity if your comment about running costs
was accepted without qualification.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Free markets better than political
intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PHILLIP OPPENHEIM MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly might be correct in assuming unfettered and unregulated free
trade may have some disadvantages in the baby milk market ('Sour milk and
apple pie', December 7). But, leaving aside the argument that European
mothers are capable of making their own choices without being nannied by
politicians, are not trade barriers also responsible for many problems?
According to the World Bank, richer countries' trade restraints against
products from poorer ones cost the latter more than they receive in aid.
European quotas on Japanese cars effectively prevent the import of small,
low-cost, economical and low-pollution micro-cars of the type which no
European manufacturer produces. The Common Agricultural Policy pushes up
food prices in a way which disproportionately hits poorer people. Britain's
protection of the indigenous coal industry has exacerbated air pollution and
harmed peoples' health.
The point is that while free markets may not produce perfect outcomes, they
tend to be a great deal less imperfect than intervention by politicians,
however well-meaning.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: French approach to driving through EU
rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY DUNN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While a student at London Business School, I recently completed an
assessment of the French market for company operated cars. Government
pressure in the early 1980s to buy French and a tax system which heavily
favours domestic products leads 80 per cent of French companies to buy only
French vehicles. In the leasing market, the proportion reaches 95 per cent.
The comparable UK figure is about 4 per cent.
As for European Union rules governing state purchases, most French state
organisations contacted expressed little interest in even considering
foreign products. As the French appear to view free trade as distinctly
one-dimensional and EU rules as there to be ignored, just how far should we
go in pandering to the attempted blackmail of France's protectionist demands
in the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations?
Incidentally, am I alone in being unable to recall vigorous French protests
at the jobs to be created by that wicked American cultural import (sic) of
Euro Disney?

Sir, As a writer for the Times of Finance in the United British Kingdom,
Observer ('Dos mio', December 6,) should know that the official name of
Mexico, Estados Unidos Mexicanos, is translated correctly as United Mexican
States, not United States of Mexico.
So, Mexicans have little reason to worry about confusion with the colossus
to the north, except among English reporters who have trouble distinguishing
adjectives from nouns.
If you are trying to fathom Mexican feeling about the US, why don't you
quote Porfirio Dias instead of the wimps who worry about what's in a name?

FT  10 DEC 93 / Arts: 'Poppea' in concert - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This month Londoners find themselves tempted by an extraordinarily rich
spread of concert opera: Berlioz's Troyens at the Barbican, Tchaikovsky's
Iolanta at the Albert Hall, and now, for two performances only, Monteverdi's
Incoronazione di Poppea at the Queen Elizabeth Hall.
Opera-in-concert proves sometimes a disappointment, when score-bound singers
in evening dress seem to do no more than stand and deliver, so that the full
range of the medium seems crudely narrowed. But when heights of expressive
intensity are reached such as those revealed on Wednesday, the form seems to
realise a musico-dramatic ideal - pristine, intimate, all-of-a-piece -
seldom even adumbrated in the opera house.
But then, opera-in-concert is hardly an apt generic categorisation of this
particular event. In common with the splendid evenings of Mozart opera -
Idomeneo, Tito, recently Figaro - masterminded by John Eliot Gardiner and
his Monteverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists in the same hall,
Gardiner's Poppea struck an exact balance between 'staging' (employing here
carefully chimed entrances and exits, platform movement, an elegantly spare
use of chairs) and concert-hall concentration on the music.
In Peter Holman's specially prepared edition (a careful new scrutinising of
available sources) a sparing group of instruments has been prescribed:
strings, continuo keyboards and lutes, two harps, none of the wind-and-brass
sonic aggrandisement that marked Nikolaus Harnoncourt's bloated burlesquing
of Poppea at this year's Salzburg Festival. The double-headed layout of
accompanying forces provided a natural arena for the activity of voices and,
when necessary, bodies; Gardiner, seated on the right, did not so much
conduct as, with an occasional flexing hand, shape and direct the flow of
notes and words.
For this reason, and because the cast was chosen for its ability to focus
pure vocal sound on the 'organic' delivery of the text, it all amounted to a
Poppea faster-moving, more nakedly affecting than any I have previously
encountered. It was still not ideal: I live in hope of one day hearing an
entirely Italian-speaking Monteverdi cast turn the notion of recitar
cantando from studied imitation to full-coloured authenticity. Here that was
most spontaneously demonstrated by the Italian Seneca (the noble Francesco
Ellero d'Artegna), Cupid (the delightful Marinella Pennicchi) and Nurse (the
countertenor Roberto Balconi), and the part-Italian Englishman Mark Tucker
in minor roles.
But the beauty, clarity and prime forcefulness achieved by Sylvia McNair,
exquisitely cool in the title role, Michael Chance (Otho), Anne Sofie von
Otter (Octavia) and Bernarda Fink (who made Arnalta's lullaby the opera's
still centre) were not at all far off the 'real thing'. Dana Hanchard,
handsome of presence, a cultivated musician, proved a shade too clouded of
timbre for a convincing soprano-pitch Nero. Catherine Bott's warm, spirited
account of Drusilla was sometimes intonationally peccable.
Those and other, minor cavils aside, this was an awesome, chastening
occasion. What a terrifying opera Poppea is - musically ravishing,
many-sided, lightning-direct, dramatically pitiless in its survey of human
affections and human ambitions. DG Archiv is recording the show 'live': for
those unable to squeeze into the QEH, either on Wednesday or this coming
Saturday. This will afford some small consolation.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Arts: A first class 'School for Wives' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the still core of Jonathan Kent's excellent new Almeida production of
Moliere's often uproarious 1662 comedy, The School for Wives, is a
beautifully tranquil performance by the young actress Emma Fielding. She
plays Agnes, the girl whom the cynical middle-aged Arnolphe has had reared
in perfect ignorance. He believes that most women are successfully
adulterous because they are clever; and that he will avoid becoming a
cuckold by marrying this girl, of whose lack of cleverness he is assured.
But Agnes, from her window, has seen Horace; the two have fallen in love;
and . .  .
Agnes is not a large role, but Fielding invests her with wonderful radiance
and simplicity. Strength of character, too. ('You can keep someone ignorant
but you can't keep them stupid,' Fielding has remarked about the role in a
radio interview.) When she argues with Arnolphe, her calm common sense has
more force than his energetic duplicity. We are made to feel powerfully that
his selfish schemes are a crime against nature itself. Standing wide-eyed
and speechless at her window (a position which Jonathan Kent makes the chief
motif of his production), she becomes a symbol of true innocence. All those
who loved Fielding's performance as the child prodigy in Tom Stoppard's
Arcadia this year should see her in this role; and one hopes to see her soon
in larger parts.
But so much about this production is marvellous. It is a pleasure, even
before the start, just to look at Peter J. Davison's set. The little French
17th-century two-storey house at its centre, and all that surrounds it, are
a precis of old Paris, in ravishing sub-terracotta hues. Peter Mumford's
lighting makes the different times of day register to fine effect - and,
when rain falls (before the play and throughout the penultimate scene), that
looks gorgeous too.
The play's main role, and the leading agent of its comedy, is Arnolphe. He
is a hilarious oxymoron: a clever fool, a daft cynic, a self-defeating
self-server. Ian McDiarmid (who is, with Kent, the Almeida's joint artistic
director) catches all this in a performance of terrific virtuoso energy. His
dynamic range, the musicality of his pacing, the inventive characterfulness
with which he listens: these become lynchpins of the whole production. A
pity that, as the play proceeds, he goes over the top a few times - notably
when overcome by happy startlement as he listens to Horace's trusting plan
to place Agnes back in his (Arnolphe's) own power. But he always shows that
Arnolphe's character is essentially destructive, and he often makes this
funny - as when, unwittingly, he strangles his two servants; or when he
bangs his own knees together in a spasm of rage.
Kent uses the Richard Wilbur translation, a perfect example of how to make
rhyming couplets (pentameters) wittily urbane without milking laughs from
the rhymes themselves and without sacrificing the sense of basic good
manners that underlies the play. And Kent's direction brings out all the
panache and brio in the play, which runs without an interval for 90 minutes.
If you know Wycherley's The Country Wife (1675), a more thoroughly funny
play, you can see how much it takes from The School for Wives, but Kent
shows admirably that Moliere's play is actually the less cynical and more
humane of the two.
All the supporting roles (with the exception of the notary, overdone by
Charles Lewsen) are delightfully played. Perhaps my favourite feature of all
is Carol Macready's performance as the selfish maid Georgette; I love the
way a scheming smile gradually illumines her fat, silly face, and the
slatternly way she uses a Wolverhampton accent. But no, perhaps my favourite
feature is the thick-rimmed pair of lunettes that Davison has given her to
wear. They come straight out of period French theatre designs, by the way,
and they perfectly give Georgette an air both blinkered and goggling.
At the Almeida Theatre, N1, 071-226-7432. Until January. Sponsored by the
Laura Pels Foundation.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Arts: Inside the palazzos of Venice - Susan Moore examines
two exhibitions of Venetian furniture and drawings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You see them in the conversation pieces painted by Pietro Longhi and his
imitators. Arm chairs and stools with carved cabriole legs, rather French in
appearance, Murano glass mirrors and little bombe commodes, all gaily
painted in a palette of blues, pinks, cream and grey. In reality, 18th
century Venetian painted furniture is much harder to come by. Victims of
poor quality local materials - soft wood such as pine - and the devastating
humidity of the Serenissima, relatively few fine pieces have survived.
It has taken the London-based private dealer Patrick Syz some 15 years to
gather together the small but choice group currently on show in 'The Spirit
of Venice: Three Centuries of Paintings and Furniture'. The exhibition
offers a rare opportunity to marvel at the light-hearted vitality and
flights of fancy of the Venetian cabinet-makers - and at their abysmal
craftsmanship. Open an ill-fitting door and be appalled by the finish - or
lack of it - and the crude and disfiguring locks and hinges. Venetian
furniture is admirable for its effect rather than its execution.
In the hands of the Venetians, the French rococo style was transformed
almost beyond recognition. Once over the Alps, the elegantly swelling bombe
commode took on a distinctly voluptuous, top-heavy line. The extraordinarily
sculptural high-chested tabernacle here, probably made for a private chapel,
knows no flat surface save the faux marble plinth on which to stand a
Madonna.
Armchairs are altogether more accommodating: light in construction,
comfortable and lacking in any pretention. Decoration is more idiosyncratic.
Only rarely does one find the same treatment twice. Trophies of war in rich
lapis blue adorn the more refined of the pairs here. Little bunches of
flowers and ribbons of lace are strewn carelessly across an elaborately
carved and pierced Bordeaux-red mirror frame. Its arms and candleholders are
carved flowers, bells of red, yellow and orange blossoming out from green
stems.
While the French inset porcelain plaques into their grandest pieces, a
corner cabinet here is decorated with faux blue and with Delft with
Chinoiserie figures and birds in landscapes of temples, bridges and willows.
There are no opulent ormolu mounts but gilded pastiglia, a kind of paste
moulded into scrolls and flowers. Once again, the top is faux marble.
The quality of the painting at its best has prompted some furniture
historians to attribute pieces to the likes of Tiepolo and Guardi,
forgetting perhaps that the painters would have belonged to different
guilds. Certainly the outstanding cabinet here seems to have been decorated
after rather than by the painter Zocchi. This is a parrucchiera or lady's
wig chest, its elaborate cartouches painted with charming rustic scenes of
shepherdesses, bird-catchers and fetes galantes. One of the scenes copies a
print by Zocchi. If it were based on his original conception, the scene
would be painted in reverse.
But the exhibition also includes a piece of decorative painting, an overdoor
perhaps, by Giambattista Tiepolo himself. This is a rare doraille - rather
than grisaille - a 'Deborah and Barrach' painted in gold against a dark
ground. In a lighter vein is a caricature of a man holding a tricorn hat,
one of a number of drawings to supplement the show. In pride of place hangs
an allegory of 'The City of Venice Adoring the Christ Child' by that
superlative colourist Veronese. Venice is resplendent in rich brocades, a
beguiling lion crouching at her side.
The spirit of Venice is also manifest at Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox which
presents another select small show, this time of 18th century Venetian
drawings. The larger part comes from the collection of the Duc de
Talleyrand. Even in 20 or so sheets, most aspects of life and art in the
Serene Republic appear, from a large and sparkling Guardi of a regatta on
the Grand Canal and an unusual Canaletto of a market on the Riva degli
Schiavoni, to Giandomenico Tiepolo's bold comedies of manners.
For sheer technical brilliance, Giambattista Tiepolo's draughtsmanship is
second to none. Two studies for ceiling frescoes are thrilling examples of
what one authority has dubbed his flying pen.
No Venetian drawings show seems complete without a Punchinello from the
Commedia dell'Arte. He is to be found in Novelli's fine pen and ink drawing
of a Venetian masked ball, sporting the traditional costume of hook-nosed
mask and sugar-loaf hat and wielding a fork and a pot of the favourite food
of Punchinellos - gnocchi. Both galleries show us works of art worthy of any
museum.
The Spirit of Venice (Syz, 94 Eaton Place, SW1) and Eighteenth Century
Venetian Drawings (Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox, 38 Bury Street, SW1) continue
until December 17

Yesterday at the National Theatre the Association for Business Sponsorship
of the Arts held its annual prize giving, at which companies that had done
their bit, and more, in helping the arts in 1993 picked up polished pieces
of aluminium in recognition. Of course the awards are sponsored, by Arthur
Andersen.
The fact that the Princess of Wales was making one of her diminishing public
appearances was certainly a draw, but this is the occasion when hundreds of
captains of industry mix with hundreds of arts administrators to mutual
gratification.
The winners were: for British art overseas: Rover Deutschland, for backing
the 'Festival of Music from Great Britain' in Germany. For the commission of
new art in any medium: Scottish Hydro-Electric, nominated by the Traverse
Theatre. For corporate programme: Manchester Airport, friend of the Halle,
the Royal Exchange, Opera North, and more. For first time sponsor: Halifax
Building Society, which supports Eureka] children's museum in Halifax. For
increasing access to the arts: BP Chemicals, nominated by Sculpture at
Magam. In recognition of long term commitment: WH Smith, sponsor of English
Shakespeare Company, Glyndebourne, the Poetry Society, Rambert, and more.
For a single project: Guinness Northern Ireland, for the Belfast Festival.
For sponsorship by a small business; Robert Golden Pictures for helping
Opera Circus. For youth: RTZ, ally of the Guildhall School of Music and
Drama.
There are three other prizes. The Elf Award for the arts organisation making
best use of sponsorship went to Book Trust (nominated by Forward Publishing)
while the Arthur Andersen award for Business in the Arts adviser of the year
was won by Lorraine Trainer of the London Stock Exchange for her work at
Serpentine Gallery. The Times Critics Award went to the Donmar Warehouse.

Elgar's Introduction and Allegro, Vaughan Williams' Fantasia On Christmas
Carols, and Holst's Planets Suite (7.30).
That is followed by The Rebirth Of Nationalism presented by Robert Wistrich:
'The half baked theories of chauvinist intellectuals have percolated to the

FT  10 DEC 93 / Arts: 'The Nutcracker', in disguise - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Well, here it is again. Wearing a comic mask and pretending to be different
 -'What, me? A Nutcracker? Oh, no, I'm something completely new]'. The
answer to all of which is, of course 'Nuts]'.
But at least the thing has made an effort with its disguise. Matthew
Bourne's Nutcracker was created for his Adventures in Motion Pictures
troupe, and I reported on it from last year's Edinburgh Festival where it
was part of an Opera North double bill including (as in the first staging in
1892) Tchaikovsky's opera Iolanta. It is a merry transformation for this
season of goodwill - though my own goodwill towards Nutcrackers is about the
same I would offer to one of those ostrich-sized deep-frozen turkeys that
lie menacingly in supermarket freezers.
Bourne's witty trick is to transpose the action to an orphanage, run by the
vile Dr Dross. His wife is matron - one having the heart-warming charm of
Stalin. Their children, Fritz and Sugar, are spoiled brats. The orphans are
pathetic, and Bourne gets theatrical mileage from the sincerity with which
his cast conveys this. Clara (played with tremendous sincerity and gusto by
Etta Murfitt) is the leading orphan, and her love for the Nutcracker (more
Chippendale toy-boy than toy) is shown as a piece of Mills and Boonery:
despite setbacks, she gets him at last.
The staging is everywhere resourceful. Bourne's orphanage is a nicely grim
location for a grotesque party, which is well worked out to the music. The
mouse-battle is a dormitory pillow fight; the snow-scene a skating party in
which Ally Fitzpatrick's Sugar (Sonia Heinje to the life) appropriates the
Nutcracker-hunk (Andrew George). The second act Kingdom of Sweets is a
collection of noxious goodies - liquorice, marshmallows, three belligerent
punk gob-stoppers - which Bourne handles very well. And after the final
duet, which has celebrated the union of Sugar and the Nutcracker, Clara
awakens back in the orphanage, and we are given a happy ending as she finds
the Nutcracker in her bed, ready to elope with her.
So far, so amusingly good. The acting abilities of AMP respond well to
Bourne's demands; the staging is lively, agreeably sardonic, and looks
delightful in Anthony Ward's clever designs; the smaller dance numbers (in
which Nutcracker abounds) are jolly revisions of the hallowed old routines.
I missed, though, choreography to respond to the two greatest moments in the
score, the snow-flake waltz and the grand pas de deux. Bourne misfires with
both. The skating party in the snow has a cursory air. The grand pas de deux
has always had music wholly unlikely for its purpose - the final celebration
in a children's ballet. We hear Tchaikovsky at his most hauntingly
melancholic and, as we now know, at his most personal. Roland John Wiley has
identified the metric shape of the descending scale (which is the melodic
device of the duet) as following exactly the prayer 'And with the saints
give rest' which is part of the Russian Orthodox funeral service. Wiley
points out that as Tchaikovsky worked to complete the score - with some
difficulty - he heard of the death of his beloved sister. The gravity of the
music is explained, and it demands the choreographic nobility that Ivanov
gave it in the first production. Bourne is too frivolous, his dancers not
grand enough.
These objections apart, the staging is a happy one, given with enthusiasm by
its cast. The young may be taken to it with certainty that they will be
entertained. The score, in Rowland Lee's sensitive edition, is well played
by the New London orchestra.
The Nutcracker is at Sadler's Wells Theatre until December 18. Production
sponsored by The Kobler Trust.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Technology: Worldly wise in half a second - Trafalgar House
has united its staff with an electronic global office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies have to move quickly to stay profitable. They also need to be as
international as their clients. It was these pressures which spurred
UK-based Trafalgar House Engineering to streamline its world operations by
building 'electronic corridors' - high-speed computer networks - to link
employees in 38 offices across 12 countries.
Since September, all the company's sites have been operating as one global
office. As a result, Trafalgar House is able to offer its customers shorter
working times on new projects - through concurrent or simultaneous
engineering (with different stages worked on in parallel rather than in
sequence) - and match the worldwide scope of their businesses.
The global office system (called Join), which runs on standard computers,
gives staff at far-flung sites a versatile set of tools for working
together. From an on-screen menu, they can select facsimile, electronic
mail, computer-to-computer data transfer or a central database. A number of
sites also use videoconferencing.
'The system enables us to exchange information as if we were communicating
with someone on another floor of our building,' says Graham Hill, general
manager for oil and chemicals at the Melbourne, Australia, office of John
Brown Engineers and Constructors, the industrial plant unit of Trafalgar
House Engineering.
The idea was born two and a half years ago when the company was looking for
a way to differentiate itself from competitors. It realised that it could
win more business from multinational companies if it could act for them
anywhere in the world.
It was in a favourable position to do this, because two years ago, after the
acquisition of Davy Corporation, the ill-fated engineering contractor, it
had 182 sites, some quite small. By contrast, most of its rivals had a small
number of very big sites. The problem was that although Trafalgar House
Engineering had 25,000 staff in all, the different sites were like
individual companies with individual characteristics.
The solution was to use information technology to enable staff to work in
'virtual teams' - separated by distance but working as if under one roof.
Strong backing came from Ian Robinson, Trafalgar House Engineering's chief
executive, and Ted Bavister, then deputy managing directory and since
retired.
The first hurdle the company faced was that some of the technology it needed
did not exist. To fill the gap, it identified a number of suppliers moving
in the direction it wanted to go. And it started to develop new products
with them. For example, with 3Com, the US computer networking company, it
has developed a form of advanced data compression enabling data to be sent
through the Join network more quickly and cheaply.
Helped by Oracle of the US, it has developed a large relational database
that can handle concurrent engineering. Called Engines, it gives all
engineers on the Join network access to the latest information on the
projects in which they are involved. They can call up word-processed reports
and drawings created using computer-aided design (CAD) software.
Together with the database, Trafalgar House is using an electronic document
management system developed in-house. With this, an engineer in, say,
Bangalore, India, does not need a copy of the Cad or word-processing
software used in London to view a document created there. 'This approach has
saved us a lot of money in software licences,' says Jim Noble, head of IT on
the engineering side.
The database also makes 24-hour working possible. For example, an engineer
in London can check and correct the work of a colleague in Houston using
'redlining' (a form of on-screen annotation) while the engineer in the US is
asleep.
'Recently,' says Hill, 'we were doing the designs for a plant in Pakistan.
Our client contacted us one day at 4pm saying he wasn't clear about a
technical detail. That night, we sent an E-mail message to an expert in
Houston asking him to look at the design and annotate it on the system. His
comments were waiting for us the following morning and we had an answer back
on the Singapore-based client's desk before he got into work.'
Other benefits of the database, which has cost Trafalgar House more than
Pounds 10m to develop, include:
Lower travel costs. Experts anywhere in the world can contribute to a
project and are less likely to have to relocate. Reduced project costs.
'Concurrent engineering allows projects to be completed more quickly,' says
Noble. 'We managed to shave 20 per cent off the cost of developing one
plant.'
Fewer mistakes. Join includes an 'expert system' which can automatically
follow a set of rules. For example, it can be made to draw supports on every
pipe relative to its size and length. This saves time and reduces errors.
Closer links with customers. Clients are seeing the benefits of Trafalgar's
concurrent database and want it themselves. Time-to-market is critical for
Merck, the big US pharmaceuticals group. So it is using the Trafalgar system
for concurrent plant development. The database helps it to write the initial
specification and check that the project is going according to plan.
Another benefit, according to Hill, is that sites which are remote feel
closer to the main office in London. The speed of the network helps to
maintain the illusion. The Join network responds within half a second, even
between London and Melbourne. 'Any longer and users would not feel they were
in the same office,' says Noble.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Technology: Green innovation takes centre stage - Moves to
create US export markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During 12 years of Republican rule, it was a maxim in Washington that the US
government's job was to obliterate industry regulation so that the market
place could work its magic.
The Clinton administration disagrees. Carol Browner, the environment
protection chief, argues that strong standards at home will force industry
to flex its creative muscles and that in turn will make it more competitive
abroad.
The US was the first nation to regulate stringently electric power plant
emissions with standards for new boilers in the 1970s. American
manufacturers dominated the market for scrubbing technologies until Japan
and Germany adapted tough standards of their own, according to the US
Commerce Department.
There were other departures from 'old thinking' available when Ron Brown,
the commerce secretary, and Browner recently announced an environmental
technologies export strategy. The administration was leaving behind decades
of debate over industrial policy which has confined government efforts to
'an ideological box', said Brown.
The US government-industry partnership will go beyond the handing out of
billions of dollars a year in research and development grants; the
administration is also 'reinventing' a government structure which better
serves its private-sector 'customers'.
An Environmental Technologies Trade Advisory Committee will provide advice
on expanding environmental technology exports to the highest levels of the
administration, while the federal government also works with local
companies, associations and interested groups to form regional environmental
export councils around the country.
An interagency Trade Policy Co-ordinating Committee will identify markets,
create export marketing plans and set up 'one-stop shops' which will gather
and disseminate data about export markets. Four regional one-stop shops will
open next January in Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago and Baltimore.
The Environmental Protection Agency will promote and accelerate
private-sector commercialisation of environmental technologies. It says it
will restructure its regulation to reward rather than penalise users of
innovative technologies rather than promoting reliance on existing and
widely accepted products.
Mexico - where Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4bn-Pounds 4.6bn) is to be
spent on environmental clean-up in the coming years - will be the first
target of the export strategy.
The current global market, worth Dollars 200bn-Dollars 300bn for
environmental goods and services, Brown said, would soar as high as Dollars
600bn by 2000. Although the US could capture 'a significant piece' of the
market, it faces intense competition from Japan and the EU, whose industries
are 'backed by a range of co-ordinated and focused government programmes'.
Bill Haney III, one of the founders of Molten Metal Technology of Waltham,
Massachusetts, sees 'extraordinary opportunity' in the initiative and notes
striking changes in US philosophy. 'Historically, the executive branch
thought environment and economic development were antithetical,' he said.
'Now, it is understood that the US needs a leading edge in regulation to
lead the industry. As we try to meet standards, we'll create new products.'
He was also struck by the 'self-confidence and greater sense of mission'
among presidential appointees, who are working together to maximise US
competitiveness - in this case the commerce, energy and environmental
agencies. There is no sign of the ego problems, turf wars and power trips
which plagued past administrations. Founded in 1989 by a group brought
together by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Molten Metal designs
and builds plants to recycle hazardous wastes into usable products. It has
150 employees and expects to double that number next year.
Haney said the company has numerous opportunities in the US, but Mexico,
which wants to leapfrog to the cutting edge on environmental clean-up, is
'the most exciting new market in the world'.
Joan Gardner, head of Applied Geographics of Boston, has a two-year-old
company with 10 employees. The company creates digital environmental maps
used by utilities, planners and local governments.
After visiting Mexico City with a state trade mission, she has entered a
joint venture with Grupo Gutsa and Northwest Water of the UK to maintain and
improve part of the city's sewer system.
She is impressed with the administration's support for small businesses. 'We
knew there was a market out there, but we didn't really appreciate the
breadth of it,' she said. 'This permits us to become part of the team.'

Anyone used to driving along bumpy country roads could be grateful for an
infra-red device which monitors steering and vibration and adjusts the car's
suspension to compensate.
Developed by the independent design consultancy Sira for Renault, the French
car maker, the device measures the distance the wheel is turned and the
speed. It then instructs the car's management system to adjust the
suspension accordingly. Because the mechanism uses light it should last
longer than mechanical measuring devices. Sira: UK, 081 467 2636.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Less scary body scanners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traditional medical body scanners have often proved terrifying for small
children, as the patient has to be transported into a tunnel. Patients wired
up to life support systems, the obese and the claustrophobic have also had
problems.
A breakthrough in magnet technology has now enabled Siemens to develop a
magnetic resonance imaging scanner which is open at the sides, removing many
of the problems.
The Magnetom Open uses a 'C'-shaped magnet which curves over the patient's
body rather than a circular magnet. Developments in the gradient coils,
which create the smaller magnetic fields, and the radio frequency equipment
which transmits the information, have also contributed to the open shape of
the scanner. Siemens: Germany, 9131 840; UK, 0344 396326.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Dusty answer for plastic card
fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest way of preventing plastic card fraud involves littering the card
with dust particles during the production process.
Developed by Inkode of Virginia, Washington, and marketed by NBS, of
Byfleet, Surrey, the process involves dropping tiny quartz rods, each with a
reflective coating, into the plastic.
Although invisible to the human eye, the randomly distributed particles can
be 'seen' by radio signals emitted from a scanner.
Because the distribution of the particles is unique to each card, the
identity of the card can be verified by passing it within 30 metres of the
radio transmitter. Inkode: US, 703 276 8000. NBS: UK, 0932 354242.

Companies are increasingly happy to outsource their information technology
requirements. However, contrary to popular perception, they did not
outsource core facilities but peripheral ones, according to the latest
report, 'UK IT Outsourcing Survey: 1993', from the PA Consulting Group. The
report surveyed 230 UK organisations, 74 per cent of which had outsourced
some of their IT provision. On average only 10 per cent of their IT budget
was spent on outsourced services.
Although 55 per cent of the companies cited cost savings as a main reason
for outsourcing, 30 per cent said there had been none. In some cases costs
had even risen. PA: UK, 071 730 9000.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Management: Sir John, get rid of those ties - Lucy Kellaway
speaks to an image consultant about the dress sense of Britain's captains of
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When you cross your legs are there two inches of flesh between where the
socks end and the trousers begin? Do you polish your shoes only when you
notice they are scruffy? Do you hang your suits on wire hangers? Is your
hairstyle the same as it was 10 years ago?
If the answer is yes to most of these questions you need help. That is the
view of Mary Spillane, founder of CMB Image Consultants, who has made a
living over the last 10 years telling British men how to look better. She
has encouraged the bosses of the former nationalised industries to cast off
their cheap suits made from indestructable fibres. She is now hard at work
encouraging British Rail managers that executives of go-ahead private
companies do not wear ties that end mid-belly.
British businessmen generally - and not just those who are being smartened
up to be sold off - are beginning to take care about the way they look. Yet
according to Spillane, surveys still show that British businessmen are
regarded as the worst dressed in Europe. It is not just vanity that is at
stake: looking good is said to be an important first step to getting the
job, doing the deal and winning the debate.
She believes the sartorial style of John Major, the UK prime minister, sets
a bad example. She was horrified to see him recently wearing his first
double-breasted suit, which he evidently did not know how to do up. 'There
was then a hysterical dance by the leader of the country looking for his
buttons.'
Despite Major's recent conversion, double-breasted suits are out, she says.
So, too, are white collars, which decapitate the wearer, and stripey shirts,
which are too hard on the eye.
The guiding principle is that businessmen should be more conscious of what
they wear, should consider their audience and the effect they want to have
on it and should dress explicitly with that in mind.
Yet just giving their appearance a bit of thought does not mean they get it
right. The Financial Times asked Spillane to comment on the appearance of
some of British industry's most notable dressers, and found that she was
often less than impressed.
Sir John Harvey-Jones, former chairman of ICI, is perhaps the most notorious
dresser in business. He has become almost as famous for his ties and for his
flowing locks as for his oft-repeated views on the ills of British
management. Yet Spillane describes him as a 'complete mess' and is horrified
by his wayward hair, the flecks of dandruff on his collar and his crumpled
suits. She recommends that he change his shampoo, grow his hair longer so
that he can wear it in a pony-tail, and buy a trouser press. She also
strongly urges him to do something about those ties. 'His personality is
larger than life and he does not need the stupid ties.' He can still wear
fun ties, but the gardenias flapping around his neck should not arrive
before he does.
Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, another well-known dresser
with his jazzy sweaters and his shirts open to the waist, does not know
where to stop, argues Spillane. She applauds the casual sweater he wore for
negotiations with British Airways, as it sent out the message that Virgin is
the antithesis of the other airline, more user friendly, more trustworthy.
Yet to address the conservatively clad Institute of Directors in
shirt-sleeves without a tie was going too far. 'It was a very arrogant
gesture. His message would have been stronger if he had shown more respect.'
While she thinks it appropriate that his unconventional approach to business
should be reflected in casual dress, she quibbles with his taste. 'The poor
chap is colour blind. You see him on TV and what he is saying is gripping
but you can't listen. Your eyes are drawn down to that catastrophe of a
sweater.'
Alan Sugar, chairman of Amstrad, is not an establishment business figure and
his appearance seeks to get the idea across. He sports a beard, which is
still regarded as an act of defiance by a captain of industry. Sugar's
facial growth is deemed beyond the pale by Spillane. 'Because it is so
multicoloured, it looks dirty, as if he still has Marmite and cornflakes in
it.' The cut-away collar and the big chunky knot also come in for
disapproval: 'They are very 1970s.' She thinks that for someone who has been
through difficult times and who has needed the support of shareholders, a
cleaner image might have been better.
John Birt, director-general of the BBC, is trying to bring about a
management revolution at the corporation and deems the best way to present
himself for that delicate task is in an Armani suit. The publicity
photographs sent out by the BBC show him looking dapper, fashionable in an
understated sort of way. Spillane thinks his ties are fantastic: 'They show
he knows it's 1993.' She also likes the soft European shirt, which is
perfectly matched by his European suit.
Yet far from giving Birt high marks for general appearance, she thinks the
photograph lies. 'He looks marvellous in the pictures, but when you see him
standing up he looks like he is in a bin liner covered in wrinkles.' She
advises him to give each suit a two-week holiday in between outings to let
the fabric rest.
The option of an Armani suit is not open to Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman
of Marks and Spencer who is more or less obliged to wear the same M&amp;S suits
he sells to the average British businessman. Spillane thinks the look is
'presentable' yet notes that the single button on his jacket strains over
his stomach. She does not like the way his handkerchief has just been
plonked into the breast pocket and thinks the average paisley tie would be
appropriate 'for a guy going nowhere'. For greater authority, in keeping
with his status, she recommends a plain, woven silk tie, set off by a
patterned handkerchief.
Robin Leigh-Pemberton (now Lord Kingsdown), the blue-blooded ex-governor of
the Bank of England, sports expensive hand-tailored Savile Row suits with
trousers that begin just under the armpits. 'He has no waist. He should
never be caught without his jacket on. His suits are very heavy, far too
heavy for today's heated offices and do not drape well. To Europeans his
image says stuffy, dated, boring.'
Yet not everyone gets torn apart by Spillane. She thoroughly approves of
Lord Hanson, the chairman of the Anglo-American conglomerate. He looks the
'quintessential businessman' with his trim suits, hand-made shirts, double
cuffs and cuff-links. His tie and handkerchief complement each other, but
never match. Yet not all the credit for this pleasing effect goes to his
tailor nor even to his colour sense. 'You have to think of the raw material
you start with. There's a great body under there.'
There is a message here for businessmen in general. Looking better may not
be about throwing out the old wardrobe and starting again. 'If most British
businessmen went on a treadmill three times a week, the clothes they have
would look much better on them,' she says.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Management: Square pegs in round holes - Re-engineering does
not always fit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contrary to all the hype surrounding the subject, most 're-engineering'
projects fail to create much improvement in the financial performance of the
organisations which introduce them - sometimes it even gets worse. This is
in spite of the considerable impact which re-engineering often has on
individual 'business processes', in terms of both cost reduction and
productivity improvement.
The reason for this apparent paradox is that most re-engineering projects
lack breadth, depth, or committed leadership by senior executives - even all
three.
These are the main conclusions of a study of re-engineering projects in 100
companies around the world carried out by three consultants from the New
York office of McKinsey &amp; Co, Gene Hall, Jim Rosenthal and Judy Wade.
Of 20 companies which the consultants studied in depth, many cut the cost of
their redesigned processes by between 15 and 50 per cent. But only six
achieved total cost reductions of above 13 per cent in the business unit
concerned; the highest was 22 per cent. Even these better efforts created,
at most, a marginal rise in pre-tax earnings.
As one of their 'five keys to a successful redesign', the consultants say
that chief executives of organisations with re-engineering projects need to
commit between 20 and 50 per cent of their time to them.
In its indictment of narrowness, shallowness, and lack of leadership, the
study reinforces existing evidence that, because of all the hype, the term
're-engineering' is being mis-applied by many companies.
First, it is being attached to the design of narrow activities within
individual departments or 'functions'. One example given by the consultants
is accounts payable. By contrast, the originators of the term intended it to
be applied only to broader processes which span several departments, such as
order generation and fulfilment, in which billing and payment are only small
components.
Second, the study underlines the danger of seeing re-engineering as a
shallow, isolated exercise, rather than combining it with other elements of
'change management'. The consultants itemise - albeit in rather an odd order
 -six so-called 'depth levers' which must also be changed: people's roles
and responsibilities; measures and incentives; organisation structure;
information technology; shared values; and skills.
Reporting on their study in the latest issue of the Harvard Business
Review*, the consultants single out three companies as model re-engineers:
AT&amp;T, Banca di America e di Italia, and Siemens Nixdorf Service. In all
three cases, senior executives not only set ambitious goals, but
restructured every element of the organisation.
By contrast, the McKinsey team cites a European commercial bank which
expected that a redesign of some of its back-office activities would cut its
process costs by almost a quarter. The actual reduction was only 5 per cent,
and pre-tax earnings rose by a scant 3 per cent.
The reason was not only that the bank had overlooked many back-office
processes, but also that back-office costs represented only 40 per cent of
its total costs. 'The process had been too narrowly defined,' the
consultants comment.
Apart from committing large amounts of the chief executive's time, the
consultants' other 'key steps' to successful re-engineering include the
setting of aggressive performance improvement targets for the entire
business unit concerned, not just for one or two individual processes within
it.
They conclude that the problem is that most executives think they can
accomplish everything 'with a memo and a slick video of the CEO talking
about the need for change'.

FT  10 DEC 93 / The Property Market: When values diverge - The Queens Moat
Houses case has called surveyors' methods into question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The widely divergent valuations produced recently by two firms of surveyors
on the assets of Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, have triggered
questions about both the regulatory processes of surveyors and the very
nature of their profession. The answers may be a long time in coming.
The Queens Moat Houses accounts for the year to December 31 1991 show a
valuation of the company's property portfolio by surveyors Weatherall Green
&amp; Smith of Pounds 2bn. The delayed 1992 accounts - released at the end of
October - show a revised figure from Jones Lang Wootton of just Pounds 861m.
It appears that Weatherall had produced a draft valuation for 1992 presented
to QMH's banks of Pounds 1.86bn, before recommending a final figure of
Pounds 1.35bn. JLW produced a draft figure as low as Pounds 640m, before
settling on the Pounds 861m accepted by the board.
While the full details have yet to emerge - and may never be made public -
it appears that both firms of surveyors delivered their 1992 estimates
within months of each other, were asked to prepare their valuations on the
same open market basis, had the same information from which to work, and
were asked to base their analysis on the state of the market at the same
date: the end of 1992.
In other words, two large firms of surveyors had come up with such widely
different values on the same properties that QMH had to settle on values in
its accounts that fell by Pounds 1.14bn between 1991 and 1992.
The notes to the accounts state: 'The current directors consider that they
do not have a sufficient understanding of the 1991 property valuation to
enable them to provide a full explanation for the decline in the property
values.' The auditors qualified the accounts on the same grounds.
Rather stronger language has come from others - not least from some
shareholders in QMH, who have threatened legal action and attempted,
unsuccessfully, to reject the 1992 accounts.
Mr Jerry Acher, head of audit and accounting at accountants KPMG Peat
Marwick, says: 'It calls into question the whole approach to valuations.' Mr
Clive Lewis, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, is
even more strident. 'The valuations were an enormous banana skin,' he says.
'The very size and measure makes it hard to get your mind around, and makes
it such a public interest. I do not believe the profession can sit idly by
when you get a QMH (situation).'
Many agree with these views, and welcomed Mr Lewis's statement shortly after
the QMH accounts were published that the institution would investigate
swiftly to consider whether there was a case for disciplinary action.
But when the Department of Trade and Industry announced that it would be
appointing inspectors to conduct an investigation, the institution delayed
its own examination indefinitely. There appears to be no legal requirement
for it to do so, although, traditionally, most professional bodies have
withdrawn once the DTI has become involved.
The result is to defer scrutiny of the conduct of the two firms and of the
far wider question of the methodology of surveyors when making property
valuations. The DTI's conclusions are unlikely to emerge within less than
two years, and the institution will probably not intervene in the QMH case
in the meantime.
This example is one of a handful of high-profile cases considered by the
surveyors' own body, none of which appears to have led to public reprimand
or clarification of the usefulness of valuations.
For example, during the takeover of Scott's Restaurant of London by BS
Group, a Bristol-based stadium group, in 1990, Baker Lorenz valued the
Scott's properties at Pounds 6.43m. De Morgan &amp; Co, which was commissioned
by minority shareholders in BS, arrived at a figure of Pounds 2.3m. The
institution concluded: 'The difference between the amounts of the two
valuations is wholly attributable to a difference in valuation opinion.'
Mr Lewis says that, in the past, the assets valuation standards committee
has been able to rap knuckles on occasions, but it is only since a change to
the bylaws in 1991 that valuation matters can be referred to the
institution's disciplinary committee. This process has yet to be tested.
Assuming there is no misconduct in the QMH case, that leaves open the
question of whether surveyors' valuations have any meaning, particularly
during a recession. Mr Len Baker, head of the valuation department at Erdman
Lewis, the surveyors, says: 'I have been valuing for 30 years. I have never
found it as difficult as in the last two. There is so little by way of
reliable transactions. It is much more into the realm of pure opinion.'
Mr Ron Paterson, technical partner at accountants Ernst &amp; Young, says:
'Valuations depend on there being a market which you can use. In the last
two years it has all been more hypothetical than real (because of the
recession). In the absence of transactions I don't know how the surveying
profession deals with the issues. Accounts should be about recording what
you have done. You're wasting your time if you put in valuations.'
Mr Lewis set up a working party on valuations, which will examine
methodology and is due to report by early March next year. But he says:
'There are lots of different ways you can go about valuing. There is no way
of satisfactorily putting them into words.'
At the start of this week, the British Association of Hotel Accountants made
its own contribution to the debate with a statement of recommended practice
on valuations, which strongly advises the use of discounted cash flow based
on future income. But this already represents best practice in the
profession, and the association's officers admit that it leaves considerable
scope for professional judgment.
It is this judgment that KPMG's Mr Acher questions. He argues that, when
surveyors examine investment properties and similar assets with a steady,
predictable income, their figures are credible.
The problems begin when they attempt to examine future cash flow, capital
expenditure and profit figures, which are vital for properties such as
hotels. 'Surveyors don't necessarily possess all the right skills,' he says.
'The valuer ought to receive these figures signed off by an accountant. We
don't see that happening. The accountants and the surveyors ought to get
together to issue guidance.'

FT  10 DEC 93 / People: Sinclair to co-ordinate Europe at Dell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dell, the world's fastest growing computer company, is reorganising its
European business as it evolves from youthful entrepreneur to sophisticated
multinational business.
Bruce Sinclair, European vice president, has been given charge of all Dell's
sales, marketing and service operations in Europe. A new team of seven
country managers, including Michael Swalwell in the UK, will report to him.
He says the move is designed to streamline and co-ordinate the company's
European activities which had become fragmented and inefficient. While
planning and treasury management were carried out at the company's
headquarters in Austin, Texas, Europe had become a number of small,
separate, businesses reporting to the US.
Sinclair joined Dell in 1988 to launch Dell Canada, which had become that
country's fastest growing company by 1991. He was appointed vice-president
of Europe 18 months ago.
Before Dell, he had been chief executive of Harris Systems, the electronics
and semiconductor concern. Denis O'Kelley, formerly with Digital Equipment
and Burroughs (now Unisys), has been appointed first vice-president of
European customer service and Philippe D'Argent, formerly managing director
of Dell France, has been appointed vice-president, European marketing.
Dell was formed in 1984 by Michael Dell, then 19 years old, on the then
revolutionary premise that personal computers could be sold by mail order
backed by telephone service.

Tesco, the UK's second-biggest grocery retailer, has appointed John Gardiner
(above), chairman of the Laird Group, as non-executive deputy chairman.
Gardiner, 57, who has been on the TESCO board for five years, joins the
existing part-time deputy chairman Victor Benjamin.
The move is thought to be aimed at ensuring a smooth handover when Benjamin
reaches the retirement age of 60 in two years' time. It will also strengthen
the representation of the non-executive segment of the board.
Gardiner has plenty of experience in the boardroom. After six years as a
journalist on the Financial Times' Lex column in the 1960s, he joined the
Industrial Reorganisation Corporation for two years. At 34, he was appointed
chief executive of Cammell Laird, which later changed its name to the Laird
Group. He added the position of chairman in 1987.
He has been a non-executive director of corporations including British
Airways, British Leyland, British Shipbuilders, Cambrian &amp; General
Securities, ICL, Courtaulds and MAI. He has also been a part-time member of
the board of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, a member of the National
Enterprise Board, the South Bank Theatre Board, and the Council of the Open
University.
Gardiner is currently a non-executive director of Enterprise Oil, PowerGen
and the Securities and Investments Board, and in September was appointed
chairman of the School Teachers' Review Body.

FT  10 DEC 93 / People: Lasmo's board now two short
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Rees, a former chief secretary to the Treasury who celebrated his 67th
birthday yesterday, is to step down as chairman of Lasmo, the struggling UK
oil company, after the next agm in May 1994.
Lord Rees, who was brought on to the board for his political contacts, has
been chairman since 1988, during which time the company has more than
trebled in size. However, its rapid growth, culminating in the Pounds 1bn
acquisition of Ultramar in 1991, has coincided with falling oil prices.
The departure of Lord Rees is the latest of several changes in Lasmo's
boardroom over the past year. Last January Chris Greentree, who had run the
group for more than a decade, was replaced as chief executive by Joe Darby
who joined in 1989. In October Lasmo announced that it was replacing its
finance director, Michael Pavia, but has yet to do so.
Over the past year Lasmo's shares have underperformed the stock market by
more than a third, and during the past two the company's stock market
capitalisation has halved to Pounds 860m. There is a growing concern in the
City that the company might not be able to maintain its reduced dividend and
a feeling that Lasmo's board needs strengthening if it is to regain the
confidence of institutional investors.
Pavia leaves the company at the end of the year and Darby says he hopes to
have a new finance director in place by the end of the first quarter. 'We
need a fresh face, who is known in the City,' Darby said yesterday. He hoped
that Lord Rees' replacement would be named before the end of March.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Free-for-all unlikely on Sundays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Partial deregulation of Sunday shopping will mean more stores opening on
Sundays but is unlikely to lead to a free-for-all.
It is likely to be mainly larger, out-of-town stores which open. With many
leading grocery chains - including Sainsbury's, Tesco, Safeway, Asda and
Gateway - already opening between one-third and three-quarters of their
stores in defiance of the law, the overall number is not expected to
increase significantly.
The difference may be more marked in the stores sector. Marks and Spencer
has refused to open any of its stores in England and Wales on Sundays, but
said yesterday that it would be forced to open in some areas to avoid losing
market share. John Lewis Partnership and Sears also said they would have to
review their policy.
If the Sunday trading bill becomes law next year it will leave one important
anomaly.
A store of slightly less than 280 sq m (about 3,000 sq ft) would be allowed
to open freely, while a slightly larger one selling a similar range of goods
would be restricted to six hours.
All shops larger than 280 sq m will be allowed to open for a continuous
period of up to six hours between 10am and 6pm. They must, however, observe
certain rules, including notifying their local authority 14 days before they
plan to open, and displaying their permitted opening times.
There are maximum fines of Pounds 5,000 for failing to notify the authority
and for trading longer than six hours, and of Pounds 500 for failing to
display the opening hours.
Some categories of outlet, such as pubs, petrol stations, and restaurants,
are not restricted to six hours and can open at any time.
Shops in Scotland, where Sunday trading is fully de-regulated, will continue
to enjoy the right to open at any time.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Small traders warn of death by de-regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, CHRIS TIGHE and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Owners of small shops warned yesterday that thousands could be put out of
business by partial de-regulation of Sunday trading.
Mr Morton Middleditch, chairman of Open, a group which represents 10,000
small shops, said Wednesday night's vote was a 'bleak evening for the
independent sector'.
He said competition from multiples had put more than 10,000 small shops out
of business in the 1980s and the closure rate was likely to increase if
de-regulation became law.
Mr Ronnie Dunbar said he intended to continue Sunday closing at R. Dunbar's
grocery, greengrocery and hardware shop, in Sandyford, one of Newcastle upon
Tyne's inner areas. He refuses to be awed by the combined power of
Tyneside's concentration of multiple retailers.
His window display evokes the days before big supermarkets, with its white
paper doilies, pyramids of tins and baskets of shiny red apples.
'I don't think the little shops are going to fade away as fast as the big
supermarkets would like,' said Mr Dunbar.
R. Dunbar has been in the family for 50 years and has outlived every other
shop in the area. Once this corner of Newcastle had six butchers, a wetfish
shop and cobblers; all have gone. Successors include sandwich bars, a video
shop and a poodle parlour.
Mr Dunbar's main competitor is not the supermarkets, but the VG shop on the
next street corner, which opens on Sundays. 'I work six days a week, long
hours,' he said. 'That's enough for me.'
A few doors along Starbeck Avenue Ms Karen Southall and her partner Mr Gerry
Noonan of Feasts Delicatessen also close on Wednesday afternoons - 'in line
with Ronnie' - and all day Sunday. The couple see no benefit in opening on
Sundays.
Ms Southall would have preferred total deregulation, for personal reasons,
so she could have more choice of shopping on Sundays, her only free day.
On Merseyside, Mr Ian Gentles has opened Ian's Foodstore in Oxford Road,
Crosby, from 9am to 6pm on Sundays since the local Sainsbury's started
Sunday opening a year ago.
He takes only as much in the full day as he once did in three hours, but he
and his wife Betty are now on a seven-day week. They have not had a holiday
since their honeymoon 32 years ago.
Mr Gentles fears that Kwik Save's new supermarket in Waterloo, half a mile
away, will feel obliged to enter the Sunday fray against Sainsbury's. If
Iceland Frozen Foods, a few hundred yards from Kwik Save, joins in, life
could become very tough indeed.
When Mr Gentles started in Oxford Road in 1960 at the age of 20, there were
six other small grocers within a mile and a half. They have all succumbed
since Sainsbury's opened in 1981.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Councils fear extra demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
District and metropolitan councils, which will have to police the new
shopping regulations, yesterday reacted with concern to the decision by MPs.
The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities welcomed the
decision to put Sunday trading on a 'more clearly defined legal basis', but
said councils would have to meet extra demands.
The cost of the partial de-regulation option has been estimated by the
Institute of Public Finance at between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m - but the
extent of the impact will differ from authority to authority.
The Local Government Management Board said that trading standards
departments would need extra funds to police the new regulations. But the
government would not meet the cost, it added.
Extra income from car parks and parking meters would have to be balanced
against extra costs from increased pressure on street cleaning, trading
standards and parking.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Defeated MPs lick their wounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opponents of Sunday shopping were nursing their bruises yesterday and
dreaming of reversing in the Lords Wednesday's defeat or during the
line-by-line committee stage.
'To tell the truth, we are all feeling a bit gutted this morning,' said one
of the key organisers of the Keep Sunday Special Campaign.
Mr Ray Powell, the Labour whip who ran the Commons end of the campaign, met
retail and church supporters yesterday to discuss resistance to the
successful six-hours option.
Keep Sunday Special is unlikely to make a final decision about tactics until
after a meeting next week, but it appears to have two options, neither of
them promising.
The first would be a guerrilla campaign during the bill's committee and
report stages.
The aim would be to toughen protection for workers who are unwilling to work
on Sundays, and possibly to reduce the permitted opening time for big shops
from six hours to four.
But amending the bill may be difficult because the government will not allow
a free vote on employment issues.
In addition the campaign's retail supporters now accept that they will have
to open on Sundays to protect market share. They may be unwilling to support
employment-protection measures which would increase their costs.
The second option would be an attempt to reinstate the Keep Sunday Special
option in the Lords. The Lords have the right to amend the bill, but are
highly unlikely to do so as it was a government manifesto commitment, and
both the principle and the six-hours option were approved by big majorities
in the Commons.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Sunday bill creates size anomaly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wednesday night's vote in the Commons for partial de-regulation of Sunday
trading sweeps away the restrictions of the 1950 Shops Act and will allow
all shops in England and Wales to open legally for at least six hours on
Sundays.
But if the Sunday trading bill becomes law next year it will leave one
important anomaly. A store of slightly less than 280 sq m (about 3,000 sq
ft) would be allowed to open freely, while one just above - whose range of
goods may be no bigger - would be restricted to six hours.
All shops larger than 280 sq m will be allowed to open for a continuous
period of up to six hours between 10am and 6pm. They must, however, observe
certain rules, including notifying their local authority 14 days before they
plan to open, and displaying their permitted opening times.
There are maximum fines of Pounds 5,000 for failing to notify the authority
and for trading longer than six hours, and of Pounds 500 for failing to
display the opening hours.
Some categories of shops, such as pubs, petrol stations, and restaurants are
not restricted to six hours but can open at any time.
Shops in Scotland, where Sunday trading is fully de-regulated, will continue
to enjoy the right to open at any time.
The winning option, put forward by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, avoids
many of the complications that would have arisen from the strict regulation
option put forward by Retailers for Shops Act Reform and the Keep Sunday
Special Campaign.
Opponents of wider Sunday opening have claimed that the partial
de-regulation option is in fact a thinly disguised version of total
de-regulation. Retail experts, however, say the six-hour restriction will
limit the opening of larger stores by making it unprofitable for many of
them to do so.

FT  10 DEC 93 / MPs deplore Pounds 20m waste of NHS cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grave concern over the waste of at least Pounds 20m on computer projects in
Wessex Regional Health Authority was expressed by the Commons public
accounts committee yesterday.
Its report refers to evidence of conflict of interest, concealment of vital
information, and 'grave shortcomings in management and financial control and
accountability'.
The Wessex authority, the National Health Service management executive and
individuals including Mr John Hoare, the authority's former general manager,
and Sir Robin Buchanan, until recently its chairman, are all criticised.
By the time the region's ambitious computerisation plans were abandoned in
1990, says the committee, at least Pounds 43m had been spent 'with little
return' and the authority accepted that Pounds 20m or more had been wasted.
The report refers to a 'near obsessional belief' in the
information-technology plans.
Much of the blame is attached to Mr Hoare, described as 'a man with a strong
vision, and such a determination not to be deflected off course, that he
presided over a series of actions incompatible with the handling of public
money and without regard to clear evidence that the project was going badly
wrong'.
Mr Hoare later left the authority with a Pounds 111,940 severance payment.
The committee notes that he was entitled to this under his terms of
employment, but says it is 'astonished that no disciplinary action was taken
against him'.
The report, coming soon after another from the committee on mismanagement in
West Midlands Regional Health Authority, brought opposition calls for
government action. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, called on Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, to announce disciplinary action. Mr
John Denham, Labour MP for Southampton Itchen, called for the removal of Sir
Robin from his present position as chairman of the NHS supplies authority.
Ministers stress that management controls in the NHS have been tightened
since the Wessex and West Midlands cases came to light.
A working party is considering ways of strengthening corporate governance
and reinforcing public-service values.

FT  10 DEC 93 / David Mellor delivers petition to Downing Street against a
hospital closure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Former minister David Mellor (right) delivers a petition against a hospital
closure to Downing Street yesterday. The boxes handed in by Mr Mellor and
actor Dinsdale Landen were destined for the Department of Health, protesting
against a plan by Mr Mellor's former cabinet colleague Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, the health secretary, to close Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton,
London. There has been a fierce local campaign to save the hospital - which
has pioneered plastic surgery and the treatment of burns. Mr Mellor's two
children were born at the hospital which is in his Putney constituency. A
report in October by the South West Thames Regional Health Authority
suggested Queen Mary's should lose its in-patient services and accident and
emergency department, in effect making it impossible for it to survive

FT  10 DEC 93 / Car chief sees small sales rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford, the leader of the UK new-car market, yesterday forecast only modest
growth in demand next year with registrations expected to rise by about 4.5
per cent to 1.85m.
Ford does not expect the UK market to recover the ground lost during the
recession for at least five years. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of
Britain, forecast an increase in new-car sales to 2.1m in 1998 from 1.78m
this year.
UK new-car sales peaked at 2.3m in 1989, then plunged to only 1.59m in both
1991 and 1992. Registrations have risen by about 12 per cent this year.
Car sales to fleets (operators of 25 cars and above) remained relatively
stable during the recession at about 630,000 a year, said Mr McAllister. The
recovery depended on retail and small-business customers coming back into
the market.
Mr McAllister said Ford hoped to win more customers in the south of England
particularly.

FT  10 DEC 93 / BMA says some hospitals allow fundholder patients to jump
queues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than four in 10 hospitals allow patients of GP fundholders to jump
queues for treatment, says a survey of 247 hospitals by the British Medical
Association.
In the Wessex health region, 67 per cent of hospitals admitted giving
priority to patients of fundholders, whereas less than one in five hospitals
in north-west England entered special arrangements.
Mr John Chawner, chairman of the BMA's central consultants and specialists
committee, said: 'Doctors throughout the country are committed to NHS
treatment on the basis of need - and this survey raises serious issues about
whether the present arrangements are making this top priority.'
The survey shows 42 per cent of 'fast-tracking' hospitals gave priority to
GP fundholder patients routinely as part of contract negotiations.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Ford unveils credit card to rival GM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford has joined forces with Barclaycard to enter the UK credit card war,
following its rival Vauxhall's entry to the market in October. Ford already
issues credit cards in the US.
Ford's approach is two-pronged. It will issue Ford-Barclaycard credit cards,
available from April next year. It will also forge a link with Barclaycard's
existing customer-loyalty programme, giving Barclaycard holders the chance
of discounts on Ford cars from January.
The Ford-branded credit cards, available as Visa or Mastercard, can be seen
as a direct response to Vauxhall's GM Mastercard and Visa, to be issued from
January. Both work as normal credit cards, but heavy spenders can earn
rebates on new cars: 5 per cent of each transaction is given back as points
towards rebates of up to Pounds 600 a year (maximum Pounds 1,800) with Ford,
and Pounds 500 a year (maximum Pounds 2,500) with Vauxhall.
The difference with Ford's scheme is that it will not be necessary to have a
Ford-branded card to participate. About 3m of Barclaycard's 8m customers are
already registered with its Profiles scheme, which gives one Profiles point
for every Pounds 10 spent. Points currently buy gifts from a catalogue, but
from January they can also be used towards buying a new Ford. Cardholders
not registered with Profiles will be invited to join.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, predicted that the first car
bought at a discount using the Barclaycard scheme would be on the road by
the end of January. About 250,000 existing Barclaycard holders already have
enough points for a Pounds 600 rebate.
The Ford card has two disadvantages compared with the GM card. It will
charge an annual fee of Pounds 10 (waived for the first year), whereas GM
has no plans for a fee for its card. Secondly, the interest rate for
Barclaycards is higher, at 1.585 per cent a month, compared with GM's 1.53
per cent.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Rover car output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover has raised car output this year with an increase of 5.2 per cent in
the first nine months and a jump of 25 per cent year-on-year in the third
quarter, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showed
yesterday, Kevin Done writes. The company is virtually alone among European
carmakers in achieving an increase.
The company has shown strong growth, albeit from a small base, in some of
the main continental European markets, where it is starting to benefit from
heavy investment to develop its dealer networks. Such markets include
Germany, France and Italy.
UK car output has also been boosted by the industry's leading presence in
the production of four-wheel drive vehicles through Land Rover, part of the
Rover group, and through IBC Vehicles, a 60/40 joint venture between General
Motors and Isuzu which produces the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera.
Demand for four-wheel drive vehicles has remained strong through the
recession. Land Rover has raised output of its Discovery and Range Rover
vehicles by 31 per cent year-on-year in the first nine months of the year,
while IBC has increased output of the Frontera by 43 per cent.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Police chiefs win power on budgets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to give police chiefs more say over the way in which their
budgets are allocated, even before the police bill has become law.
The Home Office has told chief constables starting to prune middle-ranking
jobs that their proposals on how to spend the money saved will gain
automatic approval from next April.
Technically, police forces need permission to raise staffing levels above
their authorised quotas under rules likely to be swept away from April 1995
under the government's police reforms. The Home Office's move should in
effect remove these controls a year early.
The reduction in middle-ranking positions may lead to an increase in overall
police numbers because ministers want forces to use the money they save to
recruit more officers on the beat.
But chief constables will have discretion to use savings to buy new
equipment or invest in more crime prevention.

Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, said during the second reading of the

there is scope for allowing them a renewed place in staff representation'.
Union membership was banned in 1984 after some staff took industrial action

<TEXT>
The Salvation Army yesterday won a civil action for Dollars 3.3m (Pounds
2.21m) against Mr Stuart Ford, a businessman accused of being at the centre
of an alleged Pounds 6.2m fraud against the charity.
A High Court judge ruled that Mr Ford, of Bromsgrove, west Midlands, had no
defence. He also found against Mr Ford's company, Tilen Securities, of
Acocks Green, Birmingham, on the basis it had not filed a defence. Mr Ford,
who was not in court, was accused at an earlier hearing of 'salting away' up
to Pounds 170,000 of Salvation Army money. He has denied the allegations.
The Salvation Army is pursuing claims against 13 other defendants.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Levitt case cost SFO Pounds 1.4m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Serious Fraud Office spent Pounds 1.4m on the prosecution of Mr Roger
Levitt, the financier who received a 180-hour community service sentence for
a single charge of fraudulent trading, the government disclosed last night.
The case followed the collapse of Mr Levitt's financial services group with
debts of more than Pounds 34m. His sentence, imposed at Southwark crown
court last month, provoked a storm of protest. After more than 20 days in
court, much of it spent in legal argument, the SFO reduced the charges to
just one of fraudulent trading, to which he pleaded guilty.
Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, said in a Commons written reply: 'The
best estimate of the cost of the SFO arising from this case is approximately
Pounds 1.4m. I have at present no information about other costs.'
Mr Bob Cryer, Labour MP for Bradford South, said: 'Considering the SFO
eventually only prosecuted Levitt on just one charge, this cost is
astounding. It is a complete waste of taxpayers' money to spend so much time
preparing other charges, then to drop them at the last minute.'

FT  10 DEC 93 / Officials play down plan to hive off fraud office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government officials appeared last night to be playing down the significance
of the announcement by Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, that he has
ordered studies of the scope for hiving off the Serious Fraud Office, Crown
Prosecution Service and Treasury Solicitor's Department into executive
agencies.
Sir Nicholas is understood to have an open mind on the issue and determined
not to be rushed on a decision. Officials were keen to stress that the
studies were simply part of the government's continuing review of civil
service functions announced back in 1988.
The studies were condemned by Mr Alistair Darling, Labour City spokesman. He
said Sir Nicholas was trying to 'wash his hands' of the SFO. He added:
'There are a number of people in the financial services industry who believe
that we need a single enforcement agency. We urgently need an efficient
regulatory system to protect London's reput-ation.'
The handling of serious fraud is already under review by Mr John Graham, a
Treasury official who used to work at the SFO. He is not expected to report
before February. The study into the feasibility of making the SFO an
executive agency will not begin until Sir Nicholas has had time to assess Mr
Graham's report.
Doubts about the scope for turning the SFO and CPS into executive agencies
centre on the impact it would have on direct ministerial accountability for
prosecution policy and decisions.
The SFO said yesterday that it was too early to say what effect executive
agency status would have on its relationship with the attorney-general - but
the lack of direct ministerial accountability was clearly an issue. It
pointed out, however, that the SFO already has many of the characteristics
of an executive agency - it operates at arm's length from ministers and has
to present an annual report to parliament.
The new agencies would have to publish framework documents setting
performance targets.
An in-house team has won by default the contract to provide typing and
secretarial services to the Inland Revenue's 58 offices in the south-west
region. All the private-sector bidders dropped out.
The contract won by Secretarial Typing Services is worth Pounds 12m over
five years, with the final two years subject to a range of quality and
service performance targets.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Payout order on friendly society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Assurance, a friendly society, has been ordered by
the High Court to pay compensation to most of its policyholders as a result
of investment irregularities.
In a statement Mr James Ramsden, the society's chairman, said its actuary
had estimated maximum liabilities of Pounds 8.3m.
Earlier this year the society anticipated that it might be instructed to pay
compensation and, in an unprecedented move by a friendly society, it raised
Pounds 10.1m for a compensation fund by imposing a 12 per cent levy on its
67,000 policyholders.
Surplus money from the compensation fund would be returned to members'
funds, although in a letter to members Mr Ramsden warned that those who left
the society in the meantime might not be eligible to receive the surplus.
The society went to court for directions on how to deal with a series of
fundamental errors which came to light last year.
More than half of its policyholders have suffered as a result of a Pounds
4.3m property write-off on unauthorised investments in its Capital Secure
fund. This was advertised as investing only in cash deposits and gilts but
it was found to have also invested in property.
A court decision on whether 7,000 policies that were funded by a lump sum
are eligible for tax-exempt status has been postponed pending further talks
between the society and the Inland Revenue.
Mr Ramsden said that the future shape of the society would have to be
decided over the next six months.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Insurers relieved over pollution damage ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, RICHARD LAPPER and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurers of companies that cause pollution yesterday expressed relief after
a Cambridgeshire tannery won its appeal in the House of Lords against an
order to pay Pounds 1.1m in environmental damages for contaminating a water
borehole.
Had the five law lords ruled the other way, the concept of retrospective
strict liability for environmental damage would have been introduced into
English common law.
It could have left insurers facing a bill of Pounds 3bn for the cost of
cleaning up land already contaminated.
The judges ruled that Eastern Counties Leather was not liable to Cambridge
Water Company for contamination of its borehole at Sawston, Cambridgeshire,
with perchloroethene, a highly volatile solvent used by the tannery for
de-greasing animal pelts.
The judges said the tannery could not have 'reasonably foreseen' at the time
that it used the solvent, between the early 1960s and 1976, that spillages
would lead to any environmental hazard or damage at Cambridge Water's
borehole, 1.3 miles away.
The decision pleased insurers. Mr Tony Baker, head of public affairs at the
Association of British Insurers, said: 'If the appeal had not been upheld,
an element of retrospective strict liability would have been introduced.'
The Water Services Association, which represents the 10 large water and
sewerage companies of England and Wales, said: 'We are concerned about
pollution of ground water, but we are not surprised that the law lords have
ruled against retrospective liability - it is not a principle which the WSA
has sought to pursue.'
Mr Paul Taylor, a partner with Berrymans, the solicitors representing the
tannery and its insurer General Accident, said the decision meant insurers
could now assess the strength of claims against a much clearer legal
background.
'Insurers will still be absolutely concerned about environmental cover but
there are likely to be fewer claims because plaintiffs will be more
cautious,' he said.
Had the ruling gone against the tannery, insurers would have been likely to
hasten moves to narrow the scope of pollution coverage available in
commercial liability policies.
Reasonable forseeability was a prerequisite for recovery of damages under
the common law rule, the law lords said.
The rule imposes liability on a landowner who brings on to his land
something likely to cause damage if it escapes.

FT  10 DEC 93 / BBC audience share hopes 'wildly optimistic'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC is 'wildly optimistic' in thinking it could hold on to 30 per cent
of the television audience by the end of the century, the Commons national
heritage committee warned yesterday.
Mr Gerald Kaufman, committee chairman, said the BBC would have to adapt to
the coming world of 500 channels otherwise it would 'vanish down the
technological plug'.
The BBC believes its audience share will fall to about 30 per cent by the
end of the decade from the current level of about 40 per cent.
Mr Kaufman, launching the committee's report on the future of the BBC, said
he did not see any way that the organisation's present structure could be
maintained beyond the extension of the royal charter - now being debated.
The committee predicted 'a media revolution' - with the television set
replacing 'everything from travel brochures and travel agencies to
newspapers and the postbox'.
In spite of the threat from technology, the committee decided to recommend
that the BBC's royal charter, which runs out at the end of 1996, should be
renewed for a further 10 years. They added 'with great reluctance' that the
licence-fee system of financing the BBC had 'the fewest objections to it'.
The 10-year extension, Mr Kaufman said, would give 'sufficient time for the
BBC to be able to work out a viable and vibrant future for itself'.
Future options for the BBC ranged from linking up with a large international
media conglomerate to concentrating on programme supply.
The committee also emphasised that ways must be found to make the licence
fee - at present Pounds 83 a year for colour TV - less of a burden for those
on low incomes.
Mr Kaufman appealed to the BBC to exercise humanity in prosecuting
licence-fee defaulters when it was clear they could not afford to pay.
The possibilities include: a lower-cost additional licence for households
with more than one television set, a car radio licence or one-off payment
for a car radio, large hotels paying a licence for every room beyond 50, and
dealer licences being increased from 50p to at least the level of a full
licence fee.
The National Heritage Committee also advocated that a single complaints body
should be set up to deal with every complaint relating to broadcasting.
The report was welcomed yesterday by Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, as
'a generous recognition of the BBC's value and achievements'.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Private future for civil service is spelt out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the publication of yesterday's white paper on executive agencies, the
government has for the first time spelt out its vision of the future shape
of the civil service after a decade of piecemeal reform.
It has also given notice that the emphasis in future will be on bringing in
the private sector to provide public services wherever possible.
Agencies which have previously escaped the threat of privatisation may find
that they are up for sale following reviews which are already conducted for
all agencies at regular intervals.
At the heart of the government's vision is a distinction between the core
departments concerned with making and implementing policy and the much
larger periphery of organisations that will be responsible for delivering
public services.
A core of about 10 per cent of the civil service - perhaps 50,000 civil
servants in all - will work for the Whitehall departments servicing
ministers, distributing public funds and setting standards for public
services.
The remaining 500,000 civil servants will work in the provision of public
services.
A small minority will directly work for government departments, particularly
where their functions need to be under strong central control as in units
which support front-line units in the armed forces.
But more than 80 per cent of all civil servants will soon work in executive
agencies; separate organisations created to deliver particular services to
the public such as benefit payments or tax collection.
Each of these agencies has its own chief executive, often appointed from
outside the civil service and given considerable management freedom. Each
must meet financial and service targets negotiated with government
departments, and publish an annual report on its performance.
As a result of yesterday's announcement more of the work of agencies will be
carried out by the private sector.
Some agencies will be privatised, as has happened for DVOIT, the information
technology agency of the Department of Transport.
Others in information technology, accountancy, payroll, scientific testing
and property services could follow suit and would be attractive to the
private sector. In other cases, commercial management will be brought in to
manage agencies which the government wishes to retain in public ownership.
This has happened with the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston. It
is managed as a Goco (government-owned, contractor-operated) company by
Hunting, the aviation, defence and oil services company. Similar
arrangements may be attractive for the agencies which manage the royal
parks, the public records office and palaces such as Hampton Court and the
Tower of London.
Some agencies will be too sensitive for either approach in the foreseeable
future. This would apply to the controversial Child Support Agency, which
extracts maintenance from absent parents, the prison service and the Crown
Prosecution Service. Their managers will be expected to introduce commercial
disciplines through further market-testing, by putting parts of their work
out to tender.
Even those parts of the civil service remaining in the core will not be
immune to change. The government plans to recruit more outsiders for top
posts and to make top mandarins more accountable.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, in presenting the
changes yesterday said civil service reform was alive and well, with 'the
momentum of change gathering pace'.
The civil service which emerges will be very different from that inherited
by the Conservatives when they came to power in 1979.

FT  10 DEC 93 / DTI urges radical reform of newspaper distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry has linked with the Office of Fair
Trading to seek 'fundamental reforms' in newspaper distribution.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, decided to go further than
yesterday's recommendations of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on
the Pounds 1.2bn newspaper distribution industry.
He said he wanted to initiate fundamental reforms in the supply of
newspapers which would stop wholesalers refusing to supply retailers on the
grounds that an area was already adequately served and to remove
restrictions on the point of sale and resale of papers.
Mr John Gardner, managing director of VG, the independent grocery group,
said: 'Grocers will now be able to sell newspapers in the same way
newsagents have been allowed to sell groceries.'
The minister said yesterday that if, in the three-month consultation period,
the industry made voluntary proposals to increase competition, this could be
an alternative to formal orders.
'Clearly the industry will need to consider if a minimum size of order is
necessary,' said Mr Hamilton in a hint that he is not seeking total
deregulation.
The commission concluded after a year's investigation that the publishers'
display of cover prices and the setting of common retail and exclusive
distribution arrangements amounted to a complex monopoly but it was not one
that operated against the public interest.
It found, however, that arrangements for considering applications for
supplies were sometimes arbitrary and amounted to a restriction against the
public interest.
The commission proposed that to act as 'a safety valve' retailers should be
allowed to pass on copies to other outlets or sub-retail.
'We were concerned that complete removal of the restrictions could lead toa
surge of new outlets and thus to a sharp increase in unsold copies and
higher costs,' the commission said. It added that the OFT should keep the
situation under review to determine any further action.
Mr Hamilton, who argued that publishers would anticipate changes and
minimise wastage, also emphasised MMC uncertainty over whether its single
recommendation would be enough to remedy the abuse.
He said that Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, had
also recommended more fundamental reform. He had accepted Sir Bryan's
advice, Mr Hamilton said.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Chief executives slip back on pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chief executives in the UK are falling further behind their international
colleagues in the pay stakes in spite of substantial salary increases in
recent months, according to a survey by Towers Perrin, the management
consultants.
However, because prices in Britain are relatively low, UK executives have
better living standards than many of their Continental colleagues.
The remuneration survey placed UK chief executives 17th in a survey of 19
countries, down from 14th the year before. US executives were top. The
survey covers industrial companies with annual sales above Pounds 165m.
When the criterion of total remuneration was used, UK chief executives fared
slightly better at 14th position. In the last survey on this measurement of
pay in 1991 UK executives ranked sixth.
Towers Perrin said a number of factors were influencing this change. They
included:
Exchange rate movements.
The adoption by other countries of annual bonus schemes and other forms of
longer term incentives.
Shortage of management talent in other countries which was driving up pay
rates.
In terms of purchasing power, chief executives in the UK had 63 per cent of
the purchasing power of US chief executives. German chief executives had 65
per cent, Italy 64 per cent, Spain 62 per cent, Switzerland 61 per cent,
France 55 per cent, Netherlands 54 per cent, Belgium 44 per cent and Sweden
31 per cent.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Auditors receive Cadbury guidance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Auditors will be required to highlight any aspects of non-compliance with
the Cadbury code of corporate governance that companies fail to list, under
guidelines published yesterday.
They must produce a statement drawing attention to any departures from the
code not flagged in a statement by the directors, according to a bulletin
issued by the Auditing Practices Board (APB), the standard-setting body for
the profession.
The advice is preliminary because detailed guidance is still being developed
on two outstanding areas recommended in the Cadbury code. They are
commentaries on internal controls and on whether the company is a 'going
concern'.
Meanwhile, the APB strongly advises auditors not to make any comments on
these aspects of the code.
It says auditors are not required to perform additional procedures to
investigate the appropriateness of non-compliance. They should review all
meetings, question directors and attend audit committee meetings as part of
their review.
But Mr Michael Boyd, vice-chairman of the APB and a partner with accountants
Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'This advice goes further than Cadbury required. An
auditor would disregard it at his peril.'
The guidance came into effect immediately. Companies must provide a
statement of compliance with the Cadbury code for accounting periods after
June 30 this year.

Somers Baker, a small London-based accountancy firm, is to face scrutiny
from the accountancy profession's highest disciplinary body for its role as
auditor and adviser to War on Want, the campaigning third world charity.
The firm was criticised for its work in a report published by the Charity
Commission in 1991, and paid Pounds 309,500 to War on Want in an
out-of-court settlement in August this year.
The investigation is to be conducted by Mr Michael Chance, executive counsel
of the Joint Disciplinary Scheme, which represents the Institutes of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, and Scotland, and the Chartered
Association of Certified Accountants.
The scheme only examines serious issues that command a high level of public
interest. Only three investigations are currently under way: into Barlow
Clowes, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and the Maxwell
affair.

FT  10 DEC 93 / CBI fears effects of sick-pay move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry fears that the government's move to
make large employers responsible for all statutory sick pay heralds a wider
shift towards loading social responsibilities on to companies.
Although companies overall will save Pounds 160m more in reductions in
National Insurance than they will pay out in statutory sick pay when new
legislation is introduced in April, the CBI is still concerned.
Mr Steve Palmer, CBI deputy director of employment affairs, said yesterday:
'We are not at all happy about the way that this reimbursement has been
removed even though it will not involve any extra cost for most companies.
We believe it's the thin end of the wedge.
'We are already moving in the same direction on maternity pay.'
The CBI fears that the government may in future try to burden employers with
other benefit areas, such as those for industrial injuries and family
credit.
It points out that historically employers only took on payment of statutory
sick pay to ease the government's administrative load. It also believes that
by accepting the duty to pay a statutory benefit it will do nothing to
reduce vulnerability to future National Insurance increases. Mr Palmer said:
'Statutory sick pay will have gone but there is nothing to stop the
government increasing the rate of National Insurance in the future.'
At present larger companies can claim reimbursement of 80 per cent of the
costs of statutory sick pay but this is being abolished in April.

FT  10 DEC 93 / General unions closer to merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's new super-union, to be formed from the merger of the TGWU and GMB
general unions, will appeal to the workforce of the future - part-timers,
people working in small companies and those who move from job to job,
according to Mr John Edmonds, the GMB leader.
Mr Edmonds, and Mr Bill Morris the TGWU leader, yesterday unveiled the next
stage in the merger which is expected to be completed by 1996.
The executives of the two unions have agreed to set up working parties to
cover benefits and services, industrial servicing, political activity,
recruitment and organisation and structure.
Each group will study how the unions operate and suggest how co-operation
and closer working can be extended. They will produce an initial report by
March 1994.
Although the merger is unlikely to be derailed, there are several
difficulties to be overcome. The TGWU is a leftwing union with a recent
history of domination by its lay activist executive.
The GMB by contrast is right-of-centre union controlled by full-time
officials. Mr Edmonds has far more top-down power than Mr Morris.
However, political differences have become less marked in recent months as
Mr Morris has helped to move the TGWU in a more pragmatic direction. And Mr
Edmonds has delighted many on the left by his criticisms of Labour economic
policy and his attack on the policy of one member one vote in the selection
of parliamentary candidates.
The merger may even be seen as a threat by Labour leaders as the
organisation will control about half of all union funds going to the party.
Both leaders have indicated they expect better value for money.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Clarke attacks Delors plan to create jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government yesterday attacked plans by Mr Jacques Delors, European
Commission president, to create jobs by borrowing money to pay for
environmental and transport projects such as the Channel tunnel rail link.
One the eve of the European summit in Brussels, Mr Kenneth Clarke,
chancellor, said there was no evidence of the need for borrowing for
infrastructure improvements across Europe.
'Here are the commission for the first time saying they are going to borrow
billions of Ecu as a commission and dish it out to as yet unspecified
projects across Europe,' he said on BBC Radio. All EU governments were
trying to reduce borrowing to create the right conditions for growth.
Mr Clarke added: 'It really is rather perverse for the European Commission
to say: 'Oh but we are going to have a public sector borrowing requirement
of our own now and we are going to start borrowing billions of pounds' which
might start driving things in the wrong direction.'
The government's negative reaction to the commission's proposals was
criticised by Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor. He accused
ministers of 'spoiling for yet another fight in Europe'.
'Many of the proposals the government now rejects out of hand are modelled
on the December summit agreement in Edinburgh in 1992 for which the prime
minister once claimed credit' he said.
Mr Brown added: 'It is clear that the negative, destructive, anti-European
attitudes now being expressed even by declared pro-Europeans like the
chancellor are designed to hold the Conservative party together.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, accused the government of trying
to 'placate a handful of primitives on its back-benches' and called for a
positive policy on Europe that was in Britain's interests.
Earlier Mr Clarke said: 'We don't want these white papers produced on a
Monday, trundled through a heads of government conference at the weekend,
accompanied by a press release indicating that something like Pounds 100bn
worth of borrowing can speed up the construction of the networks across
Europe.'
But Mr Brown asked: 'Why does the government refuse to back action that
would clearly be of benefit to the Channel tunnel rail link and prevent the
national humiliation until 2002 of trains travelling at 185mph from a link
already opened from Paris to Calais but at only 47mph from Dover to London?'

FT  10 DEC 93 / Corporate Names to get more power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday introduced new voting rules, significantly
increasing the power of new corporate members in the insurance market.
More than 16 new corporate Names - investment trusts and companies and
insurance companies - are injecting some Pounds 850m into the market and
will provide backing of about Pounds 1.5bn in 1994, just under a fifth of
the total.
The rules allocate votes proportionate to allocated capacity (the amount of
premiums syndicates are permitted to underwrite).
Individual Names, whose assets have traditionally supported the market, will
have voting rights proportionate to their allocated capacity - but this has
been divided on a 'one-member-one-vote' basis.
The new voting arrangements are transitional. It is envisaged that voting at
general meetings will ultimately be weighted in proportion to capacity.
Lloyd's also announced new mandatory qualifications for active underwriters
and underwriting agency directors.
Active underwriters appointed after December 31 next year must be associates
of the Chartered Insurance Institute - instead of the current requirement
that they obtain a Lloyd's Market Certificate.

The private sector has had far less success winning council contracts in

In its strongest sector, building cleaning, the private sector won 18.7 per

FT  10 DEC 93 / Committee re-elects unionist supporter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrew Hunter last night held off a challenge from Mr Peter Temple-Morris
for the chairmanship of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee in a
move that was immediately welcomed by Ulster Unionists.
Although detailed results of Conservative backbench elections are not
officially released, the Conservative MP for Basingstoke was believed to
have polled between twice and three times as many votes as his challenger.
As many as 150 Conservative MPs were said to have cast votes, reflecting the
high level of interest in the province at Westminster at present.
Mr Hunter said afterwards: 'This vote was a clear signal that the Tory back
benches are not in the business of buying peace from the IRA. It was a
signal, too, that the mood on the back benches is pro-unionist.'
Mr Temple-Morris, the more moderate MP for Leominster, said he was
'naturally disappointed' but added that the committee was 'in good hands'.
For the Ulster Unionists, Mr John Taylor, MP for Strangford, said Mr
Hunter's election would 'help to settle nerves in Northern Ireland'.
Mr Hunter's election was 'a significant reflection of feeling on the
Conservative back benches at the present moment, especially as there was a
very strong challenge'.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Tunnel handover smooths troubled waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rows over payments and delays will be set aside today as British and French
contractors celebrate the end of construction of the Channel tunnel with an
official handing over of the project to its operator, Eurotunnel.
Commercial services are not expected to begin until March when freight
wagons should start using the tunnel. Car passenger services are likely to
begin shortly after Easter.
Compared with some grand civil projects Eurotunnel has not had a bad deal
although the project is almost a year late and cost more than twice its
original estimate of Pounds 4.7bn when it was started in 1988.
The Suez and Panama canals each cost more than 50 times their original
budgets. The single-bore Seikan rail tunnel, which connects Hokkaido to the
mainland of northern Japan, took 24 years to build - 14 more than planned -
and caused 34 deaths. Its budget overshoot was far more than that of the
Channel tunnel.
The Channel tunnel cost the lives of 10 workers - eight on Britain's side
and two on the French.
There was a slow start on the British side when salt water, percolating
through fissures in the rock, affected the delicate controls on the
200m-long tunnel-boring machines.
Initial attempts to insulate equipment caused overheating, periodic engine
fires and many breakdowns. At one stage progress under the Kent coast was
less than 20 metres a week, compared with more than 300 metres a week later.
Mr John King, director responsible for the British tunnelling, later
admitted: 'There were several times when I thought we might not make it.
'One of the worst moments was when, with water still pouring through tiny
fissures in the roof of the tunnel, we had to decide whether the
modifications we had made to the machines would be sufficient to let us
proceed. Fortunately, they worked.'
Since then engineers have gone on to break a number of records in the course
of digging about 150km, in three adjoining tunnels, removing more than 20m
tonnes of spoil and building the world's largest undersea tunnel.
The tunnel was just a beginning. The terminals at Folkestone in Kent and
Sangatte near Calais in northern France represented two of Europe's biggest
building projects. The French site is equivalent in size to Heathrow.
The tunnel is one of the world's most sophisticated transport systems
including more than 200km of track in the two running tunnels which are
separated by the central service tunnel.
There is computer-controlled signalling as well as monitoring and override
devices along the track and in trains to assist the managers of the new
railway. These will operate from control towers at each end of the tunnel,
either of which can operate the system on its own. Information is carried
through miles of fibre-optic cable capable of handling 700m pieces of data
per second.
Power for the overhead railway will be drawn from the British and French
national grids from two sub-stations at each end of the tunnel. Either of
these can operate singly.
Stiff safety requirements, in the wake of London Underground's fire at Kings
Cross and the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in Zeebrugge harbour,
have helped increase the project's cost and added to delays.
Mr Edward Ryder, UK head of the inter-governmental Channel tunnel safety
authority, said this week that a full-scale evacuation test, involving 1,000
Channel tunnel employees and their families, will be conducted before
commercial services can start.
He could not rule out further delays, but said: 'We are confident that the
design and concept of the project ought to be able to work safely. Once you
are inside, you should be safer than you were on the journey to the tunnel.'

FT  10 DEC 93 / Labour halts co-operation with Tories: Smith angry at
guillotine decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour last night broke off all relations with the government in protest at
plans to curtail debate on changes to statutory sick pay and National
Insurance contributions.
The move means Labour will disrupt the passage of government business
through the Commons, opposing even non-contentious legislation.
Private meetings between government and opposition whips - accompanied by an
independent official - to work out arrangements on parliamentary proceedings
to the convenience of both sides will cease until further notice.
So will the practice of 'pairing', whereby arrangements are made for an
equal number of government and opposition MPs to miss votes in such a way
that the overall margin of victory is not affected.
In view of the government's slim 17-strong majority, this raises the
prospect of ministers being called back from official business in the
regions or overseas to vote, even on matters where there is no real dispute
between the principal parties.
The move was triggered by the government's decision to allow only one day
each for the passage of controversial bills to raise employees' National
Insurance contributions from 9 per cent to 10 per cent and to increase the
statutory sick pay burden on large companies.
Announcing Labour's decision last night, Mr John Smith, the party leader,
said there was 'simply no justification' for the government's behaviour. 'It
is oppressive and it is arrogant. It is a further sign of a government which
has been in power for too long.'
For the government, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, described
Labour's action as 'too silly for words'.
Pointing out that the recent Budget debate was extended from five days to
six at Labour's request, Mr Newton said the two bills needed to be carried
through in a way that allowed for 'adequate discussion in parliament'.
Support for both the Conservatives and Labour has risen since the Budget at
the expense of the Liberal Democrats, according to a Gallup poll in The
Daily Telegraph. The poll shows Labour at 48.5 per cent, Tories at 27,
Liberal Democrats 20, others 4.5.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Jobs in councils fall by 50,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local government employment in England and Wales fell by 50,000 in the year
to September 1993. This allowed a static pay bill in spite of an increase in
pay over that period of more than 3 per cent, the Local Government
Management Board said yesterday.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, said the government had
broken its assurances that council-tax capping would not lead to job cuts.
The government will argue that the figures show it is possible to keep the
pay bill flat, as required until 1997, and still award wage rises.
The total number of jobs in local government in England and Wales is
slightly below 2m.
The 50,000 fall excludes the effects of the transfer of further and higher
education out of the local authority sector, cuts due to compulsory
competitive tendering, and changes associated with schools moving to
grant-maintained status.
About 11,700 of the total is due to redundancy and the rest derived from
natural wastage.
The 50,000 fall included 20,800 full-time non-manual workers, 12,700
full-time manuals and 27,700 part-time manuals. Part-time non-manuals
increased over the period by 11,700.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Parking controls threat to Sundays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More parking restrictions and traffic congestion could result from
parliament's plan to de-regulate Sunday shopping, local authorities warned
yesterday.
The councils which must enforce the proposals said they would have to extend
parking controls if many large stores decided to open on Sundays.
They insisted the cost of employing traffic wardens for an extra day would
have to be met by car park charges and by operating parking meters.
The cross-party Association of District Councils and the Labour-controlled
Association of London Authorities said they would have to levy the new
charges on motorists because the government was not providing funds for the
extra costs created by Sunday opening.
According to the Institute of Public Finance, Sunday trading could cost
councils an extra Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m. This would include higher bills
for trading standards and litter collection as well as traffic control. The
RAC said yesterday it could see little justification for the councils'
proposals. It said parking meters were not in operation on a Saturday
afternoon in central London; yet Saturday was the busiest shopping day. 'If
not on Saturday, why . . . on Sunday?'
It said the consequences of Sunday trading on traffic had been overlooked.
'Even in London, public transport is much poorer on Sunday than it is during
the rest of the week. That means far more people will have to travel by car
than if they shopped on Saturday.'
Councils also warned that roadworks, normally carried out on a Sunday
because of the light traffic, would have to be moved to another day.
Local authorities are deferring detailed plans until legislation emerges.
Wandsworth said that while costs could be maintained, it 'would have to find
a different quiet day for roadworks. Maybe that would be Monday instead.'

Telecom Australia, the country's largest purchaser of electronic equipment,
said yesterday it had placed orders worth up to ADollars 2.5bn (Dollars
1.63bn) with three European companies as part of a five-year programme to
digitalise its network, Nikki Tait writes from Sydney.
The beneficiaries are Alcatel of France, Germany's Siemens and Ericsson of
Sweden. The French group will provide equipment worth up to ADollars 1.1bn,
including local exchanges, access electronics, and a transit switching
network.
The Ericsson contract is worth around ADollars 850m, and will also be made
up of digital switching equipment. Siemens will supply some ADollars 500m in
transmission equipment. Telecom added that it is still negotiating with
NorTel, the Canadian-owned manufacturer, for the supply of corporate
customer switching services.

Malaysia yesterday signed letters of acceptance with McDonnell Douglas to
buy eight F/A-18 fighter jets in a deal Malaysia says is worth about
MDollars 1.8bn (Dollars 700m), writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
The signing, during an international air show on the Malaysian island of
Langkawi, is the last stage in protracted negotiations Malaysia has held
with the US manufacturer.
Malaysia is involved in a multi-million-dollar programme to modernise its
armed forces. Malaysia is also buying 18 Mig-29s from Russia for which
payment will be made both in cash and in palm oil as part of a countertrade
arrangement.
Among other deals announced at the air show was the sale by British
Aerospace of its vertical-launch Sea Wolf surface-to-air missile system to
the Malaysian navy. The missiles will be fitted to two frigates being built
for the Malaysian navy at Yarrow Shipbuilding in Britain.

Canada is scrambling to blunt the political impact of the Uruguay Round on
the separatist debate in Quebec.
Officials confirmed yesterday that Ottawa was pressing its trading partners
for a clause in the proposed multilateral trade agreement which would allow
Canadian provinces to continue providing regional development subsidies.
In addition, prime minister Mr Jean Chretien sent his foreign minister and
chief Quebec lieutenant, Mr Andre Ouellet, to Quebec yesterday to placate
the province's dairy farmers, who have strenuously objected to the proposed
replacement of import quotas by tariffs on dairy on other farm products.
The separatist Bloc Quebecois, which won 54 seats in the House of Commons in
last October's election, has seized on the development grants and dairy
quota issues as evidence that Quebecois have more to lose than gain by
remaining part of Canada.
Under the Uruguay Round proposals, the Quebec government would be able to
provide subsidies if it was an independent state, but cannot do so as a
province of Canada. The Canadians now acknowledge they have little hope in
the Uruguay Round of retaining the import quotas which protect dairy,
poultry and egg farmers.
The government is now assuring farmers that it will maintain the
'supply-management' system by other means, such as the variable levies used
by the European Union. An official said yesterday the transition might also
be smoothed by changes to existing adjustment programmes.
Farm groups fear that tariffs will decline over time, and that production
quotas will be worthless. The official noted however, that the price of
dairy quotas has shot up by about 30 per cent in a year.

The Greek city of Thessalonika was yesterday chosen as the site of the newly
established Black Sea Trade and Development Bank at a meeting of foreign
ministers of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation group in Sofia, the
Bulgarian capital.
The choice of Thessalonika, beating bids from Istanbul, Sofia, Bucharest and
Costanza underscores the relative maturity of Greek financial instititutions
and also its membership of the European Union.
The agreement gives a symbolic boost to a pact set up in 1992, largely at
Ankara's prompting, to reforge economic links in the wake of the communist
collapse, between the region's market economies and the former Comecon
countries.
The group comprises Turkey, Greece, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania,
Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, and represents a market of 325m
consumers from the Balkans to the Caucasus.
The bank will be capitalised at SDR1bn (Pounds 930m), with a paid up capital
of SDR100m. The three bigget economies - Turkey, Greece and the Russian
Federation - will each contribute 16.5 per cent, with smaller amounts from
the others. The bank is also expected to seek funds from multilateral
agencies such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Turkey will provide the bank chairman, while the vice chairman will be a
Bulgarian.
According to a draft of the resolution agreed yesterday, the bank will
'promote regional projects and assist in intra-regional trade especially in
capital goods'.
A Greek official said Thessalonika, with 240 local banks and 10 foreign
banks, was well placed to secure access to international finance. The Black
Sea is currently considering various telecommunications projects, free
ports, and a road corridor linking the littoral states.

fails'

Economic reform in central and eastern Europe would be seriously undermined
by a failure of the Uruguay Round of trade talks and the consequent erosion
of international fair trade rules, the United Nations Economic Commission
for Europe says in a report published today.
The commission sees the main benefits for eastern Europe of a Uruguay Round
deal in strengthened rules against protectionist measures by the West,
although the regions has much to gain from liberalisation of the
agricultural and textile sectors in particular.
'These countries need secure market access and a stable and comprehensive
international framework of rules to sustain their reform programmes,' the
report says. It warns that they will be among the principal victims of
arbitrary and discriminatory trade protection if the Uruguay Round fails.
Non-tariff barriers, such as 'voluntary' export restraints and anti-dumping
suits, have increasingly been aimed at the reforming economies, the ECE
notes. Recent restrictions imposed on certain 'sensitive' products have
lessened the benefits of trade accords signed by several eastern European
countries with the European Union.
The proposed Uruguay Round accord would outlaw voluntary export restraints
and other 'grey area' measures to restrict trade outside fair trade rules,
and toughen conditions for resort to safeguards (emergency import
protection) and anti-dumping actions.
Protectionist measures by western Europe appear 'especially petty and
ungenerous' given the fact that western exporters have gained most from the
liberalisation of east-west trade, the report says.
Between 1989 and 1992 east European exports to OECD countries rose in value
by 43 per cent, but eastern imports from the OECD soared by 67 per cent and
the OECD trade balance with the east swung from a small deficit into a
sizeable surplus.
Though east European exports to the west fell by some 14 per cent in the
first half of 1993, imports from the west, mainly from western Europe,
continued to rise by 11 per cent.
The commission cites estimates of a global welfare gain of Dollars 212bn
(Pounds 142bn) a year from a Uruguay Round deal, equivalent to 1.1 per cent
of world GDP. Of this, freer farm trade accounts for 34 per cent,
liberalisation of textiles and clothing trade 40 per cent and increased
market access for services 14 per cent.
Former centrally planned economies (which include China as well as eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union) are among the biggest beneficiaries of
freer trade in textiles and, more surprisingly, in services, mainly
reflecting an opening of their protected (and underdeveloped) domestic
markets.
In the short term, the commission takes a sombre view of economic prospects
for eastern and central Europe.
Only a few countries - Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovenia -
hope for growth in 1994 and these forecasts are heavily dependent on higher
exports which may not materialise.
On average, GDP in eastern Europe fell 28 per cent between 1989 and the
first half of 1993, while output (excluding services) plunged by over 40 per
cent in the Commonwealth of Independent States and even more in the Baltic
nations.
The commission calls on western governments to increase aid flows, offer
free and secure access to western markets for eastern goods and services,
and develop a more consistent and coherent approach to the region's
problems. Economic failure in eastern Europe would threaten political
stability throughout the continent, the report warns.

FT  10 DEC 93 / World Trade News: US insistence on detail points to
two-stage Gatt deal - Line-by-line bargaining has meant accord will at first
involve just 15-20 countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mention 'the formula approach' to almost any trade negotiator, and there
will be a wince: it contrasts with the 'request and offer approach'. In the
arcane world of Uruguay Round aficionados, the victory of the latter over
the former has been, if not the source of all evil, at least the bane of
many of their lives during the past three years.
European Union negotiators in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
still today blame the refusal by the US to accept a formula approach as the
reason so many thousands of hours have been spent arguing line-by-line
tariff cuts with each separate trading partner as they have worked towards
completion of a market access agreement in Geneva.
Under the formula approach, supported by most trading nations but blocked by
the US in January 1990, once negotiators had agreed a formula for cutting
tariffs, then calculation of the product-by-product cuts would have been a
quick and simple affair. As has been seen in the protracted US-EU market
access negotiations, the request and offer approach to dealing with cuts
product by product, country by country, has added many person-years to the
process of concluding the round.
It explains why the EU said yesterday it had abandoned hope of reaching
line-by-line tariff cutting deals by the December 15 deadline with all 116
countries negotiating the round. Instead, it hopes to finalise deals with
15-20 countries which account for about 90 per cent of global trade.
They insist the delay will not jeopardise the round. Other countries will
agree in principle to finalise line-by-line schedules as soon as practicable
in the new year. But it has added to the frenetic pressures mounting on
negotiators in the few days remaining before December 15.
As details of the US-EU deal begin to surface, it is possible to understand
why the US - adamant about the need to preserve peak tariffs (higher than 15
per cent) in sensitive sectors and to tailor each deal to the idiosyncratic
details of trade with each trading partner - would not swallow the sweeping
formula approach.
Take the non-ferrous metals sector. Under the US-EU deal, tariffs on most
copper, tin and nickel goods fall to zero. Tariffs on zinc and most other
non-ferrous metals will fall below 5 per cent. Tariffs on aluminium goods
will range from 6.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent. All will be conditional on
other key importers making similar commitments. Japan's agreement is key.
Many of the tariff cuts revealed sweepingly by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart, are in fact
conditional, and pitted with exceptions. The true global value of tariff
cuts will only be calculable when the offers of all 116 participants are in
the bank. So far, the following details of the US-EU deal are clear:
Elimination of tariffs: in addition to the eight product sectors
conditionally agreed in Tokyo at the Group of Seven summit in July - listing
pharmaceuticals, construction equipment, medical equipment, steel, beer,
furniture, farm equipment and spirits - the US and the EU have agreed zero
tariffs for wood and paper products and toys. The phase-out for these last
three will be over 10 years, rather than the six years targetted elsewhere.
Tariffs on some fish products have been cut to zero. Tuna is excluded.
However, the deal on wood products depends on Indonesia and Malaysia
dropping their current bans on the export of raw logs. As a result, tropical
hardwoods may be left out until agreement is reached with these leading
timber exporters.
Low-level harmonisation: tariffs on chemical products are to be harmonised
at around 3 per cent following agreement outside Gatt by the world's leading
chemical companies.
Significant tariff cuts: tariffs on scientific equipment are to be cut by an
average of 50 per cent. Tariffs on industrial electronics will also be cut
by 50 per cent or more. The trade-weighted average of tariffs on
semi-conductors will fall to 6 per cent from 14 per cent, while tariffs on
semi-conductor manufacturing equipment will be cut to zero. Computer
peripherals will have tariffs eliminated, while tariffs on computer parts
will be cut from around 4 per cent to 2 per cent.
Consumer electronics - of critical importance to Japan, and south-east Asian
exporters - were not addressed. They will be looked at in bilateral
negotiations with these countries.
The attack on tariff peaks: cuts in the textiles and clothing sector will
need line-by-line examination. The US-EU deal cuts US tariffs on sensitive
items such as wool suits to around 17 per cent, with other wool items down
to about 25 per cent. In deference to Europe's cotton textile manufacturers,
mainly in Greece and Portugal, modest cuts have been agreed which ignore
dogmatic concentration on tariff peaks but instead focus on items of
significant export interest to these countries.
The high tariffs protecting US glass and ceramics manufacturers will not be
lopped across the board, but will reach 25-50 per cent 'on a few items'.
Farm trade: while the modifications to the US-EU Blair House text have
become clear, details of improved access to the EU food market are more
elusive. Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, says the EU tariff cuts and
new quota entitlements cover wheat and other cereals, meat, dairy products
and speciality crops such as nuts, processed foods, fruits and vegetables.
The US pig meat quota in the EU will rise by 39,000 tonnes.
It is clear that other farm produce exporters will benefit from restraint on
subsidised US and EU food exports, but what they might gain in terms of
bigger EU import quotas, or improved market access opportunities, remains
obscure.
Services: the scope and balance of offers to open markets to financial
services remains unclear. A financial services deal remains contested. A
conciliatory US move to open its ocean shipping sector appears to have been
withdrawn. The US and the EU remain at loggerheads on access to Europe's
film and television markets. There is still a danger a services deal could
crumble.

FT  10 DEC 93 / World Trade News: MFA extended for further year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Multi-Fibre Arrangement, which restricts most Third World exports of
textiles and clothing to the industrialised nations, is to be extended for a
further year to the end of 1994.
The extension, agreed by the MFA's 44 members yesterday, was made necessary
by the repeated delay in concluding the Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
If the round is successfully completed by the deadline of next Wednesday,
the MFA will be phased out over a 10-year period from 1995.
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, said the latest extension, the
sixth since 1974, was 'the final lease of life for the MFA'. Members of the
MFA, which legitimises a web of bilateral quota deals between rich and poor
nations, accounted for Dollars 136bn or 80 per cent of world textile and
clothing exports in 1990.
Representatives of Europe's textile and clothing industry were also in
Geneva yesterday to raise concerns over the terms under which the MFA will
be dismantled.
The proposed Uruguay Round deal was 'far from offering the necessary
guarantees of fair and balanced competition', the Brussels-based European
Textile and Clothing Coalition said in a statement, arguing that the EU was
one of the most open markets in the world.
The coalition said the US offer to lower very high tariffs on clothing was
inadequate and criticised the refusal of some developing country exporters
such as India and Thailand to open their domestic markets to imports.
The European industry said it would continue to press for a Uruguay Round
package incorporating lower tariff and non-tariff barriers worldwide, and
tougher action against unfair trading practices in developing countries
including counterfeiting, dumping and subsidies.

FT  10 DEC 93 / World Trade News: President apologises for rice decision
</HEADLINE>

   SEOUL, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Kim Young-sam yesterday apologised to the South Korean people for
breaking a presidential campaign promise to protect rice farmers from
imports and announced that the country had to open the market to avoid
economic isolation.
'Are we to live as an orphan by rejecting the Gatt system, or lead our
country toward globalisation and internationalisation by accepting the Gatt
framework?' he asked.
The government would draw up measures to compensate farmers for losses they
would suffer as a result of the opening of the agricultural market, he said.
South Korea is now negotiating in Geneva on terms governing the gradual
opening of the market for rice and 14 other agricultural products as part of
the Uruguay Round of trade talks.
The rice issue has developed into a political crisis for the government,
with farmers and students holding sometimes violent demonstrations in Seoul
and other parts of the country this week to protest against the
market-opening decision.
One opinion poll yesterday reported that 60 per cent of Koreans were opposed
to the opening of the rice market, while political analysts fault the
president for having done little to prepare the public for the change in
government policy.
Criticism of the government's handling of the problem is likely to lead to a
reshuffle of economic ministers and presidential advisers in the next few
weeks.
Japan's ruling coalition decided to delay until tomorrow or even later a
decision on whether to remove a blanket ban on rice imports, the Kyodo news
agency reported yesterday, Reuter adds from Tokyo.
The postponement came after a meeting of the leaders of parties in the
fragile coalition, Kyodo said.
Earlier this week, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, had said he
wanted to announce the formal decision by today to accept a Gatt compromise
proposal to allow minimum imports of rice for six years in exchange for the
scrapping of a Gatt demand to replace the blanket ban with tariffs.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Japanese face up to getting old: Planned changes to the
pension system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Setsuyo Uchida, a 71-year-old widow living on the outskirts of Tokyo,
has been drawing a state pension for more than 15 years. 'I really wouldn't
know what to do without it,' she says.
Mrs Uchida is one of 27m Japanese pensioners on the state system, which
provides citizens over the age of 60 with pensions worth 70 per cent of
average employees' salaries.
It is a tidy and generous system, but it is in for a change. Japan's is a
rapidly ageing society, expected to have the highest percentage of people
over 65 among industrialised nations by the turn of the century. Now the
ministry of health and welfare wants to raise the pension eligibility age to
65 to decrease the contribution burden on workers supporting the system.
At the moment, by paying 14 per cent of their gross salaries, 6.5 workers
support one pensioner. By 2020 some 2.2 workers will be supporting one
pensioner with more than 30 per cent of gross salary. If however the
retirement age is changed to 65 some 2.6 workers will pay 26 per cent of
their salaries to support one pensioner.
The proposal has been met by fierce opposition from the influential trade
union confederation Rengo. Mr Yoshio Tsuchida, director of Rengo's welfare
policy planning department, points out that Japanese companies have just
grown accustomed to the retirement age being raised to 60.
Although the goal of 60 as a standard retirement age is still not accepted
by all companies, progress has been made over the past decade as the
government has promoted a later retirement age through subsidies to
companies that retain or re-hire older workers.
However, Japan's seniority-based employment system puts a large cost burden
on companies retaining older employees, and although the government claims
by re-hiring elderly workers companies can counter the expected labour
shortage, job offers for workers over 55 remain at low levels.
'What are people supposed to do between the ages of 60 and 64 if the pension
eligibility rate is raised to 65?' asks Mr Tsuchida.
The government, which reviews its state system and resets its premium rates
every four years, needs to reach a decision by April next year, as it cannot
afford to postpone the matter until the next review in 2007 when Japan's
baby-boomers reach 60.
Although the pension council, an advisory group to the government made up of
union leaders, bureaucrats, and representatives from the business community,
failed to agree on a single reform blueprint, a recent report from the
council suggests that a compromise deal is in sight.
On one hand, the ministry is easing its rigid stance on the shift in
eligibility age by proposing a reduced benefit system for pensioners between
the ages 60 and 64 instead of no benefits until 65. The ministry admits it
is aware that some sort of compensation needs to be made for that age group
since at the moment two-thirds of pensioners start receiving their pensions
between the ages of 60 and 64.
Meanwhile Rengo has agreed that workers' twice-yearly bonus payments should
not be exempt from pension contributions. It has also accepted a change in
the way pension increases are calculated. At the moment these are based on
increases in average gross salaries.
However, by basing the increases in pension payments on the average growth
of net income - gross income minus taxes and social security contributions -
pensioners will also 'share' the burden of increases of workers' welfare
contributions and the government can avoid the possibility of workers taking
home less net cash than pensioners.
Professor Noriyuki Takayama of Hitotsubashi University's Institute of
Economic Research in Tokyo says basing pension growth on net salaries will
ease the burden on the workers who support the system by 10 per cent and is
more effective than altering the pension age. He says that the government
has become enthusiastic over the plan after Germany implemented a similar
scheme as a part of its pension system reform in 1992.
Over the next few months, Rengo and the government will need to work out
what the levels of partial pension payments for pensioners aged 60 to 64
will be. Prof Takayama says the government should set up a special fund
which companies would also be required to pay into. He suggests that an
incentive system should be set up where the payments into the special fund
would decline as the company takes on more elderly workers.

move into northern Natal, including parts of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi's largely autonomous KwaZulu homeland, to deal with unrest there.
The UN yesterday agreed to unrestricted resumption of shipments of oil and

Former British prime minister Sir Edward Heath yesterday secured the release
of three British prisoners held in Iraq, write James Whittington in Amman
and Agencies. The men were freed after Sir Edward met President Saddam
Hussein in Baghdad.
Mr Michael Wainwright, 42, and Mr Paul Ride, 33, were jailed last year for
10 and seven years respectively on charges of entering Iraq illegally. Mr
Simon Dunn, 23, was arrested in June and sentenced to eight years for the
same offence.
They were due to fly with Sir Edward by helicopter today to the Jordanian
capital, Amman, where they will be reunited with their families before
travelling on to the UK.
Iraq previously linked their release with Britain's unfreezing of Iraqi
assets in the UK. But British diplomats in Amman stressed that 'no deal had
been done'. One said the move was a gesture by Saddam in the hope UN
sanctions would soon be lifted.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Singapore case can proceed

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The judge in the Singapore trial of five people accused of breaking the
island republic's Official Secrets Act by prematurely disclosing an official
economic growth estimate has rejected defence calls for acquittal and has
ruled that the prosecution case can proceed.
Three economists and two journalists are charged with leaking an official
1992 second-quarter economic growth estimate of 4.6 per cent.
Last week the judge ruled that the prosecution had failed to make a case
against Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, director of the economics department at
the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore's de facto central
bank, on the charge of communicating secrets.
But the judge then suggested to the prosecution, which is led by Singapore's
attorney-general, that Mr Shanmugaratnam face a new charge of putting
classified information at risk.
The prosecution has alleged that the growth figure was leaked to two
economists working for a regional securities firm during a meeting they had
with Mr Shanmugaratnam at the MAS. The economists then passed the figure on
to a journalist with the local Business Times, whose editor published it.
The case has been adjourned until February. All five defendants have pleaded
not guilty.

FT  10 DEC 93 / US tempts Syria in peace bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A summit between US President Bill Clinton and Syria's President Hafez
al-Assad next month, followed by resumption of Syrian-Lebanese peace talks
with Israel in Washington, marks an important fresh effort to keep a
comprehensive Middle East peace agreement in sight.
The moves, announced yesterday by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, show that Washington is prepared to use its muscle and the promise of
improved US-Syrian relations to push forward a comprehensive peace
agreement.
The breakthrough points up the importance Damascus attaches to better ties
with the US, and the linkage it makes between improved Syrian-US relations
and advances in the peace process as Syria seeks to end its international
isolation and reform its economy.
So far, there seems no clear compromise between Israel and Syria on the
fundamental obstacles to an agreement.
Syria continues to insist Israel must declare its intention to withdraw
fully from the Golan Heights, captured in the 1967 six-day war. Israel wants
Syria to state clearly its commitment to full peace, including trade and
diplomatic ties before it will clarify the extent of its withdrawal.
Jerusalem has said it will withdraw 'on' but not 'from' the Golan,
suggesting only a partial return of Syrian land.
Despite the apparent impasse, Israeli officials believe the latest US
initiative provides grounds for cautious optimism because it holds out a
tempting prize for Damascus.
The US placed Syria on the terrorism blacklist when it was introduced in
1979, prohibiting US companies from exporting goods which could enhance
Syria's military or terrorism potential. The move also obliged the US to
vote against any development loans offered to Syria by multilateral
organisations.
Syria was briefly taken off the list by President Ronald Reagan in 1985 but
sanctions were re-imposed after an attempted bombing of an El Al aircraft in
1986 was blamed on Syria, and the US withdrew its ambassador to Damascus.
Syrian experts say Mr Assad is anxious to have Syria taken off the blacklist
to boost his international standing and aid the economic reform he is
overseeing. Liberalisation of the economy contributed to a 7 per cent growth
rate last year but future growth will depend on much greater investment.
Earlier, Mr Christopher announced Syria had made two important humanitarian
gestures to Israel, in an effort to restore confidence between the two
sides. Syria agreed to help a US delegation which is searching for seven
Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon and to grant exit permits to up to
1,200 Syrian Jews to travel freely before the end of this year.
Both moves were enthusiastically welcomed in Israel. But the Syrian reasons
behind the measures appear to have more to do with its desire to improve
relations with Washington than to make concessions to Israel.
As part of the package Mr Christopher said the US would allow Kuwait to
donate three ageing US-built Boeing 727 aircraft to Syria. But Washington
stressed the US was not relaxing sanctions against Syria.
Mr Farouk al-Shara, Syrian foreign minister, said a number of other
undisclosed steps would be taken before talks with Israel resumed. Mr
Christopher yesterday declined to give details of what other guarantees he
had given Mr Assad to entice Syria back to talks.
Israeli officials have hinted the US has an outline package of concessions
from Damascus and Jerusalem linked, on the Syrian side, to improved
relations with Washington and aimed at thrashing out an agreement in
principle by next April or May.

FT  10 DEC 93 / N Korea plans to initiate reforms
</HEADLINE>

   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea faces serious economic problems, it admitted yesterday, and
indicated it plans to adopt reforms.
The unprecedented communique was issued as the country's parliament began a
two-day session to announce important changes in the country's political
leadership and economic administration.
Pyongyang said its third seven-year (1987-93) plan had failed to achieve its
industrial production goals, especially in electric power, steel and
chemical fibre.
'The pace of growth and economic scale envisaged under the third seven-year
plan must be adjusted downward,' a report to the ruling Korean Workers'
Party said.
But it claimed industrial output during the period increased 1.5 times,
growing annually at an average 5.6 per cent. The plan had established an
industrial production goal of 10 per cent annual growth.
The South Korean central bank estimates the North's economic growth was
stagnant during the late 1980s before shrinking at an annual 5 per cent
during the past three years, primarily due to energy shortages.
Pyongyang blamed the poor economic performance on the collapse of the Soviet
Union and east European communist countries, which deprived it of economic
assistance, such as oil supplies, and trade. In what is regarded as a key
shift in economic policy, the government will concentrate on developing
agriculture, light industry and foreign trade at the expense of heavy
industry.
'The economy must be restructured in a way that ..develops our foreign
economic relations so that the economy can adapt to the changing
international environment,' the report stated. But the governing principle
of juche, or self-reliance, must also be maintained.
'This policy could be in response to Chinese pressure forcing North Korea to
adopt reforms or face the prospect of having China end its economic support
of the North,' one western diplomat said. China, the North's main outside
source of food and fuel, has been urging Pyongyang to adopt market reforms
similar to its own.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's economy will contract by 0.4 per cent next fiscal year, according to
the Nomura Research Institute, which blamed the expected shrinkage on a
continuing fall in corporate earnings and capital spending in coming months.
The gloomy forecast by the leading private research institute was followed
by a Daiwa Research Institute prediction that Japanese corporate profits
will fall for the fifth successive term in the year beginning from April.
Responding to indications of a deepening downturn, leaders of Japan's
coalition government said yesterday preparations for a stimulatory package
are likely to begin next week, when a supplementary budget is expected to
complete its passage through parliament.
Meanwhile, Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the leading
business grouping, said the government should stimulate the property market
to assist banks attempting to clear away their mountain of bad property
loans.
The NRI forecast for next year was based on the presumption that the
government will introduce another spending package and cut taxes, and that
the official discount rate will be reduced from the present record low of
1.75 per cent to 1 per cent by the Bank of Japan.
In the current year to March, NRI expects the economy will contract by 1.1
per cent, and it can see no signs of the recovery officially expected to
arrive in the first few months of next year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Sino-British impasse over Hong Kong deepened yesterday as the two sides
failed to make significant progress in London talks and China stepped up its
own preparations for assuming sovereignty over the territory in 1997.
British and Chinese officials blamed each other for slow progress in the
Joint Liaison Group, the body charged with arranging practical issues of the
handover, which ended three days of talks in London without setting a date
for the next meeting.
Mr Hugh Davies, the senior UK official, said the meeting had been
'disappointing' and that the current pace of the JLG was 'woefully
inadequate' if it was to complete its crowded agenda before 1997.
Mr Guo Fengmin, leader of the Chinese side on the JLG, made it clear
separately that the slowness was a result of Britain and China's failure to
advance talks on political issues, responsibility for which he laid squarely
on Britain.
Britain, Mr Guo said, had undermined previous agreements on Hong Kong and
'the discussions of the JLG are bound to be affected'.
Mr Davies said the Chinese view that the political situation affected the
JLG 'was felt throughout the agenda. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion
that a link is being made between politics and economics,' he said.
Limited progress had been made on issues such as civil aviation, merchant
shipping, investment and the civil service, but items 'ripe for agreement',
such as a proposed new container terminal, were being delayed by the
Chinese.
In Beijing Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, urged a special
advisory committee on Hong Kong to step up preparations for 1997. 'We must
put greater efforts into our work, and the responsibility borne by each
member is even heavier,' said Mr Qian, the panel's chairman.
Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political development are deadlocked and
Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, plans next week to proceed with parts
of his reform proposals without Beijing's agreement. China says it will
abandon negotiations should Mr Patten do so.
UK officials and Hong Kong business representatives fear the China-sponsored
'Preparatory Work Committee' of 57 leading Chinese and Hong Kong officials
will undermine Mr Patten's authority.
Mr Wu Jianmin, China's foreign ministry spokesman, left the door open for
further talks provided Mr Patten deferred his reforms. 'To resume them, the
UK side should change course and correct its errors which have led to the
breakdown of the talks.'
Mr Patten showed irritation yesterday at persistent Chinese claims of
insincerity. 'I think what the word 'sincerity' means to some Chinese
officials is: 'Everybody else in the world must agree with us, otherwise
they're not being sincere',' Mr Patten said.
Louise Lucas adds from Hong Kong: Mrs Anson Chan, Hong Kong's new chief
secretary who ranks second to Mr Patten, yesterday hit out at accusations by
Sir Percy Cradock, a former UK foreign policy adviser, that Mr Patten would
do 'great damage to the territory' by extending democracy. Mrs Chan said:
'The days of back-door deals over the heads of Hong Kong people are over.
For the agreement to be acceptable and credible in Hong Kong, it must enable
fair, open elections.'

Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former banker accused of funnelling around
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) in illegal loans to help arm Iraq during the
1980s, was sentenced to 37 months' imprisonment yesterday.
The former Atlanta branch manager of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, Mr
Drogoul has consistently claimed the Italian and US governments were fully
aware the money was being channelled to Iraq. He claimed the BNL Atlanta

Celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of Argentina's return to
democratic rule today are being overshadowed by the conclusion of
negotiations between the ruling Peronist party and the opposition Radicals
to change the country's 140-year-old constitution.
Ten years ago today, Mr Raul Alfonsn was sworn in as Argentina's 32nd
president this century, ending seven years of military rule. This is the
longest period of democratic rule Argentina has seen since the early 1930s.
It has suffered six military coups since 1930 and endured 13 military
presidents.
President Carlos Menem, whose six-year mandate ends in 1995, wants to stand
for re-election. This requires lifting a constitutional ban on consecutive
presidential terms. To do so, he needs the support of Mr Alfonsn's Radical
party.
Mr Menem and Mr Alfonsn are now reported to have overcome a dispute about
the powers of a prime ministerial figure being introduced with the new
constitution.
Mr Menem had demanded the prime minister should not encroach on the
president's authority. The two sides are close to agreement on a reduction
of the prime minister's powers and new rules for presidential elections.
The government wants to send the amendments next week to Congress, which
must approve changes to the constitution with a two-thirds majority. Mr
Menem is in a hurry because Argentina virtually closes down between December
and March for the southern hemisphere summer.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Nato gets Yeltsin's guarded blessing

President Boris Yeltsin yesterday welcomed the idea of military co-operation
with Nato - but not the prospect of eventual Nato enlargement to include
some of Russia's former allies such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech
republic.
This position, reflecting hardline opposition among the Russian military to
any eastwards expansion of Nato, emerged during talks with Mr Manfred
Worner, Nato secretary-general, at the neutral location of the Stuyvenbergh
chateau in Brussels.
A Nato summit next month is due to open the way towards the admission of new
members from central Europe while proposing a more immediate 'partnership
for peace', which would apply to a wider group of countries including Russia
and other former Soviet republics.
Mr Worner said after the meeting that there was 'a chance' of Russia
participating in the scheme, and he had agreed with Mr Yeltsin to increase
military contacts between Russia and Nato. The US plans to hold a first,
small-scale joint exercise with Russia next year.
Mr Worner said he had reassured Mr Yeltsin that any moves towards Nato
enlargement would not be directed against Russia and would take into account
the security interests of all concerned.
Nato defence ministers meeting in Brussels discussed US proposals to broaden
the alliance's scope to deal with new threats from countries which developed
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and missile delivery systems.
Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, said current international efforts on
non-proliferation 'may not be enough'.
He suggested that Nato might co-operate in research and development on means
of counter-proliferation, intelligence and anti-missile defences.
Mr Worner, who said European countries could not afford to develop such
defences on their own, warned allies against further sharp reductions in
their military budgets.
'If further major cuts are made, our ability to meet the challenges of the
future will be seriously compromised,' he said.
Mr Worner's remarks followed additional cuts in UK defence expenditure
announced 10 days ago.

FT  10 DEC 93 / US mayors add to support for registration of guns: Campaign
gains impetus from passage of Brady bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Support is building in the US for the imposition of a national system for
registering and licensing guns.
Attorney General Janet Reno, who has been asked by President Bill Clinton to
study the proposal, said yesterday she strongly favoured a licensing test to
show that individuals can safely and lawfully use a gun.
'I think it should be at least as hard to get a licence to possess a gun as
it is to drive an automobile,' Ms Reno said.
A task force of mayors and city police chiefs also backed gun registration
in a meeting yesterday with Mr Clinton to discuss crime and violence.
Support for tougher controls on firearms cuts across party lines, and the
suggestion for compulsory registration was in fact made to Mr Clinton by Mr
Rudolf Giuliani, the Republican mayor-elect of New York, and Mr Richard
Riordan, the Republican mayor of Los Angeles.
Mr Clinton has not taken a firm position on the idea of registration, but he
said yesterday that he believed the US was now ready to act on violent
crime. 'We have to move and I think we are prepared to move,' he said.
The mayors' task force also called for a ban on the manufacture, sale or
possession of all semi-automatic assault weapons and their components, much
higher taxes on firearms and ammunition, and much stiffer controls on gun
dealers.
In addition, the mayors asked for extra federal money to pay for more police
officers, the prosecution of violent juvenile offenders as adults and
mandatory minimum sentences for all repeat drug sale convictions. They
warned, however, that such measures were only short term recommendations.
'In our view, lasting solutions lie in Washington's willingness to view
affordable housing as a weapon to fight crime, to view child care, job
training, recreation programs, community development and transportation to
jobs as weapons to fight crime,' Mr Jerry Abramson, mayor of Louisville and
president of the US Conference of Mayors, told Mr Clinton.
Yesterday's White House meeting followed yet another outburst of random
violence when a gunman killed five people and wounded 18 others on a New
York suburban commuter train on Tuesday.
At least 38 people have been killed in the US so far this year in 11 similar
attacks, where an angry gunman with a grudge has opened fire at random.
Proposals for compulsory gun registration have already aroused fierce
opposition from gun lobbies such as the National Rifle Association. While
the NRA has traditionally opposed even the most modest forms of restriction
on gun ownership, registration is a particular anathema to the 3.3m member
organisation's core supporters.
The strongest opponents of gun controls argue that registration would allow
a tyrannical government to confiscate guns; they claim that the Holocaust
would not have happened without the gun registration laws passed in Germany
in the 1930s.
Public pressure for tougher action to curb gun violence, however, has not
dissipated with the passage by Congress last month of a law requiring hand
gun buyers to wait five days while their backgrounds are checked. Rather,
the passage of the Brady bill after seven years of argument has released the
energies of gun control campaigners to work on other measures.
Further crime legislation has been passed in both the Senate and the House
of Representatives, but the different versions must be reconciled when
Congress meets again in January before they become law.

Candidates yesterday wrapped up their campaigns for presidential and
congressional elections to complete Chile's transition to democracy begun
when General Augusto Pinochet stepped down as president in 1990, Reuter
reports from Santiago.
From midnight Wednesday, Chilean law forbids candidates to hold rallies,
stick up posters or advertise so voters have time for reflection. But polls
left little doubt as to the outcome of tomorrow's election. Ruling coalition
candidate Eduardo Frei was favoured to win the presidency with three to four
times the vote of his right-wing rival, Arturo Alessandri.
Analysts also expected a majority in Congress for the centre-left coalition
forged by President Patricio Aylwin to defeat Gen Pinochet in a 1988
plebiscite and which Aylwin again led in 1989 elections to restore civilian
rule.
But they say complicated voting rules make it almost impossible for the
coalition to win the two-thirds of the congressional seats it needs to rid
Chile of the last traces of authoritarian rule imposed by Gen Pinochet in a
1980 constitution.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Wholesale prices flat in November

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US wholesale prices were flat last month, indicating that inflationary
pressures remain subdued, the Labour Department said yesterday.
The figures left Wall Street analysts uncertain about the outlook for
short-term interest rates, currently 3 per cent.
Following ambiguous remarks by senior monetary officials, some analysts
predict the Federal Reserve will respond to evidence of faster growth by
nudging rates higher early next year. Others believe inflation is so subdued
the Fed will delay action for many months.
'The inflation outlook remains benign,' said Mr David Resler, chief
economist at Nomura Securities in New York. There was a 50 per cent chance
the Fed would tighten policy next month - the decision would depend on the
strength of economic data in coming weeks.
The producer price index for finished goods was unchanged last month after a
decline of 0.2 per cent in October. The lack of upward price pressure partly
reflected the recent decline in world oil prices which led to a 2.7 per cent
decline in US energy costs.
The 'core' producer price index, which excludes the volatile components of
food and energy, rose 0.4 per cent last month, more than expected in
financial markets. However, this reflected a 2.1 per cent increase in car
prices last month, which is not expected to recur in coming months.
It was the first rise in the core index since July and followed a 0.5 per
cent decline in October.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Elections in Russia: Fascist party enters Russian nightmares

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
If Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the leader of Russia's extreme right-wing
Liberal Democratic party, does as well as two separate surveys conducted
this week indicate, the charismatic politician could command the second
largest bloc in the Russian parliament.
And if Mr Zhirinovsky forms an alliance with the Communists and the
Agrarians, who share his tough nationalist stance, hardliners could end up
controlling more than a quarter of the seats in parliament.
Even in this nightmare scenario, the extreme right would be less powerful
than the combined forces of the hitherto divided democrats. Mr Yegor
Gaidar's Russia's Choice group is still leading the polls and Mr Grigory
Yavlinsky's 'Yabloko' grouping, which advocates a different strategy for
market reforms, is coming in third. If the constitution is accepted on
Sunday, it would also give Mr Yeltsin the final say in forming the
government.
However, even in opposition, the hardline parties could exert a powerful,
and unsavoury, influence on the overall direction of Russian politics. Apart
from his promises to make life economically comfortable for all, Mr
Zhirinovsky's other trump card in the election campaign has been his pledge
to renew Russia as a great state.
'Russian soldiers will once again stand guard along the 1975 borders of the
Soviet Union, and, once we put them there, they will not move back a single
step,' a tired but triumphant Mr Zhirinovsky declared yesterday. 'The world
should think twice before opposing us - after all, is it really desirable to
have a third world war?'
Statements like these are standard fare for Mr Zhirinovsky. Bombastic and
outrageous though they may sound to western ears, for a significant number
of Russian voters, who have impotently watched both their country and their
pay cheques shrink over the past two years, Mr Zhirinovsky's message appears
to offer an attractive third way, - rejecting both the Communists and the
economic reform programmes of Russia's tried and tested democratic
politicians.
Mr Zhirinovsky says that he will not form a coalition with any other group.
Indeed, his campaign strategy is to remind voters that he represents a
'clean, untainted alternative' to both the communist past and the democratic
present. However, in foreign policy at least, he has a natural ally in Mr
Gennady Zyuganov's Communists, whose favourite 'ism' is nationalism.
Mssrs Zhirinovsky and Zyuganov enjoy another political advantage: both are
leaders of parties in which loyalty is the paramount virtue and thus are
likely to command more disciplined blocs in parliament than the more
independently-minded democratic groups.
Their combination of discipline and demagoguery could give these hardline
parties the power to push Russia's entire political spectrum to the right
and force Russian democrats to adopt a harder line in their relations with
the rest of the world.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Elections in Russia: Tatars resist Moscow's brand of
democracy - Tatarstan adopted its own constitution a year ago and rejects
Russia's attempts at centralised control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Republic of Tatarstan is at the centre of the debate within Russia on
the form of its new constitution. The constitution, which will be voted on
by referendum on Sunday, at the same time as the parliamentary elections, is
of as much import as the parliament itself, and designed to last much
longer.
Tatarstan - the historic home of the Tatars, who in the Middle Ages
controlled much of European Russia - adopted its own constitution a little
over a year ago. This proclaims the republic as 'sovereign', deigning to
say, once, that it is 'associated' with Russia. Professor Vadim Tumanov, a
senior member of the Institute of State and Law and one of the experts who
helped to draw up the present draft Russian constitution, says that
Tatarstan's constitution breaches international norms for a federal state in
two important ways. First, by giving Tatars citizenship of Russia but
refusing reciprocal citizenship to Russians, he said, and second, by
accepting only those Russian laws which are approved by its own parliament.
A long period of sporadic negotiations followed the adoption of this
essentially separatist document, but left the main constitutional problems
untouched. Then came the banning of the Russian parliament in September, and
the suppression of its revolt on October 3 and 4.
'Yeltsin could have turned to the regions and republics for support and
agreement. Instead, he chose to issue a centralist constitution for a
unitary state. The people about him call themselves democrats but their
attitude to the regions reveals their true nature,' says Mr Vassily
Likhachev, the vice-president of Tatarstan, who was in Moscow recently.
Tatarstan's president, Mr Mintimer Shamiyev, himself went to Moscow on
November 3 to try to gain some constitutional compromises, but was rebuffed.
However, the Tatar authorities are cautious men, schooled in the politics of
the Communist party - in which nearly all of them were leading figures -
which emphasises above all the necessity to recognise power when they see
it. Theirs is the route of sullen, not overt, opposition - certainly not
that taken by the other extreme dissenter from Russian statehood, Chechnya,
where President Dzhokar Dudayev has banned both elections and the referendum
on his territory. Instead, Mr Shamiyev has said he will not vote: Mr
Likhachev will be on holiday; and the mayor of Kazan, Mr Kamil Iskhakov -
tipped to be the next Tatar prime minister - 'doubts' he will vote.
Thus the election preparations take place in something of a vacuum. The
authorities are keen to point out the apathy and lack of interest.
Among those standing in single-member constituencies or on party lists for
the State Duma, or lower house, are those who have carried on the rather
isolated business of opposing Tatarstan's drive to 'sovereignty' over the
past three years.
They work in a rather threatening atmosphere. Mr Dmitri Fomin, a candidate
in the industrial centre of Naberezhnye Chelny, shows a leaflet.
It is put out by the 'Special Headquarters against the Russian Referendum',
which threatens 'the fate of traitors and provocateurs' to all those -
candidates, election officers and voters - who take part in the referendum.
The newspaper of the 'Sovereignty' bloc of nationalist parties says that to
take part in the elections 'is a betrayal of the state interests of our
fatherland'.
President Shamiyev and his fellow leaders are convinced that the feeling of
pride in and support for Tatarstan's sovereignty has increased, not lessened
 -though the republic's 4m population numbers only a few more Tatars than
Russians, and inter-marriage is very common. Mr Iskhakov, the Kazan mayor,
says that people rejoice in their citizenship because of the chaos and wild
prices they see in Russia.
The leaders bridle when it is suggested that they are going slow on economic
reform: Mr Shamiyev insists that 'the steady way to reform has proven itself
here, as shock therapy has been shown to fail in Russia'. Privatisation is
going ahead (though not yet of shops and small businesses): the republic's
most precious property, the Tatneft oil corporation which produces some 22m
tonnes of oil a year, is now being privatised - though a controlling golden
share, will stay with the government.
'We say to all serious investors - come and talk to us, we will do a deal,'
says Mr Marat Almukhametev, a department head at the State Property
Committee offices 'But they must be serious. What's the point of selling off
to speculators and crooks, like they are doing in Russia. Why repeat their
mistakes?' The impression is of a leadership which may indeed avoid some of
the more egregious mistakes of reform, but which is attempting to hold back
the tide.
The turnout for the elections and the referendum probably will be low: it
was little over 20 per cent for the referendum in April, when the country
voted on trust in the Russian president. This will allow the republic's
leadership to point to a large majority of abstentions from the Russian
political process, which they will use to bolster their own power.

European leaders yesterday feted President Boris Yeltsin as the incarnation
of a new Russia moving toward democracy and market reform.
At a ceremony at the European Commissionm, Mr Jean Luc Dehaene, Belgian
prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
joined Mr Yeltsin in signing a political declaration promising greater
economic and political co-operation which both sides described as historic.
Mr Yeltsin said the declaration marked a further milestone ending the Cold
War. 'Another Berlin Wall has fallen,' he said.
But the declaration fell short of Mr Yeltsin's hopes of signing a
comprehensive trade pact because of outstanding EU objections to Russian
legislation restricting the operation of western banks, and internal
disputes over the treatment of Russian nuclear-processed fuels.
Commission officials predicted that final agreement would likely be reached
in the next few days. The visiting Russian delegation had promised to scrap
the restrictions on private banks within 12 months, one senior official
said.
Mr Yeltsin's visit, on the eve of Russia's parliamentary elections on
Sunday, is believed to be the first by a Russian leader to Belgium since
Peter the Great.

Employers and trade unions in Germany are facing a 'crisis of consensus' and
must now overhaul their entire system of over-regulated wage-bargaining, the
country's leading employers' spokesman said yesterday.
Mr Klaus Murmann, president of the federation of German employers (BDA),
called for a prolonged onslaught on the high costs of industry, including
not simply wages, but the whole array of fringe benefits, holiday
entitlement, and social security payments.
He warned that more than 6m people would be either officially unemployed, or
working in 'disguised unemployment' on job creation schemes or retraining
programmes by the end of 1994. For employers to create more jobs, and revive
the level of investment, they needed more flexibility from the unions, the
public sector, and in their own thinking.
Mr Murmann, who was re-elected with a large majority to the post he has held
since 1986, also called for a switch in the whole system of financing job
creation and training in eastern Germany. He backed the opposition Social
Democratic party, and the union movement, in proposing that such schemes
should be financed by direct taxation, and not by increased unemployment
benefits as at present.
He was speaking as latest figures published for insolvencies in German
industry showed a new record level in the past year, with the numbers still
rising. In the first nine months west German company insolvencies rose by
29.5 per cent compared with the same period of 1992, to a total of 9,284.
In September, the monthly figure was 1,101, an increase of 38.3 per cent on
September, 1992, reflecting the effects of the sharpest recession in the
German economy since the second world war.
Mr Murmann warned that the country was showing excessive pessimism about the
state of the economy. At the same time, the willingness of the private
sector to invest was undermined by the soaring public sector debt: he
predicted that even today the federal government's revenue expectations
would prove excessively optimistic, given the economic recession and the
sharp rise in unemployment.
Mr Murmann's comments, coming just as the wage round is getting under way,
seem likely to anger the leading trade unions, who fear employer pressure to
break the long-standing social consensus.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Spain has a head start on Delors plan for job creation

<TEXT>
Prime minister Felipe Gonzalez, who is grappling with the worst unemployment
record in the European Union, has only an academic interest in discussing Mr
Jacques Delors' white paper on competitiveness, growth and job creation at
today's Brussels summit, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
This is because the Spanish leader has already begun to implement many
measures advocated by Mr Delors.
As Spain enters its second year of recession, Mr Gonzalez has unveiled a
legislative package that aims to curb union bargaining power, reduce costs
of hiring and firing, make it easier to relocate employees and make job
classifications more flexible. The government also plans to peg wage rises
to below the inflation rate over the next three years.
Parliament will debate a draft law to deregulate labour laws when it
reassembles after Christmas. A law which came into effect this week
introduces an apprenticeship scheme for under-25s, who will get less than
the minimum wage for three years, and removes impedi- ments to part-time
work.
But the Brussels discussion will help Mr Gonzalez to sell his package to
Spaniards. 'The white paper is a useful umbrella to withstand the storm,'
said a diplomat. The main critics, the unions, accuse the government of
creating 'junk jobs' and are planning a 24-hour general strike next month.
The government is determined to push its reforms through. It believes the
malaise afflicting the EU economy is sharper in Spain, where labour market
rigidities are deeply ingrained and labour costs are considered to have
risen faster than elsewhere.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Trans-Euro networks move up the agenda: EU ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until 'trans-European networks' appeared in the European Commission's white
paper on growth, competitiveness and employment published this week, the
European Union's new infrastructure policy had tended to go unnoticed by
politicians and citizens.
The networks are the building blocks of a united Europe. They are huge
infrastructure projects in roads, rail, energy, and telecommunications the
purpose of which is to move people, goods and information more easily around
the single European market and forge closer links with eastern Europe.
The white paper calls for 'joint, massive and sustained effort on the part
of the authorities at all levels and of private operators' to establish this
infrastructure across the EU.
But it is the white paper's estimate that Ecu400bn (Pounds 304.8bn) of
direct public and private investment could be 'mobilised' for such networks
by 1999 which has guaranteed that Union leaders, flanked by budget-conscious
finance ministers, will take a close look at what this spending could
involve when they discuss the issue at their summit today.
Last Sunday the Commission provoked an uproar by presenting European finance
ministers with plans for EU spending of around Ecu124bn on the projects over
the next six years, including a scheme for the Commission to borrow on the
international capital markets.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, complained that the plans
had been slipped into Mr Jacques Delors' white paper without proper scrutiny
by finance ministers.
In effect tying the hands of Mr John Major, the British prime minister,
before today's EU summit in Brussels, Mr Clarke declared: 'The governments
of Europe will not conceivably expect to agree new arrangements for
borrowing between Ecu20bn a year without so much as a sheet of paper on the
table.'
Mr Clarke chose to ignore that most of the money for trans-European networks
has already been earmarked in the seven-year 'Delors II' budget agreed a
year ago, while the principle of subsidised lending for big infrastructure
projects is incorporated in the Maastricht treaty itself.
The real source of controversy lies in the Commission's plan to use its
Triple-A credit rating to raise money at cheap rates for lending on to
governments to fund trans-European networks.
Supporters argue that Brussels has in the past raised money to help
governments such as Italy and Greece with balance of payments difficulties;
but other Commission officials admit that raising money for public works
programmes risks duplication with the European Investment Bank, the
principal funding agency for infrastructure projects.
On the other hand, the Commission claims that about Ecu20bn will be needed
to fund trans-European networks. According to official calculations,
Ecu5.3bn is already earmarked in the budget, with the EIB expected to lend a
further Ecu6.7bn a year. This leaves a financing gap of Ecu8bn to be plugged
with the so-called 'Brussels bonds'.
Mr Delors insists that trans-European networks are not a job creation
scheme, but more a medium-term project for strengthening European
competitiveness. He argues that raising Ecu8bn a year will send only a
ripple across the international bond markets and not affect interest rates.
'If a German minister is against, then I may remind you that to fund German
unification they did not need 8bn a year, but 40bn to 50bn.'
Even if financing is agreed, the ideal of trans-European networks has
already run up against several problems.
First, there is a problem with co-ordination. Trans-European networks -
unlike the Commission's visionary single market project - are not the
responsibility of a single commissioner. Ministerial votes on individual
projects are split between at least four councils - transport, telecoms,
energy and internal market - with research ministers controlling the
separate R&amp;D budget.
Those councils have already started to chip away at the wider vision of
unified networks serving a European 'information society'. On Monday, for
example, research ministers decided to cut the proportion of the 1994-1998
research and development budget which will be spent on information and
communications technologies from 36 per cent to 28 per cent.
On Tuesday, to the irritation of Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner,
telecoms ministers rejected a proposal for an electronic network linking
national administrations on the grounds that the Commission had not done
enough homework on the real need for such a network.
Some of the projects also depend on the success of controversial
liberalisation of protected utilities. Proposals to link up electricity and
gas networks across borders, for example, look fine on paper but such links
will be relatively unused unless the Commission's controversial plans to
liberalise the EU energy market are also agreed.
The willingness of the private sector to fund large infrastructure projects
also varies. In the telecoms sector, for example, large companies are eager
to help set up networks, but constructions groups require more effective
guarantees before attempting large road or bridge projects.
The risk, as the Commission is aware, is that the combination of a row about
public money, a reluctance to liberalise, and a lack of private-sector
finance might undermine the employment benefits of the project and leave
Europe with an unhappy patchwork of half-finished networks.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Nuclear power row renewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Germany's most modern, and hitherto most useless, nuclear
power plant is back in the firing line, in a new confrontation over nuclear
energy.
The power station at Mulheim-Karlich, owned by RWE, Germany's largest
electricity utility, has stood idle since it was virtually completed in
1988, because of a refusal by the local authorities to grant the necessary
operating licences.
RWE is threatening to sue the state government of the Rhineland-Palatinate -
headed by Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the opposition Social Democratic
party in Bonn - for some DM500m (Pounds 198m) in lost revenues and
accumulated financing costs for the plant. It was ready to come on stream a
year after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which saw a complete standstill
on all new nuclear projects in Germany.
Now Mr Klaus Topfer, federal environment minister in Bonn, is threatening to
take the Rhineland-Palatinate government to the constitutional court. He has
ordered Ms Claudia Martini, his counterpart in Mainz, the state capital, to
rescind her decision refusing to give a long-term operating licence to the
plant, on the grounds that she is exceeding her statutory authority.
Ms Martini is refusing to back down, insisting that it is the federal
government, not the state, which is at fault.
The new grounds for her refusal to license the power station concern the
failure of RWE, and the federal government, to ensure a clear means of
disposing of the nuclear waste which will be generated by its operation.
At present, nuclear waste in Germany is supposed to be reprocessed under
contracts with France, and with Britain's BNFL, for eventual re-use in
Germany as mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel elements. However, there remains no
long-term solution for the disposal of the residual nuclear waste, and
manufacture of the MOX elements has also been blocked by the SPD-Green
government in neighbouring Hesse.

FT  10 DEC 93 / EU walks a tightrope on global trade deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union leaders face the delicate task at their Brussels summit today
and tomorrow of buying off France and other member states adamant that the
Gatt world trade deal now in sight will damage vital national interests.
The 12 heads of government will need carefully crafted formulae to satisfy
demands the EU will mostly have to meet internally, without breaking a
European budget already at its limit.
French insistence on a guarantee that EU farmers will not have to 'set
aside' or take any more land out of production under a Gatt deal could prove
potentially the most expensive. The most divisive issue is likely to be the
Franco-Spanish demand that the EU equip itself with tougher anti-dumping and
safeguard weapons against unfair trading, as well as trade retaliation
instruments to match the US Section 301 legislation.
On both counts, Paris could collide with Bonn, which is firmly against new
EU trade weapons and fears that the set-aside condition could lead to a
further drop in EU farm prices which would hit inefficient German farmers.
Portugal feels the EU has failed to reduce significantly US protection of
its textile industry, and wants aid to restructure its own, large textiles
sector.
Greece, which is said to own 40 per cent of the world shipping fleet,
believes the Gatt deal on maritime transport will allow the US to remain
protectionist in ocean shipping. The deal 'will raise the costs and
inefficiency of international maritime transport', says Mr Theodoros
Pangalos, Greek alternate foreign minister. Greece may also seek
compensation.
On the farm question, if the EU's reform of its common agricultural policy
works, European farmers should be able to evade the 21 per cent Gatt cuts in
subsidised food exports.
The reform's production cuts - through set-aside - mean the EU should be
exporting less than the Gatt limits, and its goal of lowering prices to
world market levels means the EU could export as much as it wants without
subsidy anyway.
If this forecast proves wrong, France wants even lower prices rather than
more set-aside, plus full compensation for the price cut. And each Ecu10 gap
between EU and world prices would cost the Union Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.52bn). The
Commission is confident enough of its forecasts to believe a commitment to
Paris will cost nothing, but the main EU paymasters, Germany and Britain,
are less sanguine. 'I can live with any wording which has no cost to the UK
taxpayer. If it looks like a cheque book I'm not signing,' one senior
British official said.
Bonn apart, attitudes are less hard on trade weapons. A Uruguay Round deal
should see the Gatt succeeded by a Multilateral Trade Organisation, which
would license all signatories' use of such weapons, so that new European
defences would go into an internationally policed mutual deterrence system.
The US is still reluctant to place its 301 arsenal under an MTO. The
question is, one EU diplomat said, 'does European rearmament make US
disarmament less likely?'
A possible solution is to make any new EU trade weapons conditional on
securing a satisfactory MTO in the Geneva negotiations - provided Bonn
concedes the principle. But German officials have hinted for some time that
if the French dig in, Chancellor Helmut Kohl could give in.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Summit faces discord over Gatt and jobs: Two-day meeting of
European Union leaders opens in Brussels today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European leaders gather today for a two-day summit likely to be disrupted by
internal rows over the cost of the world trade deal now within sight.
Further tensions are expected to surface in the debate on how to tackle the
continent-wide unemployment crisis, and over a white paper on jobs and
growth prepared by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission.
The summit is likely to expose an ideological fault line in the EU, based on
the degree of labour market deregulation necessary to create jobs and the
cost of infrastructure investment needed to make Europe more competitive.
On Gatt, the 12 member states must accommodate France's insistence that its
farmers will not have to take more land out of production to meet the
requirements of a new world accord on subsidised food exports.
This has pitted Paris against Bonn, which is also resisting French demands
that the EU put in place trade defence mechanisms as tough as those of the
US.
France's hard line has encouraged other member states such as Portugal,
Greece and Spain to put pressure on their partners for compensation over
shortcomings in the likely Gatt accord on textiles, maritime transport and
Mediterranean farm produce.
Belgium, which holds the rotating EU presidency, will push hard for a
commitment to act on the conclusions of Mr Delors' white paper.
'There is quite a lot of agreement on the orientation; the debate will
centre on the financing of it,' a senior Belgian official said.
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, is expected to try to paint Mr Delors'
blueprint as a free-spending, interventionist recipe. But other British
officials at the summit played down the likelihood of confrontation and
described the white paper as an intellectually respectable document.
Another source of contention is Mr Delors' proposal for the EU to spend up
to Ecu20bn (Pounds 15.2bn) a year to the end of the century as a catalyst
for heavy pan-European investment in roads, rail, energy, environment and
advanced information networks. The projects are to be funded partly through
new EU bonds amounting to Ecu8bn a year.
Britain may get backing from Germany to oppose the new bonds, but French
officials predicted that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would support the scheme on
the basis of a yearly review. The budget-conscious Dutch have already
signalled support.
In London Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, attacked Mr Delors' plans,
saying there was no evidence of the need for EU borrowing for infrastructure
improvements across Europe.

Mr Jack Lang, the flamboyant former French arts minister who was one of the

forced to relinquish his parliamentary seat for spending too much on his
campaign in the March legislative elections.
The French constitutional council ordered Mr Lang, 54, a friend of President
Francois Mitterrand to resign immediately his seat at Loir-et-Cher after
finding he had exceeded by FFr90,000 (Pounds 10,285) the FFr500,000 maximum
French MPs are allowed for campaign expenses. A by-election will be held
within three months.
Mr Lang, deputy prime minister and education minister in the previous
socialist administration, vowed to return to politics as soon as possible.
The constitutional council has banned him from standing for parliament for a
year.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Northern League loses clean image after arrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The populist Northern League has been deeply embarrassed by the disclosure
that Mr Alessandro Patelli, the movement's former treasurer, failed to
declare L200m (Pounds 80,700) received from the Ferruzzi-Montedison group
for the 1992 general elections.
The rise in the League's popularity in northern Italy has been based in good
measure on its image of honesty and rejection of corruption.
Mr Patelli, who managed the 1992 general election campaign finances for the
League, was arrested and imprisoned on Tuesday on charges of illicit party
funding. He was released on Wednesday after he reportedly confessed to
receiving L200m from Ferruzzi-Montedison. His alleged confession was given
widespread coverage in yesterday's media.
Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader, who has consistently claimed his
party's finances were above suspicion, has been quick to defend Mr Patelli,
a close aide, and declare his faith in the Milan magistrates conducting the
investigation. He has also denied suggestions he might have discussed
contributions to the League during a meeting with Mr Carlo Sama, the head of
Montedison.
Mr Francesco Speroni, head of the League group in the senate, said: 'We must
see if Patelli took these monies for the League or for some company which he
ran - if it is the second thesis, then it is no longer a question of illicit
financing of the party.
'If on the other hand, the money ended up with the League, then this was
irregular and Patelli would be at fault.'
The affair comes at a delicate moment for the League, with the movement
divided over whether it should seek political alliances to fight the next
general election.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, has been making overtures to form a
new centre-right political alliance including the League.

main critics, the unions, accuse the government of creating 'junk jobs' and
are planning a 24-hour general strike next month.
But the government is determined to push its reforms through. It believes
the general malaise afflicting the EU economy is sharper in Spain where
labour market rigidities are deeply ingrained and labour costs are
considered to have risen more quickly than elsewhere.
The two ills are blamed for waning multinational interest. Direct foreign
investment last year was nearly two thirds down on 1991, half that of the
previous two years and at its lowest since 1987. Investment from OECD
countries fell again in the first half of this year.
The experience of Madrid corporate law firm J &amp; A Garrigues exemplifies
Spain's declining competitiveness. In the past six months five
multinationals seeking industrial bases for big investments have passed
through the firm and, according to senior partner Mr Antonio Garrigues, one
settled for the Czech Republic, another for Scotland, two went to Portugal
and a fifth is undecided but has ruled Spain out. 'Three years ago at least
two of the five would have chosen a Spanish location,' Mr Garrigues said.
In the meantime unemployment stood was 3.5m at the end of September,
representing 23 per cent of the working population. This figure from the
national statistics office masks considerable employment in the informal, or
submerged, economy but is nevertheless the highest in the EU.

<TEXT>
European Union energy ministers appear close to solving a long-running
dispute with Norway, which had threatened to derail EU membership
negotiations.
The ministers will today seek a compromise on plans to liberalise the
licensing of oil and gas exploration. 'Given the amount of progress we have
made in the past six or seven weeks, I would be very surprised if it were
not possible to do a deal,' said one EU official yesterday.
Political agreement today would help clear a potential obstacle to Norway
joining the EU. Sovereignty over its natural resources ranks with fisheries
and agricultural policy as an issue which could derail entry talks.
Norway was not directly involved in talks on the hydrocarbons licensing
directive, but it found an EU ally in Denmark. Both countries' systems for
granting special privileges to their state-owned energy companies were
threatened by the directive. Denmark had hinted it would veto the measure if
dissatisfied.
It is understood that Norway is now prepared to open new contracts to
greater EU competition. Norwegian officials said yesterday they would
reserve judgment until they saw the final decision of EU member states. They
will also insist that a protocol is added to the treaty admitting Norway to
the EU, to stress the importance of its sovereignty over natural resources.
Denmark, meanwhile, has agreed to allow open competition into its oil and
gas-fields when the existing system comes up for renewal early next century.
British and French ministers will today try to ensure that government
regulation of the sector is clearly separated from the commercial role of
state-owned companies, to prevent covert discrimination.
Mr Tim Eggar, the UK energy minister, said the directive would also resolve
a long-running dispute and make clear that EU member states have full
sovereignty over their continental shelfs.
Separately, ministers will have their first discussion of the European
Commission's revised proposals on opening EU electricity and gas markets to
competition.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Mediators forced to drop plan for all-party Bosnia talks
</HEADLINE>

International mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg yesterday
abandoned plans to resume all-party talks on Bosnia's partition after secret
meetings with Serb leaders in Belgrade failed to achieve a breakthrough.
Mr John Mills, spokesman for the peace talks, said the mediators 'hoped to
be in a position' to reconvene talks among the three warring communities in
the week beginning December 20.
However, Commission officials said President Slobodan Milosevic was using
the European Union plan, which Lord Owen is promoting as the basis for a
settlement, to press for a division of Sarajevo. The plan links a
progressive lifting of sanctions against Serbia with some territorial gains
for the Moslems.
Mr Hans Van den Broek, EU external political affairs commissioner, yesterday
warned that Serb territorial claims on Sarjevo risked creating 'a second
Berlin or Beirut' in Europe. The EU must not be party to the division of
Sarajevo in the Geneva peace talks, he said. It was a matter of principle,
since Sarejevo remained an example of a multi-ethnic city in Bosnia.
The peace negotiators faced a difficult dilemma in their effort to reach a
settlement, and the EU could not object to an agreement signed by all the
parties. But he noted that the Bosnian Moslems were negotiating 'with a gun
to their head'.
His remarks came after a series of bilateral talks which failed to break the
deadlock over proposed frontiers of the republic's partition into three
ethnic ministates. 'The Serbs apparently did not give enough for the Moslems
to be happy enough for them to meet,' said a diplomat.
Earlier, diplomats had said that if the talks with Mr Milosevic and his
Bosnian Serb proxies went well, the three parties would meet this weekend in
Thessaloniki, Greece.
However, at yesterday's talks, which Serbian sources said were held at
Dobanovci, a military base 30km west of Belgrade, the mediators apparently
failed to wring concessions from Serb leaders for their Moslem adversaries.
While the mediators press Serb leaders to hand over more land, General Ratko
Mladic, Bosnian Serb commander, has ruled out giving up any territory,
including the 20 per cent pledged three months ago.
But Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, was reported by a Belgrade
newspaper yesterday as saying: 'There are real possibilities that the war in
former Bosnia-Hercegovina will end in January or February next year, and the
lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia will follow.'

FT  10 DEC 93 / Paramount bid battle thrown open by US court verdict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Delaware supreme court threw open the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn)
takeover battle for entertainment group Paramount Communications for a fresh
round of bidding last night when it ordered the creation of a level playing
field between the company's rival suitors, Viacom and QVC Network.
The supreme court's verdict is a victory for QVC, a television shopping
channel headed by film industry figure Mr Barry Diller, which had asked the
courts to remove various defences placed in the way of its offer by
Paramount. The judgment also represents a significant elaboration of US
takeover law.
The supreme court upheld a ruling on November 24 by the Delaware chancery
court, which blocked a friendly takeover of Paramount by Viacom because the
Paramount board had not adequately considered a higher but hostile offer
from QVC.
Yesterday's ruling is expected to lead to a fresh round of bids by Viacom
and QVC, with victory going to the company with the highest final offer.
Viacom's current bid is worth about Dollars 9.5bn and QVC's about Dollars
10bn.
Paramount said last night it would 'promptly establish procedures applicable
to all bidders for an orderly and fair process'. The key question in the
hearing was QVC's contention that Paramount's takeover agreement with Viacom
obliged Paramount's board to seek the highest offer.
Paramount argued against this on the grounds that its deal with Viacom was a
'strategic merger' offering better long-term benefits to the combined group.
The supreme court, upholding the lower court ruling, said the agreement with
Viacom amounted to a change of control of Paramount because the majority of
voting shares in the group would be held by Mr Sumner Redstone, Viacom's
chairman.
Control by Mr Redstone of the surviving entity would provide him with the
power to break up the company or buy out minority stockholders 'irrespective
of the present board's vision of a long-term strategic alliance'.
In these circumstances, the Paramount board was obliged to seek the highest
offer for shareholders, yet it had failed to consider properly the QVC
offer.
The supreme court affirmed the lower court's decision to throw out a special
stock option programme, currently worth some Dollars 400m, which Paramount
gave to Viacom in the original merger agreement.
The court said this, and other defensive measures, were 'improperly designed
to deter other potential bidders'. It let stand another agreement under
which Paramount will give Viacom Dollars 100m if its bid fails.
The Paramount case was the most important takeover issue to come before the
court since the battle for control of publishing group Time Inc in 1989.
In that case, the court ruled that Time was not obliged to accept a hostile
offer from Paramount instead of a lower-priced, friendly merger with Warner
Brothers which the board felt offered better long-term value.
Paramount argued yesterday that the Time precedent applied to its current
case. But the supreme court judgment makes clear this is not so when control
of a company changes hands.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Poll shows election strength of Russian neo-fascists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's neo-fascist party could become the second-largest faction in the
parliament which Russia will elect on Sunday, according to a survey by one
of Russia's more authoritative pollsters.
A poll by the All-Russian Centre for Public Opinion Research, which cannot
be published inside Russia in the week before elections, gave Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic party 14 per cent support among voters who
have decided how they will vote.
Mr Zhirinovsky's party is anything but liberal-democratic, promising to
conquer Russia's neighbours, including Turkey, to gain access to warm-water
ports. Domestically, he is offering Russians who feel impoverished and
humiliated an alternative to the Communists of the discredited past and to
the various democratic parties which are promising ambitious market reforms
with varying degrees of pain.
The poll puts the extreme nationalist leader behind Russia's Choice, headed
by deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar, with 22.3 per cent support.
It coincided with warnings of 'a new round of struggle and new conflicts'
from President Boris Yeltsin if Russians failed to support the constitution,
which would give him sweeping powers, in a referendum, also on Sunday.
However, Mr Sergei Yuzhenkov, deputy head of the federal information centre
and an organiser of Russia's Choice, said even if Mr Zhirinovsky did well,
Mr Yeltsin would be free to choose whatever government he pleased.
He added that if the constitution - which empowers the president to dissolve
parliament if it turns down his candidate for prime minister - was rejected,
Mr Yeltsin would continue to rule by decree until the new basic law was
pushed through parliament.
Although Russian polls tend to be less reliable than those in the west, this
survey indicates the effectiveness of Mr Zhirinovsky's homespun campaign in
exploiting the weariness of Russian voters with their present rulers.
Mr Gaidar said this week he feared the new State Duma would be as difficult
as the old Supreme Soviet dissolved by Mr Yeltsin. Yesterday, he said such
results would confirm his warnings of the dangers of the divisions among
Russian democrats who put personal ambition ahead of the country's
interests.
The poll puts Mr Grigory Yavlinsky's reformist Yabloko bloc in third place
with 13.6 per cent, followed by the conservative Democratic Party of Russia
and the Communists with 7.8 per cent and 7.7 per cent respectively.
Together, all democrats who favour similar market reforms would barely
scrape together half of the seats in a new parliament, according to the
poll.
Apart from Mr Yavlinsky, the two other parties which would constitute
natural allies for Russia's Choice are the Russian Party of Unity and
Accord, headed by deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai, and the Democratic
Reform Movement headed by the St Petersburg mayor Mr Anatoly Sobchak.

FT  10 DEC 93 / Civil service opened to bidding: Government gives go-ahead
to privatisation of 140 Whitehall agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday gave the go-ahead for the privatisation of large
parts of the Whitehall machine by inviting bids for more than 140 executive
agencies.
The agencies currently employ 430,000 civil servants, almost 80 per cent of
the civil service, on activities ranging from the payment of benefits to the
servicing of the armed forces' equipment.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, said the civil service
could be reduced within a few years to a core of 50,000 policymakers buying
in public services from both the public and private sectors.
The move represents a victory for cabinet ministers favouring radical
reforms of the civil service. Numbers of white-collar civil servants rose
last year, while the market-testing programme has produced much smaller
savings than expected.
After pressure from the Treasury and Downing Street, much greater emphasis
is now to be put on privatising public services instead of creating new
agencies. Each existing agency will also be considered for privatisation
when it comes up for the three-yearly review of its progress.
Outsiders will be invited to participate in these reviews, in effect
inviting them to come forward with bids. To increase private-sector
interest, the reviews will be announced so that bids can be made.
A white paper published yesterday on the agencies lists 92 *something in
here (HP) *
already in operation, 36 of which are currently under review. A further 24
will be reviewed next year. The names of 36 new agencies are also listed -
mainly in defence - where outside interest would be welcomed.
Ms Elizabeth Symons of the First Division Association, the top civil
servants' union, described the proposals as a clear departure from
government policy so far.
'They are dressed up to look innocuous but herald a full-scale privatisation
of everything from defence communications to core activities like the Crown
Prosecution Service,' she said.
'This is a time-bomb ticking away under the responsible provision of public
services controlled by ministers accountable to parliament.'
However, there was a welcome for the new approach from contractors.
Mr Charles Cox of Hoskyns, the information technology company, last month
criticised the tendering process for being too prescriptive and discouraging
innovative bids. Last night he said he was very pleased to see that the
government had taken contractors' criticisms to heart.
Mr John Staples of EDS-Scicon, part of the world's largest contracted
services provider, said that he would review the list with great interest.
'This offers a new way of getting value and quality into the public
services, by focusing more on the services to be delivered than on how they
are currently done,' he said.
Mr Rod Aldridge of Capita said that it was a natural development in
extending the scope for competition in providing public services.

FT  10 DEC 93 / EU reacts angrily to shipping offer in trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of liberalising international trade in services in the Uruguay Round
talks were thrown into disarray yesterday when negotiators reacted angrily
to details of the US offer on shipping.
Other important services sectors such as banking and securities have been
the subject of controversy for several weeks, and the US and European Union
remain at loggerheads over access to Europe's film and television market. If
shipping drops off the negotiating table, Geneva officials acknowledged the
services deal would be in tatters.
EU trade negotiators aroused consternation yesterday by saying they would
finalise tariff-cutting deals with just 15 to 20 countries before the
Uruguay Round deadline next Wednesday.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, insisted the EU 'must find the time, and the personnel, to bring
the Round to a conclusion' on time.
The EU thought it had won an important concession from Washington on ocean
shipping in talks on Monday in Brussels between Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart. But angry EU
negotiators discovered yesterday the offer amounted to less than they had
believed.
One US official claimed there had been an 'unintentional misunderstanding'.
The US has agreed only to include cargo reservation systems in the services
package, about 3 per cent of the ocean shipping sector. Even here, the offer
is only a commitment not to tighten restrictions, which reserve 75 per cent
of the business for US flagged ships.
'It looks like maritime is going to be out of the Round,' said one gloomy EU
negotiator. 'The US position is killing negotiations in this sector.'
Liberalisation of shipping services is a key demand for EU members, Denmark
and Greece, as well as the Nordic countries.
The EU says it will withdraw its own offer on maritime services, which is
conditional on a 'critical mass' of other countries also liberalising their
shipping sectors, if Washington does not put a better deal on the table.
Trade officials fear that if one key services sector is 'carved out' of the
Uruguay Round liberalisation package, others will follow.
The EU has served notice that, despite partial agreement with the US in
Brussels on Monday, it may not be able to resist French pressure to keep the
sensitive audio-visual sector out of the Round.
One trade official said: 'If the US and the EU really do fall out over
maritime and audio-visual services, then this is a very dangerous
development indeed. The two need to get back around a table and cobble this
together.'
Trade diplomats are also critical of Washington's stand on financial
services, where the US aims to grant unrestricted access to its banking and
securities market only to countries providing full access to the US
financial services industry.

<TEXT>
The German government yesterday abandoned a key measure to curb the rise in
social spending, by agreeing not to set a strict time-limit on
earnings-related unemployment benefits.
The plan, which had aroused widespread anger in the trade union movement,
was dropped as part of a last-minute compromise to enable the overall
government savings package, cutting some DM20bn (Pounds 7.9bn) from next
year's federal budget, to become law.
The deal was possible thanks to what amounts to a 'grand coalition' between
the government and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), who had blocked
the savings package with their majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of
parliament.
However, the Free Democrats (FDP) in the ruling coalition warned that now a
further DM2.5bn would have to be cut from government spending, if the
federal deficit was to be kept under DM70bn next year.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, had sought to impose a maximum
four-years limit on earnings-related unemployment benefits, while at the
same time cutting the benefits by some three percentage points as a
proportion of income.
The compromise was thrashed out in the early hours of yesterday morning in
the conciliation committee of the two houses of the federal parliament, the
Bundestag and Bundesrat.
The lower levels of unemployment benefit will still come into effect next
year.

FT  09 DEC 93 / MPs pass six-hour Sunday shopping for stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs last night voted to allow large stores to open for up to six hours on
Sundays and small shops to open all day, ending years of law breaking by
retail chains.
After an emotional debate on the Sunday Trading Bill, the Commons rejected
alternative plans for complete deregulation or tight restrictions which
would have closed all but the smallest shops.
The decision was taken on a free vote conceded by the government after the
failure of two previous attempts to reform the ignored 1950 Shops Act.
It was welcomed by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, an alliance of large
retailers which campaigned strongly for the six-hour option.
Baroness Jay, the council's chairman, said the decision reflected public
opinion. 'Consumers have been given the freedom to shop at a time and in a
manner of their choosing,' she said.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, executive director of Kingfisher, parent company of B &amp;
Q, Comet, Superdrug and Woolworths, said the vote was a victory for
consumers. 'It will be a great relief to millions of shoppers,' he said.
The six-hour option was approved by 333 votes to 258, a majority of 75,
after deregulation had been defeated by 404 votes to 174, a majority of 230.
The restrictive option, backed by the Keep Sunday Special (KSS) campaign and
a group of retailers, including Marks and Spencer, was defeated by 304 votes
to 286, a majority of 18.
Mr Michael Schluter, director of KSS, said the campaign would explore 'every
avenue we can use to lessen the impact of the bill on the vulnerable sectors
of society'. He said they would fight 'line by line' during the committee
stage to ameliorate the worst effects of the bill.
The outcome represents a decisive defeat for the government, which made no
secret of its preference for deregulation.
Most of the cabinet voted initially for deregulation, including Mr John
Major, the prime minister, and Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary. Most
then voted for six-hour opening.
Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, was the only cabinet minister to vote
for tight regulation. He was joined by Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister,
a member of the supermarket family. Mr Sainsbury also voted against the
six-hour option, for which J. Sainsbury had campaigned.
The outcome prompted angry scenes on the Labour benches as leftwing MPs
protested at the party leadership's endorsement of the six-hour option.
Campaigners rejoice, Page 12

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Unilever to sell stake in Dutch
textile company

<TEXT>
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, said it plans to
sell its minority stake in Gamma, the Netherlands' largest textile company,
in a transaction which would raise around Fl 200m (Dollars 105m) at current
share prices.
The shares, representing nearly 30 per cent of Gamma's share capital, will
be placed mainly with institutional investors. A company spokesman could not
say when the placement would take place but he confirmed that it will yield
a book profit. Goldman Sachs has been appointed to help in the disposal.
Unilever said the divestment was part of its strategy of concentrating its
financial resources on core activities.
The announcement came after the close of bourse trading in Amsterdam, where
Gamma's shares closed unchanged at Fl 98.50. The shares hit a 12-month high
of Fl 100.50 in late November, up from a low of Fl 71.70 set in March.
Gamma, which has annual sales of Fl 1.55bn, recorded its first profit fall
for 14 years in 1992, when net profit fell to Fl 64.8m from Fl 71.3m in
1991.
Besides making curtains, carpets and towels for the European market, Gamma
also produces exotic printed fabrics sold mainly in western and central
Africa.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmacia, the pharmaceutical manufacturer, yesterday became the first
Swedish company to establish a direct presence in South Africa since
Stockholm lifted sanctions at the beginning of this month.
The company, one of the world's top 20 drug makers, said it was setting up
both a wholly-owned subsidiary and a 50-50 joint venture operation with
Adcock-Ingram in which Pharmacia would invest SKr120m (Dollars 14m).
Pharmacia has long sold its products in South Africa through Adcock-Ingram
and conducted clinical trials in the country, but it was prevented from
having a direct presence because of sanctions which previously barred direct
investment in South Africa by Swedish companies.
A spokesman for the Swedish Industry Federation said other Swedish companies
which did not have established links with South Africa were likely to be
more cautious because of uncertainty about the political and economic
situation during the transition to majority rule.
Pharmacia, with annual turnover of around Dollars 3bn, was recently spun off
from Procordia, a drugs and food group jointly controlled by the Swedish
government and Volvo. The government is set to privatise its holding in
Pharmacia next year, leaving Volvo as the largest shareholder.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Paris rules out CFA devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France has ruled out any devaluation of the CFA franc of its former African
colonies against the French currency, despite World Bank advice that a
change in the 1948 parity is necessary to help African exports.
Mr Michel Roussin, aid minister, told the Senate there was no question of
devaluing the CFA franc because France was 'very attached to the franc
zone'. Under this system, some 14 French-speaking countries in central and
west Africa share a common currency, whose parity has stayed at FFr0.02 for
the past 45 years, despite the rise in the French currency's value.
French officials acknowledge the problem this poses for some CFA countries'
exports. But they say that because all 14 countries cannot agree on a single
devaluation rate, there will be none. Paris has told CFA countries its
annual FFr4bn aid (as distinct from development projects) will end after
this month unless they sign IMF adjustment pacts.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Israeli unions consider national strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's Histadrut labour movement was last night considering whether to go
ahead with a nationwide public sector strike due to start today, after the
government agreed to freeze the country's privatisation programme for up to
four weeks pending further negotiations with unions.
The move came as a restructuring plan for the financially troubled Israel
Aircraft Industries, Israel's largest employer, was agreed between
management and workers which should release hundred of millions of dollars
of government assistance in a rescue package.
Trade union leaders were divided about whether they should call off the
strike involving up to 100,000 workers in government-owned companies
including the electricity, telephone and water industries, state-controlled
radio and television, postal and airport services.
Mr Yitzhak Raza, leader of the engineers' union, said the strike would go
ahead. Other trade unionists said they would call it off if the government
made a more clear and unequivocal statement suspending the privatisation
drive.
The unions want greater involvement in privatisation plans and demanded that
the government find jobs for workers fired as part of the sale of
state-owned companies.
Yesterday a Tel Aviv court ruled that workers in the postal and airport
authorities were forbidden to take part in the strike after a last-minute
appeal was lodged by the two authorities.
Mr Avraham Shochat, finance minister, said he could not stop privatisation
where it is already in process, such as at Bank Mizrachi, but was prepared
to freeze privatisation for other companies by up to one month.
At least 11 govern-ment-owned companies including Israel Chemicals, Israel
Shipyards and Bezek, the telephone company, are being prepared for at least
partial privatisation within the next six months.
Officials at Israel Aircraft Industries, which last year reported a loss of
Dollars 60m from a turnover of Dollars 1.6bn, said they expected an
immediate injection of government finance following agreement on the
restructuring plan.
Under the agreement the 17,000-strong work force is to be reduced by 2,900.
Half will accept early retirement and half will be made redundant.
The agreement also states that wages will be cut by 15 per cent and there
will be no wage increases until the company is profitable.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Air France, the state-owned national carrier which was forced to abandon a
restructuring plan in October in the face of a crippling strike, is seeking
to cut 2,100 jobs next year through voluntary measures, the company said
yesterday.
The job cuts, which will comprise early retirements and increased part-time
work, are part of new plan aimed at stemming losses forecast to reach FFr7bn
(Dollars 1.2bn) this year. The plan is expected to be announced next week, a
spokesman for the company said.
The airline's operations have returned to normal following the October
strike, which lasted for more than a week and forced the resignation of Mr
Bernard Attali, the group's chairman. Mr Attali was seeking to reduce the
company's 63,000 staff by 4,000, again through voluntary measures, and to
cut overtime pay and bonuses.
Mr Christian Blanc, who succeed Mr Attali at the head of the airline, has
presented his proposals for the 2,100 job cuts to the company's unions. He
is expected to present further recovery measures at the beginning of next
week.
Unions at the airline have said they will continue to oppose cost-cutting
measures which involve involuntary redundancies and which impose an unfair
burden on employees. One of their principal complaints against Mr Attali's
restructuring plan was that they felt it discriminated against ground staff.
The French government was forced to retreat in the strike at Air France, its
first serious industrial dispute since taking office in March. Faced with an
unemployment rate of 12.2 per cent it has ordered public sector companies to
avoid involuntary redundancies.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Nato to plan for a wider role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new Nato command system enabling allies to send task forces for
peacekeeping and other missions outside their own territory is due to be
drawn up within six months, writes David White, Defence Correspondent, in
Brussels.
A US-inspired Combined Joint Task Forces scheme, which would involve setting
up 'flexible' headquarters able to deploy ad hoc forces is set to be
formally approved by allied leaders at their Brussels summit on January
10-11. Nato military authorities will be asked to present detailed plans to
ministers by June.
The scheme reflects growing emphasis on Nato's ability to act more
effectively in crises such as the former Yugoslavia.
Crucial to the scheme would be the participation of France and Spain, which
belong to Nato but keep their forces outside the alliance's mainstream
military structure.

The deal also means that social assistance, the lowest level of social
security for those who do not qualify for unemployment benefit, will be
increased by 2 per cent per year for the next three years, instead of being
frozen from mid-1994.
Another concession is that so-called 'bad weather money' for building
workers laid off in the winter will be reinstated, but limited to just two
months in mid-winter. The planned cancellation had caused massive
demonstrations by building workers.
Mr Waigel said that the 16 states, a majority of which are ruled by SPD-led
governments, had succeeded in protecting their own spending plans at the
expense of the federal government.

<TEXT>
Two German skinheads found guilty of murdering three Turks last year were
sentenced yesterday to maximum jail sentences. Michael Peters, 26, was
jailed for life and Lars Christiansen, 20, received a 10-year prison
sentence - the maximum for a juvenile.
The verdict was 'the strongest signal yet given to neo-Nazis by a German
court', said Mr Hans-Christian Stobele, the prosecutor in the case.
The two skinheads were charged with three counts of murder for burning down
the home of a Turkish family in the northern town of Molln in November 1992
and causing the death of an elderly woman and two young girls.
The Mo lln attack shocked west Germans, many of whom demonstrated in
candle-lit marches across various cities. Candles and flowers still mark the
site of the attack where the destroyed house has now been replaced by
condominiums.
The verdict was applauded by members of the Turkish community in Germany.
But they were quick to point out that police had still brought no-one to
trial for the murder of five Turks who died in an arson attack last spring
in Solingen.
Meanwhile, Mr Nobert Weise, the North Rhine-Westphalia prosecutor, said that
far right extremists had been compiling files, including names, addresses
and photographs of anti-fascist organisers in Germany and of members of the
far left.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Daimler-Benz plans radical shake-up to revitalise AEG
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AEG is to sell its household appliances business to Electrolux of Sweden in
a radical shake-out designed to return the lossmaking Daimler-Benz
subsidiary to break-even in 1995.
Other projects outlined by AEG yesterday include joint ventures with General
Electric of the US, a new structure for its railways operations,
collaboration deals and the disposal of 'fringe' businesses in lighting and
meters.
Mr Georg Stockl, AEG chairman, said the changes would reduce turnover from
DM11bn last year to DM9.3bn (Dollars 5.5bn) and the payroll from 60,000 to
48,000. In future, the company would be known as AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie,
he said.
The plans are central to the restructure of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest
industrial concern. Daimler, which expanded vigorously from the mid-1980s,
when the management decided to construct a world-class high-technology
group, is further reducing its range of activities.
Its Deutsche-Aerospace (Dasa) subsidiary recently announced the closure of
six German factories and sites and warned of further possible cuts if
conditions failed to improve. Last year AEG closed Olympia, its lossmaking
office equipment business.
Daimler is also striving to generate more market strength in sectors which
it considers core to its main concerns through partnerships and strategic
alliances.
Mr Stockl said a letter of intent had already been signed with GE for the US
group to take a majority stake in AEG's low voltage switchgear business. GE
was also to manage a joint venture embracing both companies' interests in
drives automation.
Although AEG is known to be seeking a partner for its lossmaking DM1.5bn a
year railways business, the current focused is to reduce costs by DM180m a
year. Projects include the closure of one factory and job cuts.
Further cost savings are expected from intra-group deals under which AEG is
to take full control of Daimler's microelectronics business. At present it
has an equal share in Temic Telefunken with Dasa. The high-performance
diesel engine activities of MTU, also part of Dasa, are to be rolled
together with AEG's in a business employing 5,300 with sales of about
DM1.5bn.
Mr Stockl gave no details of the price expected for the appliances business,
in which Electrolux already has a 10 per cent stake, but said the Swedish
group had agreed to keep open the company's three German factories.
Completion of the deal depends on approval by the European Commission
competition offices, but early signals are that the authorities are
satisfied there is enough competition in the field, such as Whirlpool and
Bosch-Siemens, to prevent problems.
The deal would give Electrolux an estimated 35 per cent of the German white
goods market, compared with 20 per cent today, and would boost its share of
the European market to some 30 per cent from 25 per cent.
The group does not foresee regulatory problems, partly because most of its
sales in Germany are generated through an intermediary called Quelle, which
is free to choose a different supplier.

developments in eastern Asia. A flood of funds from overseas, particularly
from the US, has sent most of the region's stock markets soaring.
The Manila and Jakarta stock markets have risen more than 70 per cent since
the beginning of the year. Hong Kong, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore
have been setting new highs in often frantic trading.
The rise of eastern Asia's equity markets has been very good news for
Standard Chartered's custodial services division, now called the Equitor
Group.
'In late 1991 the bank reorganised and decided to dedicate more people and
resources to custodial services,' says Mr Paul Barker, the Equitor Group
general manager overseeing the custodial needs in Asia of institutional
clients.
'Before we offered services on a country by country basis. Now it's a more
integrated operation. The reorganisation was really a recognition of the
enormous potential of custody services in this region,' says Mr Barker. 'It
was also part of the bank's overall aim to generate more fee-based
business.'
StanChart has been in the custody business for many years but it is only
recently that the bank has emerged as a leading force in the Asia markets.
The amount StanChart earns from its custodial services is not separated out
in accounts. But its fast growing Asia operation is likely to be making
considerable profits.
'Assets under management have grown by about 250 per cent in the last two
years,' says Mr Barker. 'In value terms US funds would outweigh others but
the Japanese are coming in in a big way. Intra Asia business is also growing
rapidly, particularly with funds going into China.'
StanChart Equitor stresses that it is not a global custodian. Its services
are focused on an area it calls greater Asia, operating in 14 countries
stretching from Pakistan and India in the west to Japan in the east.
'We act as a regional sub-custodian,' says Mr Barker. 'Our clients are the
big global custodians and institutions in the US, Europe and Japan. We offer
on the ground expertise and, perhaps most important, a comprehensive
reporting service to clients in centres like Chicago and London on
fast-growing markets Asian markets.'
StanChart has been in Asia for more than 130 years. The region has a
position of central importance in the bank's finances. Total assets of
StanChart's Asia Pacific units stood at Pounds 14bn (Dollars 21bn) last
year, about half the group's total assets.
The Asia Pacific has traditionally been regarded as the group's crown jewel,
producing profits to offset losses elsewhere. But the Bombay stock exchange
scandal last year and the resulting Pounds 272m bad debt provision the bank
was forced to make showed the region could produce some nasty surprises.
A simultaneous, secondary listing of StanChart shares is now planned in Hong
Kong and Singapore, probably taking place by the middle of next year.
The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank (HSBC), Citibank and StanChart are the
leaders in custodial services in Asia. Many domestic banks are also fast
developing custodial expertise.
While StanChart Equitor cannot match the market share of HSBC in many
markets, it has quickly worked its way to the top in what is a very
competitive business since reorganising operations two years ago.
'The bread and butter of our business is the safeguarding of share scrip,
settlement and cash management,' says Mr Barker. 'But there are so many
other services that are now essential.'
'A big part of the job is educating our clients in dealing with these
markets. For instance there is a big contrast between the older and newer
markets.
'For example, in Malaysia there is a mix of physical and scripless trading
but in Shanghai and Shenzhen it's all very sophisticated with scripless
trading and central depositories. It's very important that our clients keep
updated on local developments. We continuously feed them information on the
maze of settlement procedures and on new regulations.'
Another important role of the custodian is liaising between market
regulators and potential investors. A US pension fund might have particular
requirements which have to be satisfied before investing in a market.
'We work behind the scenes to match the requirements of certain investors to
the local market,' says Mr Barker. 'That means talking to regulators,
helping to prepare the ground for investors and prevent any
misunderstandings. If a market loses credibility with a US pension fund it
can be disastrous.'
The custody business in Asia is changing fast. More markets are moving
towards completely scripless trading and central depositories. While this
means that custody is becoming a less physical exercise - for one thing
banks will no longer have to build enormous vaults to handle scrip - clients
are now demanding many other services.
More markets will soon be offering securities lending opportunities. 'This
has already developed into a big business in Japan,' says Mr Barker. 'It's a
form of hedging for the client that works best in markets where short
selling is permitted. That is going to develop into a big part of our
business.'
The volatility of Asia's markets will ensure that operators of custodial
services are kept busy. Custodians have to anticipate sudden swings in the
market and be ready to handle volume surges.
Earlier this year trading volumes in Kuala Lumpur suddenly soared to levels
exceeding New York and Tokyo. Custodians have to have teams of professionals
ready to handle such situations. If they are caught flat-footed, then
clients, the big global custodians in the US or Europe, will quickly look
elsewhere for service.
'The recent flood of funds being moved into Asia by the big institutions has
been good for us,' says Mr Barker. 'But it won't go on like this forever.
While a lot of funds will stay in the area the business is bound to ebb and
flow. We've got to be prepared for the quiet as well as the hectic times.'

FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (15): Balancing risk against reward
 -Profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER

<TEXT>
As banks search for stable forms of income which do not carry the risks of
lending or securities trading, custody has started to become distinctly
fashionable. Yet this popularity has intensified competition, and made
participants examine more closely where the best long-term returns lie.
Two aspects of custody attract banks. The first is that it does not strain
balance sheets. Custodians only need to hold small amounts of assets on
their own balance sheets, so they require little capital. The second is that
the returns are less volatile than securities trading activities.
Mr Robert Binney, business executive for global securities services at Chase
Manhattan, says that the lack of volatility is a significant attraction for
banks. 'Custody has been a mainstay of our income during blacker days than
we are facing right now,' he says.
In addition, custody can boost other forms of business such as securities
and derivatives trading. Banks which administer securities have a rich
potential to sell customers related services. As well as measuring portfolio
returns, they can offer to raise returns through other activities.
This has led to stiffer competition. Ms Jean Pellegrini, JP Morgan's head of
sales for securities and cash in Europe, says this is less because of new
entrants than old ones doing more. 'I cannot think of any banks starting
from scratch, but people are getting more serious about it,' she says.
However, the fact that there are few new entrants does not mean that
competition is hindered. Most corporate banks offer custody services, says
Mr Alistair Reid, Barclays' director of custody. He argues that some have
become custodians virtually 'by accident' because they offer related
services.
Some custodians believe that competition will drive market players in two
directions. They will compete by offering lower cost, standardised services;
or higher cost and high value forms of custody. In different ways, both
strategies could be easier for larger, diversified banks.
Mr Reid says straightforward custody involving the holding of securities,
and collection of dividends and bond interest payments in domestic markets,
faces being 'commoditised'. The banks which handle large volumes through low
cost networks will be able to undercut smaller competitors.
This trend is being accentuated by the pressure to disclose the structure of
commissions and fees which were previously not clear. Ms Pellegrini says
that the 'ratcheting down' of fees is also being stimulated by a rise in the
number of consultants which analyse commission structures.
In this market, banks with large electronic networks may have an advantage
in their ability to link markets easily. Mr Binney says that Chase's
Infoserve network gives the bank an edge because 'all our centres have the
same hardware and software. That is where you can get some savings'.
The other end of the market is for specialised services in addition to the
core products. Mr Binney cites the examples of custodians deducting taxes
from dividends at source on behalf of customers, and attending company
meetings on their behalf to exercise proxy shareholder votes.
Ms Pellegrini argues that large banks have an advantage in providing these
services because they have resources such as securities trading arms on
which to call. 'Helping customers handle a derivatives portfolio is natural
for a trading house, but it may be more difficult for others,' she says.
However, although margins may be higher for such services, they can also
carry risks that simpler services do not. This means that while the
immediate returns are higher, the longer term profitability must be
analysed. Banks can otherwise fall into the trap of over-estimating returns
on capital.
One form of risk is credit. Custodians may perform a number of services
involving short-term credit to clients. An example is guaranteeing to credit
dividends to customers on the due date, and accepting the risk that there
will be a delay in the payment from companies in their portfolio.
A second risk is operational. The costs of services such as attending
shareholder meetings is far higher than relying on simple automated
activities. This means that custodians can either miscalculate inflexible
costs, or be exposed to the risk of costs outstripping revenues in quiet
periods.
A further problem for custodians providing complex services involving
different arms is being able to fix the true costs of services. They must
have a transfer pricing formula which ensures that the profitability of
custodianship is not over-estimated because the costs fall elsewhere.
This would be complex in itself, but Mr Reid of Barclays says the challenge
of transfer pricing can be exacerbated by the fact that the bank allows
customers to waive custodian fees if they wish to pay for services through
other methods such as 'soft' commissions on brokerage services.
Such complications are only likely to grow. Mr Ian Cormack, managing
director of Citibank's financial institutions and transaction services group
in Europe, says that custodians will respond to increasing demand for
services linked to asset management by tailoring new services for customers.
'The people who will get into trouble are those that can only do one thing,'
he says. Yet these services will in turn make it more vital for custodians
to devise better methods of measuring profitability. As competition erodes
margins, the balancing of risk and reward will become trickier.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (12): Focus shifts to hidden costs
 -Unbundling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN

<TEXT>
For years, fund managers quietly made a tidy little business out of handling
the custodial arrangements for the pension funds whose assets they invested.
Then, one day, along came the Robert Maxwell pensions scandal, and all those
cosy contractual arrangements were held up for scrutiny in the broad light
of day. In particular, regulators and pension fund trustees wanted to know,
is it safe to entrust your assets to the custodian who is also responsible
for investing them. After all, it was partly because Mr Maxwell's fund
management company also controlled the custodian that more than Pounds 400m
in pension fund assets was extracted with such ease.
To the relief of many fund managers, the government's advisory panel on
occupational pension fund safety, headed by Professor Roy Goode, decided
that there was nothing inherently unsafe about a fund manager using its own
custodian for client funds.
However, the debate has focused attention of trustees on their custodian
arrangements and what they pay for them, opening the door for the unbundling
of custody services.
Earlier this year, the National Association of Pension Funds, in a landmark
study on fee transparency, highlighted custody as one of the areas where
trustees were in the dark about exactly how much they were paying for the
service.
And not for nothing. Mercury Asset Management, in a posture which is typical
in the fund management industry, insists that its fund management fee is
inclusive of custodial services. Those clients wishing to place their
custodial arrangements externally will find themselves paying more for fund
management. Mr Gordon Lindsey, head of custody services at S G Warburg, 75
per cent owner of MAM, says that is because the company uses a single data
base for its fund management and custody arrangements. A requirement to send
instructions to an independent custodian would increase costs and the
customer would have to pay accordingly.
Nevertheless, there is growing demand among clients for unbundling of
custodial services; not just separating it from that of the fund management
but for the outplacement of such services as foreign exchange, cash
management and securities lending which have traditionally allowed
custodians to earn a handsome return on a client's portfolio.
'Unbundling is a trend driven by best practice,' said Mr Robert Binney,
business executive at Chase Manhattan's global securities services division,
who notes that the trend has been under way in the US for several years.
'European custodians see this as a bit of a shock. They are losing tied
business,' he said. Mr James Economides, global product manager for
Citibank's global custody operations, says that clients are showing growing
sophistication in selecting service providers. 'Clients are becoming more
aware of spreads on things such as foreign exchange and cash balances,' he
said. 'For the big ticket items, clients are likely to look to do that away
from us.'
That trend means that custodians are having to re-think their pricing
structure which undercuts the cost of the core master custody business on
the assumption that profitability will be made up by the 'turn' earned on
provision of other services.
At Morgan Stanley, the inclination of some clients to do forex and cash
management business away from the custodian is likely to lead to alterations
in the basic fee, said Mr Ross Whitehill, vice-president of European global
custody operations. It has not, however, prompted the bank to try to require
custody clients to do all their business with Morgan Stanley.
That, Mr Whitehill argues, would be counter-productive.
And indeed, pension fund clients say, the US global custodian banks are
leading the way in the unbundling of their services. Mr Brian Matthews,
finance director of ESN Pension Management, which manages the Pounds 12.5bn
in assets of the privatised electricity companies, has been strenuously
urging the unbundling of custody services.
For some years, ESN itself has pursued such a policy. 'You appoint a
custodian and you appoint a fund manager on the basis that you need to have
clarity of responsibility and clarity of cost.' The custodians, he says,
'are right to say that they can give you added value. But they are not
always entirely open about the fee structure.' For instance, clients may not
always be clear on the way fees earned on stock lending are split between
the custodian and themselves, with the split ranging typically from 75 per
cent in the client's favour to as little as 40 per cent. The difference,
over the course of a year, can mean a significant amount of income lost to
the client.
Also, many custodians offer interest only on balances above a minimum level.
When a host of small accounts are aggregated under the control of the
custodian, the interest generates some significant degree of income which
clients may not readily understand is income they have foregone. In effect,
the custodian's failure to pay interest on all balances represents a hidden
payment by the client although it may not be readily seen that way.
Moreover, some custodians arrange to perform services for clients that the
client is easily suited to perform more cheaply for himself. Mr Matthews
says that ESN, for instance, performs its own tax reclaim service and can
achieve full tax refunds within 72 hours. Of course, such exercises are only
worthwhile for the largest pension schemes but even then, surprisingly few
have investigated the matter.
But longer term, Mr Matthews said, unbundling is going to be a fact of life
in European custody markets. The willingness of the US global custodians to
unbundle fees and services will force even the most recalcitrant European
providers down that route as well. 'The American global custodians will
simply not go away,' Mr Matthews said.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (13): Carried abroad on a new wave
of assets - United States
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not difficult to see why the interest of US custodians in the
international financial markets has intensified this year. The domestic US
custody market has been pretty cut-throat for some time, of course, while
handling cross-border investments has been less competitive and hence more
profitable.
This year, though, two other factors have tilted the outlook
internationally. The custodians are being carried abroad on a new wave of US
assets: their domestic customers, led by mutual funds, have turned with
renewed interest to foreign markets in search of better investment returns
than those available at home. And the activity (and price) levels in some
emerging markets have reached such heights that they have produced
substantial revenues for clearing and custody firms.
Other factors have also been at work. According to Mr Mike McShee, in charge
of asset services for the Wyatt Company in Europe, US pension fund
accounting rules introduced in the late 1980s prompted standardised
reporting of US multinationals' worldwide pension funds for the first time:
this, in turn, has led many US financial executives to focus for the first
time on what their overseas funds were doing - encouraging a greater
centralisation of worldwide investment management and (inevitably) custody.
The commercial banks with a long-standing international presence have
benefited most from these shifting patterns. They include Chase Manhattan,
the world's biggest custodian with more than Dollars 1,000bn in assets,
Citibank, which clung hard to its far-reaching international network when
other US banks cut theirs and which remains the biggest custodian in non-US
markets with Dollars 250m of assets, and two newer entrants - Bankers Trust
and J P Morgan.
The cross-border element of the Dollars 16,000bn custody business, already
at 8 per cent, is set to climb to 15 per cent, says Mr Steven Baker, head of
Citibank's global custody business. It will be US institutional investors,
who have traditionally been less active internationally than their
counterparts elsewhere, who will drive much of this growth, he says.
Cross-border business is already more important to the US custodians than
the broad figures suggest. Most of the big custodians deal with three or
four times the assets in the US that they handle abroad. The higher margins
on international business, though, and the opportunity to handle foreign
exchange transactions for customers, make the revenues from domestic and
international much more even.
The US custodians have been busy investing in new technology and
reorganising their own businesses to keep up with these developments. Chase,
for instance, is in the process of transferring its US customers on to a new
multi-currency accounting system (it used to have separate domestic and
global systems). Citibank this summer reorganised away from management along
geographic lines to management by product, switching its focus to three
areas with the greatest opportunities internationally: custody, clearing,
and the handling of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs).
When the international tide of US money slows, the custodians will find
their ambitious investment plans harder to justify. Their fee income may not
move up and down exactly in line with asset prices in world markets, but
there is nonetheless a degree of correlation. Also, clearing operations
depend heavily on activity levels. A price fall in some of the hottest
emerging markets - which have also been among the most actively traded -
would hit revenues hard.
In the domestic US market, meanwhile, aggressive pricing in pursuit of
market share is at last beginning to throw up a clear set of dominant
institutions. State Street Bank, Boston Safe Deposit and Trust and Bank of
New York, alongside the other big New York-based commercial banks, have all
strengthened their hold. 'The market leaders in each segment of the market
are beginning to be able to price as leaders,' comments one.
Two forces have been at work. One has been a focus by different institutions
on different sectors of the US market. Rather than talk about one domestic
market, custodians now talk about a handful of separate markets: mutual
funds, mastertrust (largely corporate pension funds), insurance companies,
defined contribution pension plans (mainly section 401k plans) and
mastercustody (public sector custody work).
'Everyone is searching out their own niche,' says Mr Peter Derrenbacher,
heard of Chase's North American custody business. 'You don't see people
bidding to get into certain market segments: if they're not already in the
insurance business they're not trying to get into it.'
The second force reshaping the domestic market has been a growing
consolidation among custodians. The biggest deal to date - American
Express's sale this year of Boston Safe to Mellon Bank - has not been
without problems: Mellon is suing Smith Barney, which took over Amex's
Shearson broking business, for interfering with its handling of the custody
of Shearson's family of mutual funds. With market share the focus of most
institutions' strategy, such squabbles over the right to handle assets are
not surprising.
Other expected big deals have been slow to materialise. As long as the big
custodians can support their ambitious investment plans with buoyant income
from their international business, that may continue. But the talk of
consolidation is likely to turn into action should the international gravy
train lose momentum.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (11): A new set of challenges -
Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growing use of derivative instruments by fund managers has created a new
set of challenges for global custodians - challenges which only a relatively
small number of custodians are meeting, according to some of their clients.
So far, European fund managers have been slower to jump on the derivatives
bandwagon than their US counterparts. Those who do use derivative
instruments tend to limit themselves to standardised futures and options
traded on exchanges. Few have started to use over-the-counter instruments
specially designed and sold by banks, such as swaps, which can be extremely
complex and esoteric.
But the use of derivatives is expected to become more widespread in the next
few years, so there is likely to be growing demand for custodial services
which are designed to suit the special requirements of derivative as well as
cash instruments.
For example, Bankers Trust, which is custodian of Dollars 1,000bn of assets
worldwide, estimates that 30-50 per cent of fund managers with more than
Dollars 500m under management are using or reviewing the use of derivatives.
'Traditional custodians provide custody for physical securities,' says Mr
Alex Over, head of sales for UK pension funds, Global Securities Services at
Bankers Trust in London. 'Their systems are only geared to physical assets,
and have to be tweaked to handle derivatives.'
According to Mr Aidan Dennis, product development manager at Chase Global
Securities Services, the needs of clients have not changed fundamentally.
'They still want to hear about their positions on a daily and weekly basis,'
he says.
But the advent of more complex instruments has meant that a straightforward
listing of assets may no longer be considered adequate. In fact, a frequent
complaint of fund managers using derivatives is that the reports they get
from custodians are extremely difficult to understand. These days, Chase
provides some clients with three different reports: a list of assets, a
valuation of assets and a calculation of net exposure.
According to Mr Over of Bankers Trust, custody is 'rapidly becoming an
information business'. Increasingly, clients rate valuation and accounting
services as highly as custody and settlement services.
The custodians at the forefront of derivatives custody tend to be those with
a strong in-house derivatives capability on the investment banking side of
their business, which gives them a competitive advantage.
'Our systems are developed by investment banking. The growth in the number
of (derivative) instruments is phenomenal. Without their input, we would not
be able to develop quickly enough to keep with the changes in the market,'
said Mr Dennis of Chase.
While the majority of fund managers using derivatives limit themselves to
futures, where their main demand is for custodians to deal with margin
requirements, some clients have more sophisticated needs.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) recently farmed
out ECU260m (USDollars 296m) of assets (of its total liquidity of more than
ECU1bn) to six fund managers, and appointed Bankers Trust to act as
custodian for the funds.
One of the key issues for the EBRD in choosing a custodian was the ability
to handle the reporting and settlement of complex derivative instruments.
Unlike most pension or insurance funds, the EBRD funds can be invested only
in fixed income assets, but a wide range of derivative instruments are
allowed, including over-the-counter instruments, such as swaps, caps and
floors.
'Typically the clients of custodians in Europe have been pension funds, with
broad asset class allocations between equities, bonds and cash,' said Mr
Andrew Donaldson, a treasury official at the EBRD. Unlike derivatives, the
reporting of these instruments is very straightforward, he says.
'When you look at what different custodians do there is a huge range in
their abilities. Many pension fund custodians can handle equities very well
but get tripped up by more complex instruments. They are not set up to
handle derivatives.'
Bankers Trust has drawn on skills from the W M Company, its wholly-owned
subsidiary which specialises in performance measurement and portfolio
valuation and accounting, as well as from the investment banking side of its
business, it is a market leader in derivatives engineering.
Because the W M Company has 80 data feeds from different sources, Bankers
Trust can offer cost effective and accurate marking to market. 'We can do it
because we can leverage off an existing capability,' says Mr Over.
The issue of valuation is rather a grey area, partly because fund managers
are themselves still coming to grips with it. There are no set accounting
standards for derivatives, as there are for physical assets.
A year ago, Mr Glyn Pete, a director of Lazard Investors, chaired a
committee of the Pensions Research Accountants Group (Prag), an association
of 200 UK pension fund practitioners, which published guidelines on the use
of futures and options by pension funds concentrating on how best to meet
reporting, control and performance measurement demands.
The report, according to Mr Pete, has not been welcomed with open arms.
'Many of the people I talk to are aware of the report, and when they sit
down and decide how to incorporate derivatives into their portfolios they
look at it, but it has not been accepted across the board,' said Mr Pete.
He added that a number of global custodians are looking at the standards and
working on implementing them into their derivatives services.
Global custodians make money by charging relatively small fees for handling
massive amounts of money. Although extra charges are made for dealing with
derivatives, they are generally small. Nevertheless, the ability to offer
custody services which deal with derivatives as well as cash instruments is
likely to become an increasingly important marketing ploy for custodians.
Mr Dennis thinks that this ultimately means that 'those that can't play in
the derivatives market will not be able to play in the custody markets'.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (10): Investment fashion of the 90s
 -Emerging Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emerging markets look like being the investment fashion of the 1990s.
Scarcely a week goes by without a new fund being launched in the field, and
enthusiasts are constantly urging institutions to increase their portfolio
weightings in emerging markets to between 10 and 20 per cent.
But the catch-all phrase 'emerging markets' covers a multitude of countries
in Latin America, Asia, southern Europe and some parts of Africa.
Many markets are, almost by definition, small and without a long tradition
of welcoming international investors. That creates the potential for many
custody problems.
Until recently, many managers complained that custodians were not committing
enough resources to emerging markets. But the growing popularity of these
markets means that custodians seem to have improved their service.
The pattern seems to be that most managers appoint a global custodian, which
in turn appoints sub-custodians in individual markets. There are some
exceptions, however. Some managers use regional custodians; specialist
country fund managers like to have a direct relationship with a custodian in
their particular market.
Mr Richard Royds of Mercury Fund Managers says his group has Warburg as
overall custodians but then uses Chase Manhattan as custodians in less
accessible markets. 'We have found service surprisingly efficient; on the
other hand custody is less of a problem when markets are rising' he says.
According to one fund manager 'Chase Manhattan is the most important player.
There's a fairly big gap after that to Citibank, which has the widest agent
network of anybody. What it lacks is a good co-ordinating network.'
Another fund manager describes Citibank as 'thinly spread but recovering
strongly'. State Street, which the manager ranks third in the list, is
described as having 'the best quality of service but is not the cheapest'.
Some fund managers found that settlement conditions in the emerging markets
were much better than they expected. Mr Kenneth King of Kleinwort Benson
says he 'hasn't found any emerging market that has given me anything like as
much of a problem as Italy did in the mid-1980s. One always feels nervous
when one goes into a new market. But so far, we have not suffered any
significant inconveniences. In fact, it is a tribute to the efficiency of
the custodians.'
'We have never experienced a counter-party failure. The problem is not so
much custodial as the initial set-up,' says another manager. 'Some countries
require a lot of documentation before you can invest. Our application to
invest in India is a pile of paper 2 1/2 feet high. When you actually get to
invest, settlement is not too bad. But managers can have problems keeping
track of, and dealing with, bonus issues and corporate restructurings, which
can be surprisingly complex.'
Whereas managers seem relatively happy with most areas of settlement,
foreign currency dealing can be a problem. One manager says: 'If we were
doing a share trade in a normal market, then the local currency deal would
be separate. In emerging markets, that is not often possible. Often there is
no interbank currency market. Then there are repatriation restrictions,
which might limit your freedom when you want to sell.'
'Quite a lot of custodians make a lot of money out of trading currencies.
They've been beaten down on fee levels but they get it back in the currency
markets,' according to another manager. He cites an example of the
difficulties. 'The Brazilian cruzeiro is declining at 1.5 per cent a day.
One needs to know the time of day the deal was done to know whether one got
a good rate.'
Conversations with fund managers illustrate why custodians are so eager to
advertise their expertise in emerging markets. For while the risks are
clearly far greater the potential for profit is correspondingly higher.
Inevitably, with such a wide range of countries, the problems vary widely
from market to market. 'The Latin American markets are red hot on
settlement,' says Dr Arnab Banerji of Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets.
'In Latin America, inflation has forced them to have a good banking system,'
agrees another manager. 'But some markets are bumpier than others. In
Venezuela, it can take over 50 pieces of paper to settle a trade.'
One fund manager said: 'India gives me attacks of nerves. The nature of the
Indian market is that many brokers have little capital backing. That gives
me cause for concern.'
It would be wrong to think that every pension fund in the UK is happy to
dabble in Chilean equities. Some institutions will only invest directly in
the more substantial emerging markets, or in shares which are traded in the
form of American Depositary Receipts. If they want to get exposure to one of
the smaller emerging markets, they will do so via the growing number of
single country funds.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (8): Dual attraction - European
Competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last June, the European Community's proposed directive liberalising pension
fund investment was sent back to the drawing boards for a re-think, setting
back the cause of cross-border investment.
Significantly, one of the sticking points was the French and Italian
governments requiring that custody of pension scheme assets be held
domestically - a measure which flies in the face of the spirit of the
internal market.
Europe remains an attractive market for custodians, particularly with the
growing interest in cross-border investment. Moves to ease restrictions on
outward investment in Scandinavia and the Netherlands have made European
markets even more attractive to custodians than they had been previously.
Moreover, custodians will admit privately, Europe has another attraction;
its clients tend to be less sophisticated in their zeal to pare fees to
their lowest levels and, consequently, business based there may prove more
profitable than in some other centres.
Recent liberalisation of Scandinavian investment rules, allowing foreigners
to buy domestic shares, for instance, are opening those markets for
non-domestic custodians, while the lifting of foreign investment
restrictions on some of the Netherlands's largest pension schemes are
creating opportunities there.
Custodians say that there are very few domestic rules which formally bar
them from competing fully for European business. There are, however, a
series of local customs and practices which, when added together, have made
some centres hard to penetrate. Mr Ross Whitehill, vice-president at Morgan
Stanley's European custody operations, says that the so-called 'reciprocity'
deals are far more of a barrier to true competition than any formalised
local rules. In reciprocity deals, a bank, based, say, in Thailand, will
approach a Swiss bank to act as custodian for all its Swiss-based
transactions. It will, however, request that the Swiss bank use its custody
services for all its Thai business. In that way, competition by non-domestic
competitors is avoided.
However, custodians cite two European markets - France and Germany - as
particularly difficult to penetrate. Mr Colin McClatchy, operations director
at Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Ltd, notes that some rules which restrict
the activities of foreign fund managers also make life difficult for
would-be non-domestic custodians.
For instance, any fund manager wishing to offer a spezialefunden which
attracts capital gains tax relief will find that the rules require the use
of a so-called depot bank as custodian. And, because it is largely the banks
themselves which offer spezialefunden, 'a non-German investment manager is
going to search long and hard to find someone to act in that capacity'.
The door is not entirely closed to those wishing to act as custodians of
retail funds, he notes. There is a provision for registered foreign funds to
attract similarly generous capital gains treatment as the spezialefunden,
but their chosen custodian must demonstrate that it is controlled to the
same standard as a depot bank. But as a practical matter, he said, that
standard has proven very difficult to match. 'In institutional terms, I know
of no one who has cracked the German market. And UK institutions which own
German institutions have almost no leverage either,' Mr McClatchy said.
And in France, Mr McClatchy notes, 'there is a cultural tendency always to
choose a domestic provider'. Small wonder then that the greatest pressure
for custody of pension fund assets to remain at home comes from France. And
although the argument presented has been about the need to reassure scheme
sponsors that their assets are physically within reach, there remains
considerable scepticism that the French are most interested in keeping
competitors out of what has been a safe business until now.
'Our judgment is that the French and German markets offer potential in the
longer term,' said Mr Robert Binney, business executive for Europe in the
Global Securities Services division of Chase Manhattan Bank. 'But not in the
next few years.' The existence of foreign exchange controls in both those
countries has tended to mitigate against cross-border investment, making
them less attractive to a global custodian prospecting for new business, he
said.
Custodians say that perhaps the most significant development in European
markets is the Swiss initiative, to be known as Intersettle. This allows all
the Swiss banks who choose to be members to bargain collectively for master
custody services in other markets. Mr Wolfgang Michaelis, chief executive of
Intersettle, said the project should be ready around mid-1994.
'Our goal is to become a cross-border clearer for Swiss participants, with
the exception of Euroclear and Cedel,' he said. The two are the giant
clearing agents for Eurobonds and international equities with deeply
entrenched businesses in Switzerland. 'We are a mouse and they are an
elephant,' he said.
Intersettle has 146 members and SFr50m (USDollars 34m) in capital. Under the
system, the Swiss banks will keep some of the higher margin business of
custody but are outsourcing basic business with a single supplier in each
market. The effect has been to enable the Swiss banks to obtain the best
pricing and servicing of the basic product in each foreign market. In the
US, Brown Brothers Harriman has been chosen as the local custodian, while in
northern and southern Europe, Citibank has the contract. Citibank has also
won the contract in South America, while Barclays will act as agent in
Africa. In Japan, Mitsubishi Bank has won the contract while ANZ has done so
for Australia. Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank has won the contract for the
remaining Pacific rim countries.
Membership in Intersettle is not limited to domestic Swiss institutions -
any locally - based bank may join, Mr Michaelis said.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (9): The going is getting tougher -
Fund Managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition is getting tougher for custodians as fund managers become more
aggressive and a range of new pressures sweeps over the industry.
'In three years' time, we are going to see a move towards independent
custodians and fewer players in the UK market,' says Mr Nigel O'Sullivan, a
partner with Bacon &amp; Woodrow, consulting actuaries, who scrutinises
custodians.
'Previously custody has been an area neglected by pension trustees,' he
says. 'People spent all their time considering fund managers. Now they are
taking a far more detailed look at custody.'
But he describes a number of 'nightmares' which have illustrated the need
for greater attention to the back-office functions, such as custodians who
have failed to collect dividends. More generally, he says the industry is
becoming more alert to 'rip-offs' such as tardy income collection, and
ambiguous cash management policies which provide low rates of interest.
Mr O'Sullivan also highlights the lack of transparency in charges. He says
custody fees have often in the past bundled up opaquely with fund management
fees. Now that is beginning to change.
So is the level of fee-cutting. He says: 'The US banks have come over and
where you used to be quoted 10 to 12 basis points for custody, now it is
probably 3 to 4. We're sceptical.
'The ideal custodian is ideally like the Victorian housekeeper: someone you
don't see much of,' he says. Among the factors he looks for are assurances
on the safekeeping of the assets; that settlement is contractual; that there
is adequate redress if things go wrong; and that there is sufficient
scrutiny of sub-custodians overseas.
'If an agent defaults, we would like the custodian to make up the
difference,' he says. 'We are very much against the idea of limited
liability, and are increasingly asking custodians to get their parent
company to countersign agreements.'
He is not opposed to fund managers offering custody services, but recommends
separate contracts with the custodians.
Mr Markus Ruetimann, director of client and business services at UBS Asset
Management in London, is not afraid to take action when he is not satisfied
with custodians. 'We got rid of two agents this year,' he says. 'That is
part of our continuous review seeking improvement in quality.'
He propagates what he calls 'the seven Cs' he developed in helping to
determine the right custodian to work as partners with his company:
Cash management: including stocks invested in interest-bearing accounts with
the interest passed on to the client.
Curtailment of risks: ensuring that potential custodians have appropriate
systems, controls and insurance.
Competitiveness of fees: to be offset against quality of service provided.
Credit-rating: examining the net assets and ensuring the balance sheet of
the agent is healthy.
Communication and technology: how easy it is to communicate with agents and
maintain links with them.
Customisation capabilities: now that custody is becoming more commoditised.
Commitment and comfort: with regular checking of compliance backed up by
personal visits.
Mr Ruetimann stresses several particular priorities at present: 'Helping us
to reduce the risks; making sure their creditworthiness is up to standard;
and continuously monitoring performance.'
He says custodians are now having to take a more active role to market
themselves. 'Before they would say this is the service we will provide, take
it or leave it,' he says. 'Now they are having to accommodate technical
changes.'
UBS Asset Management presents a threat to independent custodians, because it
believes that fund management and custody go hand-in-hand and need not be
separated.
Mr Ruetimann argues that lobbying by custodians and the trade press in the
wake of the Maxwell scandal - and echoed in the recent Goode Report which it
triggered - has unfairly tilted the balance towards custodians independent
of fund managers.
He says there are strong advantages to providing both services, since
combined providers can share information, pool cash and eliminate the errors
that can be introduced when a third party is involved.
As evidence that the market appreciates this approach, he says his company
now has more than Pounds 31bn under management, including Pounds 25bn of
assets in custody.
On the other hand, UBS Asset Management does still offer business to other
custodians, since it believes in local and regional custodians rather than
handing out all custody work to a single global contract.
It only uses its own custody service for domestic equities in the UK, and on
its home territory in Switzerland. Elsewhere, it sub-contracts the work to
some 20 local custodians around the world, and to two regional custodians:
one for the Pacific Rim and the other for North America.
His company has undertaken a costly exercise this year, examining and
overhauling its custody agreements to ensure that the services required are
spelt out, and that details are provided of insurance cover, control
procedures and audited financial information.
Other pressures changing the demands of fund managers for custodial services
include the growing range of financial instruments. 'We are having to
demonstrate more sweeping abilities in more esoteric areas such as
collateralised mortgage obligations and futures and options,' says Mr Ross
Whitehill of Morgan Stanley.
At the same time, there is a growing move towards overseas investment in
emerging markets, which is increasing the emphasis on sub-custodians. 'It is
up to us to pioneer services in these regions,' he says. 'We must be there
in Vietnam or Peru when markets open up.'
But the next few years will not be easy. Mr O'Sullivan warns: 'There is a
price war on at the moment. You have to spend a lot of money on technology.
Those without deep pockets are going to be left behind.'

FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (6): On the way to speedier
settlements - Crest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crest, the Bank of England, insists, is not an acronym and has no meaning.
But in giving this catchy name to the electronic settlement system that is
intended to fill the gap left by the Stock Exchange's collapsed Pounds 400m
Taurus project, has the Bank taken risks with the image? After all, when you
pass the crest you go downhill.
Last month a task force set up by the Bank in July issued a working paper
describing the design principles of Crest. After a period for consultation,
a final specification is due by May next year. Crest will be a stripped-down
electronic settlement system, minus some of the complexity which rendered
Taurus unworkable. It is due to be introduced in 1996.
Even before that, however, important improvements in the settlement of
London Stock Exchange transactions are set to take place.
By beefing up the existing (but old-fashioned) Talisman system used by
market makers it is intended to speed up the creaking settlement system
which still operates according to a fortnightly account basis.
The provisional timetable is that 10-day rolling settlement will be
introduced by July 1994, and five-day settlement by January 1995. This would
still leave London settlement some way short of the three-day rolling basis
which is the international standard proclaimed by a Group of 30 committee.
That would have to await the full implementation of Crest.
However, the latest initiative has already run into the same kinds of snags
which delayed and finally derailed Taurus.
There were protests in August, for instance, from the Institutional Fund
Managers' Association which said that its members - the biggest users of the
London Stock Exchange - were seriously under-represented on the Crest
committee, which instead was packed with representatives of custodian banks
and registrar banks.
Some institutions are openly sceptical of whether the transitional
Talisman-based scheme can meet its targets.
Mr Michael Robarts, director of administration at Fleming Investment
Management, says that the move to five-day settlement within little more
than a year will prove impractical.
'We don't believe that it will be feasible in a paper-based system,' he
says. 'It is inevitable that backlogs will develop, especially among some of
the smaller custodians and registrars. An awful lot of paper has to be
passed around.'
His potential disaster scenario is that accelerated rolling settlement will
be introduced on a flawed basis, and then Crest will fail to appear for some
unforeseen technical reason. In any case, other pessimists reckon that Crest
will take five years to be introduced rather than the official three.
Certainly, if the move to five-day settlement is to be successful, paper
will have to move around between custodians and registrars at considerable
speed, and the electronic payment and trade reporting networks which have
recently developed will need to be able to interface without hitches.
At some point an unacceptable level of settlement failures would occur, and
it would be important for the authorities to back off before this stage was
reached.
Another somewhat controversial area is stock lending, an activity which is
likely to expand when rolling settlement is introduced and the market makers
will have less time to cover their positions. Some fund managers believe
that the traditional collateral, consisting of short-term Talisman
certificates, is not acceptable for pension funds.
Sceptics remember that even the existing two-week account system caused
tremendous problems in 1987 as volume soared in the months ahead of the
Black Monday crash.
So the five-day settlement target under Talisman remains in doubt. This is
accepted by some on the task force, while among the big brokers some fear
privately that up to 40 per cent of trades would fail on a five-day cycle,
at least on the basis of present experience.
Nevertheless, the big investors and their brokers accept the need for a
speeding up of the settlement process. Private clients see it differently,
because they may be required to deposit money with their brokers, and may
find themselves forced to run their investments through brokers' nominee
services; this would break their direct links to the companies they invest
in and expose them to possible default risks should the brokers get into
administrative or financial trouble.
As for Crest, it is true that the Bank of England has a track record of
building electronic settlement systems, notably its system for the
gilt-edged market, which operates on the basis of next-day settlement. But
an equity system is inherently much more complicated, given the need to cope
with rights issues, takeover bids and various special situations. There are
also many registrars to be dealt with, rather than just one as in the case
of the Central Gilts Office.
Nobody will be confident that Crest will work satisfactorily unless the
design is kept simple. The critical point may be the so-called
name-on-register requirement that may have been the straw that broke the
back of Taurus: vociferous companies insisted that the original design
should be changed so that a full list of investors would appear on their
shareholder registers.
This is also known as the designation issue. It would greatly simplify the
structure of the new electronic system if identification of individual
shareholdings were confined to the custodian's records and did not have to
be repeated externally on the company register. However, the Crest working
paper leaves this issue open: a Crest member's pooled account might be
designated as a number of smaller accounts on the register.
The Bank of England says simply that designation should be available if
users are prepared to pay for it. But some institutions fear that too many
pension scheme trustees will insist on designation for security reasons, and
the system may become overloaded.
The Goode Committee on pension law reform looked at the security arguments
for external designation, but decided that with Crest in the offing it would
not be desirable to make external designation compulsory.
It remains to be seen whether lobbying by British companies nervous of
losing track of suspicious changes in the ownership of their shares will
once again block attempts to adopt a simplified approach.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (7): Braced for radical changes -
Settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City of London's stock lenders and borrowers are braced for a series of
significant changes to their business over the next 18 months, as the London
Stock Exchange moves to modernise the share dealing mechanism.
Under the present system, UK market makers - who quote prices to buy and
sell shares on the London market - have two weeks to settle their accounts
and deliver the stock to clients. If they have a deficiency of stock to
fulfil an order, they will normally borrow the balance from one of eight
Bank of England-authorised money broking houses. These in turn borrow the
stock from institutions, such as a pension fund or insurance company, which
are recognised by the Inland Revenue. Both the institution and money broker
charge a fee for their services, the size of which is dependent on the size
and value of the trade, and the duration of the loan.
However, in a series of radical changes, the settlement system moves to a
10-day rolling account period next July. By January 1995, the plan is to
move to five-day settlement. A year later the Crest paperless settlement
system will be introduced.
The impact on the three participants of the stock lending process - market
maker, money broker and institution - of these changes are still being
debated, both by the Bank of England working party preparing the way for the
new system, and by the dozens of City firms and institutions involved in the
Pounds 2bn-a-day business.
The most important change will be the increase in the number of
transactions. Instead of settling their books every two weeks, as now, under
the new rolling system market makers will settle on a daily basis. For their
part, money brokers will have to borrow from the institutions and lend to
market makers more frequently.
'Every day will be account day from July,' says Mr Luby Sparber, head of
settlements, at Smith New Court. 'Market makers will have to run their
positions more tightly and for shorter durations. If they don't it will
increase the carrying costs.'
Just how much more business will be created under the new rolling system is
the subject of much speculation in market circles. An internal study by one
stockbroking firm estimated that the amount of stock lending could increase
between five and six times. The Bank of England, which has had access to the
dozens of internal broker and institutional studies, suggests a doubling of
the number of transactions more likely.
Most observers say the need for more stock should not be a problem at these
forecast levels. Mr Dick Vesy, at Lloyds Global Custody, says: 'I believe
that in absolute terms there is enough stock to satisfy a large increase in
requirements, even by a factor of four or five, but only if the demand is
allowed to draw out the price sufficiently to attract more suppliers. Some
of the institutions may not come in without more money.'
The level of increase in transactions will be crucial to the degree to which
fees harden. One money broker executive admits: 'The margins for both
brokers and institutions have gone down in the last two or three years
because there's been too many lenders. Fees will go up, and any increase
after rolling settlement will help redress the balance.'
Typically, a money broker will calculate the fee for a trade with a
marketmaker as follows: the size of the loan (ie the number of shares)
multiplied by the share price, mulitplied by the basis rate (usually around
50 points) and divided by 36,500. This gives a daily rate and is then
mulitplied by the duration of the loan. The institution will be paid a fee
by the money broker of just under half of that received from the market
maker.
The likelihood of greater volumes in stock lending have also given rise to
fears over the extra amount of paperwork that will be generated and the
present system's ability to cope prior to the Crest paperless system taking
over.
One solution that may develop is for market makers to help each other to
balance their books at the end of each day's trading. This would only apply
to smaller trades, but would considerably reduce the amount of paperwork
from the rolling settlement system.
The Bank of England has also commissioned a sophisticated computer model of
the stock lending process in an attempt to identify potential bottlenecks.
Various areas for improvement are being examined, including introducing a
code of practice for the registrars, and reducing the movement of share
certificates, particularly where the value of the loan is considerably less
than the certificates' face value.
'There is a lot of slack to be taken up,' says Mr Iain Saville, who heads
the Crest project at the Bank. 'We are confident that savings can be made to
make the system operate more efficiently.'
There has been some pressure to make more radical changes to the system,
mostly from the market-making side. One leading market maker says: 'The
proposed changes simply bring us into line with other countries' systems.
But the mechanism's still too restrictive. It inhibits arbitrage and puts
obstacles in people's way. There's a huge pool of outside investors who see
the UK market as overvalued and who'd like the opportunity to short it.
There's a groundswell of opinion that London should get in step with the
rest of the world's markets.'
Supporters of the changes say that the uniqueness of the quote-driven system
underpins the success of the stock lending business. The Bank of England
believes that 'the planned changes for stock lending in London will
facilitate marketmakers in providing an excellent quote-driven system with
liquidity. This will be extremely good not only in the absolute but also by
international standards.'

FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (5): Clients' awareness grows -
Stock Lending
</HEADLINE>

International securities lending can be one of the most lucrative aspects of
the global custody business. But custodians are beginning to realise that
clients are becoming more aware of its profitability.
Some clients have discovered that the fees earned on stock lending benefit
their custodian more than themselves. Also, some have gathered a
sophisticated understanding of the business, and have grasped that in some
circumstances custodians may not be able to maximise fee income from the
stocks the client is prepared to lend.
Recently, these inefficiencies have caught the attention of other commercial
providers who seek to either help investors maximise profits on stock
lending through their custodian, or to help them to lend directly to those
who need stock most.
One leading UK institution, CIN Management, the in-house manager of the
Pounds 13.5bn British Coal pension schemes, is already doing its own direct
stock lending.
As a practice, stock lending in the UK received a setback two years ago when
the former administrators of pension schemes controlled by the late Mr
Robert Maxwell said that much of the Pounds 440m in assets missing from the
schemes had disappeared through stock lending agreements.
However, writs against several of the world's largest fund managers allege
that the activities carried out by the Maxwell pension schemes bore little
or no relation to stock lending as it is commonly understood.
Indeed, the government's own advisory panel on pension law reform, headed by
commercial law Professor Roy Goode, found that stock lending, properly
controlled, is a perfectly reasonable and sensible activity for pension
schemes to undertake.
That pronouncement is expected to do much to help restore confidence in
stock lending among pension fund trustees and should help to widen the pool
of potential lenders.
Thus, trustees attention is turning away from the question of 'Is stock
lending safe?' to 'Is stock lending profitable?'.
Mr Mark Weeks, vice-president at London Global Securities, notes that stock
lending is also taking on greater significance for the proprietary trading
arms of large securities firms. 'There is a growing trend to try to finance
long equity positions by trying to lend the underlying securities,' he said.
That technique has been the mainstay of the US Treasuries markets for
decades where so-called repurchase agreements for billions of dollars of
securities are arranged within seconds. Mr Weeks's own business acts as an
intermediary to the stock lending process, particularly among securities
firms trying to arrange lending agreements outside their own custodian.
However, Mr Weeks is quick to point out that his firm is not seeking to
by-pass custodians as a rule. 'If the custodian offers a good enough
business, we are happy to borrow from them,' he said.
The advantage to using an intermediary is that many custodians are
themselves attached to securities firms. 'If you go out to borrow securities
from another broker-dealer, there is always the danger that the details will
leak out,' he said. 'Wouldnt you prefer to go to an independent where the
terms of the deal will not leak?'.
Meanwhile, technological advances are aiding both custodians and those who
would like to manage their own stock lending operations. Tullett and Tokyo,
the UK money broker, is setting up a screen to quote prices for securities
lending now that new UK rules allow on-lending of stock to third parties.
Also, Reuters Instinet system is shortly to launch a screen-based stock loan
matching system which will allow counterparties to electronically match
their bargains.
One of the new businesses which has sprung up in response to the growing
interest in profitability is Boston Global Advisers, a US-based sister
company to London Global which acts as an intermediary. 'We are a bolt-on
securities lending operation,' said Ms Chris Donovan, marketing director.
The company offers an agency lending service to pension funds, mutual funds
and to custodial banks who have no securities lending operation of their own
or which do not engage in the most lucrative aspect of stock lending,
cross-border stock loans.
'This is a business proposition made possible by the inefficiencies of the
global custodians and because of the size of the portfolios now available
for lending,' Ms Donovan said. Not only are some clients unhappy at the fee
split - in the UK, the average split ranges from 75 per cent received by the
client to 40 per cent - some feel they cannot get the maximum use of their
securities if they rely only on the custodian to find business.
A client with, say, 500,000 shares of IBM stock may have given his custodian
permission to lend all of them. But the custodian may have agreements with
20 other clients all holding similar amounts. When an order to borrow say,
1m IBM shares comes in, the custodian will borrow from each of the clients
equally and instead of lending 500,000 IBM shares, the client is able to
lend only 50,000.
Thus, Ms Donovan said, for the very largest clients, even the most efficient
custodians may be unable to get the most profit out of a portfolio.
However, custodians say that those clients trying to bypass them in their
stock lending activities probably have little to gain in the long run. Mr
Terry Pearson, head of client relationships at Royal Bank of Scotland, the
largest independent custodian for UK pension funds, says: 'The client may
feel that they are in control but they are not really. In fact, he is still
reliant on his custodian to deliver the stock and collect the collateral.'
Unless clients have adequate systems to handle the collateral - marking it
to market, servicing corporate actions and safekeeping - stock lending
outside the custodian could prove disastrous.
