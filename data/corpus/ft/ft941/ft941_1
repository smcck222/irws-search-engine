A 10 per cent stake in GiroCredit, Austria's third-largest bank and the
savings banks' clearing institution, will be offered to a foreign partner
later this year through a capital increase.
Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, is due formally to take control of
GiroCredit next month after raising its shareholding from just over 30 per
cent to at least half.
Bayerische Landesbank, a major bank and clearing institution for the
Bavarian savings banks, will be offered first refusal.

<TEXT>
BSN, France's largest food manufacturer, is to set to take control of Best
Foods, the New Zealand company in which it already holds a 20 per cent
stake.
BSN said yesterday it had launched an agreed bid for Best at NZDollars 4 per
share, valuing the company at about FFr450m (USDollars 78.9m).
Under the terms of the agreement, the Huljich family, which controls 50.01
per cent of Best, will buy back up to 33 per cent of the shares in the
company. BSN, which would hold 67 per cent of the shares in Best, said the
aim was to withdraw the company from the New Zealand stock market.
Best, which produces frozen prepared foods under the 'Top Hat' brand,
achieved sales last year of FFr180m and net profits estimated at about 10
per cent of that figure. According to BSN, the company has a strong
potential to export to the Australian, Japanese and US markets.
The acquisition is in line with BSN's strategy of expanding in the
Asia-Pacific region. Its sales in the region have risen from about FFr500m
in 1989 to some FFr3.5bn last year.

A summit of the Group of 15 most influential developing countries yesterday
called for a monitoring mechanism to protect the interests of developing
countries in implementation of the new Gatt accord.
The G15 leaders criticised attempts by the developed countries to bypass
multilaterally agreed frameworks for trade liberalisation by resorting to
unilateral action bsed on environmental and social concerns.
'We look to the World Trade Organisation (successor to Gatt) as a guarantor
of the rights of the weaker trading partners and as a safety net against
arbitrary, unilateral and discriminatory protectionist action,' said Indian
prime minister P V Narasimha Rao.

<TEXT>
Top trade negotiators yesterday agreed to make January 1 1995 the target
date for implementation of the Uruguay Round trade liberalising accords,
committing the leading trading nations to ratifying the accords this year.
The date will be formally endorsed by ministers next month when they meet in
Marrakesh to sign the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade agreements.
Continued wrangling over a US demand for labour rights to go on the agenda
for future trade talks prevented approval of a draft ministerial
declaration. The row is also blocking agreement on setting up a preparatory
committee to manage the transition between the Uruguay signing and
establishment of a new World Trade Organisation next year.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt said yesterday he stood ready
to call a meeting of senior trade officials next week to try to resolve the
worker rights issue ahead of the Marrakesh meeting on April 12-15.
The matter did not pose a threat to the signing of the Uruguay Round
agreements, but Mr Sutherland said it would be 'very unfortunate' not to
have consensus on the ministerial declaration. In a reference to a potential
North-South split in the WTO, he warned that failure to resolve the problem
could create 'a divided attitude in regard to future developments'.
Earlier Mr B K Zutshi, India's Gatt ambassador, told the 121-strong trade
negotiations committee that the worker rights issue had 'menace and
destructive potential' for undoing what had been built in the Uruguay Round
and threatened the foundations of the multilateral system.
Despite the united opposition of developing countries, and lack of support
from other industrialised nations, US officials say Washington remains
committed to a reference to worker rights in the ministerial declaration.
Mr Sutherland, worried by the US move which surfaced unexpectedly last week,
said there had been broad assent to his proposal in January that discussion
of new issues be postponed until after the Marrakesh meeting.

The US yesterday levied preliminary anti-dumping penalties against Fuji of
Japan ranging between 360.95 per cent and 321.23 per cent on colour
photographic paper sales into the US, AP-DJ reports from Washington.
The decision, which involves punitive tariffs, requires Fuji to post cash or
bond equivalents with the US Customs Service pending further review by the
Commerce Department.
A final ruling on the dumping complaints filed by Eastman Kodak against Fuji
photographic paper produced in Japan and the Netherlands must be given by
August 18.
If the preliminary ruling is upheld, the International Trade Commission will
have 45 days in which to decide whether Eastman Kodak has sustained
financial injury.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Russia to build up ties to Crimea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SIMFEROPOL, CRIMEA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In what may, paradoxically, presage an easing of tensions between Moscow and
Kiev, Russia is likely to begin providing much more active support for
Crimea's efforts to loosen Ukraine's grip over it after the
Russian-dominated peninsula voted at the weekend for much closer ties with
Russia.
Moscow's new Crimean policy would involve building closer economic ties  -
for instance making it easier for Russian banks to open in Crimea to help it
develop tourism - and pushing for a settlement to the tug-of-war over the
Black Sea Fleet, headquartered in the closed Crimean port of Sevastopol.
'Russia has its sphere of special interests whether people like it or not,'
said Mr Konstantin Zatulin, head of the Russian parliament's committee for
relations with the CIS and Russians living abroad. 'There are some places
Russia simply cannot walk away from.'
He said he had the impression that the city and the fleet would never agree
to share the 100-ship fleet with Ukraine despite a breakdown in negotiations
over its transfer to Russia.
Mr Victor Semyonov, head of Sevastopol's city council, says it sees its
future only with Russia because it needed subsidies and stability to develop
economically after decades of isolation as a closed city. Its ailing
infrastructure means for instance that it will receive just two hours of
water a day starting from tomorrow.
The likelihood of a deal, rather than confrontation, with Ukraine after an
80 per cent 'yes' vote in an 'opinion poll' proposing a special treaty
between Crimea and Ukraine, dual citizenship, and special powers for
Crimea's president, has even been lent some credence by Ukrainian President
Leonid Kravchuk.
Mr Kravchuk, who earlier issued a decree outlawing the opinion poll as a
referendum in disguise, has since told a Crimean newspaper that he favoured
giving Crimea 'maximum economic independence' while preserving Ukraine's
territorial integrity. He also said Mr Yevgeny Saburov, a Moscow economist
whom the new Crimean president wants to appoint his prime minister, would be
able to receive Ukrainian citizenship in order to qualify for the job.
Crimea was given to Ukraine in 1954 when both were part of a single Soviet
state but it has sparked fears of a conflict ever since the two became
independent two years ago.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos has predicted impending
political crisis and instability in Italy following this week's general
election, Reuter reports from Athens.
Mr Pangalos, known for his frank, outspoken manner which in the past has
upset some of Greece's European Union partners, was speaking in an interview
with state television channel ET2 which was held on Tuesday and made
available to Reuters.
'We are entering a period of crisis, of instability in Italy. This is very
unpleasant not only because we are neighbours of this great country with
which we have traditionally had good relations, but also because we will
have among us, especially in the European Union, a government with no
power,' he said.
He said the victory of the Freedom Alliance, in which tycoon Silvio
Berlusconi's Forza Italia party has the most seats, was based on the 'magic
of the media and populist preachings on morality, happiness and the
liberation of citizens from taxes'.
'This populist alliance won the election,' Mr Pangalos said. 'It is indeed
an extreme example of how the law of the media rules.'
He said he could not see how Berlusconi's group of parties could form a
solid majority.
The Italian election result showed Europeans 'tend to turn to dead-end
solutions' when faced with social, economic and cultural impasses.

FT  31 MAR 94 / EU to draft work council directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The months of dialogue between trade unions and employers at European level
in search of agreement on the establishment of works councils in European
multinationals finally broke down yesterday.
With voluntary agreement between the social partners ruled out, the European
Commission will now proceed with a works council directive which is likely
to be passed at the end of the year.
The directive will require at least one meeting a year between employer
representatives and top management of a company to discuss investment,
production plans and redundancies.
It is is likely to affect about 1,000 companies in Europe and become law in
most countries in 1996 or 1997.
Works councils have been a matter of controversy between European unions and
employers for more than 20 years, with employers insisting that the form of
consult-ation should be left up to companies.
It had been hoped that a voluntary agreement between Unice, the European
employers' body, and the European Trades Union Congress, might be possible,
especially after Unice shifted towards the ETUC position by accepting the
principle of a legal right to information for employees.
But yesterday ETUC said that the withdrawal from the negotiations of the
Confederation of British Industry, the main British employers' body, had
undermined Unice's negotiating authority. The CBI was unhappy about the
earlier concessions that Unice made.
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the British TUC, one of the main
affiliates of the ETUC, said: 'What the employers have now done is make a
directive on this inevitable.'
The directive is likely to be passed under the German presidency later this
year, but will not become law for another two years at least.
It will not directly affect the UK as works councils are covered by
Britain's opt-out from the Maastricht Treaty. However, it is estimated that
at least 100 UK companies will be affected through their continental
European subsidiaries and most of them are likely to include their UK
employees.
Elsewhere, the directive will affect all companies with more than 1,000
employees operating in a minimum of two EU countries and with a minimum of
100 in one of the countries.
The directive will provide for voluntary arrangements within companies to be
agreed between unions and employers but will have a fall-back statutory
model.
That will require meetings of a works council at least once a year, with
other meetings triggered by particular events such as mergers or mass
redundancies.
The directive will lay down the areas which must be the subject of
discussion, the level within the company at which discussions must take
place, and minimum and maximum participants.
Statutory European works councils will not be a significant cost item for
companies, although they will have to foot the bill for travel and
interpreters.
But European companies and employers organisations have long argued that
while they agree with the goal of consultating and informing employees they
believe that there should be flexibility about how it is achieved.
Unions, on the other hand, have set great store by trans-national works
councils and see them as the first step towards trans-national collective
bargaining, a long-standing union goal.

FT  31 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Westland bought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westland's battle for survival looked almost over last night after GKN
revealed it had captured 54.4 per cent, just 0.6 percentage point below the
level it needs to declare the offer unconditional.
Earlier in the day, GKN lifted its hostile offer from 290p to 335p a share,
valuing Westland at Pounds 577m. Turnover came to 26m shares, the heaviest
in the market yesterday, with the price gaining 8 at 333p.
A Pounds 52.5m rights issue from Simon Engineering had been well flagged by
the company and the shares slipped just 3 to 118 1/2 p. The five-for-nine
cash call at 100p a share will be used to cut debt and bolster the balance
sheet.
Oil major British Petroleum fell 7 1/2 to 349p after Merrill Lynch joined
the ranks of analysts cutting forecasts following the decision by Opec to
maintain its oil production quota until the end of the year.
Merrill's oil analyst in New York, Mr Gus Fliakos, dropped his estimate for
the average price of Brent crude by almost Dollars 3 a barrel to Dollars
14.60.
As a result he reduced his forecast for the company's profits for this year
by Pounds 275m to Pounds 945m and his earnings per share estimate by 5p to
17.4p.
BAT Industries moved ahead 7 to 448p after several marketmakers decided that
the stock was oversold and worth picking up for the 6 per cent prospective
yield. One analyst pointed out that the stock had underperformed the FT-A
All-Share Index by 16 per cent over the past quarter.
Pharmaceutical group Zeneca shed 18 to 727p, partly as the stock caught up
with the slide elsewhere in the sector and also on concern over pressure on
mail order sales of Zestril, its high blood pressure treatment, from rival
Merck.
Mining group RTZ slipped 11 to 833p. BZW argued that the release of a huge
Japanese stockpile of copper on April 1 would have a 'major impact on the
copper price'.
Growing speculation that Great Universal Stores is poised to buy back a
chunk of its equity saw the shares rise 10 to 591p. Dealers heard more
rumours of activity by the company in the gilts market in preparation for
the move. If GUS were to buy back a stake of around 15 per cent, the cost
would be close to Pounds 1bn, a figure well covered by the company's
estimated Pounds 1.7bn cash pile.
Talk of improving margins at its B&amp;Q home improvement division, together
with some positive noises from brokers, lifted Kingfisher 12 to 569p.
Speculation that PepsiCo, the US soft drinks giant, is about to buy out its
partners in the Britvic distribution consortium for around Pounds 350m was
again heard and impacted on the shares concerned.
Bass, which owns a 45 per cent share, had a roller coaster day, tumbling 12
at the outset and then rallying 19 as the Britvic story gathered strength,
before fading towards the end to close a net 2 up at 535p. Turnover was
4.6m. Whitbread, which owns 22.5 per cent, slid 9 to 516p, with some worries
over the company's next strategic move, while Allied-Lyons, also owner of
22.5 per cent, lost 4 at 553p.
British Bio-technology jumped 20 to 490p on the view that its issue of
warrants exercisable at the end of next year at 525p offered a cheap way
into the stock. Dealers said James Capel, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley
were all recommending the stock.
Health products and photo processing group London International improved on
an announcement from the Department of Trade and Industry that price
controls on condoms would be lifted. However, the shares closed a net 2 down
at 146p.
Insurance brokers, which generate the majority of their earnings in dollars,
responded to the weakness of sterling against the US currency. Leaders
Willis Corroon and Sedgwick put on 2 at 228p and 208p respectively.
Meanwhile, Hogg Group benefited from an upbeat statement with its figures
and rose 7 to 141p.
The insurance sector was restrained by the market and, to a certain extent,
by the news that Norwich Union had suspended its sales staff. However, most
stocks recovered from their troughs as bargain hunters moved in. Prudential
closed 3 easier at 309p.
A widely rumoured rights offer from Stakis saw the hotel group look to raise
Pounds 67m, intended for selective hotel purchases. The one-for-four at 72p
a share was well received, and the stock steadied at 84p, off a penny on the
day.
Rank Organisation said it was quitting the video and audio rack jobbing
business in the US at a one-off cost of Dollars 75m. The shares lost 6 at
395p. One analyst said: 'It is a relief that they have got out, but why has
it taken so long? The business has been losing money for years.'
The wobbling property sector saw further retreats by the leading stocks and
the expected nervous debut by Capital Shopping Centres. The shares, which
received only 14.4 per cent acceptances for its public offering, came to the
market at 230p and languished a good 20p off for most of the day, closing at
208p. Turnover was 4.3m.
BOC shed 12 to 708p, some dealers suggesting that the stock was due for a
correction.
Waste group Shanks &amp; McEwan rose 6 to 87p after the company announced its
strategic review. Analysts were relieved that there was no mention of a
reduced dividend. But Mr Philip Morrish of Smith New Court said a question
mark remained over the EU directive on importing waste, which comes into
effect in May, and it was too early to turn positive.
Newcomer to the market Inspec started trading at 178p, well above its 160p
issue price, and ended at 185p, with Hoare Govett advising institutions that
the speciality chemicals group was worth 200p a share in the short term.

FT  31 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Forced sales hit BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decision by British Aerospace to force international shareholders to
lighten holdings because of rules governing overseas ownership of the
defence group saw the shares marked down sharply yesterday.
The company warned of its action late on Tuesday following a breach of the
permitted 29.5 per cent ownership. Yesterday the shares opened sharply lower
on fears that the move would cause a stock overhang and that buying pressure
would subside without the continued overseas interest.
But analysts said the problems caused by the ceiling, imposed by the
government to prevent the company being dominated by foreign interests, were
likely to force the government to relax the rule. After the market closed,
BAe said its foreign-owned stakes had fallen to 29.49 per cent.
Meanwhile, a press story that BAe's aircraft leasing obligations were
substantially greater than the income it expects to receive on sub-leases to
airlines was said to have caused few ruffles. The stock closed 13 off at
488p.

FT  31 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie 3,100 swept away in turbulent
market - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political worries, interest rate concern and uncertainty in US markets
combined to take the heart out of the London stock market yesterday. The
Footsie 3,100 mark, lost at the market's opening, was briefly regained later
but only to be swept away again when the market fell at the close as the Dow
Industrial Average shed 40 points in early deals. The final reading of
3,092.4 on the FT-SE 100 Index left a loss of 31 points on the day.
The initial damage was done by the overnight drop of 63 points on the Dow
and the rise in US long bond yields above 7 per cent. Moving in line with
other European bourses, the Footsie was 36 points off at the opening and
quickly extended this loss. But London was additionally hurt by the slide in
sterling as foreign exchange markets reacted sharply to the political storm
in the UK House of Commons prompted by the government's acceptance of the
changes in the EU voting structure - and particularly to attacks on Mr John
Major, the prime minister, from his own parliamentary supporters. Weakness
in sterling presents a further threat to prospects for a cut in UK base
rates and the short sterling market quickly took fright.
Little selling pressure developed in the stock market, however, and a rally
then set in, encouraged first by a further reduction in rates at the
Bundesbank repo tender and then by the favourable outcome to the auction of
Pounds 2.5bn UK short-dated securities.
Led by improvement in European bond markets, which responded to a modest
rebound in US Federal securities, equities regained most of their losses and
the Footsie touched 3,117.7, still 5.7 off on the day.
The last hour-and-a-half of business saw the revival in confidence abruptly
quelled when the early setback on Wall Street hit Europe. Nervousness in
London was reflected in a heavy seller of the June future contract on the
FT-SE 100 Index, and in rumours that an influential New York guru had cut
ratings on the US market.
The June Footsie future fell to a massive discount against the cash market -
but rebounded after the close of the official futures market.
Erratic trading this week has been blamed on the approach of the Easter
weekend, when securities houses will be unwilling to hold positions open.
This week's data on US consumer confidence has reinforced concern that a
strengthening economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten credit
policy sooner rather than later.
European investors have become increasingly nervous ahead of Good Friday,
when most markets will be closed but important US statistics on employment
will be announced.
Seaq volume jumped to 765m shares from 677.3m on Tuesday as nervous holders
got out of the market. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed above the day's worst
but showed a loss of 21.7 at 3,767.1, indicating that selling pressure had
not been confined to the blue chip sectors, which are linked to stock index
futures.
Weakness in sterling was identified as the new factor in the market
equation; easing in Bundesbank rates and tighter credit policy by the
Federal Reserve have both been largely taken on board by the UK stock
market, which has continued to hope for a further cut in domestic base
rates. But the prospect of continued pressure on the pound if overseas
investors take a negative view of the UK political situation will prompt a
hurried reappraisal of the UK base rate theory.

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Derivatives markets moved mostly in tandem with the underlying stock market
yesterday as they reacted to the sudden nervousness prompted by Wall
Street's setback, writes Terry Byland.
The FT-SE 100 Index opened 36 points down and the June contract on the index
also plunged, showing a discount of just over 8 points to the cash market;
the fair value premium is estimated at 3 to 8 points.
Although volume was unexciting, the market then turned higher and the June
contract was showing a premium of around 10 to cash as the FT-SE 100
approached its closing reading for the day. However, with Wall Street
dropping afresh at the beginning of the new session, a large seller of the
June future appeared and it quickly collapsed to 3,055, a 30-point discount
against the index. Volume was moderate at under 20,000 contracts.
But post-session trading saw the June contract quickly recover virtually all
of its discount as the seller disappeared, and traders said the opening
quotations this morning would depend entirely on Wall Street's performance.
Business in traded options increased to 42,164 lots from 23,741. The FT-SE
100 contract held the limelight, trading 20,480 against 9,446.

FT  31 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Ms Garzarelli helps Dow to
another slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equities yesterday suffered their worst setback in a week of heavy
losses, as the sell-off in stocks triggered by February's shift in monetary
policy took on fresh intensity, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
In a highly volatile session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished
72.27, or nearly 2 per cent, down at 3,626.75. The fall brought the
bellwether index's net loss since March 22, the day the Fed lifted rates for
a second time, to 235 points. The Dow now stands at its lowest level since
November 4.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 6.93 lower at 445.55. New
York SE volume was very heavy at 390.5m shares and for a second day running
declines overwhelmed advances, by 2,040 to 350. The American SE composite
plunged 8.89, or 2 per cent, to 445.54, while the Nasdaq composite weakened
10.38 to 744.91 after dropping some 17 points the previous day.
From the opening bell, stocks came under fire as the bearishness that pushed
the blue chip index down 63 points on Tuesday showed no signs of
dissipating. The immediate catalyst yesterday was news that Ms Elaine
Garzarelli, a highly respected analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York, had
grown more pessimistic about the extent to which the market would fall from
its Dow Industrial peak of 3,978, reached at the end of January.
Ms Garzarelli said she believed the current slide in the Dow, at about 7 per
cent before yesterday's rout, may be only half over. The index could fall by
10 to 15 per cent before the correction ended, she said.
Her comments brought a quick response on the trading floor. Within an hour
the Dow plunged by as much as 54 points, triggering the NYSE's uptick rule,
which restricts program-guided sales.
However, investors were able to reverse the tide, and the blue chips worked
their way back to near opening levels by the early afternoon. But the market
soon changed course once again, partly in response to renewed weakness in
the bond market. The uptick rule then was reimposed, but failed to stop the
Dow from hitting its session low at the close.
Allied Signal dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 34 1/4 , Alcoa Dollars 2 7/8
to Dollars 71 3/4 , Chevron Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 83 3/4 and General
Electric Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 98 3/4 . IBM survived with a gain of
Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 53 1/2 and 3M edged Dollars  5/8 higher to Dollars
99.
Canada
Continuing interest rate fears and weak Canadian dollar and bond prices sent
Toronto stocks into a further sharp retreat, leaving the TSE 300 composite
index 79.70, or 1.81 per cent, lower at 4,313.9. Falls swamped rises by 659
to 228 after volume of 96.3m shares.
Brazil
Sao Paulo saw shares end 5.2 per cent higher following the overnight news
that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, had officially
announced his presid-ential candidacy. The Bovespa index gained 748 at
15,156. Portfolio-squaring ahead of the end of the month also gave the
market some underpinning.

FT  31 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses volatile, mostly
weaker after US losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street's overnight losses on Tuesday, the steady opening in the US bond
market yesterday and the subsequent, continued weakness in US equities left
bourses volatile, but generally lower, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT shelved Tuesday's apparent switch from cyclicals into defensive,
or interest rate-sensitive stocks and dropped in most sectors, the Dax index
falling 20.82 points to 2,147.53, mounting post-bourse recovery and then
subsiding to close with the Ibis indicated Dax at 2,151.84.
Turnover fell from DM8.2bn to DM7.5bn. Another small cut in repo rates, and
a higher dividend did nothing for Deutsche Bank, which fell DM5 to DM795.50;
but BHF Bank, with higher than expected profits, rose another DM12.50 to
DM449 for a two-day gain of DM20.
BHF said yesterday that Metallgesellschaft, of which it is a major creditor,
had a good chance of survival after its recent disasters. Metallgesellschaft
itself said that its group operating loss narrowed by 38 per cent in the
first five months of 1993-94, and rose DM7.60 to DM196.50, up DM17.50 this
week.
PARIS dropped 1.9 per cent to a new 1994 closing low, suffering from the
sea-change in opinion which has seen it move from strategic favour at the
beginning of this year to the wrong end of a switch into Italy.
The CAC 40 index fell 39.37 to at 2,083.87. Oils were still suffering from
Opec's failure to cut production levels, and Total compounded this by
suffering from rights issue talk, falling FFr12.30 to FFr298.20. Elf
Aquitaine dropped FFr9 to FFr378, below its privatisation sale price of
FFr385.
Nor were stocks helped by the corporate results season. Pernod Ricard, the
drinks company, fell FFr11 to FFr382; its results, after hours, were in line
with expectations. Pinault Printemps, the retail group, lost FFr34 at FFr915
with its results due today.
MADRID, not surprisingly, was more comfortable with domestic, rather than
international concerns as it, too, hit a 1994 low, the general index
dropping 5.00 to 319.48 in turnover of Pta40bn.
Influenced by the US declines, Telefonica dropped Pta100 to Pta1,665.
However, Fecsa, the electrical utility which said yesterday that it would
raise its 1993 dividend by 60 per cent, mnaged to rise Pta15 to Pta1,020
against the trend.
MILAN continued upward, the Comit index adding 1.72 to 695.54, on the
perception that the right-wing Freedom Alliance was making progress towards
forming a government.
Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities recommended, given current
uncertainties, taking some profits at current levels. 'A serious dip in the
bond and equity markets would, however, be a buying opportunity,' he added.
'Longer term, further successful privatisation and the improving economic
fundamentals should ensure a return of the Italian equity and bond market to
outperformance.'
Insurers were the day's biggest beneficiaries on hopes that they would gain
from any move towards private pensions. RAS rose L1,547 or 6.1 per cent to
L27,125, Fondiaria put on L559 or 4.7 per cent to L12,438 and Generali added
L1,740 or 2.5 per cent to L40,876.
Pirelli rose L86 or 3.4 per cent to L2,583 after the announcement that it
was launching a L1,000bn bond: investors welcomed the news that the group
wanted to move into telecommunications.
Olivetti dipped L69 or 2.6 per cent to L2,571 on profit-taking after the
strong run-up to Monday's news that it had been granted Italy's second
mobile telephone licence.
AMSTERDAM's AEX index finished 2.19 lower at 404.71. The market was
supported by some light bargain hunting and demand for stocks which trade
ex-dividend next month.
Mr Marc Slendebroek at Kleinwort Benson, who has revised his Dutch market
weighting to neutral from overweight, commented that given the continuous
drain on liquidity by cash calls and the depressed dollar, there was little
potential for the Dutch market to outperform.
VNU went against the trend, rising FL 6.70 to Fl 175.70 following the
announcement that it had priced its planned 3m share issue at Fl 169.
ZURICH reduced some of its early losses in a technical rebound which left
the SMI index to close 12.9 down at 2,814.5, after a low of 2,783.1.
Ciba registered, the most active stock, bucked the trend rising SFr13 to
SFr877 and halting the profit-taking that followed Tuesday's results. Many
investors are seen as underweight in the company which is likely to benefit
from a pick-up in industrial activity.
HELSINKI continued the painful reassessment of its own, and international
interest rate prospects, the Hex index falling 36.4 to 1,766.8.

FT  31 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Political developments hold the key
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political developments held the key in three of the world's emerging markets
last week.
Istanbul, already sharply down since the beginning of the year, was the
week's biggest loser.
The market became nervous when it decided that this Monday's local elections
were a key test of whether the coalition government of Mrs Tansu Ciller, the
prime minister, could be trusted to tackle the looming economic crisis.
The gloom was compounded as Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit ratings agency,
downgraded the country's debt and placed it on credit watch, suggesting that
the rating might be lowered even further.
Mexico and Brazil both had bumpy weeks.
Mexico began firmly on a combination of political and interest rate
considerations, before the country was shaken by Wednesday's assassination
of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate.
The market was closed on Thursday as a mark of respect and it was left to
Wall Street to respond with a sharp fall before local investors returned in
remarkably resilient form on Friday.
Sao Paulo shares recovered from worries early in the week about higher
interest rates and rising inflation fore-casts as speculation mounted that
Mr Fernando Henrique Cordoso, minister of the economy, would run for
president.

FT  31 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei declines on
US-Japan trade tensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of mounting US-Japan tensions over trade spurred a further rise in the
yen, and equities closed moderately lower after an early fall of more than 2
per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average lost a net 149.83 at 19,559.91 after opening at the
day's high of 19,640.53. The index dropped to a low for the session of
19,288.86 in the morning as the yen peaked at Y102.52 to the dollar on
speculation that the US government will attempt to talk up the Japanese
currency, due to dissatisfaction with Japan's trade package, announced on
Tuesday.
Criticism of the measures was voiced by Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade
Representative in Washington, and Mr Walter Mondale, the US ambassador to
Japan, in a morning meeting in Tokyo. However, the yen lost some of its
steam and finished a net Y0.50 up at Y103.30.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 8.29 to 1,588.22 and the
Nikkei 300 slipped 1.48 to 290.99. Declines led advances by 792 to 241, with
144 issues unchanged. In London the ISE Nikkei 50 index shed 4.97 to
1,303.42.
Volatility on the currency markets kept many investors on the sidelines and
trading volume totalled 330m shares against 254m. Small-lot buying by public
funds and financial institutions in the afternoon helped to remove some of
the uncertainty.
Export oriented high-technology shares lost ground on the higher yen. NEC,
the day's most active issue, retreated Y20 to Y1,100 and Ricoh, which rose
on firm earnings prospects earlier in the week, met profit-taking and dipped
Y8 to Y830. Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y10 to Y1,730 and Sony
Y80 to Y6,050. The high yen also hurt steels, NKK losing Y10 at Y250.
Some trading houses were higher on the multimedia theme. Many of the
companies are investing in cable television, and forming alliances with
satellite-related companies. Itochu rose Y17 to Y698 and Mitsubishi Y30 to
Y1,150.
Drug stocks, unaffected by currency movements, were popular. Takeda Chemical
moved forward Y10 to Y1,230 and Daiichi Pharmaceutical Y20 to Y1,520.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 270.53 to 21,750.08 in volume of 86.8m
shares. The index fell through 22,000 for the first time in three weeks.
Roundup
The region produced varied reactions, or a lack of them, to the overnight
slide on Wall Street.
HONG KONG dropped on the US sell-off, and on measures to curb domestic
property prices, the Hang Seng index tumbling 247.93, or 2.6 per cent, to
9,232.21.
Turnover was flat, and low at HKDollars 4.5bn. During late trade the
government announced the setting up of a task force in the next few months
to make proposals for the improvement of residential land supply. It also
plans to speed up the release of sites in the remote Tin Shui Wai area.
Major property stocks all fell. Cheung Kong relinquished HKDollars 1.25 at
HKDollars 40.25, New World HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 28.10 and Sun Hung Kai
Properties HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 54.50.
NEW ZEALAND ended 1.9 per cent lower in line with overseas trends, and as
investors reassessed fixed-interest alternatives following the sharp rise in
interest rates over the past few weeks.
The NZSE-40 index fell 39.32 to 2,076.23. Higher rates, in particular, were
largely responsible for weakness in stocks with high dividend yields such as
Telecom. The company also ran into strike news as it ended 10 cents down at
NZDollars 5.10 but off its low of NZDollars 4.95.
AUSTRALIA clawed back early sharp losses sustained in response to Wall
Street, the All Ordinaries index closing a net 8.4 off at 2,092.4. An
improving bond market, comments by Mr Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank
governor, that a rise in official interest rates is some way off, and
current account data in line with expectations, all contributed to the
subsequent recovery.
MANILA, normally sensitive to US influences, saw Philippine Long Distance
Telephone slightly higher in New York overnight, and unchanged at home at
1,740 pesos. The composite index rose to 2,726 and then hit profit-taking to
end 37 up at 2,711.50.
SINGAPORE's brokers gave a polite nod in the Dow's direction but
institutions were buying the market and bargain hunters also came in. The
Straits Times Industrial index finished 34.67, or 1.7 per cent, ahead at
2,128.39 after sharp falls last week and on Monday.
COLOMBO extended its correction, the all-share index falling a further 13.64
to 1,183.07.

FT  31 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Weak currency helps bolster
Johannesburg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharply weaker financial rand and some bargain hunting helped pare losses
in Johannesburg, still very nervous after the week's political developments.
Wall Street's overnight drop and the lower gold bullion price took an early
toll. The weaker financial rand was also initially seen as a negative
factor, signalling poor political sentiment and increased offshore selling.
But the currency's weakness worsened after midday, making shares cheaper for
foreign investors, and equity prices were also bolstered by some local
bargain hunting.
The gold shares index closed 31 down at 1,994, industrials fell 67 to 5,696
and the overall index lost 32 at 4,935.
Anglos fell heavily in early trade, shedding R10.25, or 5 per cent, to R194
before rebounding to R210 by the close. JCI, the diversified mining house,
declined R2 to R85.50 but its restructuring plans found a broad welcome.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Politics knock sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The renewed political difficulties of Mr John Major, who faces widespread
criticism from within his own party, put the pound under pressure on foreign
exchanges yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
Sterling got off to a very nervous start following intense media speculation
about Mr Major's future, following what was seen as a humiliating climbdown
over voting rights in the European Union.
In early European trading sterling fell below Dollars 1.4750, from Tuesday's
London close of Dollars 1.4927, before steadying to finish at Dollars
1.4790. It was also lower against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.4829 from
DM2.4889. Short sterling futures also took a battering, the June contract
falling 14 points to a low of 94.42 before rallying to end at 94.52.
Trading was generally fairly quiet, investors either taking to the sidelines
or scaling back their positions ahead of the long weekend. The tidying up of
positions at the end of the quarter also played a part.
There were few surprises in Germany, where the Bundesbank allowed the repo
rate to fall by another four basis points to 5.76 per cent. The Belgian
central bank brought itself into line with lower German rates by cutting its
key central rate 10 basis points to 6.05 per cent.
Aside from political worries, sterling was also undermined by talk of a
tightening in credit policy which accompanied the monthly monetary meeting
between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor
of the Bank of England.
Many UK analysts believe inflation pressures remain subdued and are counting
on a further base rate reduction, probably in the summer. The chances of a
cut will have improved with the Bundesbank yesterday confirming the downward
path of German rates.
The market, however, continues to take a gloomier view of events. The June
short sterling future is discounting a rise in base rates of about 25 basis
points to 5.5 per cent by mid-year. Futures staged a recovery in the
afternoon after plummeting during early trade. The December contract closed
unchanged at 93.96 after a low for the day of 93.72.
Mr Julian Callow, international economist at Kleinwort Benson, said the
profile of short-term rates was very exaggerated. 'The market is basically
factoring in a full-blown sterling crisis, a sharp pick-up in UK inflation
and rapid economic growth, all at once.' He said it was unlikely that the UK
would be hit by this combination.
The Kleinwort analyst said sterling had been 'cruising for a bruising' ever
since the controversial rate cut in February. The fundamental weakness of
the currency had initially been disguised by the weaker dollar, but
political concern and worries about the current account deficit had now
resurfaced.
Mr Callow said foreign investors were nervous about the political outlook,
and sterling weakness reflected a more generalised shift out of UK assets.
Some analysts argue that if Mr Major were to leave office, probably to be
replaced by Mr Kenneth Clarke or Mr Michael Heseltine, this could well be
positive for sterling.
The Bank of England put Pounds 774m liquidity into the money markets after
predicting a shortage of Pounds 750m.
The D-Mark was softer in Europe after the Bundesbank again trimmed the repo
rate. It closed lower in London against the French franc at FFr3.419 from
FFr3.424. The Italian lira continued to firm in the aftermath of the
election. It finished at L973.4 from L977.9.
Analysts said the cut in the repo rate showed that the Bundesbank was
prepared to continue cutting rates in spite of poor money supply figures.
German M3 money supply for February grew at an annualised 17.6 per cent, far
above the Bundesbank's growth target of 4 to 6 per cent, but slower than
January's 21.2 per cent rise.
German call money stayed tight at the 6.75 per cent Lombard rate, with banks
under pressure to ensure that they have secured sufficient month-end funds.
Sentiment in the futures market was more positive, with the June Euromark
contract a point firmer at 94.52 and the December contract six basis points
higher at 94.91.
The dollar finished higher against the weaker D-Mark, at DM1.6788 from
DM1.6675. Against the yen, however, it was lower, ending in London at
Y103.490 from Y103.600. In New York it closed at DM1.6748 and Y102.835.
With the US-Japan trade row having returned to centre stage, Mr Steve
Hannah, director of research at IBJ International, said it looked as if the
yen would make another run at the all-time high of Y101.3 to the dollar.
The US administration on Tuesday dismissed a Japanese market-opening package
as 'of little substance'. Mr Hannah said it was clear 'this dispute is going
to smoulder on for some time'.
Traders said the recent volatility in the yen reflected end-of-quarter
balance sheet manipulation by Japanese companies, and speculators probing to
see at what levels the Bank of Japan was prepared to intervene to support
the dollar.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Robusta coffee producers
expected to suspend export retention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robusta coffee producers are expected to stop withholding exports following
a rise in the international price.
Last week producers of arabica coffee dropped the amount of exports they are
holding off the market from 20 per cent to 10 per cent following strong
gains in prices of that variety.
The latest rise came at the end of a meeting of coffee producers and
consumers in London that adopted a new 5-year international coffee
agreement, to take effect in October.
The export retention scheme has helped to lift prices since it began last
October, but analysts attribute the market's current strength to a supply
shortage from most producing countries. 'The decline in production is due to
the lack of investment over the last few years because prices have been so
low,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles of brokers GNI.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mr Attavar's petunias blaze
biotechnology trail - India is hoping genetically-engineered plants will
yield a rich export harvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a laboratory in Bangalore, in south India, a researcher holds a dish with
three small brown leaves sprouting from a sponge-like mat. It is a petunia,
he says, the first fruits of India's commercial genetic engineering
industry.
The petunia is growing in a light-filled, dust-free room as clean as a
hospital operating theatre inside the laboratories of Indo-American Hybrid
Seeds, a producer of seeds and plants for farmers and market-gardeners in
India and around the world. Founded nearly 30 years ago by Mr Manmohan
Attavar, the chairman, the company is now on the fore-front of efforts by
Indian and foreign companies to transform India into a principal source for
the international trade in seeds and young plants.
'India's got lots of land, water and sunshine. And it has very good
researchers. There's no reason why we can't export quite a bit to the rest
of the world,' says 62-year-old Mr Attavar, who studied agricultural
sciences in the US before returning to India to establish his business.
India has a wide diversity of soils, climates and natural flora, which
together have encouraged the development of a long tradition in agricultural
sciences. But the decades of autarkic economic policies that followed
independence restricted the contacts between Indian scientists and their
foreign counterparts and limited the prospects for international trade.
Moreover, domestic research was dominated by public sector institutions that
often frowned upon the efforts of private companies. Also, India's refusal
to subscribe to internationally-accepted norms for intellectual property
rights made foreign researchers wary of sharing their knowledge.
However, the liberalisation of the Indian economy in recent years and the
country's decision to accept the Uruguay Round of trade talks, which binds
nations to enforce strict patent laws, is bringing India into the mainstream
of international trade in seeds and plants. The potential for improving the
condition of Indian agriculture is also significant. For example, about half
the Rs30bn-worth (Pounds 640m) of tomatoes grown annually are destroyed by
viral diseases. Scientists in Mr Attavar's genetic engineering laboratory
are trying to produce a disease-resistant tomato by manipulating its genetic
codes.
The history of Mr Attavar's company mirrors the recent history of India's
plant breeding industry. He started in the 1960s by producing hybrid seeds
for petunias and other plants and diversified into vegetable hybrids in the
1970s. (Hybrids are produced by cross-pollinating plants to encourage the
development of particular qualities, such as resistance to disease or
above-average size in vegetables. Producers sell either seeds or plants to
farmers and other customers.
Indo-American Hybrid Seeds became the country's largest exporter of flower
seeds and a leading exporter of vegetable seeds, including tomatoes. Last
year its annual sales topped Rs150m, of which Rs65m was exported. Mr Attavar
invested heavily in research and development and in 1988 established a
biotechnology laboratory for producing plants by tissue-culture - that is
growing whole plants from fragments of plants. The technique permits the
large-scale reproduction of plants bred for particular qualities, including
bananas, vanilla, chrysanthemum and carnations.
The newest development is the genetic engineering laboratory, set up last
year with the latest imported equipment. It is home to the
genetically-engineered petunia, a plant developed mainly to test techniques.
Researchers are working on disease-resistant tomatoes, flowers that will
stay fresh longer after they are cut and grains with an extra-high protein
content. They also dream of creating blue roses (produced in only a handful
of genetic engineering laboratories) and blue lilies (which, Indo-American
says have yet to be grown anywhere).
The international trade in seeds and plants is largely in the hands of
companies in the US, the Netherlands and Italy. But developing countries
including Thailand are expanding rapidly. Mr John Hamilton, managing
director of Cargill India, an affiliate of Cargill the American seeds
company, says India's export prospects are 'brilliant'. Cargill, which
started its Indian business in 1988, has been at the centre of controversy
over commercial seed development. Indian farmers last year attacked the
company's Bangalore office claiming that seed companies would seize control
of seed development and use post-Uruguay Round patent laws to prevent
farmers from trading in their own seeds.
The protests were largely based on a misunderstanding of the Uruguay Round,
though they also reflected genuine fears of farmers about the impact of new
technologies (often of foreign origin) on their work and way of life.
Mr Attavar says the farmers have little need to worry as new breeds of plant
will improve yields and raise rural standards of living. Far from being
harmed by international trade, farmers will benefit by winning access to
seeds for crops with export potential. 'If we use the right seeds and
improve our transport our agricultural produce can be marketed everywhere in
the world.' Protectionist trade regimes in the US, the EU and Japan will
restrict access to these markets but Indian farmers will have plenty of
scope in nearby countries, notably in the Gulf.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Swiss buying lifts platinum to
7-month high - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss buying boosted the PLATINUM price yesterday as other precious metals
languished.
After a quiet start the white metal moved up to Dollars 409.50 a troy ounce
at London's afternoon fix and then gained another Dollars 3.50 to reach the
highest level since last August. Swiss dealers, who had 'got out of their
longs' earlier in the week, 'came back in on the lows', one trader said.
Meanwhile GOLD closed just 55 cents up and SILVER shed another 7 cents.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Technical selling wave batters
copper market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper prices tumbled yesterday under the weight of computer-driven
technical selling in New York and operators taking profits before Easter in
London. Having started the day at Dollars 1,940 a tonne, the three-month
price crashed through two technical support levels - at Dollars 1,920 and
Dollars 1,900 - to close in London at Dollars 1,890.25, down Dollars 46.25
and its lowest for four weeks.
Nearly all big copper consumers and merchants were waiting for this
correction, suggested Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at the Merrill Lynch
financial services group. 'They were hoping the market would cool down a bit
during the summer and were anxiously waiting to buy any and all price dips
down from 86 cent a pound (Dollars 1,895 a tonne) to 80 cents (Dollars
1,763).' He pointed out that demand for copper in the US was so strong that
the States had to import more than 30,000 tonnes in March, while in Europe,
not only was demand picking up, but supply was becoming 'something of a
problem'.
He thought copper would not go much below 80 cents a pound in 1994 and
should be back at 95 cents by the year-end.
Mr Wiktor Bielski at Bain &amp; Company, part of the Deutsche Bank group, was
even more bullish. He suggested that copper supplies were tight, as a
120,000-tonne fall in global stocks in the past three months indicated,
while demand in the US was roaring ahead. He forecast copper would be back
at Dollars 1 a pound (Dollars 2,204 a tonne) by the end of 1993.
He said yesterday's fall in London had been triggered because speculators
were not able to force the price upwards through technical resistance at
Dollars 1,950 a tonne and decided to take some profit instead.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Traders call for VAT changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grain and soft commodities traders are lobbying the European Commission for
the amendment of proposals put forward for excluding commodity transactions
from the levy of value added tax.
The commission drafted proposals to try to remove uncertainty caused in the
commodities trade over complex VAT rules.
In spite of single market regulations that came into force at the beginning
of last year exempting from VAT sales of goods between registered traders in
each member country, commodity transactions were still subject to VAT levies
in a number of EU countries.
Some member countries were applying VAT to the 'paper' transactions so
prevalent in the commodities trade. This often involves a series of sales
and purchases without physical delivery taking place.
The commission is proposing that the sale of commodities located in a
so-called 'fiscal' warehouse will be able to benefit from VAT suspension
until the goods are removed from the warehouse. But the commission specifies
the commodities must be placed in a separate building.
Commodity traders object to the commission's suggestion as shipments of
grain or rice, for example, may be sold while on board ship or on storage at
a port. Taking the cargo out of the ship and placing it in a special silo so
that it can avoid VAT on subsequent transactions would be uneconomic as the
cost would be more than the VAT saved.
UK grain traders are hoping to organise a special conference to outline the
problems involved. The commission's proposal would have to be passed by EU
finance ministers which could take about six months.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Floating-rate gilts auction 2.28 times
oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN, ANTONIA SHARPE and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After a weak start, UK gilts outperformed most other markets yesterday with
traders taking heart from the positive reception to the Bank of England's
first auction of floating-rate gilts for 15 years.
Dealers said prices were also boosted by signs of strength in US and German
bond markets.
Gilt prices opened a point lower, as the market fell prey to rumours that UK
prime minister John Major was on the point of resigning. But such fears were
soon shrugged off, and long gilt futures on the Liffe gained almost two
points before falling back in after-hours trading to end at 107 5/32 , up 1
1/2 points.
The Pounds 2.5bn worth of floating-rate gilts due 1999 was oversubscribed by
2.28 times, according to the Bank of England. The weighted average accepted
price was 99.92. The gilts pay interest of 1/8 point below the London
interbank bid rate (Libid).
Dealers interpreted the auction's success as a sign of confidence in the
market, rather than a symptom of lack of interest in conventional gilts,
reflecting expectations that UK interest rates will start to rise sooner
rather than later.
The enthusiastic reception to the auction fuelled hopes that more of the
Bank's funding will be completed through floating-rate issues, limiting the
supply of conventional, fixed-rate gilts.
Despite the strong rally, there was little sign of any return to the market
by medium-term institutional investors, and price changes were driven by
futures trading.
The spread between two-year and 10-year gilts has widened to 119 basis
points from 85 basis points on Friday, as the long-end of the market
improved.
Yesterday's rally 'prompted discussion of a key reversal day,' according to
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg. Many analysts believe the
market could rally strongly from current levels, if end-investors return to
the market.
Italian government bonds ended higher after a fairly volatile day on hopes
that the right-wing alliance would be able to form a government in the near
future. The June contract of the Italian government bond future on Liffe
traded between a low of 109.95 and a high of 111.80 during the day. In the
late afternoon, the contract stood at 111.35, up 1.17 points on the day.
German government bond prices rallied slightly on the news of a four basis
point cut in the repo rate. The Bundesbank awarded DM65.9bn in variable-rate
securities repurchase agreements, and lowered the marginal rate to 5.76 per
cent from 5.80 at last week's repo. Dealers said the cut was widely
expected, and prices ended the day only about 1/8 point higher.
French government bonds remained vulnerable to domestic political
developments but traders detected some buying interest late in the day,
which they said was position-squaring ahead of the long Easter weekend. The
June contract of the notional 10-year French government bond on Matif fell
from a day's high of 123.08 to trade at 122.94 late in the afternoon, down
0.12 points on the day. However, this was off the day's worst level of
122.74.
Longer-dated US Treasury bonds slipped further yesterday as stronger than
expected data on factory orders brought an abrupt halt to an early rebound
in prices.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 lower
at 89 17/32 , with the yield rising to 7.097 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 99 7/8 , to yield 5.175 per cent.
After days of heavy selling pressure, the market opened firmer, with prices
across the yield curve showing modest improvement in lacklustre activity.
However, the market gave back all of its gains and more soon after the
mid-morning announcement by the Commerce Department that new factory orders
had fallen 1.0 per cent last month, marking the first decline since July.
Traders were disappointed, however, because analysts had forecast a decline
of 1.2 per cent. In addition, most of the weakness was concentrated in the
volatile aircraft sector. The data's suggestion that February's weather had
not slowed the economy as much as expected sent a chill through the market,
which was already nervously anticipating Friday's important employment data.
The weakness at the long end was also linked to jitters in the
mortgage-backed securities market, where traders fear a sell-off by Askin
Capital Management, an operator of hedge funds, which have experienced heavy
losses.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Healthy demand seen for Dutch
guilder-denominated paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABN Amro Bank, the Netherlands' largest bank, and Nederlandse Gasunie, the
Dutch gas company, tapped the guilder sector of the international bond
market yesterday with issues amounting to Fl 650m, following close on the
heels of a Fl 400m deal by the Kingdom of Sweden on Tuesday.
While activity remained fairly subdued, syndicate officials were optimistic
that the Republic of Italy might tap the international bond market soon,
following the general election outcome.
Mr Alberto Giovannini, head of the Italian Treasury's international
borrowing programme, said yesterday there were no plans to launch an
international bond issue in the immediate future.
He pointed out that the market background has been 'very unwelcoming'
recently, but added that Italy has been looking at the possibility of doing
a bond issue at some stage.
Italy's foreign currency borrowing is expected to be between Dollars 10bn
and Dollars 12bn in 1994, of which about Dollars 3bn equivalent has already
been achieved.
In the guilder sector of the market, syndicate officials claimed there was
fairly healthy demand for guilder-denominated paper, despite the recent
volatility in the bond markets which has kept many borrowers away.
Dutch government bonds, which have tended to yield less than German
government paper, are currently yielding more than their German counterparts
as the Dutch market has reacted badly to recent inflation figures.
However, syndicate officials claim some investors are taking the view that
there is scope for Dutch paper to trade through German bonds again, and that
the market will pick up as and when the Bundesbank eases.
ABN Amro's self-led Fl 500m bond issue has a six-year maturity, a coupon of
6.375 per cent and yields 25 basis points over the government paper. The
bonds were mainly pre-placed with domestic institutions, according to the
bank, and they traded at around 99.55 to 99.65, above the reoffer price.
Nederlandse Gasunie's Fl 150m, five-year deal was aimed mainly at retail
investors in Switzerland and the Benelux countries who are attracted by the
triple A rating. The bonds were priced to yield 8 basis points over
government bonds and traded at 99.35 - 99.45 by late afternoon.
Royal Bank of Scotland announced that it has raised Dollars 200m from US
retail investors with an issue of perpetual notes exchangeable into
preference shares.
The bank issued 8m Exchangeable Capital Securities of Dollars 25 each with a
coupon of 8.5 per cent. The notes count as upper tier two capital.
Nomura's securitisation subsidiary has launched a Dollars 410m issue backed
by US commercial mortgages, writes Antonia Sharpe in London.
Of the total issue, Dollars 353m will be sold through a public offering and
the remainder through a private placement. Thirty-three per cent of the
issue is secured on loans on hotels and 67 per cent on retail properties.
Around 60 per cent of the multi-tranche deal is rated triple A. Maturities
go up to 20 years and payment on the deal is due April 15.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: IBCA positive on Nordic banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banks in the Nordic region, battered by heavy loan losses, are on the road
to recovery and some are likely to see individual ratings raised this year,
IBCA said yesterday.
The European rating agency said improved results in 1993, with major banks
in Denmark, and Norway and some in Sweden swinging back to profit, were
attributable largely to favourable market conditions but it warned the
situation had not yet returned to normal.
'Further falls in interest rates, if any, will be relatively limited and net
interest revenue in many Nordic banks looks set to come under pressure from
intensified competition,' IBCA said.
'Similarly, capital gains on securities are not expected to be as high as in
1993,' the agency added.
But it also said there was an improvement in the underlying financial
condition of many banks as loan loss provisions were on a downward trend and
anticipated continuing improvement in 1994.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Record domestic issue from
China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China will tomorrow launch an Dollars 11.5bn domestic bond issue - its
biggest ever - to help cover the budget deficit and the increasing
debt-service obligations of its vast infrastructure programme.
Western bankers and economists say that plans to issue some Yn100bn (Dollars
11.5bn) in two and three-year bonds are highly ambitious and will severely
test the Chinese debt markets.
In the past, China has resorted to compulsory sales to individuals and
institutions to clear a backlog. The authorities last year also outlawed the
issue of competing debt issues such as enterprise bonds.
China's budget deficit is forecast to reach Yn67bn this year, a big increase
over last year. Total liabilities, including domestic and foreign debt
service, are expected to amount to Yn129.6bn.
China has already issued Yn15bn in six-month and 12-month Treasury bills to
institutions this year. The 12-month paper is yielding just under 12 per
cent, or about one percentage point more than the bank deposit rate.
Chinese officials see this year's massive bond issue as soaking up surplus
funds and aiding the fight against inflation.
Among causes of continuing sharp rises in the cost of living is a consumer
spending boom. China is also struggling to reduce money supply growth.
The three-year bonds will carry an interest rate of 13.96 per cent. This
compares with increases in the cost of living running at more than 20 per
cent in the larger cities.
Chinese investors have been reluctant to take up yuan-denominated bonds
because of currency depreciation and worries about inflation.
Beijing's first-ever public share offer has been heavily oversubscribed, the
Beijing Evening News reported yesterday.
Thousands queued for three days at more than 300 outlets to buy forms giving
them the right to participate in a lottery for shares in four companies.
The companies include Beijing Department Store and Beijing Light Bus
Company.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Glass write-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Owens-Corning, the US glass company, said it will report one-off charges of
Dollars 122m after tax in the first quarter of 1994, balanced exactly by a
Dollars 122m after-tax gain from a change in accounting treatment.
Some Dollars 83m of the charges stem from restructuring initiatives which
the company said would improve its earnings per share by between 35 and 40
cents from next year.
The remaining charges reflect accounting changes, while the one-off gain,
equivalent to Dollars 2.74 a share, stems from a switch to the capital
method of accounting for rebuilding facilities.
This method is standard practice in the industry and involves capitalising
costs when incurred and spreading them over the useful life of the
equipment.

Salomon Brothers yesterday said it was paying Dollars 66m to settle class
action suits by a number of bond investors, signalling an attempt finally to
put the 1991 Treasury bond auction scandal behind it.
The settlement, which needs court approval, involves investors who claim
they lost money as a result of Salomon's rigging of US government bond
auctions.
The firm has already paid Dollars 190m to Federal government agencies and
set up a Dollars 100m fund to meet civil claims.
Salomon said it expected more than half the Dollars 66m to be reimbursed to
it out of the claims fund. It settled other class actions last year for
Dollars 55m plus costs.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Selling a blueprint for black
mining control - Anglo American's reorganisation has deep political
implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo American's decision to break up Johannesburg Consolidated Investment,
its associate mining house, amounts to a significant corporate
reorganisation in its own right. However, the aim of relinquishing control
of many of its assets ideally to the black business community sets the
manoeuvre apart.
The African National Congress, however, which has called publicly for the
establishment of a 'black mining house', is quick to point out that the move
provides only a platform for what might be an important development towards
greater formal black ownership of the economy. 'Let's wait and see,' says
ANC spokesman Mr Carl Niehaus.
Circumspection is required, because although Anglo has proved its word and
designed a workable vehicle for black economic empowerment, quite who will
emerge to manage a black-owned mining house and raise money to buy it is
still unclear.
'There is no heir apparent,' say Mr Michael Spicer, an Anglo spokesman. He
notes that Anglo's exercise in Afrikaner economic empowerment in the 1960s -
when mining assets were sold to insurance group Sanlam - took six years to
complete.
Reaction from the local investment community is more welcoming, with
surprise stemming not so much from the decision to dismantle JCI but the way
in which it is going to be done.
Analysts were aware Anglo was considering the disposal of JCI to black
business, but they were puzzled how it could be done so as to reduce the
cost of buying the group outright and the risks associated with raising that
amount of capital, while ensuring Anglo would retain its strategic
investments within JCI.
JCI, in which Anglo and sister company De Beers have 39.6 per cent and 8.4
per cent stakes respectively, is a considerable mining industrial
enterprise. It has a market value of R13bn (Dollars 3.8bn) and yearly sales
of R2.6bn. Its assets include Rustenburg Platinum, the world's largest
platinum producer, two quality gold mines, important coal and ferrochrome
businesses, and large stakes in two of the countries leading industrial
groups: South African Breweries and the Premier Group.
The mechanism Anglo will use for the unbundling is the creation of three new
holding companies, which will house JCI's platinum, other mining, and
industrial interests. Anglo will retain control of the platinum mining arm -
it will buy JCI's diamond trading interests, regarded as a natural fit with
De Beers - while encouraging black investors to come forward to buy shares
in in the other holding companies, which represent large but less formidable
businesses from the point of view of an outside buyer.
Mr William Bowler, head of research at stockbrokers Fergusson Brothers,
says: 'It's a very clever move which makes a good deal of corporate and
political sense.'

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Comalco leads power station deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium led by Comalco, the large intergrated aluminium producer which
is 67 per cent-owned by CRA, yesterday formally acquired the Gladstone power
station from the Queensland government for ADollars 750m (USDollars 536m).
To help fund the deal, Comalco and its partners required non-recourse
project financing of ADollars 625m. This has been provided by a banking
consortium led by Barclays Bank, and involving Commonwealth Bank of
Australia, ANZ, Industrial Bank of Japan and Deutsche Bank.
The transaction has attracted considerable attention, because it was the
first financing of a large resources-related project whose viability could
be affected by an Aboriginal land claim under the new federal native title
legislation. This came into force at the beginning of the year.
The purchase of the power station is tied to Comalco's plans to expand
production of its nearby Boyne Island aluminium smelter. However, land in
the surrounding Cape York peninsular is subject to a native title claim by
the Wik people. The claim covers some of Comalco's bauxite leases, which may
have to supply raw material to the smelter.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Profits surge at Bank Leumi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank Leumi, Israel's second-largest bank, has reported 1993 profits of
Shk370m (Dollars 125m), a 58 per cent increase on 1992. Shareholders are to
be paid dividends totalling Shk114m.
Fourth-quarter profit for 1993 was Shk141m - a massive 88 per cent increase
on the same quarter in 1992, and 52 per cent up on the July-September 1993
period.
The bank attributed the rise in profits to a lower allocation for bad debts,
reduced activity in loss-making branches overseas, and the implementation of
a new domestic business strategy.
The bank also sold off part of its holdings in its Union Bank subsidiary
during the year.
Ten per cent of shares in Bank Leumi were sold off on the Tel Aviv stock
exchange in May 1993, the bank said. There were plans to sell another 20 to
40 per cent during 1994. Bidders were invited to submit applications by
April 18.
Israel's third-largest bank, the Israel Discount Bank, also released figures
showing a jump in net earnings for 1993 - up 26.5 per cent to Shk205m.
Fourth-quarter profits stood at Shk78m compared to Shk69m in the same
quarter of 1992.
Israel Discount Bank's managing director Mr Avraham Asheri attributed the
improved performance in part to lower taxes, and also to the fact that, for
1993, all profits from the bank's Mercantile Discount Bank subsidiary had
been included in the consolidated statement. In 1992, only 50 per cent of
the profits had been included.

United Bank of Kuwait, the London-based bank owned by Kuwaiti financial
institutions, has reported a 40 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, to Pounds
14.5m (Dollars 21.6m), for 1993. The figure was struck on operating income
of Pounds 50.6m, a rise of 9.5 per cent.
UBK, 24 per cent of which is held by the Kuwait national pension fund,
reported profits after tax of Pounds 10.3m, up from Pounds 7.5m in 1992. Its
capital base rose 17 per cent to Pounds 235m. Shareholders will receive an
overall dividend of Pounds 7.7m.
Mr Chris Keen, general manager, said the results showed progress on all
fronts, particularly in market-based operations, notably its fixed-income
products. The bank, the bulk of whose clients are Kuwait or Gulf-based, saw
its funds under management rise 22 per cent to almost Dollars 2.64bn.
The 1993 figures mark a substantial improvement on the bank's recent
earnings, after showing only an operating profit in 1990, when it was hurt
by the the Gulf war. UBK showed modest improvements in 1991 and 1992.
Mr Keen said UK commercial property funds opened in 1992 and 1993 were
performing well, as were newly-introduced private banking and Islamic
banking products. 'We feel well-placed. The markets we're operating in are
more difficult than they were last year, but we will continue to do well,'
he said.
In May last year, UBK bought Portman Asset Management as a wholly-owned
subsidiary. The unit is launching property investment trusts with guaranteed
minimum returns, medium-term Islamic leasing funds and a high-yield retail
fund.
UBK last year also sold down Dollars 30m of UBK-originated aircraft
financing loans and Pounds 38m of real estate loans. In July, the bank sold
a Pounds 70m slice of its UK residential mortgage portfolio to Birmingham
Midshires. However, it retained Pounds 50m of home loans, representing
special-case loans or those to Gulf clients.

Coca-Cola Amatil, the Australian-based soft drinks company controlled by
Coca-Cola in the US, is acquiring a 75 per cent interest in the former
state-owned enterprise which holds the Coca-Cola franchise in the Republic
of Slovenia. The deal is worth about ADollars 10m (USDollars 7.1m).
Coca-Cola said the business, which is being privatised, will manufacture and
distribute Coca-Cola products through an existing bottling plant in Zalec,
and a sales and distribution depot in Ljubliana. The remaining equity in the
business will be held locally, essentially by employees.
Coca-Cola Amatil already has franchises in surrounding countries, including
Austria, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak republics and Belarus.
Amcor, the Australian paper and packaging group which has been expanding
aggressively into Europe and North America, yesterday announced plans to
build an ADollars 18m flexible packaging plant in Beijing. The project is
aimed mainly at servicing multinational customers with established
operations in the region.
The company said construction would start shortly, and that the plant was
due to be operational by mid-1995.

trust, share investments

<TEXT>
Nissho Iwai, Japan's sixth-largest general trading company by sales,
yesterday warned it would record extraordinary losses of Y39bn (Dollars
376.4m) during the financial year which ends today. It blamed investments in
specified money trusts, securities losses, and the costs of closing
businesses outside Japan.
The group said it planned to offset the losses through extraordinary sales
of land and securities. However, the net impact would be an extraordinary
loss of Y3bn for the 1993 financial year. Post-tax profits would fall short
of the Y7bn forecast, it warned.
Nissho Iwai is the latest of many trading houses to announce extraordinary
losses on specified money trusts. These financial instruments, known as
tokkin, were an important source of income during the late 1980s. However,
they have become a serious burden since the collapse of the Tokyo stock
market. Sumitomo, Mitsubishi and Marubeni have each liquidated unprofitable
subsidiaries and cancelled tokkin and fund trusts.
Nissho Iwai said it would report a Y16bn loss on its fund trust and tokkin
accounts. A further Y6bn loss would be incurred by scaling back similar
investments at its subsidiary NI Finance. The remaining Y17bn would be
accounted for by losses on securities and the closure of overseas
operations.
These would be partly offset by a Y5.1bn profit on land sold in Chiba, east
of Tokyo, the sale of another plot for Y24.5bn, and Y6bn from sales of
securities, it said.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Recharged VW faces remaining
obstacles with confidence - But the German car maker must not underestimate
the scale of the task
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Like freshly-minted charm school graduates, the Volkswagen board oozed
self-confidence and solidarity. The inescapable message, trotted out
eloquently by all seven at a recent outing before the press, was that
Europe's biggest volume vehicle maker was out of the mire.
A break-even or better result was likely for this year. And within three or
four years, the phoenix emerging from the ashes of 1993's record DM1.94bn
(Dollars 1.1bn) net loss would have new plumage and continue rising to
undreamt-of levels of productivity and profitability.
Forecasts and boasts flowed freely. Japanese competitors had exhausted all
their potential for improving productivity, according to Mr Martin Posth, in
charge of the Asia Pacific region.
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, production director, believed VW would
leapfrog over the productivity levels of Europe's current indigenous stars,
such as Renault, in 1996.
Even Seat, the battered Spanish subsidiary blamed for most of last year's
loss, would break even in mid-1995, he said.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, said payroll savings were sufficient for him
to pocket a DM1,000 note for every VW marque car sold.
German labour costs had been reduced by 15 per cent this year, claimed Mr
Peter Hartz, the mastermind behind the so-called four-day week.
Younger workers were not simply twiddling their thumbs in their free time.
About 10,000 were being trained into Olympians, who would soon be building
cars in less than 10 hours. According to Mr Piech, production times for the
flagship Golf model will be cut from 30 hours to eight hours by 1997.
By then, Mr Lopez estimated, new models and lower prices would have helped
VW to a 10-fold increase in US sales, regaining the 5 per cent of the US
market captured during the glory days of the early 1970s.
The roots of this extraordinary outburst of self-confidence lie in the
arrival in January 1993 of Mr Piech. Blooming optimism has emerged after a
year of turmoil, in which Mr Piech ejected most of the old board after
blaming it for the mess he had taken on.
He has consolidated his front-rank management in a triumvirate comprising
himself, the controversial Mr Lopez - hijacked with a gaggle of his
so-called warriors from General Motors a year ago - and the ingenious Mr
Hartz.
Mr Piech has led the drive to seize full control over the group's flabby
structure. To his overall responsibilities he has added control over the
flagship VW marque.
Seat has been stripped down, and effectively has one factory instead of
three. Its new, largely German board, is shedding 40 per cent of the Spanish
workforce.
Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, the independently-minded chairman of the Audi quality
car subsidiary, has been sacked and replaced by a so-called spokesman in
another move seen as shifting more power to the group's centre.
VW is a manufacturer firmly fixed in the overcrowded volume market for
mid-range vehicles and its best chance of recovery lies in its ability to
beat all competitors. This includes the likes of BMW, which recently
launched a compact 3-Series car aimed at top-end Golf buyers, and broke out
of its prestige niche with the purchase of Britain's Rover group.
As Mr Piech said, savings within the group were to be passed on to
customers, either as lower prices or enhanced equipment. He noted last week,
in relation to the original target price of a possible new model, 'DM19,000
is not a VW'. The target was now DM4,000 less.
The group's price problems, analysts said, were highlighted last year when
VW underperformed in the only mainstream markets to show any growth.
In Britain, where total car sales rose 11.6 per cent, VW managed a rise of
only 7.6 per cent. In the US, up 5.3 per cent, and where VW had to cope with
quality and delivery problems, its sales fell 35 per cent.
According to figures presented to analysts last week, the cost of materials
at the parent company had fallen to 52.7 per cent of sales, compared with
61.5 per cent in 1992. Group-wide, the ratio fell from a record 64 per cent
to 62 per cent.
However, indications of the scale of the task ahead emerged in a one
percentage point increase in group personnel costs to 25 per cent of sales,
compared with the 2.2 per cent reduction to 20 per cent achieved by BMW.
Other obstacles confronting the group include a bloated workforce. The
company admits it has 30,000 more workers in Germany than it needs. In
addition, some 4,000 laid-off Spanish employees are due to be taken on again
in two years.
Meanwhile, Mr Lopez's aim of increasing group productivity by 25 per cent in
the next 24 months will further accentuate employment problems unless a
sales jump allows the surplus to be re-employed. Mr Piech has warned that
the four-day week programme will need to be extended beyond its initial
two-year run.
More urgently, Mr Piech still has to turn a group deficit of DM400m in the
first quarter into the heralded 1994 break-even when VW's core German market
is expected to continue to shrink.
The possibility of criminal charges against his main ally, Mr Lopez, under
investigation in Germany and the US in connection with allegations that he
and several colleagues stole large volumes of General Motors' industrial
secrets, may yet disrupt his boardroom dream team.
However, the chairman refuses as always to contemplate such a prospect.
The mood has reached Mr Klaus Liesen, head of the group's non-executive
supervisory board, who recently proclaimed he saw virtually no risk of
charges of industrial espionage against Mr Lopez or penalties against VW's
US business. Mr Liesen, hitherto VW's leading sceptic on issues relating to
Mr Lopez, believes no GM documents made their way into VW.

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada's second biggest financial
institution, yesterday unveiled plans to expand in global capital markets
through an overhaul of its investment and corporate banking services.
The move is designed to shift CIBC away from its core business in Canadian
dollars, which account for 80 per cent of investment banking revenues.
Instead, it aims to offer a wider range of services in other currencies to
its North American corporate customers, and to increase its business with
European and Japanese institutional investors.
Mr John Hunkin, who heads the bank's investment and corporate banking
division, said: 'The problem is that both on the institutional investor side
and the issuing side, our clients have access to global markets and to
global competitors, and they want a broader range of capability.'
He pointed to the lengthening list of Canadian companies tapping US and
other foreign markets for funds. Canadian financial institutions were
especially taken aback this year when Rogers Communications, the country's
biggest cable-TV operator, sold a high-yield debt issue denominated in
Canadian dollars mainly to US investors.
CIBC said it aimed to become more active in high-yield debt markets,
derivatives and proprietary trading. At home, it would seek to expand the
fast-growing Canadian market in securitised products, especially in the real
estate sector.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Woolworth interim result to be

<TEXT>
Woolworth, one of the oldest retailers in the US, disclosed yesterday it
would restate 'interim financial results' for fiscal 1994 amid allegations
of accounting irregularities. It warned that it may have to restate its
fiscal 1993 results.
The company refused to reveal the source or specific nature of the
allegations, but announced the appointment of a special committee of outside
directors to investigate the charges.
'While the company cannot at this time evaluate the accuracy of the
allegations, it believes that nothing in the allegations will materially
adversely affect the company's financial positions,' Woolworth said just
before trading began on Wall Street.
The company added it was unable to estimate the amount of any restatements
but said the adjustments were 'not expected to have an impact on full-year
results'. Instead, they would 'reflect the correction of gross margins', or
the percentage of revenues retained as profit.
'The company believes the announcement speaks for itself,' the group said.
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, the New York law firm retained by
Woolworth to assist its investigation, was unavailable for comment.
Mr Bruce Missett, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, said the
statement may mean the company would have to move some accounting items from
one quarter to another. He added that the development would likely depress
Woolworth's share price, which has lost nearly half its value over the past
year.
In early trading, the stock fell Dollars 1 to a 52-week low of Dollars 17.
Moody's Investors Service said it was placing Woolworth's long-term debt
ratings and its prime-2 commercial paper under review for a possible
downgrading.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Union Miniere may return to
profit this year
</HEADLINE>

   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union Miniere, the Belgian mining and metals group, expects earnings to
improve strongly this year after reporting a slightly reduced net loss for
1993.
Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, chief executive, said UM might return to a net profit
this year. The board, however, did not think it appropriate to pay a
dividend for 1993. UM last paid a dividend in 1990.
The group suffered a net loss after minority interests of BFr2.484bn
(Dollars 69m) in 1993, against a loss of BFr2.814bn the previous year.
Mr Rodier said UM achieved a BFr160m operating profit in a year when most
metal prices plummeted. This hit most of its processing operations. The 1992
operating result of BFr1.93bn included BFr1bn non-recurring gains on stocks.
UM managed to stay on course partly because of rationalisation measures and
partly because of strong performances at the processing units.
He said UM expected to collect BFr9bn cash in May from its policy of selling
non-strategic assets to fund investment in the core business.
UM's turnover fell to BFr105.2bn from BFr120.8bn.

FFr1.06bn before items

<TEXT>
Pernod Ricard, one of France's leading wines and spirits groups, yesterday
announced net profits of FFr1.06bn (Dollars 180m) for 1993, a slight fall
from the FFr1.10bn recorded in 1992.
Stripping out exceptional items and the impact of currency effects, profits
showed an increase of just under 7 per cent. The exceptional items largely
related to gains on the sale of its Societe des Vins de France in 1992.
Turnover last year, limited in France by the effects of depressed demand,
showed an increase of 3.8 per cent at the group level to reach FFr15.05bn.
The company announced an increased dividend of FFr9, against FFr8.5 for
1992.
Mr Patrick Ricard, chairman, said the results for 1993, the
internationalisation of the group and its solid financial position allowed
the company to be 'reasonably confident about the future'. However, there
were uncertainties concerning the French spirit market, he added.
These related to the depressed level of consumer spending because of the
recession last year, and the impact of an increase in alcohol taxes last
July. The increase in taxation fed through into spirits prices and,
according to analysts, prompted strong buying in the first half of 1992. The
effect is likely to distort the sales comparison in the first half of this
year.
Mr Ricard said the company's financial structure continued to improve in
1993. The gearing ratio fell to 41 per cent from 60 per cent in 1992. In
1990, the ratio was just under 90 per cent.

fast deal

<TEXT>
Northrop, which is bidding for defence group Grumman against Martin
Marietta, said yesterday it was willing to increase its offer from Dollars
60 to Dollars 62 a share if Grumman was prepared to agree an immediate
merger.
The unusual move in the Dollars 2bn battle seemed designed to exert pressure
on Grumman to change the ground rules it has laid down for an auction of the
company, which Northrop says are unfair.
However, Grumman later rejected Northrop's proposals and said it would
continue with the auction.
Grumman has called on both Northrop and Martin Marietta to submit their best
and final offers by 5.00pm New York time today. It wants to spend Easter
weekend evaluating the proposals and announce a winner on Monday morning -
laying down an unusually short timetable for a US takeover.
However, Northrop yesterday said it could not accept this timetable, arguing
that to be fair a bidding procedure must be open and public, giving each
bidder a reasonable opportunity to respond to the other's offer.
Northrop's current hostile offer of Dollars 60 a share is Dollars 5 a share
higher than the friendly bid for Grumman being made by Martin Marietta.
However, Northrop said that to demonstrate its commitment to an open bidding
process, it was prepared to proceed immediately to Dollars 62 a share, but
this would only remain on the table until 3.00pm today. If Grumman had not
accepted the offer by then, it would expire and Northrop's Dollars 60 a
share offer would remain in effect.
Northrop noted that if Grumman agreed its proposal,it would mean that the
two bidders faced the same takeover costs. At present, Martin Marietta has a
financial advantage because of a merger agreement which lays down that
Grumman will pay it Dollars 50m compensation if another bidder acquires the
company.

<TEXT>
Interbrew, the Belgian brewer, has won the tender to buy a 23.78 per cent
stake in Zagreb Breweries, Croatia's largest brewery, with a bid of DM19.5m
(Dollars 11.69m).
Its offer, which values the brewery at DM82m, beat four rival bidders
including Brau of Austria, Castel of France and Mr Andronic Luksic, a
Croatian millionaire now living in Chile.
The shares sold to Interbrew are owned by the Croatian Privatisation Fund
and two Croatian pension funds. The brewery was privatised in April 1993 and
the majority of shares are owned by employees.
Interbrew plans to invest a further DM21m through a capital increase which
would constitute the largest foreign investment in Croatia.
The latest investment marks a rise in investor interest in Croatia. Foreign
companies made equity investments of Dollars 16m in 1992 and Dollars 56m in
the first nine months of 1993. But with the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina
appearing close to resolution, bankers are predicting that the level of
investment will rise gradually.
'There will be a lot of interest in medium to small deals, particularly from
Austrian and German companies,' said Mr Charles Harman, executive director
at CS First Boston in London. 'Bigger deals will not be so easy.'
A privatisation law came into force in May 1991 and 1,907 enterprises had
been privatised by the end of January. 'We haven't stopped the process even
for a minute, even at the most difficult moments,' said Ivan Penic,
president of the Croatian Privatisation Fund.
The law allows Croatian workers to buy shares of up to DM20,000 in book
value at a 20 per cent discount to the nominal value plus 1 per cent for
every year they have worked.
One third of the remaining shares in each enterprise were transferred to two
pension funds and the balance was transferred to the Croatian Privatisation
Fund, which now has a DM8bn portfolio of assets.
However, the government desperately needs money and the fund is starting to
sell assets.
In early March, the fund agreed to sell a 30.5 per cent stake in Croatia's
second-largest brewery, at Karlovac. The buyer was Mr Luksic, who paid DM10m
for his stake.
The fund is planning to sell stakes in several other consumer product
companies, including Kras, Croatia's largest chocolate producer.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Amdahl in alliance to offer MPP

Amdahl, the US mainframe computer company, plans to offer high-performance
database systems based on massively-parallel processor (MPP) supercomputers.
Its announcement pre-empts the expected introduction of similar products by
IBM.
Amdahl has formed an alliance with nCube, a US manufacturer of MPP
computers; Oracle, the leading database software company; and Information
Builders, a software company that specialises in linking different types of
computers on networks.
Amdahl, which has been struggling to keep pace with rapidly falling prices
for its mainframe computers, sees the alliance as an opportunity to broaden
its market.
MPPs achieve very high processing speeds at low cost by linking thousands of
microprocessor chips, similar to those used in personal computers, to work
together in parallel. Most MPPs have been used in scientific and technical
applications.
However, IBM is expected next week to announce an MPP system aimed at the
commercial market. Amdahl and its new partners said they too would enter
this field within the next few months.
Business intelligence systems that capture, analyse and distribute
information from mainframes and other computer systems are now seen as
critical to process re-engineering efforts taking place in many businesses,
Amdahl noted.
nCube will supply the hardware for the products. Oracle and Information
Builders will provide software. Amdahl will market the products.
Hearst Corp and Capital Cities/ABC are have agreed to buy Viacom's one-third
interest in Lifetime Television for Dollars 317.6m in cash, AP-DJ reports
from New York.
Hearst and Capital Cities, which each own one-third interests in the cable
network, will each own half interests on completion of the deal.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Clock ticks for Air France
unions' decision - Rejection of a restructuring plan would mean a referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Decision time has arrived for the 14 trade unions at Air France. Mr
Christian Blanc, the airline's chairman, has given them until 6.00pm to sign
a rescue plan which is vital to the company's survival.
Union opposition and a wave of violent strikes scuppered the last rescue
strategy, put forward by Mr Bernard Attali who was forced to resign as
chairman last October. To avoid a similar fate for his own plan - and
possibly for himself - Mr Blanc has demanded support from all the unions for
his package of measures. So, effectively, has the government, by linking a
FFr20bn (Dollars 3.5bn) capital injection to staff acceptance of the
proposed cost-cutting and restructuring measures.
The stakes are high, both for the state-owned airline and its principal
shareholder. Without a significant restructuring, the airline will not be
able to stem losses, which last year amounted to an estimated FFr7.5bn.
Mr Blanc is proposing a 30 per cent increase in productivity over the next
three years, achieved by the loss of 5,000 jobs, a wage and promotion
freeze, the reduction of the airline's fleet and a reorganisation of the
group into separate profit centres.
The problem for Mr Blanc is that months of negotiations, involving more than
2,000 meetings with unions and personnel, have failed to overcome opposition
from some quarters. The latest and final round of negotiations last weekend
brought some changes to the package; the pay and promotion freeze may now be
reviewed after one year, and Mr Blanc agreed to accept alternatives to
increased working hours (from 38 to 39 hours per week for ground staff) if
they yield the same productivity gains.
But for some unions, such changes are inadequate. The strongest reaction has
come from the communist Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT), the
second-largest union at Air France with 2,100 members out of the airline's
40,000 employees. CGT representatives walked out of the negotiations on
Saturday evening and oppose the final version of the restructuring plan
which was delivered earlier this week.
'We cannot sign this plan,' said Mr Raymond Besco, the general secretary of
the union, adding that a final meeting would be held this morning to confirm
the union's position. He opposed plans to cut jobs, freeze wages and extend
working hours and described the linking of the FFr20bn capital injection to
staff approval of the plan as 'unacceptable blackmail'.
According to Mr Besco, 'it is not acceptable for a public company to cut
employment in the present economic climate'. He agreed that the airline
needs restructuring, but said cutting its aircraft from 166 to 149 over the
next five years would weaken Air France in international markets.
CGT is the most radical of the unions, and others have been more supportive.
Force Ouvriere, the largest union among Air France's employees, has said
that it 'does not want to throw a spanner into the works of the package'. It
said it was conducting a secret ballot of its members and that the results
would be analysed this morning.
The Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail (CFDT), the
third-biggest union, said that there has been 'considerable progress on
certain points, a little on others and none at all on some'. A spokesman
said that it was weighing the relative importance of its reservations with
the plan and would make a final decision today.
Even with support from Force Ouvriere, the CFDT and the smaller unions,
however, a rejection from the CGT would ruin Mr Blanc's hopes for unanimous
union support. In this case, the Air France chairman has indicated that he
will appeal directly to the airline's staff, probably by referendum.
'The document is definitive. If the 14 unions have not signed by 6.00pm then
we will have to go to a general consultation,' said a spokesman for the
airline. Such an appeal could be expected within the next few weeks,
although the terms of the document have not been decided.
The strategy behind a referendum would be to isolate opponents of the
package. But Mr Blanc is likely to need a comfortable approval margin -
above 50 per cent - to proceed with his plan. The unions say they accept the
idea of a referendum in principle; in practice, however, it may be a
different matter. 'It will depend on the terms,' said Mr Besco; if it is a
simple yes/no on the package, then the CGT will oppose it.
Without majority support through a referendum, Air France would clearly
enter a new, and more dangerous, phase. But risks remain, even with a
mandate from the majority of its staff. In particular, the fragmented nature
of union membership at the airline provides scope for the disruptive action
which proved so damaging last October.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: BTA suspended in anti-Banesto
move
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal's Stock Exchange Commission (CMVM) yesterday suspended shares of
Banco Totta e Acores (BTA) following moves by the central bank to curb the
influence of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the crisis-hit Spanish bank
which has a substantial equity stake in BTA.
Banesto and an associate investor own some 50 per cent of BTA. The CMVM said
the shares had been suspended indefinitely because of moves to limit the
voting rights of Banesto and its associate to 25 per cent. Banesto's direct
and indirect holdings in BTA contravenes Portuguese legislation limiting
foreign ownership of the bank to 25 per cent.
Banesto's voting rights were reduced ahead of BTA's annual general meeting
today and before the conclusion of separate investigations into the legality
of the Spanish bank's shareholdings in BTA by Portugal's attorney-general,
the central bank and the CMVM.
The suspension appeared to be aimed at halting speculative trading after
control of BTA had been thrown in doubt by the central bank measure,
analysts said yesterday. The Portuguese government has said it wants to
return BTA to Portuguese control, and at least two Portuguese businesses
have lined up bids to take control.
The central bank said its measure did not reflect on the financial stability
of BTA, which it described as prudently managed with an adequate level of
capital.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Pre-tax profits up at German
metals group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German diversidied
metals and engineering group, were up 60 per cent at DM55m (Dollars 33.1m)
in the five months to end-February. However, angry shareholders at
yesterday's annual general meeting were more concerned with calling for the
resignation of Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, supervisory board chairman.
Yesterday's meeting followed a 12-hour extraordinary general meeting last
month, at which shareholders approved a DM3.4bn rescue package negotiated
with the group's banks after its near-collapse in December.
Criticism of Mr Schmitz was met with resounding applause. 'Your behaviour
borders on the unscrupulous,' one shareholder said.
Most of the some 300 shareholders present applauded calls for Mr Schmitz to
resign. There were allegations that he failed to safeguard against the high
risks of oil futures trading, which cost the company DM2.3bn. However, there
were no formal motions to remove him from the board.
Mr Schmitz, who is also a member of the Deutsche Bank management board, is
believed to have the support of five banks and institutions, which together
hold about 62 per cent of the group's shares.
The pre-tax profit figures do not include the group's New York operation, or
the interest payments to finance its losses of DM2.3bn. Group sales fell 1.4
per cent to DM7.14bn.
A key vote to approve the activities of the much-criticised supervisory
board was postponed until the next annual general meeting. Votes to approve
the actions of the management and supervisory boards are standard practice
at German general meetings.
Mr Kajo Neukirchen, who was appointed chief executive in December, said the
group would create a holding structure and hive off its plant engineering
and chemicals divisions.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: BASF/AlliedSignal nylon fibre
merger collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A plan for Germany's BASF and AlliedSignal of the US to merge parts of their
nylon fibre operations into a joint venture with annual sales of around
Dollars 1bn, has collapsed, the companies announced yesterday.
AlliedSignal said that they were unable to find a satisfactory way to
integrate their businesses but that they were well-placed in their
respective markets for textile and carpet fibre products.
The failure of talks, which were first revealed last October, is the third
recent setback to the German group's ambitious restructuring plans.
A proposed deal with Britain's ICI, under which BASF was to have exchanged
its west European acrylic facilities in return for the UK company's
polypropylene activities, failed because the German group placed too high a
value on its side of the bargain.
BASF agreed last month to pay ICI Pounds 60m (Dollars 87.6m) for its
polypropylene business, including two plants in the Netherlands and
north-east England.
Completion of this part of the deal was seen as essential at the German
company in the light of an earlier agreement between Shell and Montedison to
merge their polypropylene operations into Europe's biggest specialist
manufacturer in this sector.
Earlier last year BASF failed to sell its polyester fibre divisions to
Wellman, of New Jersey.
Fibres, which is currently combined in a single division with plastics in
BASF's operations, is one of the group's most troubled sectors. It has been
especially affected by over-capacity and price erosion in its main European
markets.
The German company said last October that the deal with AlliedSignal would
create a more cost-efficient producer with enough critical mass to compete
more effectively.
BASF officials said they had nothing to add to yesterday's announcement from
AlliedSignal, and said further explanation of the circumstances of the
break-down was unlikely.
Mr Jurgen Strube, group chairman, said earlier this month that all divisions
except plastics and fibres were making profits in the current financial
year, but forecast a return to break-even by year end.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Last chapter in a stormy career
 -Jean-Yves Haberer is unlikely to go quietly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Yves Haberer has been out of work before but he has always bounced
back - until now. He was fired in 1986 as chairman of Paribas, the prominent
French bank, only to resurface two years later as head of Credit Lyonnais
until he was banished last autumn to the less prestigious Credit National.
Yet it is inconceivable that Mr Haberer, 61, could recover from yesterday's
news that the French government has dismissed him after only five months at
Credit National. His departure, which follows last week's news that Credit
Lyonnais made a FFr6.9bn (Dollars 1.2bn) net loss in 1993 and that it was to
be baled out by the state in a FFr44.9bn rescue deal, marks the end of one
of the stormiest careers in French finance. It also raises serious questions
about the relationship between politics and commerce in France.
'Am I surprised by his dismissal? No way,' said one senior Paris banker.
'Credit Lyonnais is in a dreadful state. The government has to find someone
to blame and Jean-Yves Haberer is the obvious candidate. The only surprise
is why they gave him another job last autumn when they kicked him out of
Credit Lyonnais.'
Mr Haberer was nothing if not a controversial choice as chairman of Credit
National. He is a brilliant but undeniably difficult man whose manner has
made him highly unpopular among his peers. His critics have for years been
prophesying that the aggressive stance on loans and international
acquisitions he pursued in five years as chairman of Credit Lyonnais would
end in disaster.
Their fears were realised last spring by the news that Credit Lyonnais in
1992 had fallen into the red for the third time in its history with a net
loss of FFr1.85bn. Mr Haberer's reputation was so tarnished that when he
arrived at Credit National last autumn two of its German institutional
investors protested against his appointment.
The official reason for his new job was that it reflected the 'softly
softly' approach to public sector appointments adopted by Mr Edouard
Balladur, the centre-right prime minister, since he came to power last
March. Mr Haberer, a former conservative who had changed allegiance when the
left took power in 1981, was appointed to Credit Lyonnais by Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, the late socialist premier. Mr Balladur wanted him to go - but
quietly.
The Paris financial establishment was also anxious to avoid an outburst from
Mr Haberer. 'There's no doubt that Haberer was the architect of Credit
Lyonnais' problems, but what about the ministers who backed his decisions
and the banking supervisors who let them give him more capital?' said one
banking analyst. 'They must all have been worried about what he might say
and very relieved when he was kept quiet by being given a new job.'
Mr Haberer was also backed by influential friends on the left, notably by Mr
Francois Mitterrand, the socialist president. Observers say that Mr
Mitterrand last autumn put pressure on Mr Balladur to find another job for
Mr Haberer, rather than to dump him as Mr Jacques Chirac, the last
centre-right premier had done in 1986 by firing him from Paribas.
But even the president could not shield Mr Haberer from last week's storm
when Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the new Credit Lyonnais chairman, revealed the
full extent of the bank's 1993 losses and disclosed the final terms of the
government's rescue package which includes a FFr4.9bn capital injection and
the transfer of FFr40bn of non-performing property loans to a new company.
Le Point, the right-wing weekly news magazine, dubbed Credit Lyonnais 'The
Banking Scandal of the Century' and fingered Mr Haberer as 'The Man Behind
the Scandal'. By the beginning of this week a number of conservatives had
called for inquiries into Credit Lyonnais' affairs and rumours were
circulating about Mr Haberer's imminent dismissal from Credit National. The
rumours were confirmed after yesterday's cabinet meeting by Mr Nicolas
Sarkozy, the official cabinet spokesman.
This time Mr Haberer shows no sign of going quietly. He issued a formal
statement on Tuesday claiming to be the victim of a 'media lynching'. He
also claimed that some of Credit Lyonnais' problems dated back to decisions
made before his appointment and that others were based on 'recommendations'
from the old socialist government.
Finally, Mr Haberer called for an official inquiry into management of the
group, claiming that he would be vindicated by such an investigation. His
old friend, Mr Mitterrand, yesterday successfully insisted that the cabinet
agree to mount an inquiry.
'This is just a warning shot,' said another analyst. 'Haberer has made it
quite clear that he won't go without a fuss. And as the French government is
well aware, he could make sure that the Credit Lyonnais story gets very,
very dirty indeed.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The BHF-Bank group yesterday reported an increase of 20.5 per cent in net
operating profits for 1993, and said it was 'cautiously optimistic' about
prospects for the current financial year.
Partial operating earnings, which exclude income from own-account trading,
rose 27.6 per cent to DM370m (Dollars 222m) last year, while group-wide
provisions against bad debts were increased 45 per cent to DM168m.
The lion's share of the provisions were made in the BHF-Bank itself,
reflecting precautionary moves made elsewhere in the German banking industry
to take account of an expected increase in the number of corporate borrowers
suffering in the wake of recession.
Mr Wolfgang Strutz, managing partner, pointed out that the year's total
provisions were within the range expected at the start of last year.
A third of the bank's earnings, and 30 per cent of group income came from
outside Germany, he told a press conference.
The bank's business volume rose 17 per cent last year to DM63.3bn and credit
volume increased by a similar proportion to DM46.7bn.
Interest earnings rose 15 per cent to DM619m, while own-account trading at
the bank and subsidiaries in securities, currencies and derivatives
generated DM127m income - up 32 per cent on the previous year.

The 335,000 private investors who bought shares in the recently privatised
Istituto Mobiliare Italiano (IMI) will receive a L400 dividend for 1993,
writes John Simkins in Milan.
This effectively doubles the previous year's dividend and represents a
policy switch by IMI to a more generous allocation. A dividend of L2,000 was
paid in 1992 on each of the then 60m shares which were increased to 600m
before the public offer.
The total payout has increased from L120bn to L240bn (Dollars 147m).

1993 from FFr1.27bn the previous year, on turnover which increased 2.4 per
cent to FFr50.9bn.
EBS said most of its divisions had produced increased operating profit which
had risen by 11.7 per cent to FFr4bn. But some of this profit was absorbed
by exceptional costs related to restructuring.
Proceeds from the sale of its North American animal feed business had
brought its net debt down from FFr14.1bn at the end of 1992 to FFr12.5bn at
the end of last year.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: AGF hit by losses on banking
side

<TEXT>
Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the state insurance group scheduled
for privatisation by the French government later this year, yesterday
announced a sharp fall in net profits, of 35 per cent to FFr977m (Dollars
171.4m) in 1993, from FFr1.49bn in 1992. It blamed heavy losses from its
banking interests.
Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, the former banker earlier this year
appointed chairman of AGF to orchestrate its sale to the private sector,
said the group was on course for a return to profits growth in 1994.
He disclosed that AGF was in talks with the economy ministry over a capital
increase to raise cash for its own purposes, as part of the state share
sale. Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurer, which
is due to be privatised this spring, has already secured the government's
agreement for a capital increase.
AGF was affected last year by the competitive state of the French insurance
industry, and by the increase in claims resulting from the floods in France
last autumn. However, its main problem was the loss on its holdings in two
financial companies, Comptoir des Entrepreneurs (29.7 per cent) and Banque
du Phenix (100 per cent).
Both businesses plunged into the red because of heavy writedowns on their
French property interests. AGF's share of their losses amounted to FFr2.52bn
in 1993.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Stakis on the acquisition trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stakis, the hotels and casinos group, yesterday capitalised on its recent
recovery by announcing a Pounds 67m rights issue to fund its acquisition
strategy, writes James Buxton.
It also announced the purchase of two hotels for a total of Pounds 15.5m and
disclosed that it is close to concluding the purchase of a further hotel and
a casino for a total of Pounds 13.1m.
The rights issue will reduce Stakis's gearing from 46 per cent to 20 per
cent. Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman, said it would enable the company to
take advantage of opportunities in the hotel and casino sectors 'quickly and
efficiently'.
The Glasgow-based company which came close to collapse in 1991 because of
ill-managed expansion, has reorganised its banking arrangements, cutting the
number of its banks from nine to four, leaving Barclays, Royal Bank of
Scotland, Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale.
It has obtained a new Pounds 30m facility over five years at a lower rate
above Libor than previously, on top of the existing facility of about Pounds
140m.
Drawing on this facility Stakis has bought the 132-room Coburg Hotel in the
Bayswater Road, London, for Pounds 9.5m. The three star hotel was in
receivership after a Pounds 3m refurbishment in 1990 and was put on the
market by KPMG, the receiver.
The company has also bought the 108-room Airport Ambassador Hotel at Norwich
airport for Pounds 6m. The four star privately owned hotel was making annual
profits of about Pounds 1m.
The rights issue, which is fully underwritten by Schroders and Noble
Grossart, involves the issue of 95.5m new shares on a 1-for-4 basis at 72p
each. The shares closed down 1p at 84p yesterday. Latest time for acceptance
of the new shares is April 30.
Stakis forecast a total dividend for the year to October 1994 of not less
than 1.5p, against 1p last time.
It said it was too early to forecast the results for the full year, but Sir
Lewis said there had been 'an encouraging start with some, if limited, signs
of recovery in demand in the hotel division and stable, satisfactory trading
in the casino division.'

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Mt Edon withdraws bid for Burmine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-delayed, three-way merger involving Europa Minerals, a UK mining
finance house, and two Australian groups with which it already has close
associations - Burmine and Austmin Gold - is set to go ahead today. This
follows the withdrawal yesterday of rival bidder for Burmine, Mount Edon,
another Australian gold company.
Burmine and Mount Edon have called an end to the litigation which has held
up the merger, first mooted in July last year. Each side will bear its own
costs but Mount Edon has agreed to pay ADollars 125,000 (Pounds 61,576) to
Burmine and its managing director Mr Guido Staltari.
During the battle Mount Edon sold its 19.9 per cent stake in Europa and
directors said yesterday that its 22.6 per cent shareholding in Burmine had
now also been sold - to a group of Australian institutional investors.
Total net profit for Edon on the two disposals was ADollars 3m (Pounds
1.4m). Mr Tony Brennan, Mount Edon's managing director, said the decision to
sell the Burmine holding was made, 'when it became clear that the merging of
Burmine's gold assets with Mount Edon's would only be achievable after still
further legal actions and at a cost which would not have been in the
interest of Mount Edon's shareholders.'
Sir David Hardy, chairman of both Europa and Burmine, said he was delighted
that Mount Edon had conceded defeat. He said that, after lawyers signed the
final agreements between Mount Edon and Burmine in Melbourne today, the
Burmine offers for Europa, valuing the UK group at about Pounds 15m, and
Austmin would be declared unconditional. This would lead to Europa's London
Stock Exchange quotation being removed.
Sir David indicated that the delay caused by litigation had not been wasted
and that the enlarged Burmine group expected quickly to make one or two
mining acquisitions.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Picking over tasty opportunities - Stakis's
plans to exploit weakness in its market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Lewis Robertson reflected this week that while illness in a company was
undesirable, Stakis had succeeded in timing its period of infirmity rather
well.
The pruning of the company under his chairmanship since 1991 had 'greatly
refreshed' it, he said. It was now unencumbered by problems from the past
and confronted a market which offered tasty opportunities for a
discriminating purchaser, caused by the difficulties of other companies.
Now this medium-sized hotel and casino company is securing sufficient means
to exploit these chances.
Sir Lewis, a specialist in corporate rescues, became chairman when the
company slid into trouble under Mr Andros Stakis, son of its Cypriot-born
founder Sir Reo.
'Everyone knew what needed to be done to save the company,' an executive who
has worked under both regimes said recently. 'It just needed someone to take
the decisions.'
The company shed its fringe operations, refining itself to hotels, casinos
and its promising but expensive nursing homes operation.
Sir Lewis brought in Mr David Michels as chief executive from Hilton
International. Stakis emerged from convalescence in January 1993 when it
disposed of its nursing homes, writing off Pounds 48m and raising Pounds 28m
in a rights issue.
Mr Michels tightened the management of what he says was basically a sound
business operating a chain of middle ranking hotels and casinos (most of
them outside London), which enjoyed strong staff loyalty and well chosen
sites.
Better control of costs and more skilful pricing were more influential last
year in raising room occupancy rates and generating pre-tax profits of
Pounds 10.4m than the slight upturn in the UK economy.
Last year the company began to strike out again, buying a hotel in York for
Pounds 5m, acquiring three casinos in the Midlands for Pounds 10.5m, and
starting building work on airport hotel in Edinburgh.
The City has been impressed by Mr Michels' mastery of the business, and has
increasingly urged Stakis to take advantage of the opportunities created by
the weakness of other groups, hence the rights issue.
Stakis has already rejected the hotels being disposed of by Queens Moat
Houses, but hopes better properties may become available.
It has ended negotiations with Aer Lingus on the possible purchase of its
Copthorne chain. But Forte is also expected to make strategic disposals and
Hilton International could also put properties on the market.
'The market had been expecting us to make a single purchase of a chain or
block of hotels,' says Mr Michels. 'But you can't do that in this market:
the seller always parcels up the ones you want to buy with about 30 per cent
that you don't want, and in this market you can't get rid of that 30 per
cent.'
For this reason, Stakis prefers to cherry pick. 'It's more profitable and
safer.'
However, the company stresses that it will also examine carefully the
acquisition of larger portfolios of hotels 'if the profiles of the units
suitable and the terms are attractive.' The group expects to buy about six
properties this year.
'What we bring to the party is a style of management and local autonomy that
has had a positive effect on our returns elsewhere,' says Sir Lewis. 'We
also bring a strong marketing input and a strong IT input.' The acquisitions
Stakis made last year did not 'add a single body to our head office
payroll,' says Mr Michels.
The stock market was not taken aback by Stakis's capital raising
announcement. The shares fell by 1p to 84p compared with the rights price of
72p.
Analysts still expect pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.5m for this year, with
earnings of 4.2p, which puts Stakis on a prospective p/e of 19.5.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BLP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A buoyant performance from its North American Woodtape edgebanding division
helped BLP Group, the USM-quoted wood laminates and veneer company, to swing
round from a pre-tax loss of Pounds 605,000 to a Pounds 2.38m profit in
1993.
The profit included exceptional credits of Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 202,000
debits) of which Pounds 1.54m related to a write-back of a provision against
a loan to the ESOP trust. A further Pounds 368,000 profit related to the
sale of the London site and subsequent rationalisation and reorganisation of
the UK business.
In view of the improvement, BLP is restoring the dividend with a small final
payment of 1p. Mr Malcolm Cohen, chairman, said this was 'intended to be a
reflection of our cautious optimism for the future prospects of the group.'
Turnover in 1993 increased by 21 per cent to Pounds 27.9m. Earnings per
share including exceptional items were 28.2p (15.3p losses), while excluding
these, losses were 0.6p (12.3p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong contribution from its newly-formed industrial division helped
Princedale Group report pre-tax profits of Pounds 740,000 for the 15 months
to end-December, against Pounds 254,000 for the preceding 12 months.
Until midway through 1993, Princedale - which has a USM quote - was a
specialised marketing services consultancy. However, in June it formed the
new division with the acquisition from Hillsdown Holdings of two plastics
manufacturers and a commercial vehicle contract hire business.
Group turnover for the 15 months totalled Pounds 26m, against Pounds 12.8m
previously. Of this, acquisitions were responsible for some Pounds 13.5m. At
the operating level the new division boosted profits by Pounds 603,000 to
Pounds 855,000, compared with Pounds 457,000 last time.
Mr Stephen Bennett, chairman, said that after a difficult start the
marketing services side had shown improvement in the latter part of the
year.
Earnings per share emerged at 1.9p (1p) and the company is returning to the
dividend list with a proposed final of 0.25p. The last dividend was paid in
1988.
The shares closed down 1p at 26p.

Bridport-Gundry reported halved pre-tax losses of Pounds 220,000 for the six

Mr David Sebire, chairman, said that although there was no discernable

Turnover for the company, which has interests in the manufacture of medical

Operating profits were Pounds 86,000 (Pounds 120,000 losses) after
accounting for one-off reorganisation costs of Pounds 245,000. There was a
further loss of Pounds 100,000 relating to the sale of the Irish fishing

Losses per share came out at 1.22p (4.67p) and the interim dividend is 1.25p

Moorfield Estates is acquiring a property portfolio for Pounds 24m, financed
partly by a net Pounds 12.2m placing and open offer, writes Vanessa Houlder.
The company also announ-ced a reduction in 1993 pre-tax losses from Pounds
1.98m to Pounds 494,000. Net asset value increased to 44p per share at the
period end, compared with 39p last September.
The company is buying six retail, industrial and office properties, with a
current rental income of Pounds 1.93m, from Mobax. The deal will leave
Moorfield Estates with gross property assets of Pounds 62m and reduced
gearing of 133 per cent.
Beeson Gregory, the company's brokers, are placing 33.62m new shares at 38p,
with shareholders being able to take part in the open offer on a 1-for-1
basis. The shares were unchanged at 43p.
The balance of the acquisition price will be financed by a new loan facility
and by existing resources.
The company plans to seek a full listing in the near future.
Losses per share fell from 18.3p to 2.9p. No dividend has been recommended
for 1993, but a 1p payment is forecast for 1994.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Higgs &amp; Hill back in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After two years of losses, Higgs &amp; Hill, the construction, property and
housebuilding group, moved modestly back into the black in 1993 with a
Pounds 1.23m pre-tax profit.
This compared with a Pounds 22.04m loss in 1992, restated in accordance with
FRS 3, and a Pounds 16.7m loss in 1991.
After an abnormally high tax charge of Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 701,000 credit)
reflecting the low proportion of UK profits available to offset ACT,
earnings per share rose only to 0.3p compared with losses of 48.4p.
The company, however, is proposing a maintained final dividend of 1.5p
making an unchanged total of 2.5p.
The biggest reason for the profits recovery was the absence of large land
and property write-downs, as well as provisions against redundancy costs and
losses on disposals which cost Pounds 22.02m in 1992.
Mr John Theakston, chief executive, said 1993 represented a turning point in
the UK housing and commercial property markets, which had been in recession
since the late 1980s.
Commercial property, following the sale of a 12 acre site in Southend, Essex
to Waitrose for a superstore and a 75,000 sq ft office development at St
Quentin-en-Yvelines in France, moved from a Pounds 14.29m loss to a Pounds
4m profit last year.
Mr Theakston said that UK institutional investors in property had begun to
return to the domestic market enabling values to recover and improving
development opportunities.
The UK housing market had also improved. The number of homes sold had risen
from 262 to 332, making profits of Pounds 2.25m (Pounds 1.67m losses).
Contracting however, remained difficult. Margins remained deeply depressed
with too many companies chasing a shortage of work. An 11 per cent fall in
group turnover to Pounds 262.2m (Pounds 296m) was mainly because of a fall
in construction orders as the group became more selective about the quality
of work it took on.
Construction losses were reduced from Pounds 2.92m to Pounds 2.08m on lower
turnover of Pounds 212m (Pounds 251m).
COMMENT
Profits, excluding the effect of write-downs and exceptional provisions,
rose 37 per cent to Pounds 1.25m. The company has the good feel of a
business that knows where it is going notwithstanding an extremely difficult
UK market. Joint ventures with Berkeley Group and H&amp;H's moves to increase
its international order book are the right measures for a medium-sized
contractor seeking to counter a steep downturn in its domestic market.
Gearing may rise to 10 per cent this year to buy housing land, but hardly
straining the balance sheet. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m this year and
Pounds 6m in 1995 would put the stock on a prospective p/e of 14 two years
out: probably high enough but buy on weakness, this is a good contractor.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Slimmer Tilbury achieves Pounds 21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tilbury Douglas, the construction group, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds
20.9m for last year, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 1.9m in 1992,
writes Andrew Taylor.
The figures were flattered by profits on disposals and the impact of
provisions which under FRS 3 were required to be written off
previously-stated 1992 profits.
Tilbury said pre-tax profits excluding exceptional items would have fallen
from Pounds 15m to Pounds 13.6m. The final dividend is again 22.5p,
maintaining the total for the year at 33p.
Earnings per share after exceptionals rose to 46.2p compared with restated
losses of 2p. Group turnover fell from Pounds 382m to Pounds 361m.
Mr Michael Bottjer, chief executive, said the decline was attributed mainly
to the group's decision not to pursue lossmaking contracts, unlike some of
its competitors.
He said last year's profits had been enhanced by a Pounds 7.3m surplus on
the sale of its Douglas Concrete &amp; Aggregates and Douglas Plant businesses.
Construction profits had fallen from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 7.6m on a
reduced turnover Pounds 302m (Pounds 322m), in part because of the company's
refusal to price work at unviable levels.
The value of the group's construction order book of Pounds 225m at the
December 31 year end was 47 per cent higher than a year earlier, in spite of
its pricing policy.
Its specialist piling and interior contracting operations, however, have
continued to suffer, reflecting the downturn in the UK building industry.
Heavy electrical contracting and process engineering, which are seeking to
expand overseas, produced satisfactory performances, while the construction
equipment division increased pre-tax profits by 35 per cent to Pounds 1.64m.
Scottish housebuilding profits dipped from Pounds 4m to Pounds 3.78m as the
number of homes sold declined from 353 to 278.
The group is withdrawing from its commercial property and English
housebuilding businesses.
COMMENT
Tilbury, with its emphasis on specialist contracting, continues to command
above average margins in a highly competitive UK construction market. Its
lack of housing exposure, in spite of a quality Scottish business, however,
means that this is a late cycle recovery play. There is also a feeling that
the group may be too cautious in using its strong cash balances of Pounds
14.9m at the year end. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 18m should more than cover
the dividend, which is on a handsome yield 5.7 per cent. Tilbury has shown
that it is one of the safest pairs of hands around, and the shares on this
basis are a solid hold but the short-term outlook for profit recovery looks
dull.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wilson Connolly jumps to Pounds 28.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Wilson (Connolly) Holdings, the housebuilder, having
fallen by two-thirds since 1989, jumped by 68 per cent from Pounds 16.81m to
Pounds 28.22m last year.
This compares with peak profits of Pounds 54m in 1989 when the group
achieved sales of Pounds 193m. Profits in 1991 and 1992 were depressed by
property and land write-downs of Pounds 2.02m and Pounds 5.49m respectively.
Turnover last year rose by 36 per cent to Pounds 275m (Pounds 201m) giving
an operating margin of 10.3 per cent compared with 8.3 per cent in 1992 and
a peak of almost 28 per cent in 1989.
Mr Lyn Wilson described last year's performance as outstanding in difficult
market conditions. The final dividend is raised from 2.66p to 2.86p making a
total for the year of 4.13p (3.93p) - a 5 per cent increase and the first
rise since 1991.
Net debt, including land creditors, was equivalent to just 4 per cent of
shareholders funds at end-December compared with 9 per cent a year earlier.
The number of homes sold by the group rose by a third from 2,880 to 3,840 at
an average price of Pounds 54,500 (Pounds 53,000). Housing profits also
benefited from the absence of fresh provisions and rose from Pounds 15.2m to
Pounds 22.5m.
Commercial property profits, following the completion of two turn-key office
developments at Northampton and Oxford, also rose sharply from Pounds
547,000 to Pounds 4.68m.
Construction profits, reflecting very difficult trading in the UK, dipped
from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 1.01m on a slightly higher turnover of Pounds
37.49m (Pounds 36.17m).
COMMENT
Wilson Connolly's shares have underperformed a UK housebuilding sector which
has declined of late as concern has mounted over rising land costs and the
possibility of more sluggish house sales and price rises should forthcoming
tax increases knock buyers' confidence. The group, however, has net cash,
excluding land creditors, and has a good reputation for making shrewd land
purchases. It is a quality builder although some, at this stage of the
cycle, might prefer less of an emphasis on first time buyers. It looks a
little cheap against some of its peers, therefore, on pre-tax profits of
Pounds 34m putting the shares on a prospective p/e of 16 times for 1994 and
13 times Pounds 43m profits in 1995.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pressac advances 10.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressac Holdings, Nottingham-based electro-mechanical engineering group
which specialises in circuit board manufacture, lifted interim profits by
10.5 per cent and anticipated 'a tangible increase in sales' during the
second half.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to January 31 increased from Pounds
619,000 to Pounds 684,000, on turnover up slightly to Pounds 16.3m, compared
with Pounds 15.9m.
The group has been in a holding pattern in recent months as weak demand from
continental Europe has offset growth in the US and the fragile recovery of
the UK. This prevented Pressac from gaining full immediate benefit from its
heavy investment in automotive components.
But the introduction of new products, not least circuit boards for heated
wing mirrors, eased pressure on margins. Operating profits rose from Pounds
842,000 to Pounds 912,000.
Component sales to the automotive industry rose by 15 per cent during the
first half and new contracts won in the US come on stream this month. In
Europe there is some hope that depletions of production schedules in the
first half will be restored in the second.
Delays in production schedules meant a build-up of stocks, which in turn had
affected gearing, raising it by the end of the first half to 51 per cent. Mr
Geoff White, the chief executive, said that by the year-end gearing should
be back to where it started the year - 41 per cent.
First-half earnings per share were 1.71p (1.55p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 0.75p. Total payments for 1992-93 were 2.57p.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hogg halved to Pounds 6m before goodwill
write-offs
</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hogg Group, the insurance broker, yesterday reported halved pre-tax profits
halved to at Pounds 6.01m for the year to end-December before goodwill
write-offs of Pounds 4.96m on discontinued items.
Turnover rose 4 per cent to Pounds 122m (Pounds 118m), while investment and
other income fell 15 per cent to Pounds 6.12m (Pounds 7.22m) and operating
expenses rose 9 per cent to Pounds 124m (113m).
The board recommends a reduced final dividend of 2.5p (5p), compared with 5p
last year, making a total of 5.65p for the year (8.15p).
It said the reduction was 'prudent' and 'a healthier base from which to
develop into the future'.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rationalisation helps Gt Southern rise 19%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tight cost controls and rationalisation at Great Southern Group helped the
funeral service operator to lift profits last year by 19 per cent.
Despite property write-downs as part of its rationalisation programme,
pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 6.2m in 1993, against Pounds 5.2m restated
under FRS 3.
Turnover rose from Pounds 29.6m to Pounds 32.7m.
Mr James Smillie, chairman, said the profits improvement reflected a strong
commitment to cost controls.
A 4 per rise in mortality rates had reversed falling trends - particularly
in London and the north.
Of the three divisions, retail funeral services continued to dominate - with
profits up 15 per cent at Pounds 4.83m.
This was offset slightly by a Pounds 60,000 loss on the disposal of three
properties, while a Pounds 475,000 provision was also made for falling
values on four further sites.
Nevertheless, group operating profits rose to Pounds 7.13m (Pounds 6.35m)
following improved results by the crematoria division and pre-arranged
funeral services.
Mr Eric Spencer, chief executive, said sales had been held back by the
group's decision not to increase funeral prices.
Cremation costs, however, were subject to an average 10 per cent surcharge
to cover environmental improvements at crematoria, which must be completed
by 1997.
Earnings increased by 27 per cent to 30.4p (24p) basic.
The 8.2p (7.4p) final dividend lifts the total to 12.2p (11p).

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Watson &amp; Philip pays Pounds 9.2m for
convenience stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watson &amp; Philip, the retail and wholesale food group, is further expanding
its convenience store business with the Pounds 9.2m acquisitions of Midlands
Convenience Stores and Convenience Stores West.
The company also announ-ced a Pounds 10.7m open offer and placing at 357p
per share.
Under the open offer, ordinary shareholders can apply for up to 3m new
ordinary shares, on a 1-for-13 basis. The shares closed 5p lower at 379p
yesterday.
The Pounds 7.7m consideration for Midlands Convenience will be met by the
allotment of 460,349 new ordinary shares, a Pounds 500,000 cash payment in
respect of interest on shareholders' loans and 1.54m new ordinary shares,
which are being offered to group shareholders as part of the open offer to
raise Pounds 5.5m for the vendors.
W&amp;P is also issuing 1.46m additional new shares for cash to finance the
Pounds 1.5m consideration for Convenience Stores West and the cash element
for Midlands Convenience. In addition, the Pounds 5.2m cash placing will
repay the external borrowings of the two acquisitions - currently Pounds
2.6m - and finance the expenses of the purchases.
Midlands Convenience operates 33 stores - of which 9 are on petrol station
sites - in the west Midlands. Convenience Stores West operates 13 stores in
the south of England.
Both companies - with turnover totalling Pounds 27m - currently operate
under licence from one of W&amp;P's subsidiaries, and will increase the number
of convenience stores owned by the group to 289.
W&amp;P has an objective of opening 50 new stores this year, which will be
financed from its own resources.
The acquisitions are in addition to this expansion and accordingly, the
group is using its shares to finance the acquisitions.
The open offer has been underwritten by Flemings and brokers to the placing
are SG Warburg Securities.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: 3i and institutions in Pounds 200m link -
Co-investment scheme to oversee MBOs and buy-ins over Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
3i, the UK's largest venture capital group, yesterday announced a
fundamental change in the way it invests in management buy-outs that will
involve it for the first time in managing funds provided by UK institutions.
In future all of 3i's investments in management buy-outs and buy-ins larger
than Pounds 10m will be made alongside five blue chip UK institutions.
The co-investment scheme is likely to raise Pounds 100m from the
institutions, a sum which 3i will match, giving it an initial Pounds 200m
fund.
3i has a policy of not taking controlling stakes in its investments and
consequently has passed Pounds 250m worth of deals to other venture capital
companies by way of syndications over the past 10 years.
The new scheme will allow 3i to retain a greater amount of deals for its own
benefit and will increase security of supply of capital for the larger
deals.
The move follows the group's launch of an Ecu300m (Pounds 227m) European
private equity fund last month and signals its increased desire to manage
funds for other institutions and not just investments it makes from its own
balance sheet.
The move could also have implications for other venture capital companies
trying to raise new funds but facing growing resistance from institutions
unwilling to pay large management fees.
The institutions will pay no management fees to 3i. Instead 3i says it will
'share in the performance' of the investments it makes with the
institutions, with the greatest part of that remuneration arising when the
investment either floats or is sold.
3i has also undertaken to continue managing any investments still within the
portfolio after 10 years, the time at which most funds would hand
responsibility and direct share ownership to the subscribers.
Mr Rupert Wiles, 3i director, said that had the co-investment scheme been in
place over the last 10-year period, 3i would probably have passed deals
worth only Pounds 100m to other venture capital companies.
'I suspect we will still provide more than we receive in the large
management buy-out market, but it will be much closer to parity,' he said.
3i, which is seeking a flotation later this year, has led 35 MBO's of more
than Pounds 10m in the four years to the end of 1993.
3i said yesterday its institutional partners in the 3i 94 Large Management
Buy-out Plan had declined to be named.
It is likely to raise further funds in a similar manner.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Virtuality incurs Pounds 365,000 deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Virtuality Group, the designer and manufacturer of virtual reality computer
games which floated in October, is planning to treble its development
spending this year to take advantage of the potential home market.
Mr Jon Waldern, managing director, warned that the increased investment
would mean continued losses for the company, which yesterday announced a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 365,000 for the year to end-December.
Mr Waldern said that the next generation of home computer games machines,
which would be able to run virtual reality software, were being developed
more quickly than expected and were now forecast to reach the market by the
beginning of next year.
Virtuality is negotiating potential partnerships with the main home games
machine manufacturers, which include Nintendo, Sega and Sony.
Virtuality has 13 games, developed for its own arcade-style machines, which
could be transferred to the new home computers. Mr Waldern said there were
also opportunities to license Virtuality's technology for use in
non-entertainment applications.
Valued at nearly Pounds 85m on the stock market, Virtuality increased its
sales to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 5.25m) last year, representing growth of 50 per
cent excluding a one-off order in 1992.
In January, it launched its second generation machines, which incorporate
better graphics and lighter headsets. They are also 30 per cent cheaper at
about Pounds 20,000 each.
Mr Waldern said the reaction to the new products had exceeded expectations,
with sales so far up 50 per cent on last year.
Development expenditure jumped from Pounds 505,000 to Pounds 1.23m last
year, turning a Pounds 217,000 profit into a Pounds 365,000 loss. In its
flotation prospectus Virtuality forecast a loss of Pounds 400,000 and said
it would not pay dividends 'during the initial period of the company's
growth'.
Although development spending may rise by another Pounds 2m in 1994, the
company had year-end cash balances of Pounds 7.47m, which it said was
sufficient for its current needs.
In response to interest from American investors, Virtuality has arranged for
its shares to be traded on the US Nasdaq market in the form of American
Depositary Receipts from April 5. 'It should increase understanding of our
business in the US, which is our largest market,' said Mr Waldern.
Virtuality shares were unchanged at 324p, almost double their placing price
of 170p.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Benefits of streamlined management lift
Ocean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The benefits of streamlining the management structure and the dollar
exchange rate helped Ocean Group, the freight, environmental and marine
services combine, to achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds 44.1m for 1993.
This was sharply ahead of the previous year's Pounds 16m, struck after a
Pounds 16m loss on the Panocean disposal and a charge of Pounds 8.4m for the
management restructuring.
The latest figure represents a 9 per cent rise on 1992's underlying profits
of Pounds 40.4m. Group turnover rose from Pounds 875m to Pounds 964m,
including Pounds 10.7m from discontinued operations.
Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, said the management changes had
contributed about Pounds 5m to profits, and movements in the exchange rate a
further Pounds 4m.
He described the markets for most of the group's services as tough. 'In
these conditions the growth in our results was encouraging,' he said.
Operating profits from the freight and distribution division, which operates
on fine margins, eased from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 14.7m on turnover ahead
from Pounds 644m to Pounds 748m. The profits fall was mainly due to Hull
Blyth, which was seriously affected by the war in Angola.
Profits at MSAS, the air freight brokerage company, were 15 per cent ahead
on exchange gains and the benefits of a new computer system. Large new
clients included Eastman Kodak.
The marine services division, which contributes the bulk of profits, also
benefited from exchange rates which countered lower oil prices. They rose by
25 per cent from Pounds 24.1m to Pounds 30.1m on turnover of Pounds 132m
(Pounds 122m).
The group succeeded in moving its oil exploration vessels away from the
depressed North Sea to areas of strength in west Africa and south-east Asia.
Profits from environmental services rose from Pounds 4m to Pounds 4.4m on
turnover of Pounds 70.5m (Pounds 65.6m). The UK domestic waste business had
a good year.
Earnings per share were up to 20.3p (1.4p). An unchanged final dividend of
9.62p is proposed giving an unchanged total for the year of 14.33p.
COMMENT
Ocean has been running hard to stand still. The benefits from the
restructuring and exchange rate movements have saved it from a flat year or
worse. Most of the profits come from the marine services area, where low
prices are curbing oil exploration budgets. Overall there appears to be
nothing to get excited about from the rather mixed bag of activities.
However, there is a further Pounds 3m benefit to come from the
restructuring, and the balance sheet is strong, with gearing down from 35
per cent to 17 per cent. A yield of 6.6 per cent makes the shares worth
holding.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Mayflower more than trebles to Pounds 5.38m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mayflower Corporation, the specialist automotive engineering group, reported
pre-tax profits more than tripled from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 5.38m in the
year to end-December.
Operating profits from continuing operations before acquisitions rose by 58
per cent to Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 3.6m), while total operating profits
increased by 47 per cent to Pounds 5.2m.
Mayflower has grown rapidly since 1991 following the acquisition in that
year of Motor Panels and the purchase last year of International Automotive
Design (IAD).
The group is now established in both the UK and the US as an integrated
design, engineering and production operation for truck cabs and low-volume
specialist car bodies.
Group turnover jumped by 50 per cent to Pounds 102m (Pounds 67.8m). Sales
from continuing operations rose by 16.4 per cent to Pounds 74.6m (Pounds
64.1m) and Pounds 26.1m was added through acquisitions.
Earnings per share more than doubled to 2.59p, and a final dividend of 0.9p
is proposed raising the total for the year to 1.35p (1.25p).
IAD, which was acquired from the receiver, has been extensively restructured
and achieved profits of Pounds 257,000 in the eight months from April on a
turnover of Pounds 24m.
The IAD workforce worldwide has been reduced from about 1,000 to 650,
including 200 contract staff.
The lossmaking IAD subsidiary in France has been sold, while in the UK the
main IAD operation in Worthing, West Sussex, has been sold to Daewoo Motor,
the South Korean car maker.
Daewoo paid about Pounds 1m for plant and equipment from IAD, which
continues to hold project contracts with the new owner.
At home IAD has opened offices in Essex and Coventry, and has recently won
new contracts from Ford and Saab.
Group turnover and pre-tax profits are expected to continue to rise strongly
in the next couple of years as new contracts are brought into operation
including:
The supply of bodies for the Aston Martin DB7 luxury sports car to be
launched this summer;
The supply of bodies for the new MG sports car to be launched by the Rover
group in the summer of 1995;
The development and manufacture of cabs for a series of trucks for Ford in
the US, which could be worth more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 205m) over a
15-year period.
The engineering and prototype programme for the MG sports car, code-named
PR3, has been completed, and Motor Panels is currently installing the
assembly facility. It is investing Pounds 24.2m in the project.
Mayflower is forecasting annual sales of Pounds 1.5m from the Aston Martin
contract, Pounds 20m from the MG contract starting next year, and Pounds 14m
from the Ford US truck contract.
Mr John Simpson, Mayflower's chief executive, said the group had 'healthy
order books' and could expect a period of 'strong organic growth.' It
continued to look for acquisitions, he added.

After the listing there will be 43.8m ordinary shares and Pounds 26.2m in
convertible loan stock in issue.
The group's venture capitalists - Montagu Private Equity, 3i and SO. PA. F
of Italy - will hold about 49 per cent of the ordinary shares and 60 per
cent of the convertibles. The three companies are not selling any shares.
Mr Terry Goddard, chairman and finance director, and Mr Gordon Bloor, chief
executive and managing director, who founded the group in 1985, will own 4.4
per cent of the ordinaries and 4.7 per cent of the convertibles.
Mr Goddard is selling 27,000 ordinary shares and 240,000 convertibles.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Productivity gains boost Meggitt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Productivity gains and a commitment to new product development were behind a
10 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits at Meggitt, the Dorset-based
engineer.
Profits for 1993 rose from Pounds 21.2m to Pounds 23.3m on turnover
similarly ahead to Pounds 360m (Pounds 328m). The result was achieved after
higher net interest payments of Pounds 3.24m (Pounds 908,000).
Mr Ken Coates, executive chairman, said the group had kept profits up
through three years of recession. In addition, cash generation of Pounds
38.5m had helped to cut gearing from 48 per cent to 31 per cent.
The group had increased capital expenditure from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 7.8m
and research and development by Pounds 3m to Pounds 11m. Sales per employee
were ahead 11 per cent to Pounds 55,000.
'When business comes back we'll be reaping our just rewards,' said Mr
Coates.
On prospects, he added that orders in the first quarter of this year had
been 3 per cent ahead of the comparable period. However, he warned that the
group's performance would be constrained by the lack of clear signs of
improvement in the aerospace market and the European process industry.
The aerospace and controls divisions make up most of Meggitt's business.
Aerospace operating profits edged ahead from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 13.9m on
turnover up from Pounds 121.7m to Pounds 132.6m, while controls profits fell
from Pounds 6.25m to Pounds 5.22m on turnover of Pounds 117.5m, against
Pounds 115.8m.
While the aerospace market continued to decline, the group had won new
customers throughout the division. In the controls sector, profits were held
back by the need to reorganise some Sunvic and Mobrey operations. Germany
was likely to prove a difficult market this year.
The energy division doubled profits to Pounds 2.22m on turnover of Pounds
47.2m (Pounds 37m). The group had established its presence in east Asia,
winning important orders in Vietnam, Indonesia, Japan and Korea.
Electronics profits rose from Pounds 4.37m to Pounds 6.95m on the back of
greater volume with turnover improving to Pounds 61.6m (Pounds 49.1m).
Earnings per share grew to 7.1p (6.6p). A final dividend of 2.63p is
proposed, taking the total for the year to 3.93p (3.78p).
COMMENT
While Meggitt has shown its resilience to recession, it looks as though the
current year will prove to be dull. The group has sharpened the management
focus and is carrying out some sound restructuring. But it is all dressed up
with nowhere to go. Its two main markets will be among the last to recover
from recession. An improvement to Pounds 25m for earnings of 7.5p put it on
an undemanding prospective multiple of 14, but the yield of almost 5 per
cent could prove attractive.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cowie in Pounds 18.9m vehicle leasing
purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T Cowie, the acquisitive motor group, is expanding its vehicle leasing
activity by buying Commercial Union's business for Pounds 18.85m.
The deal will add 5,000 vehicles to Cowie Interleasing's fleet, making a
total of 65,000. Cowie was already market leader.
Cowie is paying cash and not taking any debt with the business. The deal
will increase its gearing by about 12 percentage points.
The Commercial Union business broke even after tax in 1993.
The acquisition follows Cowie's purchase last August of Commercial Union's
corporate fleet management activity, for an undisclosed sum, and the 1991
purchase of Royal Bank of Scotland's lossmaking contract hire business for
Pounds 38m. That covered 5,700 vehicles.
The price being paid relates to the value of the vehicles, and will be
finalised on completion today.
Cowie said it could assimilate the 5,000 vehicles without taking on many
extra staff. The vehicles are mainly under contract to local authorities.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Alcan loss jumps to Pounds 22.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another 588 jobs were lost at British Alcan Aluminium and capital
expenditure was cut to the bone last year as the company, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Alcan of Canada, struggled with the worst known aluminium
industry conditions.
The company's pre-tax loss jumped from Pounds 15.9m to Pounds 22.7m after
another surge in reorganisation and rationalisation costs, up from Pounds
4.6m to Pounds 11.2m.
Nevertheless, British Alcan remained cash positive during the year 'through
careful management of working capital and limited capital expenditure,' said
Mr John Bridgeman, managing director. It repaid Pounds 18m of debt, despite
re-instituting Pounds 6m cash contributions to the UK pension fund, after a
three-year 'holiday'.
Mr Bridgeman added: 'Some signs of recovery are now apparent in the UK
economy and it is noticeable that many of our major customers are showing
more confidence and more inclination to spend on capital goods. It remains
to be seen whether these signs of recovery can be sustained.'
However, since the year-end the serious world over-supply of primary
aluminium had led Alcan to announce the temporary closure of 156,000 tonnes
of smelting capacity, 18,000 tonnes of it at the three UK smelters.
British Alcan's workforce fell from 7,938 to 7,350 last year. Jobs went
throughout the company but the biggest shake-out was at the Rogerstone
rolling mill operations where 250 jobs went and reorganisation costs came to
Pounds 6m. When the company was formed from the merger of British Aluminium
and Alcan in 1982 it employed 14,000.
Capital expenditure, already at a rock-bottom Pounds 22.5m in 1992, was cut
to Pounds 18.3m.
Turnover slipped from Pounds 756m to Pounds 748m and exports from the UK
fell from Pounds 275m to Pounds 272m. Losses per share were 54p (42p).

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Johnston Press makes Pounds 29m buy -
Advertising upturn in final quarter behind 28% profits rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnston Press, the Edinburgh-based local newspaper group, is making its
largest ever acquisition with the purchase of the family-owned Halifax
Courier group for Pounds 29.4m.
The company also announced profits up by 28 per cent to a record Pounds
12.5m in 1993 helped by a significant upturn in advertising in the last
quarter.
Mr Fred Johnston, chairman, said the acquisition was in line with the
group's strategy of extending its geographical coverage by acquiring titles
which are local market leaders.
He said the quality of the business was reflected in the 'relatively full
price'. But he added that there was 'a lot of mileage' for cost savings and
that the acquisition would enhance the group's earnings from the start.
Johnston is paying a total of Pounds 29.1m for the trading activities, which
made an operating profit of Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.55m) on turnover of
Pounds 9.97m last year. It is also paying Pounds 5.4m for investments and
surplus cash.
In addition to the Evening Courier in Halifax, the business has four small
titles in West Yorkshire and three papers in the Isle of Man where it is
also market leader.
Johnston shares added 2p to 667p yesterday, helped by the 1993 figures which
showed earnings per share up 19 per cent to 27p (22.7p). A final dividend of
4.5p gives a total payment of 7p (6.25p).
The main newspaper division increased operating profits by 31.5 per cent to
Pounds 9.1m helped by a full year from TR Beckett, the Sussex-based
newspaper group acquired for Pounds 12m at the end of 1992.
Mr Johnston said that the south of England economy 'still has a way to go'
but that there has been a good if 'patchy' recovery elsewhere. Advertising
volumes increased by 6 per cent last year, with over 9 per cent growth in
the second half.
He added: '1994 has started encouragingly with results in most of the
group's companies exceeding budgets.'
Strong cash generation resulted in year end net cash of more than Pounds 6m
and although, on a pro forma basis, the Halifax acquisition would have left
it with gearing of 31 per cent this should be down to 16 per cent when the
deal is completed in June.
The consideration for Halifax will be satisfied by the issue of up to 2.5m
new Johnston shares and the balance in cash.
COMMENT
Halifax Courier is a rather better managed company than most of Johnston's
recent targets. But last year's profits were depressed by a major investment
in the Isle of Man and there is scope for cost-savings to bring its healthy
margins up to the level of Johnston's best titles. Even Johnston's famously
cautious chairman allowed himself to be encouraged by the recent upturn in
advertising which should push group profits to Pounds 15m this year. But the
shares are starting to run away. At 667p they are now trading on 21 times
this year's earnings which is asking a lot even from Johnston.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Attack results in best defence - The future
for Westland as part of GKN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, is today expected to leave the engineering
group's London headquarters and walk a few hundred yards past St James'
Palace to the offices of his new subsidiary - Westland Group.
He will invite Mr Alan Jones, chairman of Westland, to join the GKN board
and continue his plans to develop the company as one of Europe's leading
helicopter manufacturers.
There is some uncertainty whether Mr Jones will accept, having waged a
seven-week campaign against GKN's hostile takeover bid and hinted that some
senior Westland managers would not want to work for a group dominated by
automotive components and pallet hire business.
Sir David, however, yesterday indicated he was going to Westland's offices
to praise Mr Jones, not to bury him.
Although he has criticised the Westland chairman for inflating Westland's
order prospects and exaggerating potential profits, he now wants him to stay
with the company and turn estimated orders for more than 150 helicopters
into reality over the next six years.
Potential profits could be boosted by pay-outs from the Arab Organisation
for Industrialisation, which was last year ordered to pay Pounds 385m in
damages over cancelled orders.
Westland has already received Pounds 25m in compensation and GKN is keen to
find out how much could be forthcoming. If the settlement results in a
pay-out of more than Pounds 200m, along with the promise of goodwill orders
from the Arab governments involved, Westland may have lost its independence
too cheaply.
In his meeting with Mr Jones, Sir David is also expected to reiterate the
industrial logic which GKN has touted from the start, namely the synergy
between its defence business - manufacturing armoured vehicles  - and
helicopter production.
Pointing to changing patterns of warfare around the world, Sir David
believes that regional conflicts such as in Bosnia or Somalia will increase
demand for rapid-response vehicles, whether in the air or on the ground.
Westland's directors will be urged to exploit that potential by stepping up
production at the Yeovil plant.
The future, however, of all the Westland board is not secure. Mr Christopher
Bunker, the group finance director, may find it hard to stay on following
the arrival at Yeovil in the next few days of two senior GKN executives, who
will want to go over the books.
Their attention will focus on Westland's profit forecasts for the next three
years and how much they will enhance GKN's tax position. Arguably, it was
the likely tax benefits to GKN which first prompted the bid and fuelled Sir
David's determination to succeed.
Combining Westland's lucrative spares and overhaul business with its defence
and engineering operations would enable GKN to increase the proportion of
sales in the UK sales to 40 per cent.
In turn, the Yeovil-based group's pre-tax profits - up 22 per cent to Pounds
30.5m in the 12 months to October 1 last year - would enable GKN to recover
advance corporation tax that it has written off in the past.
While GKN is confident that Westland's core helicopter business is vital to
improving its own tax position, it is not so sure about the group's other
divisions - notably Westland Technologies, the components business which has
suffered from fewer aircraft orders and delays in government defence
programmes.
Sir David winces at talk of rationalisation and restructuring. Having made a
proposal and seemingly won consent, he wants to carry Westland over the
threshold before deciding which members of the extended family are
disposable.
For the moment, he is content to savour the prospect of enlarging his
defence division to a Pounds 570m sales a year business, which aims to
dominate the European market for armoured vehicles and helicopters.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lower provisions help Co-op Bank to Pounds
18m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in operating profit and a continuing fall in bad debt
provisions helped the Co-operative bank increase annual pre-tax profits by
82 per cent from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 17.8m.
The period to January 8 1994 is the second year in which the Co-op bank has
returned to profit after two years of losses.
Amid fierce competition for personal savings, the bank's retail deposits
rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 1.9bn.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell by 11 per cent to Pounds 38.4m
(Pounds 43.4m).
Mr Terry Thomas, managing director, said the figures reflected improvements
in the bank's loan portfolio in both the personal and corporate sectors.
They represented 'substantial progress in the first full year since the
worst of the recession in the early 1990s.'
Mr Thomas said yesterday the investment programme would continue to enhance
efficiency in dealing with customers, and highlighted its telephone banking
service and the re-design of the distribution network.
Net interest income rose to Pounds 130m (Pounds 125m), while non-interest
income rose more sharply, taking total operating income to Pounds 228m
(Pounds 208m).
Staff costs grew by more than 10 per cent to Pounds 82m (Pounds 74.5m). Mr
Thomas paid tribute to staff members and emphasised that the bank's success
had been achieved without significant job losses.
Earnings per share advanced to 0.91p (0.1p).
The bank, which is wholly owned by the Co-operative Wholesale Society,
underlined its ethical stance again yesterday, with the launch of a scheme
using its credit cards to raise money for charities chosen by bank
customers.
From April 1, 5p of every Pounds 100 spent on the bank's Visa cards will go
to national charities and local good causes.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Senior Engineering seeks Pounds 67m -
Profits up at Pounds 24.2m / Acquisitions made in Germany and the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Engineering Group, the air-handling, tubular products and thermal
engineering company, yesterday launched a Pounds 67.4m rights issue to
finance investment in its fast-growing flexible tubes business and fund
acquisitions in Germany and the US.
Senior also reported a sharp increase in underlying profitability last year,
and forecast that although some European economies were still in recession,
the group would have another satisfactory year.
The 1-for-4 rights issue of 60.2m new shares was priced at 115p. Senior's
shares closed down 8 1/2 p at 133p.
The group is paying Dollars 15.3m (Pounds 10.2m) for Metal Bellows, a US
maker of welded diaphragm metal bellows for the aerospace, semiconductor,
medical and industrial markets.
Senior is also acquiring Christian Berghofer, a German manufacturer of
flexible hoses and expansion joints, for DM20.7m (Pounds 8.4m) from its
private owners.
Mr Don McFarlane, chairman, said: 'Berghofer will promote the expansion of
our flexible connectors business in Germany and eastern Europe, while Metal
Bellows will complement Senior Flexonics' product range and will increase
our market share in several important markets in the US.'
Flexonics, which Senior bought for Pounds 28m in 1992, has a strong position
in the US automotive market for flexible tubes and expansion joints, which
are used to reduce exhaust vibration and cut emissions.
Senior said Flexonics had opportunities to increase sales to the automotive
industry in the US and Europe, with a likely increase in the number of
components supplied from 3.2m last year to 7.6m in 1995. The group plans to
invest some Pounds 28m in the business over the next two years.
Following the purchases and the rights issue, Senior will have net assets of
about Pounds 145m and net cash of about Pounds 16m.
The rights issue is underwritten by Schroders, with Hoare Govett and Albert
E Sharp acting as brokers.
Under FRS 3, Senior's pre-tax profits in the year to December 31 increased
from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 24.2m, but the previous year's figure was
depressed by Pounds 12.2m of losses arising from its withdrawal from the
mining equipment industry and closure of its power contracting side.
Earnings rose to 7.14p (0.98p) per share under FRS 3, but the underlying
earnings - minus exceptionals - emerged at 7.1p (6.26p). A final dividend of
2.1p gives a total of 3.36p (3.15p).
COMMENT
Senior believes it has found a gem in Flexonics, and has taken advantage of
its strong share price to finance a big wave of investment in the automotive
side of that business, which is being driven by tougher environmental
regulations. The simultaneously announced acquisitions offer a wider spread
of activities in the US and a potential route into the crucial German
automotive market. The shares, which have outperformed the market by 80 per
cent since the beginning of 1992, are on a prospective multiple of 18.5.
That 15 per cent premium to the market does not look unjustified, but the
shares are unlikely to advance significantly until the market sees how well
the rights proceeds are used.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Fittings returns to black with
Pounds 1.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Fittings Group emerged from two years of losses with 1993 pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.4m.
There were restated losses of Pounds 3.4m in 1992 and Pounds 3.56m in 1991
when evidence of stock thefts and accounting errors came to light just
before the finals were announced.
The West Midlands pipeline equipment, water products and non-ferrous metals
distribution group has completed the installation of new financial controls.
'It is now a question of getting our market share and increasing it,' said
Mr Cecil Buckett, finance director.
After stripping out figures for the discontinued non-ferrous metals
business, turnover on continuing operations was Pounds 69.3m compared with
Pounds 71.1m. The fall came largely because low levels of capital
expenditure hurt demand for water products.
More than 70 per cent of turnover came from pipeline equipment distribution,
which was the only profitable division. It raised operating profits by 39
per cent.
Group operating profits on continuing operations were Pounds 2.45m, compared
with Pounds 1.54m.
Over the last two years, British Fittings has reduced its non-ferrous metals
activities and Mr Brian Stanton, the chief executive, said these operations
were no longer a core business: 'we will not build on it but we're not going
to panic-sell it.'
With market prospects this year remaining uncertain, the group expects to
lift profits by winning greater market share through a widened base of
materials suppliers and further geographical and product diversification.
Earnings per share were 3.19p (losses 13.59p).
The final dividend is 1.25p (1p) making 2p (1.5p) for the year.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs hit Grampian - Profits
fall 50% after Pounds 2.98m exceptional charge and sports loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grampian Holdings, the Scottish mini-conglomerate, yesterday blamed heavy
restructuring costs for a 50 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds
5.63m.
The Glasgow-based pharmaceutical, sporting goods, transport and retail
group, said its results were hit by exceptional charges of Pounds 2.98m to
cover redundancies and reorganisation costs and a Pounds 398,000 operating
loss in its sporting business.
As part of the restructuring, the group has closed its pharmaceutical
factory in Glasgow, relocated the division to Leyland in Lancashire and cut
the workforce by 12 per cent to 440.
It made a further 42 workers redundant at Patrick International, its
sporting goods subsidiary which closed down operations in Germany and made
stock write-downs elsewhere.
Total closure and restructuring costs of Pounds 6.6m were offset by a Pounds
3.62m exceptional profit on the disposal of Grampian Woollen Mills, which
was merged last year with the Edinburgh Woollen Mill.
Despite the problems, Grampian said an improved performance by the transport
division, which saw profits increase 85 per cent to Pounds 2.7m, lifted
profits on continuing group operations to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 11.3m).
The increase was also underpinned by a Pounds 1.6m profit derived from its
retained 25 per cent stake in Grampian Woollen Mills.
Mr David McGibbon, finance director, said group turnover had declined
slightly to Pounds 137.1m (Pounds 137.3m) as the pharmaceutical business
struggled to maintain sales during its restructuring.
'Some sales are bound to be lost when you're putting through a
reorganisation of this size,' he said.
The restructuring costs also forced the group to increase net borrowings
from Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 32m, representing gearing of 74 per cent
compared with 58 per cent last time.
Although exceptional items led to a 50 per cent decline in earnings per
share to 7.35p (14.71p), the previous year's figure was distorted by a
profit from the sale of Mitre, the sporting goods company.
Pre-exceptional earnings increased to 10.53p (7.18p).
An unchanged final dividend of 3.8p leaves the total payment for the year at
5.5p (same).
COMMENT
Although the restructuring of the pharmaceutical division has only just been
completed, Grampian has decided to take all the costs in 1993 in the hope
that pain now will pay off with a recovery later. There are, however,
reservations about the strength of a balance sheet which is still labouring
under heavy borrowings. Nevertheless, profits this year are expected to
bounce back to around Pounds 11m, putting the shares on a forward multiple
of 15. Although that is a discount to the market, there are some concerns
that the slimmed-down businesses can generate the necessary cash to
strengthen the balance sheet.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Harrisons &amp; Crosfield advances 15% to
Pounds 98m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the chemicals and commodities and feeds group,
announced a 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 98m for 1993
in spite of a poorer than expected result from the agricultural feeds
business acquired for Pounds 67m in 1992.
Sales were 14 per cent ahead to Pounds 2.21bn (Pounds 1.93bn). The shares
edged back 4p to 205p.
Mr Bill Turcan, the finance director who will take over as chief executive
in May, said some of the difficulties which had hit the feeds business last
year and prompted the trading statement in December would continue to affect
the company into the first quarter.
Nevertheless, he was cautiously optimistic about further growth in 1994.
Earnings per share benefited from a lower than expected tax charge and rose
by 13 per cent to 8.6p (7.6p). However the total dividend is uncovered at an
unchanged 9p with a proposed maintained final of 5.4p.
The collapse in pig prices and a sharp fall in margins on compound feeds
left profits at BOCM Pauls 28 per cent lower. 'We missed our targets on BOCM
by a mile,' Mr Turcan said.
Compound feed margins had since recovered, but pig prices remained some 16
per cent lower than 1992 levels.
The difficulties at BOCM left operating profits in the food and agriculture
division 2.3 per cent lower at Pounds 37.9m. The other businesses in the
division had performed well, Mr Turcan said, with profits, excluding BOCM,
about 15 per cent ahead.
The chemicals business increased operating profits by 44 per cent to Pounds
39.9m, or by 30 per cent after adjusting for reorganisation costs. The
businesses had benefited from increased demand and an industrial
restructuring which had left capacity more in line with demand, Mr Turcan
said.
Timber and building supplies suffered a two point fall in margins in the
second half, as sales began to accelerate. Cost-cutting helped the division
report a 31 per cent increase in operating profits on sales 9 per cent ahead
to Pounds 786m.
Plantations advanced by 20 per cent to Pounds 24.2m. The effects of the
devaluation of sterling largely offset the decline in the dollar price of
palm products.
COMMENT
The main attraction of Harrisons in recent years has been its substantial
yield premium. However, this is beginning to look a bit less seductive as
the quality of that yield comes under pressure. Harrisons has neither
earnings nor cash to cover its dividend, leaving it with limited room for
manoeuvre. The recovery may offer some solace, but there may be others in
the sector with more flexibility. Forecasts range between Pounds 115m and
Pounds 120m, with the prospective p/e hovering around 19. The shares may
tread water until they go ex-dividend, when the main attraction fades.

FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Acquisitions help Waterford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Waterford Foods, Ireland's largest milk processor, has reported a 31 per
cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits to IPounds 24.5m (Pounds 23.7m) on
turnover up 26 per cent to IPounds 694m.
A significant part of the growth came from a full year's contribution - five
months in 1992 - from the Express Foods Ireland and Premier Dairies
acquisitions made in August 1992, and which have given the group a 35 per
cent share of Ireland's liquid milk market.
Mr Stephen O'Connor, group managing director, pointed out that there had
also been an overall improvement in operating margins from 5.3 to 5.8 per
cent, operating profits having grown 37 per cent to IPounds 39.9m.
Interest charges rose to IPounds 12.6m (IPounds 9.7m), tax doubled to
IPounds 2.1m (IPounds 900,000) and goodwill increased to IPounds 3.4m
(Pounds 1.9m).
About 39 per cent of the group's sales are in Ireland, 35 per cent in the
UK, and 17 per cent in the US. The consumer products division - consisting
of liquid milk, fresh dairy products and fruit juices - grew by 19 per cent
to IPounds 281m. The dairy products division, which manufactures cheeses,
butters, milk powders and food ingredients, grew by 37 per cent to IPounds
341m, accounting for 49 per cent of group sales.
Animal feeds accounted for the remaining 10 per cent.
Earnings per share advanced by 11 per cent to 11.1p (10.04p) and a final
dividend of 1.64p is being recommended for a total of 2.83p (2.73p).
COMMENT
Waterford has positioned itself well for further rationalisation in the
dairy industry on both sides of the Irish Sea. It has not diversified to the
same extent as its peers in the Irish food sector though, making it more
vulnerable to growing price pressures in the dairy products sector and in
competing for its milk supplies. Pre-tax profits of IPounds 28m are
realisable for 1994, giving an eps of 12p and a prospective p/e ratio of
around 8. The market thus appears to have priced in the downside factors.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Shanks &amp; McEwan warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management group, revealed the extent of damage
incurred by expanding its construction business and warned of Pounds 20m in
provisions which will force the group into losses for 1994.
The Pounds 15m charge announced yesterday, on top of the Pounds 5m specified
at the interim stage, brings total write-offs since June to about Pounds
40m.
Some Pounds 28m of this arises from disputed payments in the civil
engineering division. Thebalance of the Pounds 40m charges covers
rationalisation costs and asset write-downs.
Shanks also announced the departure of its auditors, Moores Rowland, who
were accountants to the civil engineering division.
Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, spent 10 weeks reviewing the business.
Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, said the review had identified substantial
central office overheads that had been carried by operating businesses.
These would now be cut.
There were also significant asset overvaluations. The review was instigated
in January when Shanks made a profits warning - its third in as many years -
and announced the departure of Mr Roger Hewitt as chief executive.
Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, said the latest provisions had wiped the slate
clean. 'We have opened every cupboard, looked under the beds, looked for
every kind of thing. Having made these provisions, we would sell this house
to anybody - it is clean.'
This did not mean Shanks was up for sale, but the group might consider
taking a strategic partner.
'I have got no objections to joint ventures,' Mr Waddell said, 'but I am not
in the business of sacrificing the independence of Shanks &amp; McEwan.'
Fourth quarter results would be 'significantly better than the third',
Shanks told shareholders, leaving it expecting pre-tax profits excluding
exceptionals of Pounds 14m.
After exceptionals, analysts expect losses for the year to March 26 to total
Pounds 6m against Pounds 10.2m last time.
The outlook was clouded by uncertainty over Rechem, the hazardous waste
company. The possibility of a government ban on hazardous waste imports
could swing a Pounds 9m profit into a loss of more than Pounds 1m, Mr
Waddell said.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Spirax-Sarco given a boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Devaluation helped Spirax-Sarco Engineering, the steam equipment specialist
which makes three-quarters of its profits overseas, lift pre-tax profits by
15 per cent to Pounds 26.7m in the year to December 31, against Pounds
23.1m.
Currency translation added Pounds 2.1m to the profits figure. Sales rose
from Pounds 154.2m to Pounds 193m, which included Pounds 17.4m from
acquisitions. Like-for-like sales improved by 14 per cent but were only 3
per cent higher at constant exchange rates.
Operating profit rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 28.1m (Pounds 24.8m) with
Pounds 904,000 coming from acquisitions.
Mr Chris Tappin, executive chairman, said order levels so far this year
hadmaintained the trend of volume growth which had been established in the
last quarter of 1993.
In particular, the group was now benefiting from improving conditions in the
US, although a number of economies in Europe remained in decline.
The chairman said: 'Given the continuation of present trading conditions we
look forward to another successful year.'
Strict control of stocks helped increase cash flow from operations of Pounds
31m (Pounds 26.7m) and November's enhanced scrip dividend saved a further
Pounds 1.9m in cash.
Group gearing was slightly reduced at 19 per cent, in spite of expenditure
of a net Pounds 12.6m on acquisitions and disposals.
Earnings per share rose by 28 per cent to 21.6p, against 16.9p depressed by
an exceptional disposal charge representing 1.7p.
The underlying earnings increase was 16 per cent.
A final proposed dividend of 3.3p makes a total for the year of 9.9p (9.3p).
COMMENT
These were good results from a quality company, even if sterling's weakness
against the dollar did flatter the headline numbers. Analysts were also
pleased by the company's optimism about the recent recovery in orders,
although the continuing caution over continental Europe was also noted.
Forecast profits of Pounds 30m this year put the shares, up 4p to 405p, on a
prospective multiple of 17.6. That 10 per cent premium to the market does
not look unjustified, given that the group is a late-cycle play and has
built an international network which will benefit greatly from increased
demand.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Simon Eng calls for Pounds 52.5m to reduce
debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Simon Engineering, maker of access equipment including fire rescue gear,
yesterday announced a 5-for-9 rights issue to raise Pounds 52.5m after
finally completing complex negotiations with its lenders.
The group is proposing to issue 55.9m new shares at 100p. The issue will be
fully underwritten by Hill Samuel and SG Warburg.
The shares closed at 118 1/2 p, down 3p on the day.
Simon said the issue would significantly strengthen the balance sheet and
sharply reduce debt, enhancing its ability to win new business and pursue a
measured disposal strategy.
The issue was flagged earlier this month when the group announced a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 160.3m for 1993. Mr Maurice Dixson, chief executive, said the
rights would be the cornerstone to put the group on a sound financial
footing.
Since he joined the group last September, Mr Dixson has concentrated on
driving down debt through a programme of tighter controls and disposals. Net
borrowings have fallen since then from Pounds 148m to Pounds 127m.
After the rights issue the group's gearing is expected to fall from 264 per
cent to 67.3 per cent, with a further reduction by the end of the year.
Simon's negotiations with its lenders have been protracted because of the
number of banks involved. Its new banking and bonding facilities will be
provided by Lloyds and Barclays in the UK and the Fifth Third Bank in the US
on completion of the rights issue. They will allow Simon to reduce its
outstanding US loan notes from Dollars 125m to Dollars 80m (Pounds 54.7m)
and to repay most of its existing bank debt.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bibby decision questioned
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J Bibby &amp; Sons faced questioning from shareholders at its annual meeting
over the sudden decision a month ago to put a proposed demerger of part of
the group on ice, while an offer for one of the businesses from Associated
British Foods was considered.
Bibby - 79 per cent owned by Barlow Rand, the South African industrial group
 -had announced last October that it would float three of its activities -
science, paper and agriculture - in a new group. The demerged group was
estimated to be worth Pounds 75m. The cash raised would cut debt which stood
at Pounds 122.8m at the September year end.
ABF is interested in the agriculture division. At yesterday's meeting Mr
Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman, said the talks with ABF were continuing and
an announcement would be made in due course.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Eradicating the hazards of waste - The new
strategy adopted at Shanks &amp; McEwan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste services company which yesterday ann-ounced
provisions totalling Pounds 20m, is returning to its Scottish roots, says Mr
Gordon Waddell, its Glaswegian chairman.
'We are trying to change a culture,' said Mr Waddell. 'There will be no more
free newspapers, no five star hotels. They will have to become Scottish.'
The Shanks review which has prompted the further provisions, following the
Pounds 19.3m announced in June, was greeted with relief in the market. The
shares moved ahead by 6p to 87p, against the trend.
Investors were further encouraged by Shanks's guardedly optimistic statement
on trading. Substantial progress had been made in solving some of the
technical difficulties which hit capacity in the third quarter at Rechem,
the hazardous waste incinerator.
However, some questions remained, particularly over the dividend. Analysts
speculated that this was likely to be cut under the new, stricter, regime.
Nor was Rechem out of the woods, with considerable uncertainty arising from
European Union regulations which come into force on May 8.
From that date Britain has the power to ban all imports of hazardous wastes.
'Should it choose to exercise that power,' said Mr Waddell, 'it would bring
into serious question the viability of high temperature incineration in this
country.'
Rechem depends on imported hazardous waste for about 50 per cent of its
sales by value. Mr Waddell said that if the government chose to implement
its power to ban all hazardous wastes, at least one of its two plants would
have to be closed down. This, he said, could result in a further substantial
write-down. The two plants are valued at Pounds 31m.
The real horror story, however, was last year's performance from the
construction division, which has prompted two of the three profits warnings
in the last three years. Disputes over payments for large road-building
contracts have led to a total provision of Pounds 28m for bad debts.
Shanks has now admitted that Pounds 17m of last year's provisions should be
recognised as losses. So far this year it has managed to recover only Pounds
3.3m of the total Pounds 41m claimed, a substantially lower figure than was
expected at the interim stage, with a further Pounds 2m to come.
Yesterday the picture worsened, with further construction debt write-offs of
Pounds 11m. Mr Waddell said Shanks could be confident about recovering only
a further Pounds 8m to Pounds 9m.
One analyst at the company's briefing was prompted to question whether the
civil engineering division had been building roads for free over the past 18
months. Mr Waddell does not dodge the accusation. 'They did bid at very
uncompetitive margins,' he says.
Construction now has new management and Mr Waddell is optimistic that it
will turn the corner this year. 'I would be astonished if it is not in
profit,' he says.
Management has been revamped throughout the group, leaving only one main job
unfilled: that of chief executive.
However, the company would say little more than that the search continued
and an announcement is expected before the annual meeting in August.
Some analysts suggested that Mr Mike Averill, recently appointed group
operating officer, had been pegged for a second promotion. 'There might be
few people in the industry qualified to do the job,' said one analyst. The
company is keeping mum.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ashley in Pounds 20m Spanish write-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ashley Group, the window blinds and timber company, is to write off the
entire Pounds 20m deferred payment from the sale of its Spanish food
subsidiary. This would result in substantial losses for 1993, the company
said yesterday.
Ashley also admitted that it had breached certain banking covenants on its
Pounds 18.5m of net debt, but said its principal bankers had 'been
supportive of the steps taken to date.'
The announcement follows a business review undertaken after significant
board changes in January, including the appointment of Mr Hamish Grossart as
chairman in place of Mr James White.
Digsa, the Spanish retailer, has been the root of Ashley's problems. It was
sold last April, but the directors have decided it 'would not be prudent to
assume at this stage that any value attaches to the deferred consideration'
of Pounds 20m. A further Pounds 1.07m will be written off related to
discontinued activities.
Ashley will announce full results in May, but it indicated that it had
achieved operating profits of Pounds 3.1m before interest, and had
maintained positive operating cash flow.
Mr Grossart said that given the provisions, and its level of debt, some
equity financing would be necessary once it had fully clarified its
financial standing. Meanwhile, preference dividend payments, due on March
31, will be defer-red.
The shares fell 3/4 p to 7 3/4p.

FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cornhill Ins rises tenfold to Pounds 31.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cornhill Insurance, the UK offshoot of Allianz Group, yesterday reported a
tenfold increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 31.5m for 1993.
The increase, which the company said was driven by motor and personal
insurance, came after profits of Pounds 3.1m last year and a loss of Pounds
39.5m in 1991.
Overall premium income rose marginally to Pounds 709m, compared with Pounds
706.8m. Of the total Pounds 605.2m (Pounds 619.9m including discontinued
operations) from general business and Pounds 103.8m (Pounds 86.9m) from life
business.
From continuing operations, there were profits of Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 15.9m
losses) from general business and profits of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 2.9m)
from life business, offset by a charge of Pounds 800,000 to a profit sharing
scheme.
The company said that commercial insurance improved but remained in loss,
partly as a result of the property claims following the IRA bombing of
Bishopsgate in London last year.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Waiting to see if the punches are worth taking: Matthew
Curtin and Michael Holman assess the mood of business people in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa: things don't fall apart, was the title of a recent analysis of
investment opportunities by Salomon Brothers, the New York-based investment
bank. As word came in on Monday of mounting casualties following a Zulu
demonstration at the African National Congress headquarters, even such
cautious bullishness seemed inappropriate.
It may yet prove to be accurate, however, as the country's politicians have
faced equally grave crises in the four years since Mr Nelson Mandela's
release and stepped back from confrontation.
Economic statistics and ratios 'indicate the country should be placed
squarely in the mid-investment-grade category', says the Salomon report. But
it also warns that there is 'a small possibility of a rapid deterioration in
the country's political stability and ability to access foreign currency to
service its foreign debts'.
This could lead to a credit rating below the level suggested by a purely
economic analysis. Nevertheless, Salomon reckons any rating below the upper
BB range - just below investment grade - 'would be unjustified'. Salomon is
on a shortlist of international banks bidding to advise the new government
on entry into the international bond market.
The local business community would have been happy to settle for an upper BB
as Monday's death-toll rose to more 50 and the JSE all-share index fell
nearly 3 per cent. Opinion was summed up by Mr Richard Stuart at
stockbrokers Martin &amp; Co: 'When your hands are tied behind your back, you've
just got to take the punches.'
Mr Stuart has consistently told his overseas clients that the run-up to the
election would present the best buying opportunities. Taking such advice
requires a strong nerve and a belief that, despite the violence, the country
will emerge stable and profitable from the transition to democracy.
Unnerving as Monday's events are, maintains Mr Stuart, investors should not
lose confidence in South Africa's potential. With a market value of some
Dollars 150bn (Pounds 103bn) and a highly sophisticated financial services
sector, it is not so much an emergent market as a re-emergent market.
But Mr Stuart's sanguine view is not necessarily shared by the local
stockbroking community. Mr David Schapiro, a director at Frankel Pollak
Vinderine, says Monday's events were 'the last straw' for many people who
have worked hard to market the country abroad. 'It's becoming an
increasingly frustrating game of snakes and ladders, and many brokers are
fed up with the uncanny ability of our politicians to put us back at square
one.'
From Dr Chris Stals, governor of the country's central bank, comes the
phlegmatic comment: 'We have to accept Monday's events as just another
adverse short-term event. All it will do is confirm the 'wait-and-see'
approach which already prevails among international investors.'
Mr Michael Spicer, a consultant to Anglo American, the mining and industrial
group, says: 'The country's institutional framework is strong and will
bounce back, the economy is fair-set for a mini-boom, while we have always
warned our international contacts that the transition would be testing.'
However, behind the brave face is an unease that the business community has
not felt for some time. What made Monday's events so traumatic was the
symbolic impact of mayhem under the noses of the men and women whose job has
been to sell 'South Africa to the rest of the world'.
A toughened senior executive in one of the country's biggest mining
companies was shocked to discover that a bullet had struck the
reinforced-glass window of his city-centre office. As businessmen rang each
other to compare eye witness accounts, the mood was as sombre as it has been
at any stage during the country's perilous transition from apartheid to
democracy.
Yet within 48 hours the country's resilience was demonstrated as the
Department of Finance unveiled interim budgetary guidelines based on a
forecast of 3 per cent growth in gross domestic product this year, compared
with 1 per cent in 1993.
Perhaps most striking was a meeting in one of Johannesburg's luxury hotels
between more than 100 executives and top officials from the ANC. In contrast
to the hostility which has often marked exchanges between the ANC and the
private sector, the executives left reassured on important issues such as
the independence of the central bank, fiscal discipline and exchange rate
policy.
Meanwhile the world watches and waits. As Mr Stuart observes, 'the main body
of investment money will come to South Africa only after the elections'.

FT  31 MAR 94 / C&amp;W and Bell Canada seek offering for joint cable group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new cable television group linking the UK cable interests of Cable and
Wireless, Bell Canada International and Jones Intercable is planning a
public offering which could be the first to reach the London Stock Exchange.
The new cable group, to be known as BCETI Cable, which will be the third
largest in the UK, is planning a listing on the New York Stock Exchange and
probably also in London.
The groups have signed a letter of intent to consolidate their interests in
cable television and cable telephony and have announced a public offering.
C&amp;W, which has a 20 per cent stake in Bell Canada's UK cable holdings, said
last night it hoped to see a flotation in both London and New York.
Mr Alan Bates, managing director of the UK arm of Jones Intercable, a US
group, will be chief executive of BCETI Cable. He said the proposed
amalgamation meant 'our interests in the UK can achieve the full benefit of
access to both capital and expertise, allowing us to deliver a wide range of
video, voice and data products to consumers and businesses.' The group will
have significant cable interests in London, Yorkshire, East Anglia and
south-east England.
The decision to go for a flotation is a symptom of growing confidence in the
UK cable industry largely because of the dual streams of revenue from
television and telephone services.
At least three other large cable groups are considering coming to the London
Stock Exchange this year: TeleWest, Comcast and Generale Des Eaux, the
French utility and communications group.
Mr Richard Woollam, director of the Cable Television Association, said the
deal underlined the cable industry's commitment to build 'super highways' in
the UK. It could also be a chance, he said, for British investors to back
the industry. At the moment the multi-billion pound task of building cable
networks in the UK is largely being financed by North American money.
Details involving minority shareholders in the BCETI agreement are likely to
be resolved within the next couple of weeks with a prospectus likely within
two months.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Caradon rises 70% after big restructure: Group boosted by
sterling's fall and CarnaudMetalbox stake sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caradon, the building products and security printing group, came through a
year of substantial restructuring with underlying profits up 5 per cent to
Pounds 132.2m and earnings per share unscathed at 15.2p, Mr Peter Jansen,
chief executive, said yesterday.
In 1993 Caradon sold its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox for Pounds
467.5m, and reinvested the proceeds, plus Pounds 334m raised through a
rights issue, in the Pounds 808.7m purchase of the Pillar building products
business from RTZ. Caradon shares fell sharply initially but recovered to
show a net fall of 9p to 374p yesterday.
Mr Jansen said Caradon had found no serious problems at Pillar and that
operational management had been largely retained.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 213.4m, up 70 per cent from Pounds 125.7m,
including exceptional gains of Pounds 81.2m net. These were a Pounds 100.3m
profit on the CarnaudMetalbox sale, less a provision of Pounds 14.1m against
properties being sold and a Pounds 5m provision on last week's sale of the
UK security printing business.
However, profits were helped by sterling's fall, which gave translation
gains of Pounds 10.3m at the operating profit level.
The sale of the CarnaudMetalbox stake cut profits by Pounds 32.5m, but this
was offset by profits from acquisitions of Pounds 19.2m and interest
receivable of Pounds 8.6m, a positive swing of Pounds 13.7m.
Mr Jansen, who is adding the deputy chairmanship to his role, was optimistic
about the UK building products market. Volumes rose 9 per cent, but prices
fell 1 per cent with bathroom products under particular pressure. He said
the group had been distracted by the strategic upheavals of 1993 and had not
pushed for price increases last year. Now price increases were coming
through.
The US recovery was ahead of that in the UK but in continental Europe, which
now accounts for about 10 per cent of the group's business, conditions
worsened in the second half and the trend was continuing.
In US security printing, prices were under pressure in 1993, falling 5 per
cent, partly as the group offered its three largest bank customers a
discount to refix contracts early. However, volumes rose 4 per cent.
Group turnover from continuing operations rose 10.3 per cent to Pounds
720.9m, and the total increased 44.6 per cent to Pounds 960.7m. Operating
profits from continuing activities were up 6.6 per cent to Pounds 99.6m.
UK building products profits were flat at Pounds 35.4m, continental Europe
was unchanged at Pounds 18.9m and security printing rose 15 per cent to
Pounds 45.3m.
Earnings per share excluding exceptionals were unchanged at 15.2p, while
fully diluted FRS3 earnings were 29.2p. A final dividend of 6.08p is
proposed to give a total of 8.91p, a rise of 3 per cent.

FT  31 MAR 94 / GKN ups bid to win fight for Westland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN won control of Westland yesterday after raising its hostile bid for the
helicopter manufacturer from 290p to 335p a share, valuing the target at
Pounds 577m.
The engineering group took its stake from 45 per cent to 54.4 per cent after
a number of institutional shareholders accepted the revised cash offer.
Although more than 26m Westland shares were traded yesterday, GKN was not
able to declare the offer unconditional because it failed to push its stake
above 55 per cent. It is expected to pass that barrier today.
The revised offer - coming seven weeks after the bid was launched - followed
Westland's forecast earlier this week that it would increase pre-tax profits
by 64 per cent this year to Pounds 50m.
Most of the expected increase was linked to a Pounds 15m profit on
compensation payments from the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation
(AOI), which last year was ordered to pay Pounds 385m damages to Westland
over cancelled helicopter orders.
Warning that there was no guarantee that the AOI would make further
payments, GKN yesterday offered Westland shareholders a 290p alternative to
the 335p offer that would include a potential share of any further
compensation received.
GKN has also offered a loan note alternative to investors, and increased the
offer for each convertible preference share from 358.4p to 409.9p and for
each warrant from 208.3p to 253.3p.
Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, said the group had decided to increase its
offers following his failure on Tuesday to persuade Mr Alan Jones, his
Westland counterpart, to agree terms.
The Westland board, which adjourned an emergency meeting yesterday pending
an announcement that GKN's revised offer had gone unconditional, had
previously criticised Sir David for undervaluing order prospects for its
helicopters.
Those prospects - enhanced this week when McDonnell Douglas Helicopters
announced it would market Westland's EH101 model in the US - were given a
further fillip yesterday when the Ministry of Defence said it was issuing
tenders for new RAF support helicopters. Mr Jonathan Aitken, junior defence
minister, said in a parliamentary written answer that Westland and Boeing
would be invited to bid.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Ferranti receivers agree to sell defence systems to GEC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Administrative receivers to Ferranti International have agreed in principle
to sell the company's main defence systems businesses to GEC rather than a
management buy-out team.
Ferranti went into receivership in December after GEC withdrew a 1p a share
offer for the company following its due diligence inquiries.
The receivers from accountants Arthur Andersen said yesterday that after
analysing the indicative bids and 'taking into account a number of important
factors' they had decided that GEC was the preferred buyer. GEC is
understood to have made a higher bid and the other factors are thought to
include its acceptability to the Ministry of Defence. The receivers and GEC
expect to conclude negotiations in April.
However, Mr Jonathon Wackett, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which is advising the
buy-out team said it was 'still very much in the game'. 'We are now talking
to our backers about an increased bid and other ways we could reshape our
offer.'
The buy-out team is backed by a UK institution and 'a major European defence
company', thought to be Thomson of France.
The agreement covers Ferranti Defence Systems Integration, which has around
570 employees, and Ferranti Simulation &amp; Training which has a further 540
staff.
But the buy-out team is bidding for the whole of Ferranti's systems
business, including its civil and satellite operations, which has a turnover
of Pounds 130m and 1,750 employees.
Mr Geoff Eades, a member of the buy-out team, said: 'We are trying to
preserve the greatest part of the systems business as an entity. It is a
people business and one of the dangers is that the people start walking
away.'
GEC is also thought to be negotiating with the receivers over Ferranti's US
business and its sonar joint venture with Thomson.
The receivers said separate negotiations were continuing with other
interested parties over the civil business, based in Wythenshawe near
Manchester, and the component making operation, which employs around 515 in
Oldham, Lancashire.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Enhanced redundancy terms for miners may be dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is likely to end British Coal's enhanced redundancy scheme
from the end of next month in a move that could encourage thousands of
miners to seek to leave the industry before then.
Replacing the scheme by a less generous package would be attacked by the
opposition and union leaders as a betrayal of the 10,000 miners still in the
industry.
British Coal hopes to soften the blow by offering a one-off bonus for miners
who go on working. In exchange it would expect miners to accept significant
changes in working practices before privatisation later this year and next.
The changes would ease problems surrounding the sell-off. They would make
British Coal more attractive to prospective bidders who, under European
legislation, will have to honour the terms and conditions governing workers
in the businesses they take over, initially at least.
Treasury restrictions make it very unlikely that British Coal could offer
both its existing enhanced redundancy package and loyalty bonuses.
Although the Department of Trade and Industry has still to make final
decisions, indications are that it would prefer the bonuses.
The likely termination of the existing redundancy package from April 30
follows a series of extensions and improvements since the scheme was
introduced in January 1990. The enhanced terms have helped British Coal
reduce its mining workforce to about a quarter of the total of more than
40,000 two years ago.
In recent closures miners have been eligible for payments of up to Pounds
44,000, and the average of about Pounds 27,000 is almost unprecedented for
manual workers in any industry.
However, with the bulk of the pre-privatisation rationalisation complete,
the political need for the scheme has diminished.
An announcement to withdraw existing terms would lead to a flood of
applications for redundancy. Although British Coal can refuse requests for
redundancy, saying no would inevitably cause morale problems.
Of the 18 remaining pits, between two and four may close before
privatisation but the closures could be effected before April 30.
British Coal may present the package as compensation for miners' failure to
win pay awards for the last two years as well as a reward for loyalty.
However, ministers are keen to change work patterns and erode demarcation
before privatisation.
British Coal declined to comment on plans for the redundancy package or
loyalty bonus. The DTI said it was a matter for British Coal.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Ex-minister says Matrix chief deceived him over Iraq exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Trefgarne, a former trade and defence minister, yesterday told the
arms-to-Iraq inquiry that Mr Paul Henderson, the businessman at the centre
of the Matrix Churchill case, had deceived him about the true purpose of
machine tools exported to Iraq.
Lord Trefgarne's accusation came as Lord Justice Scott's inquiry draws to a
close and threatened further political embarrassment for the government. It
emerged last night that Mr Henderson, who also worked for British
intelligence, may now insist on giving oral evidence to the inquiry.
In his evidence, Lord Trefgarne said he had approved the exports of Matrix
Churchill machine tools to Iraq towards the end of 1989 after being
personally assured by Mr Henderson, the company's managing director, that
they were intended for civilian use.
Lord Trefgarne said: 'I don't think I could have done more than looked him
in the eye and asked him what the machines were intended for. He told me. I
now believe that he deceived me.'
The allegation drew a strong denial from Mr Henderson's solicitor, Mr Kevin
Robinson, who was present at the hearing.
Mr Robinson said: 'Lord Trefgarne's allegation is completely denied. Paul
Henderson has already supplied the Scott inquiry with a truthful account of
the events surrounding his meeting with Lord Trefgarne.'
He added: 'Mr Henderson is confident that the inquiry's report will sustain
his position.'
Officials close to Lord Trefgarne insist his evidence to the inquiry was a
personal initiative.
However, the government is thought to feel it is on the defensive,
particularly following evidence given by Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general, which raised fresh questions over whether the prosecution
of the Matrix Churchill case should have gone ahead.
Mr Henderson was declared not guilty of breaching export regulations in
November 1992 after his defence had secured disclosure of official documents
proving he had worked for British intelligence and exported defence-related
machine tools with government knowledge.
The collapse of the Matrix Churchill case caused a political furore and
forced Mr John Major, the prime minister, to set up the Scott inquiry.
Lord Trefgarne was the last of several former and serving ministers to give
evidence in public to the inquiry, which has adjourned until May.
Last night an inquiry official said Mr Henderson would be asked to give
further written evidence in the light of Lord Trefgarne's statement,
although the judge had not decided whether to ask him to give oral evidence.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Government to cut Pounds 21bn road programme by 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Pounds 21bn road building programme is to be cut by 15 per cent
following a detailed review of government transport policy.
Of the 371 schemes originally planned over the next 10 years, 49 projects,
worth some Pounds 3bn, have been withdrawn, Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, announced yesterday.
Work on a further 69 schemes will be halted at the earliest opportunity
though they will remain in the programme for long-term completion. Eighty
schemes have been given top priority while a further 173 have been ranked as
'priority 2' and will be put back.
Despite the decision to drop many planned new roads and road-widening
schemes, the impact of the review was less severe than many had expected.
Roads and motoring groups reacted with relief to the proposals. Transport
2000, a pressure group opposed to roads, described it as 'a con'.
The aim of the reassessment was to concentrate funds on a smaller number of
motorway and trunk road-widening schemes.
New roads which cut across open country such as the M12 from London into
Essex and roads which encourage commuter journeys into town centres have
been dropped.
Deciding priorities would allow essential projects to be built faster and
remove those deemed environmentally unacceptable or unnecessary for the
foreseeable future, Mr MacGregor said. It would also minimise damage and
disruption to local communities.
Nearly 100 motorway improvement schemes have been retained including
expanding parts of the M25, up to 14 lanes, southern parts of the M1 and the
M6 from Birmingham to Manchester.
The RAC commended the outcome of the review as being 'highly satisfactory'
while the Road Haulage Association said it was 'less severe than expected'.
However, the Freight Transport Association said it was 'deeply
disappointed'.
Mr Jim Turner, a director of the Federation of Civil Engineering
Contractors, said: 'At first glance, it could have been a lot worse. We
welcome attempts to establish clear priorities.'
In a second motoring initiative announced yesterday, Mr MacGregor promised
fewer delays because of roadworks, more reliable emergency phones and better
lit motorways under two charters - for road users and for people whose homes
are in the path of road schemes. Responsibility for the charters will lie
with the Highways Agency.

FT  31 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Shanks &amp; McEwan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shanks &amp; McEwan used to describe itself as the Rolls-Royce of the waste
management sector. The wheels have now come off. Its market capitalisation
languishes below the Pounds 170m paid for the Rechem hazardous waste
disposal business in January 1991. Yesterday's provisions are the latest in
a string of disappointments since that acquisition. Further provisions on
the contracting side and property write-downs mean that 1993 profits will be
drowned in red ink. The question is whether Shanks can deliver much by way
of growth from here.
Assuming that contracting is sold, Shanks would be left with around Pounds
100m turnover in waste management. While municipal waste has proved to be
anything but the recession-proof business once supposed, Shanks might now
push through price increases in Scotland, where it enjoys a hefty market
share. Yet in England Shanks commands only a fraction of a fragmented
market. That operation might flourish more as part of a larger group.
The chance of this logic eliciting a bid probably turns on the prospects for
Rechem. Half of Rechem's sales come from burning imported waste, so any
government ban on hazardous imports would undermine profits. While that
threat remains, Shanks has a poison pill. Should the worst happen to Rechem,
though, the risks would be easier for a predator to judge. Shareholders have
been given little incentive in recent years to defend Shanks's independence.

FT  31 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to assume that yesterday's gilts market rally owed something
to the success of the first floating-rate issue since the 1970s. But cover
of nearly 2.3 times is only what might be expected of an issue targeted
towards banks which are short of borrowers. Having got one issue
successfully away, the authorities can - within limits - issue more
floating-rate paper, which may help reduce supply worries in the fixed-rate
market. Otherwise gilts are still caught up in the ebb and flow of
international confidence.
It will take more than yesterday's two point gain to bring buyers out in
force, though. Uncertainty over future funding remains great. A further
floating-rate issue would be the obvious solution if the market remains
nervous into April, but the authorities cannot become solely dependent on
this instrument without being accused of fomenting inflation by selling too
much paper into the banking system.
As long as the Bank of England believes in its ability to control inflation
and therefore to keep interest rates low, it can argue that floating-rate
borrowing is cheap. Yet to shy away from fixed-rate funding because long
yields are close to 8 per cent may be to miss the point. The Bank
increasingly appears to have missed the opportunity to raise long-term funds
when yields were at their trough. The floating alternative may still be
revealed as an expensive option when the paper has to be refinanced in five
years' time.

FT  31 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Caradon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a tumultuous year of disposals and acquisitions, Caradon's annual
results appeared a tame affair in comparison. Rather like Tomkins after its
purchase of Ranks Hovis McDougall, Caradon was tight-lipped about the
newly-acquired Pillar, apart from suggesting that its striking two-month
contribution would not be indicative of this year's full performance. That
reticence is understandable, as Caradon still grapples with what it has
bought. But, in the absence of fuller information, the market was left to
worry over the sizeable fair value provisions for potential environmental
liabilities and some chunky reorganisation costs. To be fair, Caradon has
always presented the Pillar acquisition as a slow margin burn rather than a
quick explosion. Some reassurance can be drawn from Caradon's fine record of
delivering on its promises. Structural market changes affecting its security
printing business in the US and Caradon's exposure to depressed markets in
mainland Europe may take some of the shine off this year's progress. But
longer term, Caradon offers an enticing mix of volume growth on the back of
increased UK housing transactions and steady margin gains at Pillar.
The broader worry concerning Caradon, though, is the same as that afflicting
the building materials sector as a whole. Much of the sector's rating
depends upon a return of price inflation. Many companies, including Caradon,
are now itching to play that game. But if inflation really does take off
with a vengeance, it may only spook the market as a whole.

FT  31 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: GKN hits the target
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It must be pretty galling for Westland to be shot down only hours before a
government minister announces that some long-awaited reinforcements may be
about to arrive. Still, assuming that GKN's bid goes unconditional,
Westland's new owners will be happy that tenders for the RAF's support
helicopters are now being invited. Despite GKN's scepticism during the bid,
if a price can be agreed with the Ministry of Defence, Westland stands a
good chance of turning some of those possible orders into real work.
The incident highlights the difficulty facing those large institutions that
have so far resisted GKN's advances. GKN has a controlling stake in
Westland, yet the price does not reflect the highest hopes for the company's
prospects. Holders now have to choose between the unpalatable acceptance of
a price they consider inadequate and the uncomfortable existence of a
minority shareholder. If enough hold out, however, and four institutions
speak for more than 30 per cent of the shares, GKN will not be able to use
Westland's earnings to relieve its tax problems. Staying in for a year or
two in the hope of more may not be, in this case, a road to nowhere.
Unless remaining institutions put up vigorous objections, however,
Westland's management may feel it has little choice but to recommend the
offer. Canny and more adventurous shareholders may mitigate their
disappointment by opting for less cash now and money from settled litigation
later. The flip side of the institutions' reluctance is that GKN has bought
Westland's potential at a very reasonable price. All it has to do now is
hang on to the management which has made Westland worth buying.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Better news from the Balkans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For over a month now, since the Bosnian Serbs complied with Nato's ultimatum
and withdrew their heavy weapons from Sarajevo, the news from the former
Yugoslavia has been, for the most part, unusually good.
Further west, the war between Croats and Moslems has been brought to a
sudden halt. Supply routes have been opened. The two sides have agreed on a
federal constitution, and even on merging their forces into a common army.
Northwards, the Serbs have allowed the reopening of Tuzla airport, and have
at long last permitted a UN relief convoy to reach the Moslem enclave of
Maglaj.
These hopeful developments have been achieved through diplomacy, backed by a
show of military force and political resolve - elements which were cruelly
lacking in earlier attempts to stop the fighting. Force has been displayed
by Nato in the air and by the UN on the ground. At the local level General
Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander, has proved an outstanding diplomat, with
a rare grasp of Clausewitzian principle. At the international level Mr
Charles Redman and Mr Vitaly Churkin, the US and Russian special envoys,
have performed prodigies of discreet arm-twisting on their respective Balkan
clients. Indeed, their achievements have spread beyond Bosnia, with the
ceasefire agreement signed early yesterday by Croatian officials and Serb
leaders from the breakaway Krajina region.
Euphoria premature
But euphoria would be premature, to say the least. The peace in Sarajevo,
however welcome, is based on de facto recognition of Serb authority in
several suburbs where Moslems were the largest group before the war. It
could easily turn out to be a further step towards permanent partition of
the city. Meanwhile in Banja Luka, the main city of northern Bosnia, the
odious process of 'ethnic cleansing' is still going on.
In Croatia, too, the new agreement consolidates territorial division by
installing a buffer zone, to be policed by UN troops. This was precisely the
deployment which the Vance Plan, on which the original ceasefire was based
two years ago, had been careful, at Croat insistence, to avoid. Croats are
well aware of the precedent set in Cyprus, where a UN-manned 'green line'
across the island has become a 20-year partition. Accordingly the Vance Plan
provided for an 'ink-blot' UN deployment in 'protected areas', within which
militias were supposed to be disarmed, and refugees allowed to return to
their homes. None of that has happened, and it now seems unlikely it will.
US firmness
Hopes for peace in both Bosnia and Croatia now depend on a combination of US
firmness and Russian diplomacy. Between them, they will have to push the
Serbs beyond ceasefires into withdrawing from captured territory, and into
accepting, in name at least, both Bosnia and Croatia as sovereign states
within their prewar frontiers.
Nor should Serbia be allowed to think that the present state of affairs in
Kosovo can continue indefinitely. The ethnic Albanians there, comprising 90
per cent of the population, have been deprived not only of the autonomy they
enjoyed before 1989 but effectively of all political and civil rights.
Their leader, Mr Ibrahim Rugova, has so far restrained them from taking up
arms. For that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, but so far the main result
has been that the world has postponed dealing with their problem, while the
Serbs in Krajina, who did take up arms, seem likely to be offered autonomy
amounting to independence in all but name. Inevitably some Albanians are
beginning to question Mr Rugova's strategy.
The US has suggested linking the lifting of sanctions on Serbia to solution
of the problems in Croatia and Kosovo, and to the handing over of war
criminals. Legally that may be difficult to sustain, and Russia can be
expected to object, since sanctions were originally imposed only to deal
with the situation in Bosnia. Politically, however, the connection is clear.
If Russia is going to make itself the guarantor of Serbia's contribution to
peace in the Balkans, it will have to interest itself in the whole range of
Serbian behaviour.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Personal View: Russia: IMF gives too little, too late
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY SACHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund last week stared into the Russian abyss and
for the first time saw the horrors. After withholding a Dollars 1.5bn loan
from the Russian reformers in the second half of 1993 on the grounds that
the budget deficit was too high, it finally freed the loan, in spite of a
vastly larger deficit today. IMF inaction in the past contributed to
Russia's gathering storm. Its action last week was a desperate move to help
head off Russia's descent into chaos.
Russian reformers are understandably nonplussed. Last year, with reformers
in the cabinet, the IMF withheld financing when the budget deficit was about
10 per cent of gross domestic product; now it lends money to a 'cabinet of
lobbies' with a deficit about 15 per cent of GDP and rising. Tax collections
appear to have dropped by at least 5 per cent of GDP so far this year. The
draft budget on which the IMF agreement is based is dubious.
And yet the IMF's move was understandable. The Russian central government
teeters on the edge of a disaster, as it no longer collects adequate
revenues needed to run the state. Tax evasion and arrears are rife;
inflation eats into the real value of tax collections; revenues collected
regionally are often not sent to central government. Under such
circumstances, the government cannot feed and house the army, or provide for
public order, much less cover social needs.
If the IMF had continued to withhold the funds, it would have amounted to
the west's abandonment of Russia's reform hopes. Prime Minister Victor
Chernomyrdin's new-found fiscal prudence, whether feigned or real, would
have been buried immediately by a political avalanche. He knew it, and
therefore courted the IMF chief, Michel Camdessus. The reformers are
furious, but their anger would be better directed at past western inaction
and poor IMF advice.
The real problem is not the IMF's action, but a much deeper malaise. The
Dollars 1.5bn means little, since it covers less than two weeks of Russia's
budget deficit. Only a much larger aid programme, with a wiser stabilisation
strategy, could do the job.
IMF incantations of budget cutting and tight monetary policy are
insufficient. Almost no stabilisation programme in history has worked the
way that the IMF recommends in Russia. Real stabilisation programmes,
whether in Israel, Bolivia, Poland, Estonia, Argentina, or the classic
stabilisation programmes of the inter-war period, start from the proposition
that a country needs a stable convertible currency as the first step towards
ending high inflation, not the last. After currency stability is achieved,
and inflation is lowered as a direct result, then cuts in the budget deficit
become politically and economically more likely.
To move first on the currency typically requires large-scale help from the
outside world to back the currency and to help finance the budget deficit,
as well as immediate relief on debt servicing. The foreign help should
surely come together with significant deficit cutting, but well before the
fundamental budgetary problems are fully resolved.
The IMF has blundered badly on these points. It delayed introduction of a
separate Russian currency in 1992. As a result, Russia was bombarded with
inflation from the other states. The IMF has argued constantly against
pegging the exchange rate until several months after inflation is ended, so
guaranteeing a vicious circle of currency depreciation and rising deficits,
not a virtuous circle of currency stability and falling budget deficits.
The IMF has failed to mobilise international assistance to help Russia fund
its budget deficit, and to back its currency. It is poignant, and ironic, to
compare Russia's shoddy treatment with the protections received by Macy's
department store in the US when both Russia and Macy's went into default in
January 1992. Macy's received an immediate standstill on all debt servicing
under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. Two weeks later, in February
1992, it received a Dollars 600m working capital loan, also under Chapter
11. The Russian government received its first working capital loan, from the
World Bank, also for Dollars 600m, nearly one-and-a-half years later] Even
debt service relief is not yet fully in place.
It is time for a serious, professional, external review of IMF operations in
Russia. More important, it is time - if it is not already too late - for
western governments to design a real support programme for Russia in return
for a real stabilisation strategy. This would surely cost closer to the
Dollars 28bn already announced, but not delivered, by the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries, than the IMF's Dollars 1.5bn. At least the
IMF's modest action gives a few more weeks to move on the more basic agenda.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Window on Whitehall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Outsiders do not understand.' This ancient cry from Authority is being
rehearsed once again. It will not do. Too much evidence of the secrecy and
manipulation inherent in British governance has already been presented to
the Scott inquiry. There is still room for argument about whether particular
individuals who have appeared before Lord Justice Scott acted in good faith,
according to rules then extant, but there is no doubt about the verdict on
the way ministers and officials sometimes go about their business. The
system is flawed. It must be put right. This outsiders do understand,
perhaps too well for Whitehall's comfort.
Lord Justice Scott was asked to investigate two charges. First, did the
government disregard its own regulations restricting the sale of
arms-related equipment to Iraq? Second, did ministers and officials deploy
public interest immunity (PII) certificates to cover their embarrassment, at
the risk of sending innocent men to prison? The inquiry's findings on these
specific points will be published in November. The report of the inquiry may
include observations on the need for systemic change, particularly in the
use of PII certificates. It is also open to Lord Justice Scott to comment on
decisions made by members of the cabinet and the civil servants who advise
them.
Overly circumspect
He will be handicapped by the nature of the defence put up by the government
and its apologists - that decisions on arms sales are necessarily political.
A balance has to be struck between the desirability of telling Parliament
when flexible rules are reinterpreted, and the interests of exporters.
Foreign policy cannot always be made in public, least of all by judges. If
PII certificates are issued, there is always a good public-interest reason.
Lord Justice Scott, trained in the law, but not proficient in politics, must
use legal arguments to clear away such obvious smokescreens.
That lies in the future. What can be said today relates to the broader
charge, implicit in the terms of reference, that Whitehall is overly
circumspect, its mandarins and ministers too ready to conceal information
that ought to be in the public domain. This is supported by the evidence
given at the public sessions of the inquiry over the past 11 months.
Fortunately, the proceedings have been unencumbered by the adversarial rules
advocated by Lord Howe. These might have lengthened the inquiry, perhaps
beyond the attention span of the electorate. Those who have been called do
have their reputations, and perhaps their careers, at stake. They have been
asked to endure something of an inquisition. This is no bad thing. Most of
them, particularly the ministers and senior civil servants, are well able to
look after themselves.
Unassailable right
Using skilful cross-examination, Lord Justice Scott and his counsel Ms
Presiley Baxendale QC, have opened a window into the workings of government.
No parliamentary select committee, no media report, and no inquiry
stultified by traditional methodology could have exposed so much. What has
been revealed is what might have been expected. The executive branch of
British government believes that it has an unassailable right to decide what
it is good for both Parliament and the wider public to know. In exercising
this self-perpetuating prerogative, it sometimes picks the truth from an a
la carte menu of its own making, and serves it with garnishes of its choice.
Most of the witnesses honestly could not see that any of this is wrong.
One element of the inquiry will ensure that the public understands what is
at stake. The machinery exported by Matrix Churchill to Iraq could be used
to make arms, but many in Whitehall knew this. Yet three directors were
hauled before the court. Mr Michael Heseltine perceived that to sign a PII
certificate might lead to a miscarriage of justice. Sir Nicholas Lyell
apparently did not.
Sir Nicholas, whose performance was uncertain, may be found to have acted
mistakenly. Mr William Waldegrave, the minister for open government, may not
remain unscathed. Both may be found blameless, but the likelihood is that,
if not them, other individuals will be named. It will be regrettable if
reputations, or jobs, are sacrificed, but the shock to Whitehall would be
salutary.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Grand designs, unsure foundations: Thirty years after the
military takeover, Brazil faces further problems as a democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Antonio Delfim Netto, one of the architects of Brazil's economic growth
in the 1964-85 period of military rule, is convinced the country is at a
turning point. 'If the (leftwing) Workers party wins October's presidential
elections, we'll become a westerly offshoot of Africa. If anyone else wins,
Brazil will have a solution to its crisis in three to four years,' he says.
His belief that there is a chance for Brazil to surmount its economic and
political difficulties would be encouraging, were it not for the fact that
he made a similar prediction five years ago, ahead of the last presidential
election. Much has happened since, including the resignation two years ago
of the 1989 victor, Mr Fernando Collor, amid corruption allegations. But the
country's main problems - such as an annual inflation rate of about 2,500
per cent, a growing gulf between rich and poor, and crumbling public
education and health systems - are still undefeated.
Today, the 30th anniversary of the military takeover, there is again
optimism that Brazil can confront its crisis. A promising anti-inflation
package - including plans for a new currency and public spending cuts - is
almost in place. A review is under way of Brazil's cumbersome 1988
constitution, which entrenched many workers' rights and benefits. That could
give the next president greater freedom to act when he takes office in
January.
But Brazil's complicated political make-up and its culture of compromise
mean progress on both the economic and political fronts is likely to be
slow. Already there are worries the inflation package will be undermined by
calls for higher spending in an election year. Cynics maintain that Brazil's
'lost decade' of economic stagnation since 1980 - blamed on two oil shocks
and the delay in returning to a democracy - is in danger of becoming a lost
decade and a half.
Some of the present problems stem from the military's seizure of power in
1964. . The takeover enjoyed widespread support at first from the middle
classes and media, which feared Brazil was becoming ungovernable under a
populist president, Mr Joao Goulart.
But the military's increasing intolerance of political opposition destroyed
that support. Moreover the economic 'miracle' of the 1970s, when the country
enjoyed some of the fastest growth rates in the world, was undermined by a
rise in foreign debt - from less than Dollars 5bn when the military took
over to more than Dollars 100bn by 1985.
The discrediting of the military regime means today's anniversary will not
be marked officially. But while the date may pass peacefully, the period's
legacy is turmoil. 'One problem with military rule is you can get left with
many hangovers,' according to Mr Luis Eduardo Magalhaes of the
right-of-centre Liberal Front party, the second largest in congress.
The biggest headache is an underdeveloped party political system. The method
of proportional representation for congressional elections has a strong
constituency link, meaning that politicians tend to be concerned with local
rather than national interests - and open to local corruption. The 20
political parties are constructed around powerful individuals rather than
ideology. Building coalitions is therefore difficult, and no president has
enjoyed a majority in congress since the return to civilian rule.
'You are forced to govern excessively through compromise, which means
problems take too long to be tackled,' according to one minister.
October's elections provide scope for change. As well as the presidential
race, elections are due for state governors, mayors and congress. A
corruption inquiry late last year, which recommended the expulsion of 18
politicians from congress, has raised hopes of improved morality among
candidates and voters.
In any case, the next president will be in a better position to form a
strong government than Mr Itamar Franco, who became president after Mr
Collor's resignation and does not have a popular mandate.
The two main presidential candidates both promise change, although their
programmes differ. Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, leader of the leftwing
Workers party (PT) and a former metalworker, is well ahead in the polls,
with 30 per cent support. The media depict his party, which campaigns for
land reform, social rights and other populist measures, as packed with
radicals. But Mr da Silva has moderated his policies, so that he would be
able to forge a coalition in congress, and has toned down pledges to stop
paying interest on foreign debts or block foreign investment.
'The apparently radical language simply expresses a feeling of protest at
Brazil's big problems. But even radicals know you have to keep attracting
foreign capital,' says Mr Francisco Weffort, political scientist and PT
supporter. Nevertheless, business leaders worry that the PT's policies will
involve increased government spending and will do nothing to curb inflation.
The other leading presidential candidate - Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso - is
a centrist politician who resigned as finance minister yesterday to prepare
for the elections. His main achievement in 10 months in office has been the
passage through congress of an anti-inflation plan, the centre-piece of
which - the new currency, the real - is intended to stabilise prices by
being linked to the country's foreign reserves.
His plan, the sixth attempt to defeat inflation in eight years, is supported
by several leading economists. But Mr Cardoso failed to persuade the
International Monetary Fund this month to grant a 'standby' loan as part of
a private bank debt restructuring agreement. The IMF thought inflation would
fall and stay low only if the government kept its pledges of a balanced
budget and tight monetary policy - difficult in an election year.
Whoever wins the presidency will inherit an economy that appears to have
weathered the inflationary crisis remarkably well. Gross domestic product
grew 4.9 per cent last year and is forecast to rise a further 3-4 per cent
in 1994. Partly as a result of economic reforms introduced by Mr Collor -
such as a privatisation programme and lower trade tariffs - the private
sector has increased productivity. Exports rose by 8 per cent to Dollars
38.8bn last year.
But these improvements continue to be dwarfed by the effects of inflation
and the uncertainty it creates. Investment as a percentage of GDP has stuck
at 15-16 per cent since 1990, compared with 27 per cent last year in Chile,
the highest rate in the continent. Inflation has exacerbated income
differentials - among the worst in the world. In 1990, the poorest half of
Brazil's population survived on just 11 per cent of national income.
Tackling such problems would take many years for any government. But Brazil
faces another obstacle: a constitution which, in effect, forces the country
to live beyond its means. It includes generous provisions on social welfare,
retirement and pensions. Within a few years, more people are expected to be
receiving benefits and pensions than will be contributing to the social
security system, unless it is changed.
The constitutional review, under way in congress since October, has so far
made little progress. Neither government nor congress appears willing to cut
benefits before the elections, or push through controversial changes to
reduce the role of the state in the economy.
'The review is fundamental for the country to be viable next year, under any
government. Unfortunately people don't realise how important it is,' says Mr
Magalhaes of the Liberal Front party.
A possible explanation for the lack of progress, which threatens Brazil's
hopes of rejoining Latin America's economic fast track and of finally
controlling inflation, is the emphasis within the political system on
compromise. For example, political leaders have worked hard to persuade
opponents of the constitutional review to take part, even offering to drop
some controversial proposals under consideration. In such a young democracy,
this may be a reaction to years of imposed decisions by the military.
Mr Fernando de Hollanda Barbosa, a Rio de Janeiro-based economist, says:
'There is something cultural about Brazil. You don't see abrupt changes,
instead things go smoothly. That's bad because, if you need change, it
doesn't come quickly. But it's good because the country remains stable. Even
our military coups were not violent.'

'We interrupt this newspaper to give you the facts,' read the full-page
advertisement emblazoned in the New York Times.
It cost Dollars 50,000; but the 100 who signed it, defending Hillary Rodham
Clinton, clearly thought it a bargain.
It was largely the handiwork of two Washington Democratic party consultants,
Ann Lewis and Lynn Cutler, First Lady friends.
They are also hitting the airwaves - where Hillary-bashing is most prevalent
 -to launch a counter-attack, fighting the hands they perceive behind the
attacks: those wanting to block healthcare reform, and those on the
ideological right who want to put women back in the non-career closet.
Otherwise, life as normal. The Wall Street Journal's leader writers continue
fulminating over Whitewater. Yesterday they examined Hillary's successful
foray into the commodities markets in 1978-79, complaining she pursued the
kind of speculative greed which characterised the 1980s.
Perhaps Hillary should have deliberately lost money in order to satisfy her
critics.

The Thai army - famous for staging 17 coups d'etat and doing well out of
logging businesses - is trying to mollify public fears of yet another
upheaval.
A senior officer has written in Thailand's Army News a piece called 'Fear no
coup'. It explains that coups are caused not by ambitious soldiers but by
the shortcomings of democracy and 'inappropriate behaviour' by politicians.
The piece adds that a typical warning sign of a coup is criticism of the
government for ineptitude by the media and academics.
Very comforting; the media have been in anti-government overdrive of late.
The Bangkok Post headlined its story on the army's views thus: 'No coup if
MPs doing good job'.
Is that over one week or three?

Will President Clinton be travelling on the royal yacht Britannia alongside
Queen Elizabeth II en route to France to join in the commemorations for the
D-Day landings in 1944 next June?
The answer is - yes and no. Says the US embassy in London: 'I can't react to
that. The president's schedule is not yet set in concrete.' All right then,
has it at least been mooted that Clinton will be on the yacht? 'Don't know.'
Buckingham Palace is equally tight-lipped, referring all queries to the
Ministry of Defence on the grounds that it's handling all D-Day media. And
the MoD won't discuss the movements of VIPs 'for security reasons'.
Never mind. Observer can reveal that while Clinton will be on the royal
yacht to review what's left of the British fleet in Portsmouth, he then
departs for France on his own nuclear aircraft carrier, the USS George
Washington.
'You know the Americans - never like to arrive on anyone else's boat,' says

Phew, thank God that's over. Except it isn't. The Scott inquiry into
arms-for-Iraq - already more than a year old - still has a week's oral
testimony in May and then must be written up by Scott himself; no finer way
of ruining a summer.
Meanwhile, hacks covering the story are producing a necktie for distribution
to various Whitehall and government officials. It will feature the Roman
numeral III, representing the guideline the government allegedly breached; a
serpent, signifying Whitehall; and the motto 'distorted, wild, prejudiced',
words used by Sir Robin Butler, head of Britain's civil service, to describe
the British media's reporting of the Scott inquiry.
Since when was a tie judged a suitably satirical device? A very masculine
gadget, its choice hints rather strongly of the old-school-tie cohabitation
so often prevailing between accusing hack and accused minister. Very cosy.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Social clause in a trade pact to
protect workers is not protectionist (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BILL MORRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Workers' rights and free trade' (March 28), dismisses
too casually the case for incorporating minimum standards for the treatment
of workers into international trade agreements.
Why, for example, should it be tolerable for a country to seek competitive
advantage by jailing trade unionists or flouting the most elementary factory
safety requirements, while it is prohibited from seeking such advantage
through discriminatory tariffs?
Indeed, the more the international community insists on a level playing
field in other areas bearing on trade, the more differences in labour costs
will become important, particularly in manufactur-ing.
Workers throughout the traditional industrial areas of the US understand
this only too well, as they see their jobs 'relocated' to Mexico, where free
trade unionism scarcely exists, working conditions are often Dickensian and
pay rates tiny compared with north of the border.
While in Morocco to sign the Gatt agreement, world leaders will be able to
observe similar conditions.
Unfair competition does not lie simply in the fact that labour costs (pay,
health and safety requirements, social spending, etc) are extremely low
compared with those prevailing in most of Europe; it is also that the state
is often acting to keep wages low, by denying workers the rights necessary
to improve their conditions and by failing to enforce even such legislation
as may be on their statute books.
That is why President Bill Clinton is right to force this issue on to the
trade agenda. If the liberalisation of the world economy is founded upon the
(often literally) broken bones of working people, it will not endure and
will end up provoking the very protectionism it seeks to avoid. There can be
no free trade without free workers.

Sir, Your editorial, 'Workers' rights and free trade' (March 28), calling
for 'broad-ranging discussion of workers' rights in the World Trade
Organisation' (the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)
is to be welcomed.
Non-governmental and civil society organisations in the third world have
long supported the call for Gatt to set up a working party on the linkages
between trade and workers' rights.
In the Uruguay Round agreement, such a working party was agreed for the
environment and it has long been a puzzle why the life of a dolphin or the
fate of a forest should be afforded more importance than the right of
children to be protected from inhuman exploitation.
The question of protectionism can be properly dealt with in such a WTO
working party made up on a tripartite basis. As unions see it, a social
clause is the opposite of protectionist as it would raise living standards
and purchasing power and increase commodity trade worldwide.
Obviously a social clause which focused on international rights of free
assembly, speech and organisation would be unwelcome to some authoritarian
third-world governments and to those multinationals which flee their social
responsibilities at home and seek out countries where human rights are
violated.
The bitter experience for many of the third world's workers is that the real
protectionism today is the protection that authoritarian governments and
multinationals have from international covenants on human rights in the
workplace.

Sir, Perhaps I could clarify and slightly expand your report, ''Crazy rules
on aid and trade . . .' (March 30), on the evidence I gave to the Commons
foreign affairs committee on aid and trade.
I cited the aid given by the German government to the Shanghai metro and the
Guangzhou metro merely as examples of the way other governments use their
large aid budgets to support industry, often in a ruthless way.
In the case of Shanghai, the UK government offered 23 per cent of the cost,
this being, in 1988, the OECD minimum. At a late stage the Germans offered
51 per cent, just 1 per cent above the level required for the offer to be
deemed bilateral and therefore not requiring advance notice.
In the case of Guangzhou, the UK government offered the then OECD minimum of
35 per cant of the cost of the rolling stock. Just before Chancellor Kohl
visited China with a large delegation of ministers and businessmen, the Bonn
government offered a 68 per cent grant, again for the rolling stock.
The British government did offer to match 68 per cent but the Chinese
decided to award the contract for the rolling stock and the rest of the
electrical and mechanical work to German industry - presumably partly to
ensure the success of the Kohl mission and because the Germans initiated
this high offer. In both cases GEC companies were well placed to win the
orders.

FT  31 MAR 94 / In peril on stormy seas: Support for the UK prime minister
is sinking, but he's not quitting yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The present storm may abate. Parliament's Easter recess offers Mr John Major
the hope of a breathing space. But still blacker clouds have gathered
already on the horizon. His premiership is in serious peril. If the ailment
is chronic rather than acute, it is no less dangerous for that.
Mr Major has been assailed before from the Tory backbenches: sterling's
ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism, the row over coal
industry closures, and the civil war over the Maastricht treaty provide only
a small sample of such occasions.
But this week it was different. The attacks came not from an embittered
group of irreconcilable Eurosceptics. Nor were they confined to the
Europhiles on the Tory left who have become increasingly agitated by Mr
Major's efforts to appease the right. This time it was the usually loyal
centre - described by one senior minister as the party's lumpen proletariat
 -that deserted their leader.
The sullen silence in the Commons chamber when he announced the compromise
over European Union voting rights offered far more eloquent testimony to the
depth of his troubles than the public attacks on Mr Major by the maverick
Tory MP, Mr Tony Marlow.
The word swirling around the bars and tearooms of Westminster was that Mr
Major had lost the confidence of his party. Conservative MPs would no longer
give him the benefit of the doubt.
Ironically it was not the substance of the deal with Britain's European
partners that dismayed the government's supporters. Many Tory MPs hardly
bothered to look at the details.
What was damning in the eyes of a demoralised and dejected party was the
perception that Mr Major had caved in - that a week after he had derided Mr
John Smith, the Labour leader, as the poodle of Brussels, he had assumed
that very role himself.
It made no difference that those who follow European affairs knew in their
hearts that, however strident Mr Major's rhetoric had been last week, he
would be forced to cut a deal with his European parters. Britain, the
champion of enlargement of the European Union, could not delay indefinitely
the entry of Austria, Sweden, Norway and Finland.
Mr Major's decision to accept the deal had the backing of 18 of the
cabinet's 22 members. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, would probably
have resigned if the cabinet had rejected it. If that had happened, Mr Major
would have had trouble surviving in office for the rest of this week.
But such awkward realities were overlooked on the backbenches. Instead the
focus was on the four cabinet ministers - Mr Michael Howard, Mr Michael
Portillo, Mr Peter Lilley and Mr John Redwood - who had urged him to hold
out for further concessions.
This time many believed that, once he had staked out an uncompromising
position, Mr Major should have stuck on the side of the men he had once
called the cabinet's 'bastards'. As one erstwhile supporter of the prime
minister commented: 'I don't give a damn about the technicalities. What I
want, what the party wants, is some leadership.'
The front pages of the Tory tabloids yesterday - mocking the prime minister
with a brutality usually reserved for leaders of the Labour party -
reinforced the message.
So the conventional wisdom among Conservative MPs is that it is no longer a
question of if Mr Major will go, but merely one of when.
That judgment may well be wrong. It has been in the past. In such febrile
times, the reflex at Westminster is to project the present into an
indefinite future. Mr Major is a more resilient man than he is given credit
for. He has told friends that panic on the backbenches or vilification in
the newspapers will not force him to fall on his sword. He will fight to
stay in 10 Downing Street.
He has other advantages. For all Mr Marlow's insistence that a leadership
challenge will be mounted in the autumn, there is no obvious candidate on
the Tory backbenches. Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
principal contenders for the succession, cannot challenge him from within
the government.
But elections loom. The local elections in May, five parliamentary
by-elections and the European Parliament poll in June will provide the most
important test of national opinion since the 1992 general election. The
opposition parties intend to make them a referendum on Mr Major's
premiership. As one cabinet minister admitted, the debacle over voting
rights has ensured that the background to the campaigns could not be worse.
If the Conservative defeats are as bad as the opinion polls predict, Mr
Major's determination may not be enough to save him. More than one
ministerial colleague has recalled recently that, only hours before she
quit, Lady Thatcher declared her intention to fight to the bitter end. If Mr
Major lost the confidence of his cabinet, he too would be forced to resign.
The name of the 61-year-old Mr Heseltine, written off after his heart attack
less than a year ago, is suddenly on everyone's lips. Encouraged by his
Gaullist rhetoric, the Tory right has made the mistake of believing the
president of the board of trade has ditched his fervent Europeanism.
Even those who swore they would never forgive him for toppling Lady Thatcher
are beginning to view Mr Heseltine in a different light. As one
middle-ranking minister put it: 'I would never trust him, but at least he
would give us a fighting chance of winning the election.'
Mr Clarke's star has waned in recent weeks. His-less-than-adroit handling of
the row with opposition parties over impending tax increases has removed
some of the lustre. His robust attitude to Brussels has not persuaded the
party's sceptics that he has joined the ranks of nationalists. But Mr Clarke
remains the champion of the mainstream Tory centre-left. If there is a
contest, he will be a hard man to beat.
There is much more, though, to all this than Mr Major's style of leadership.
Those few Conservatives - including a handful in the cabinet - who are
willing to think more deeply about the present crisis are gripped by
foreboding.
The fault-line in the party over Europe is much deeper than many of them
realised even a year ago during the parliamentary battle over the Maastricht
treaty.
The sceptics are not in the majority - far from it. But there is now a
destructive minority which clings to the belief that the past 30 years of
Conservative history has been a disastrous aberration - that the party
should never have become the champion of the European cause.
They would be happy to see the government lose the next general election -
and then to be reborn in opposition as the party of nationalism, under the
leadership of Mr Portillo. It is a vainglorious dream.
Mr Hurd demolished the argument in a speech last week, setting out in stark
terms the economic and security realities binding Britain to a European
future. But the Europhobes are beyond such reason.
There are other factors dogging Mr Major. The prime minister lacks the
constancy born of deep-rooted political convictions. He too often confuses
tactics with high principle. His party bears the burden of 15 years in
office and has lost the habit of loyalty.
But Europe looks once again like an anvil on which the modern Conservative
party will break itself. Day by day it seems more likely that Mr Major will
be the first victim. He might yet survive - it is still possible to find one
or two willing to put serious money on his prospects. But in any event his
departure would not solve his party's problems.
The present mood was caught by a Tory MP who remarked that he was rereading
a book familiar to every student of modern British history - Mr George
Dangerfield's account of The Strange Death of Liberal England. Contemplating
the self-destruction of his own party, the MP shrugged his shoulders as he
explained: 'I want to know what it is like.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN W HAWKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr A W Behrens (Letters, March 28) quite rightly points out the way in
which charities have been disadvantaged by the payment of the BAT Industries
1993 final dividend as a foreign income dividend.
Charities' interests have likewise been ignored in the proposed exchange of
BICC's 10 3/4 per cent convertible capital bonds for convertible preference
shares.
It is surely time that a body was formed to speak with authority on
investment matters on behalf of all charities, perhaps along the lines of
the Investment Protection Committee of the National Association of Pension
Funds. Without a unified voice, charity trustees will continue to suffer the
penalties of being inadequately represented.

<TEXT>
Sir, My corporation is constructing a British/Irish style pub in the Napa
Valley, California.
To this end, on February 3 I wrote to the chief executives of what were
identified as the 56 largest brewers in the UK. I inquired whether, first,
they had an interior of a pub they had closed which we could purchase and,
second, if they did have one what was the name of their distributor in
northern California.
To date, I have had one reply, with not even the courtesy of a response from
any of the others.
If this is indicative of the get-up-and-go which British industry has at
present then I feel sympathy for the shareholders and employees who rely on
these chief executives.

HONG KONG MEMOIRS
Xu Jiatun
United Daily News Press, Taipei, 1993 (in Chinese) 2 vols
Four years ago, Xu Jiatun, a member of the central committee of the Chinese
Communist party, bade farewell to his family in Shenzhen, across the border
from Hong Kong, and slipped into the colony. Three days later he was in Los
Angeles.
Xu was one of the top 300 or so people ruling more than 1bn Chinese people.
Now living in a Buddhist monastery, he is the most senior member of the
Chinese Communist party ever to defect to the west.
The significance of his memoirs is thus considerable. They give the first
insider's account of its workings that has not been filtered through
Beijing's thought police. For students of the Chinese Communist party, the
memoirs give a unique insight into the workings of the party at the highest
level; for those interested in how the party set about laying the
foundations of its rule over Hong Kong, when UK sovereignty expires in 1997,
they are essential reading.
As head of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Group - Beijing's title for the
group of the most senior Communist party members in Hong Kong - Xu was
China's top man in the colony. He was an experienced party man; immediately
before Hong Kong, in mid-1983, he was Communist party chief in Jiangsu
province.
In Hong Kong, however, he faced a more challenging time; he had been
instructed by Beijing to reform the New China News Agency, a cover for the
Chinese Communist party's organisation in the colony, which was regarded as
remote from, and was widely distrusted by, the Hong Kong Chinese. Beijing
recognised a need to improve its image in the eyes of the local population.
Senior staff at the agency were also hostile to Xu's appointment; at the
time, the agency was run by a hardline southern Chinese clique which
resented the appointment of a northern Chinese official. Xu's immediate
predecessor, a Maoist of the old school, had opposed the creation of
'special economic zones' which he argued (rightly) were anathema to
communism.
Xu decided on a two-pronged reform plan for the agency: an internal shake-up
and a campaign to rehabilitate its public image, and thereby that of
Beijing.
Before he arrived in Hong Kong, the local Communist party had been organised
into two 'cells', local supporters and mainland diplomats and businessmen
sent by Beijing. By merging the two wings, Xu increased his control over the
organisation.
But his most important work - and enduring legacy - was his effort in
creating the 'United Front', a coalition forged among the elite in Hong Kong
who could be relied on to support China. The United Front's significance is
not only that it created the appearance of support for the party across a
broad section of society; it also ensnared people in an active relationship
with Beijing.
Sensing the deep-seated anti-communism in Hong Kong at the time, Xu decided
to 'put aside everything about ideology'. Most of Hong Kong's population
were refugees from the mainland; the inflow had been particularly strong at
the time of the Cultural Revolution.
Xu describes his guiding principle in the following terms: 'On the love of
China, support for Deng Xiaoping's reform and open policy, and national
reunification we share a common view. On criticism of Mao Zedong and the
Communist party we can accommodate our differences.'
Xu soon made himself the acceptable face of Chinese communism. That helped
in the important task of co-opting Hong Kong's businessmen, which had been
high on Xu's agenda when he arrived in the colony. He quickly found the
measure of the colony's capitalist class, writing: 'I perceived, shortly
after my arrival in Hong Kong, that a businessman's political inclination is
normally linked to (the fortune of) his business.'
An early example of this was the bail-out of the Bank of East Asia, one of
Hong Kong's leading Chinese banks. In 1983 the bank not only faced a split
among its founders, but Societe Generale, a French bank, was seeking to take
it over. Xu relates how Mr David Li Kwok-po, the chief executive of the
bank, approached the agency for help. After deliberation, 'we decided to
stand behind the bank', Xu writes.
The United Front's political use of the Bank of China, and other large
Chinese-owned companies, stands out as one of the chief ways in which the
Communist party sought to strengthen its influence over Hong Kong's business
community. Xu's work is one of the main reasons why business leaders now
line up behind China in its fight with the UK over Hong Kong's democratic
development.
In late 1989 - a few months after the Tiananmen Square massacre - Xu retired
as director of the New China News Agency and moved to Shenzhen in southern
China. He had tried to convince Beijing to take a softer line towards the
demonstrators; he recalls in the book how he travelled to the Chinese
capital to petition the party leadership. He took as evidence video tapes of
Hong Kong TV coverage of the demonstrations to try to convince the leaders
that the protests taking place on their doorstep had been patriotic, not
subversive. In Beijing, he met Zhao Ziyang, the then head of the Communist
party.
After Tiananmen, realising the bad favour in which he was held in Beijing,
Xu retired voluntarily. But when his successor launched an inquiry into his
activities at the time of Tiananmen, Xu decided to leave the country. He
believed he had done nothing wrong, but felt he would not get a fair
hearing. How he fled, however, is unclear: the presumption is that the US
helped him.
So far, Xu's memoirs are available only in Chinese, although the Hong Kong
government has made an unofficial translation. A proper edition, with an
index and notes, would be an invaluable insight into how Beijing set about
the task of returning Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Arts: Frank Andersen's Jubilee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They do these things wonderfully well in Copenhagen. The ballet matters a
great deal; dancers and choreographers are public figures - a postage stamp
bore the portrait of the great Danish ballerina Margrethe Schanne - and the
fortunes of the Royal Danish Ballet are of national concern.
Frank Andersen has directed the company for the past nine years - he will
retire this summer - and this year celebrates his silver jubilee as a member
of the Ballet. So, on Saturday night, there was a gala to mark his 25 years
of service, and an occasion to thank him for his achievement as director.
It was a splendid occasion, with that mixture of formality and happy ease
which is one of the joys of the Royal Theatre. Queen Margrethe was in the
Royal Box, a reminder of vital patronage - she has provided admirable design
for that most national of Bournonville's works, A Folk Tale - and the
audience knew it was there for a family celebration. There was nothing too
serious, some nice jokes, wonderful dancing, and a merry determination to
get everyone possible on stage somehow or other.
Thus the last act of the company's new Sleeping Beauty showed us roles being
shared, sometimes in mid-variation. There were two pairs of Bluebirds - with
Alexander Kolpin and Thomas Lund very buoyant - three Auroras and three
Princes, so that Yury Posokhov and Lloyd Riggins played catch-as-catch-can
in the Prince's solo and were tremendous.
It is one of the strengths of the Royal Danes that a career will start in
childhood - peering and cheering from the bridge in the last act of Napoli -
and continue well into autumnal years with rewarding character roles that
include Napoli's lemonade and macaroni sellers. So the children of the
ballet school came to salute Andersen (who is, officially, Royal Ballet
Master) and danced featly to the adorable rattle of the Polka Militaire,
which was composed for Bournonville in 1842.
Then we moved into the gala sweetmeats. There was new Danish choreography
with part of Anna Laerkesen's Whispers and Floating; John Neumeier's
Adagietto from Mahler 5 for Mette Ida Kirk and Yury Posokhov; Nina
Ananiashvili and Julio Bocca flashing through Don Quixote's flaming paper
hoops; Elisabeth Platel and Manuel Legris in Balanchine's delicate, allusive
response to Ravel's Sonatine - exquisite, subtle, both in ideas and
performance.
And of course, to finish with, came the crack of muskets, tambourines, and
the flash of Bournonville steps in the last act of Napoli. This is, because
of Bournonville's love of the theatre, his moral dignity, his belief in the
joyous nature of dancing, his power to capture the life of his time,
quintessentially Danish - not least in its response to southern light.
There were the ballet children on the bridge, and such eminent artists as
Niels Kehlet sitting at the cafe tables. There were the buoyant lines of
male dancers - young Johan Kobborg bounding through a solo like the spirit
of Bournonville - and the bewitching legion of the girls. And there, as the
hero, Gennaro, was Frank Andersen, still nifty as to step (he is, after all,
only 41 years old) and leading his entire company in these ever-fresh,
eternally sparkling ensembles.
We clapped and cheered. The children on the bridge waved and shouted. The
dancers cheered. Andersen, with the sincerity and charm that has marked his
dancing and his direction of the troupe, took his bows and the presents
brought on for him, and his laurels, saluted his monarch, and was rightly
moved near to tears. The applause went on for ever.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Arts: New York Met's Otello - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Met production of Otello will not seem so very new to anyone
familiar with Covent Garden's present staging. Once the company had decided
to abandon a projected version by John Schlesinger, on the grounds that
William Dudley's set would have been too complex for repertory exposure, it
went to the Royal Opera team of Elijah Moshinsky as director and Michael
Yeargan as set designer.
The result, while not quite a remake of the London production, has many of
the same features, including especially the feel of Venetian painting:
immense neoclassical columns that make the stage look like one of
Carpaccio's spacious vistas, and a Titianesque sumptuousness of colour and
texture in the costumes (by Peter J. Hall). When the Venetian ambassadors
arrive, they do so as a strong forward wave of crimson brocade and fur,
shamelessly spectacular.
Shamelessness and spectacle carry the weight of the production elsewhere
too. Mr Moshinsky's handling of the crowd scenes is extravagantly busy and
brilliantly managed: the slicing apart of the curtains at the beginning
reveals a proscenium at once filled with activity in an exhilarating
chiaroscuro, going up to a top level of soldiers and cannons.
Quite what kind of structure is being represented here is unclear, just as
the architectural purpose of the grand columns is never fully explicit. The
function of the sets is not to portray a city but to provide sufficient
space and splendour for action, or contrariwise for the effective stillness,
emptiness and isolation of the more intimate scenes. Otello and Desdemona
are often pinned against the base of one or other of the pillars; the
lighting examines them mercilessly. Only Iago has the freedom to wander and
lean.
The reason for this production was to salute Placido Domingo on the silver
anniversary of his first Met appearance, and his performance in the title
role is all the more fascinating for its edge of frustration. The ring of
brightness which we hear, for instance, at his first appearance does not
come easily to him now - it has to be striven for.
In his solo after the eavesdropping scene he gives up the striving, and the
voice becomes bleak, grim, heavily baritonal: the raw grain of the wood,
without the polish. At other points the sense of strain can be either
intense or exquisitely uncomfortable, but always it is just to the
expressive moment.
The command holds, magnificently. And if we begin to notice the cost, it is
not as vocal deficiency but as the cost exacted by the score on the wretched
victim it makes its chief character.
It also suits the piece that the Iago, Sergei Leiferkus, should be
effortlessly in control of his vocal equipment. His gentlemanly correctness
begins by seeming perhaps even too finely modulated: evil, one may feel,
ought to spit more, be more scarred. But this Iago is not evil, except in
being the supreme manager. What delights him is regulation, efficiency, the
ability to manipulate scenes and emotions. The 'Credo', in which Mr
Leiferkus does bare his tone and show us some vocal fangs, seems an act.
Carol Vaness's Desdemona is a less natural piece of casting. She is a
mettlesome stage personality, and here she gives the appearance of a
precarious restraint: left to herself she would surely be clouting Otello
back. Nor is it just a matter of physical behaviour, for there is an evident
carefulness too in her singing. She can produce beautiful sequences of
rounded, gleaming melody in the middle-high register, soft and yet carrying;
but the notes have to be held in place and warily balanced. It is a near
miracle that they almost always are so, but one cannot quite believe in the
purity, and without purity Desdemona has little going for her.
The other parts are paltry in this cruel opera, and they are adequately
done.
The conducting, on the other hand, is far more than adequate. Valery
Gergiev, normally associated with Russian repertory, proves he can be just
as passionate about Verdi, and there are moments, notably the close of the
third act, when the passion he encourages in the orchestra threatens to
drown out even a stage full of voices. And so the orchestra, in its display,
equals what we see on stage.

BACKBEAT (15) Iain Softley
KALIFORNIA (18) Dominic Sena
THE SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA (U) Tran Anh Hung
BELLE EPOQUE (15) Fernando Trueba
Some films seem created entirely out of 'almosts'. Consider Backbeat. Stuart
Sutcliffe was famous - or almost - as The Beatle who never was - or almost
never. Ian Softley's lithe, evocative but in the end maddeningly
inconsequential film recreates the Fab Four's formative visit to Hamburg in
1960 when they were the Fab Five.
Sutcliffe, played accent-perfect by American Steven Dorff, was the bass
player destined to be left behind in Germany. For as well as getting up the
nose of Paul McCartney as a musical performer, Sutcliffe fell in love with
photographer Astrid Kirchherr, played by another American Sheryl Lee.
Sutcliffe had a rival career as an almost-famous painter of Jackson
Pollock-ish abstracts. And to complete the misfit-genius credentials, he had
a doomed kismet as a man who would die young: in April 1962, from a brain
haemorrhage.
Many ingredients, many flavours, but . . . what are they meant to add up to?
Softley begins promisingly, with an Olympian crane shot that descends into
1960 Liverpool like a visiting god of hindsight seeking vital clues. Soon
the famous ones are picked out from the Swinging Britain identity parade -
John the witty, deadpan drawler (Ian Hart, looking and sounding startlingly
like David Thewlis in Naked), Paul the one with vertical lift-off eyebrows
(Gary Bakewell), George the scowly-handsome one hanging back from the
limelight (Chris O'Neill). And Ringo? Ah, he is just a fella dropping by in
Hamburg, because as all Beatlologists know Pete Best was Mr Percussion at
that time.
Interesting themes are picked up, looked at and then put back, as if by a
high street shopper dazed with indecision. Was John Lennon bisexual? (Astrid
thinks he fancies Stuart and there is much ambivalent banter between the two
lads about sharing a Reeperbahn bunk bed). Was Paul or John really running
the show? And did Astrid's former boyfriend Klaus, who went on to design the
lads' Revolver album, also influence their mophead hairstyles?
The film starts to tackle each of these questions; then it doesn't. Perhaps
everyone thought it was enough for the Anglo-American market - and you see
the ocean-straddling mentality in the two American leads and the
easy-to-digest view of British cultural history - that the larky legends
should just get up there on screen, strum their stuff for immortality and
the tie-in album, and leave a few interesting bodies in their career wake.
* Kalifornia gives us another, not-so-fab foursome adrift in wonderland.
Imagine that you are an aspiring writer (David Duchovny) contemplating a
book on serial killers. You wish to visit famous murder spots across
America. But you and your photographer girlfriend (Michelle Forbes) need a
ride-sharer to co-fund the trip. So you pick up this ragged, bearded
Antichrist figure (Brad Pitt) with his deeply dippy girlfriend (Juliette
Lewis). And what should he turn out to be? Yes: a serial killer.
Just imagine all those Hollywood producers yelling 'High-concept]' at this
idea. Soon the American dreamscape is crackling with menace, as the car
rumbles from one famous killing ground to another and Mr Pitt's character,
named 'EarlyGrayce' for symbolism addicts, graduates from petty theft to
mild brutality to murder. Duchovny and Forbes should have noticed the Early
warning signs. This man picks his toes through the holes in his socks; whips
his girlfriend in the privacy of his own motel room; and has a Southern
accent that sounds as it was bought at an Actor's Studio Halloween sale.
Writer Tim Metcalfe and director Dominic Sena so load the journey with
menace and inevitability that there is no room left in the boot for humanity
or serendipity. Even the laughs the film extracts from Early's backwoods
philosophising - 'People think quicker out there (California) 'cos of all
that warm weather]' - are too arch and programmed. And when we come to the
film's own final message, to the effect that Duchovny and Forbes's
pseudo-scholastic prurience is bloodbrother to Early's enacted viciousness,
we hear the sound of Hollywood itself dressing up blood-and-thunder in the
robes of moral enlightenment.
* The Scent Of Green Papaya won its Vietnamese writer-director Tran Anh Hung
the Camera D'Or - or best first film prize - at last year's Cannes festival.
Set in 1950s Saigon, for controlled beauty of imagery it should leave every
other movie this year standing.
It is meant to be about a young country girl Mui (Tran Nu Yen-Khe), drawn
into the timeless trap of female servitude as she ministers to a
middle-class family. It is more about the film-maker's lyrical eye, drawn
into the timeless trap of reckless beautification. The camera glides over
floors, across latticework screens, through palm fronds, even into the eye
of a steaming, sizzling wok. Or we linger on a row of towels or pair of
slippers, bathed in the silvery musk of night.
The announced theme of female oppression barely gets a look in. And if it
did, how could we believe that living in this ocular paradise is oppressive?
Even when the local urchin turns up to break wind or to pee into the
priceless vases, we admire the balletic way he does it. And when we
fast-forward a decade to glimpse Mui in conjugal bliss with one of the sons,
we know that the film has given up all pretence at social-domestic realism.
This is a masterpiece of sort. One just wonders if it is the masterpiece
Tran Anh Hung intended. We are led by the maker's own dicta to expect a
feminist fable gritted with everyday truths. We get something that at worst
resembles a Vogue magazine 'Vietnam edition' - ravishing to the senses, full
of l'exotique voile - and at best announces a director whose visual sense
may soon outleap not just his material but many of his modern rivals.
Green Papaya should have won last week's Best Foreign Film Oscar. Instead
Spain's Belle Epoque beat it to the bronze doorstopper. But then think of
those poor academicians: force-fed with homegrown movies for the whole of
March and then faced in the arthouse category with a choice between
opiate-imaged Eastern minimalism and this raunchy, simple romp - a sort of
Iberian Tom Jones - about a handsome servant boy (Jorge Sanz) bedding all
four daughters of his mangy, goodhearted employer (Fernando Fernan Gomez).
Director Fernando Trueba probably intended a fable about the timeless trap
of servitude. If so he forgot about it at the first shout of 'Action'. There
ensues much rumpy-pumpy, much giggling in the servants' quarters, and much
juggling with goldlens-filters by cameraman Jose-Luis Alcaine, as if trying
to impart distinction to this long and stubbornly lightweight shagging-dog
story.

<TEXT>
For the first time, I am in love.' Helen Mirren, playing Natalia Petrovna,
wife and mother caught between youth and middle age, is alone onstage. She
has fallen for Beliaev, her son's tutor, and she speaks these lines in a
daze of wondering gratitude, and through a mist of tears. In the next second
she turns brisk, her voice hardens, she adds 'He's got to go' - and the
whole theatre bursts into laughter.
With this split-second change of tone Mirren catches the self-contradictory
essence of Natalia Petrovna, the heroine of Turgenev's only play; and in
this extended scene alone, full of such sudden contrasts, she shows many
more facets of this one woman. Amid a comedy of conflicting desires, Natalia
is forever dramatising herself. This makes her touching and absurd. And yet,
like a Marivaux heroine, she also manipulates the lives of people in her
power, more or less heartlessly. Mirren shows all this, and with absolutely
no grande dame airs or bids for our sympathy.
Wonderful to have Mirren in the West End again, and to watch her in a role
worthy of her calibre. (Her only serious miscalculation is a dragged-out
final exit, and a light dismissal of her long-trusted admirer Rakitin that
is even lighter than Turgenev can have intended.) The great risk she takes
is to emphasise Natalia's self-dramatising capriciousness even more than her
sincerity. We believe that she has fallen for young Beliaev; but not always.
When she says 'He's a real man,' we laugh; but we do not believe that she
means it so much as the dramatic scene she is acting in her own head. In her
big Act IV scene with him, she exposes her heart to him with beautiful
simplicity, tells him to go - and then says 'Well, why aren't you going?' so
sharply that we wonder how artless the previous speech really was. In short,
we never quite know this Natalia; and that is her fascination.
It is her fascination in particular for Rakitin, who is splendidly played by
John Hurt. His lined face, practising hard to play WH Auden, is too old for
the role (30 years of age, says Turgenev) but his spirit is Rakitin's to
perfection. He watches Natalia rush off in Act II, and exclaims 'What
vivacity]' so coolly that it sums up his impotent, sardonic character in a
trice. Finally in Act V he warns Beliaev of the perils of total love, of
'how much torrid hatred lies behind love . . . and what it means to belong
to a skirt'. Eighteen years ago in the same theatre, this speech was a
high-water mark of Derek Jacobi's art. Jacobi spoke it with scorching
bitterness; Hurt brings to it a vehemence that becomes so violent and
red-faced that - very strikingly - he has to stop. He is suddenly
embarrassed, and shrugs off his tirade as if it had no meaning.
For Turgenev, Rakitin was something of a self-portrait for Turgenev; and the
character's relationship with Natalia is something of a preparation for
Trigorin and Arkadina in Chekhov's The Seagull.
The director is Bill Bryden. He shows how Russian A Month in the Country is
in the way its wealth of detail brings a whole milieu to life: the
mother-in-law's painful feet, the companion who takes snuff, the nonsense
words coined by the rich, dull, old neighbour. It is Shpigelsky, the doctor,
who epitomises all this darling trivia, and who observes Natalia's household
cannily. John Standing brings this role an ideal quality of wry relaxation;
then suddenly at the end adds an astonishing dash of bitter Russian ennui.
Polly Adams, as his no longer young intended, performs with wit - and with
rather more charm than this frowsty spinster warrants.
Joseph Fiennes brings the youthful, bashful, handsome Beliaev utterly to
life; and as Vera - Natalia's ward, who also falls for him - Anna Livia Ryan
catches very keenly the heartbreak and hardness of adolescence, and its
rapid fluctuations between childishness and adulthood. As Natalia's husband
Gawn Grainger misfires on several counts - too sensitive a type to be so
blind to Natalia's real feelings, too urbane to be so thunderstruck. The
production does not consistently catch Turgenev's beating heart, but it is
fully alive to his endless ironies and touching surprises.
At the Albery Theatre, WC2.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Arts: A sadly misconceived Sylvia - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I reported on David Bintley's Sylvia last October, when Birmingham Royal
Ballet first exposed us to it on their native heath. I cannot but feel that
it would have been better to expose it on a hillside at birth. For it is,
alas, a monster, a 24 carat, copper-bottomed, fully-guaranteed brute, which
I find misconceived, misbegotten, and a miserable indictment of artistic
taste and policy.
Delibes' score is one of the greatest ever made for dancing, unfailingly
mellifluous, grand, witty. (And Ashton's realisation of it in 1952, when he
was at the height of his powers, ideally matched the music's beauties, as
did the design by the Ironside brothers. That version, of course, has long
been abandoned by our national ballet). The story of the nymph Sylvia and
her love for the ninny-ish Aminta is no great shakes, but it appealed to the
academic taste of the 1880s, which delighted in such classic nostalgia, be
it in the music of Saint-Saens or the canvases of Bouguereau. Bintley
mistrusts the tale, and its implicit style, and has sought by an inept
up-dating - which mingles classic myth with a dinner-jacketed hero arriving
in a Bugatti - to make it seem more apt. In fact, his revisions, the
conflicts between modern dress and antique manners - Eros shown as an old
buffer in natty summer suiting; Orion, the villain, moving from rags to
evening dress - fatally undermine any charm the narrative might have had.
His Sylvia has less dramatic cogency than the original.
All this camping about with a classic past would be less tiresome were there
compensations of step or design. What can bring on a flux of rage is the
cussed, ungrateful choreography Bintley has made - his customary facility
and felicity of means rarely apparent - and the awfulness of Sue Blane's
design. A quasi-permanent set encroaches crudely on the stage (the dance
looks cramped) and is seemingly made from giant crumplings of elephant-grey
linoleum. An outburst of candles in Orion's grotto suggests we are in a
maniac Lourdes (replete with pier glass, chair and sarcophagus bar). The
last act is a muddle of antique columns as unlikely and rickety as the
choreography's academism. Costuming ranges from the dull to the desperate -
Aminta's last act rig includes a jerkin made from what I take to be ruched
loo-paper: it makes him look like Quasimodo intent on a white wedding.
I have no patience with the piece, which I have seen three times. The BRB
artists appear seriously undermined as classic dancers, their style
optimistically busy and distinctly fuzzy round the edges. Nothing they do
seems clear, true. At Monday's performance, which opened this short Opera
House season, Miyako Yoshida repeated her pretty but recessive
interpretation of Sylvia, with Kevin O'Hare as the dimmest of heros. On the
next evening, Sandra Madgwick made much more of Sylvia - dance and character
came into focus, bright in temperament, fleet in step - and Sergiu
Pobereznik showed that Aminta was something more than the wimp he had been
the night before. He has a fluent technique which deserves better. I report
with continuing disbelief that, in the third act, Eros appears as a
one-legged Pirate, a rat tacked to the back of his coat, spinning on his
peg-leg, and reducing part of the audience to hysterics. The ballet reduced
me to a state of ferocious depression. Sylvia is wholly unworthy of a
national ensemble.
Birmingham Royal Ballet appears at Covent Garden with varied programmes
until 8 April.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Arts: Canterbury Tales - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the true Chaucer tradition, Michael Bogdanov's version of The Canterbury
Tales is full of good clean dirty jokes. There is bawdy all over the place:
some of it comes from the original, some of it has been added, but none of
it is likely to offend. This is pantomime in the spring.
True, Bogdanov has gone for the more licentious tales. There is very little
chivalry or courtly love. The knight does not get much of a look in. Yet
this is as it should be, for the pilgrims as a whole were a bawdy lot with,
incidentally, a good deal of sexual equality.
Bogdanov has also changed the framework. Instead of a prologue introducing
the characters, there is a vicar hosting a competition for which tale can be
best acted. The pretext is supposed to be the 650th anniversary of Chaucer's
birth, but since the Bogdanov version has been around for some years and
even the year of the birth (circa 1340) is uncertain, that is a detail.
There is a very jolly vicar played by Nicholas Lumley. He resists the
temptation to be over-camp: rightly, because there are plenty of escapades
going on around him without an extra dimension. But he rigs the competition
by trying to exclude The Miller's Tale on the grounds that it is not
suitable for family viewing.
Yet there are limits to how the rigging can go. Wonderfully played by Brian
Glover, who began his career as a professional wrestler, the miller is there
in the audience even before the piece begins. He is up on stage telling blue
jokes (some of them very funny, like the one about the normal, dyslexic and
nymphomaniac hens) whenever the vicar turns his back. In short, the miller
has the audience in his hands and, of course, his tale is told in the end by
popular demand.
The doggerel in which the tales are related palls occasionally, but there is
always the competition - and the splendid vicar - to return to. Audience
participation abounds; if anything it is underdone - a Richmond audience, so
close to Twickenham, would have liked a longer go at joining in Swing low,
sweet chariot.
Richmond Theatre until Saturday. Marlowe Theatre, Canterbury from April 11.

Last week's episode of Murder Most Horrid, about a cunning grandmother who
outwits her scheming daughter and son-in-law every time they try to bump her
off, was the weakest so far, but this second series has been so much better
than the first that that is not saying much. In today's story Dawn French
plays travel and cookery writer Verity Hodge who moves to a little French
village to hype all things French, bullying the villagers into creating the
image she sells so successfully in her book (9.00 BBC2).
After Episode 1, BBC1's new detective series, Grushko, shot in St
Petersburg, could go either way. If the scripts sustain the interest in the
problems of Russia, and move away from the cliches and stereotypes, all
could be well. If not, this will be written off as just another crime
series, shot on exotic locations to take advantage of financial enticements
(9.30 BBC1).

<TEXT>
Worthiness and chunkiness mark the Good Friday schedules. This afternoon
BBC2 screens Jonathan Miller's production of one of the greatest pieces of
music ever created: Bach's St Matthew Passion. It lasts 2 hours 40 minutes
(4.45).
Among the blockbuster movies the one shown least often before is
Bertolucci's The Last Emperor which was shot in Peking's Forbidden City,
lasts three hours, and won nine Oscars. To its credit ITV is showing it
uncensored, which means odds and ends of sex and violence (10.20).
Though a moderate admirer of Patrick Malahide I find The Inspector Alleyn
Mysteries among the least appealling of television's classic English
detective adaptations. Today's story is 'Dead Water' (9.00 BBC1). I shall,
however, try to watch the one-hour special Penn And Teller: Don't Try This
At Home. Although it repeats material from the recent series by these two
American conjurors, it was so bizarre, naughty and funny that it will reward
a second look (10.30 C4).

FT  31 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cossetting turns a
journey into a voyage - How BR's cross country service is seeking more
long-distance travellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail's promotion of its high-speed InterCity links has been highly
successful. It faces a harder task 'selling' the attractions of its slower,
cross-country services.
One initiative which seems to be working, though, is BR's new Voyager
service for the long-distance traveller, which uses a marketing approach
likely to be more widely adopted when parts of the state-controlled rail
network are franchised out to the private sector.
The problem on many of BR's longer routes is appealing to distinct types of
customer - short journey commuters, 'long haul' businessmen, and
holidaymakers. The daytime Cornishman, for example, which takes nearly 12
hours to cover the 689 miles from Dundee to Penzance, starts as a commuter
train around Dundee and then carries business travellers between Edinburgh
and York, and Birmingham and Bristol. From Bristol west to its final
destination, commuters and leisure travellers again predominate.
The challenge for BR has been to persuade more travellers to take the train
for its entire journey or at least a substantial part of it.
InterCity Cross Country not only has to overcome travellers' reluctance to
use the train. It also faces stiff competition from express coaches, which
now account for nearly 15 per cent of leisure travel between Scotland and
the south-west of England, a similar percentage to that taken by rail. The
airlines have a one per cent market share with the rest accounted for by the
private car.
InterCity talked to people who had not used a train for at least 10 years,
asking their views on ticket prices, standards of buffet service and
overcrowding. Many were quite nervous about making a long journey; they were
unsettled by the comings and goings of the short-distance travellers and
concerned about leaving their seat and their luggage to go for refreshments.
'People wanted more than a seat on a train,' says Alison Morris, marketing
development manager for InterCity Cross Country services. 'We had to devise
a service which matched the cossetting which the coaches and the airlines
give their passengers.'
Intercity Cross Country's response was to launch its Voyager service.
Tickets must be bought by noon on the day before travelling and this
automatically reserves a seat in a specially designated carriage from which
other travellers are barred.
A steward or stewardess is allocated to the Voyager carriage for the entire
journey; two hot meals and regular tea and coffee are provided at the
traveller's seat as part of the price.
This additional level of service has proved popular with the elderly
travellers who make up the bulk of the leisure market between Scotland and
the south-west. Many are women travelling alone to visit relatives. Before
the Voyager service was launched last May, 50 people per train in summer
were making the entire journey and just under 40 in winter.
A recent survey showed that 23 per cent of travellers said they would not
have taken the train but for Voyager. From this it forecasts about 600 extra
passengers in its first year. This is not a large addition to the numbers
already travelling but Cross Country believes the service will attract more
as it becomes better known. Ninety-six per cent of travellers said they were
satisfied with the service.
InterCity Cross Country recently extended the service to cover journeys
starting from the north-east of England to the south-west and is thinking of
introducing it on its routes from Scotland to south coast resorts such as
Poole and Brighton.
When Cross Country, like BR's other subsidiaries, is franchised out to the
private sector, innovative marketing is one tool which many BR managers
intent on buy-outs plan to employ.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Light touch in
battle for brands - A free speech issue, a clever marketing ploy or an
unfair promotional device? Diane Summers looks at EU plans to liberalise
comparative advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two chimps are locked up by scientists: one is given Coca-Cola to drink,
while the other gets Pepsi. After six weeks, the Coke chimp can hammer pegs
into holes and the scientists note his 'remarkable improvement in motor
skills'.
The Pepsi chimp, meanwhile, has gone missing and is later discovered driving
a Jeep full of young women along the beach into the sunset, to the
accompaniment of rock music.
This Pepsi television advertisement - one of a series that seeks to
differentiate the drink from the brand leader by giving it, in Pepsi's
words, a 'hip and irreverent' image - was unveiled to a US audience of 130m
viewers during a break in the Super Bowl football championship in January.
The advertisement made it clear that Pepsi was being compared to Coke and
both drink cans were displayed.
But when it came to showing the advertisement around the world, further
versions had to be made, referring coyly to Coke as Brand X 'leading cola'
or, even more elliptically, as Brand X 'leading soft drink'. Comparative
advertising, which makes direct comparisons with a competitor's product, is
a common and long-standing practice in the US, but is either restricted or
banned in a number of other countries.
In Germany, for example, all comparisons are seen as unfair competition  -
the slogan 'Avis, we try harder' was not allowed because it was seen as
implicating fellow car-rental business Hertz, even though the rival name was
not mentioned.
Pepsi sees comparative advertising as a free speech issue, as well it might,
since it is the number two brand. The convention is that the brand leader
never stoops to the tactic. Alan Pottasch, a senior executive in charge of
worldwide advertising for Pepsi-Cola International, says: 'As the world
moves irrevocably towards free and open markets, we think it's high time
that comparative advertising becomes an acceptable way to communicate the
concept of choice to consumers everywhere. That's what we believe is at
stake here.'
Coca-Cola's response - attempting to get the chimps advertisement and other
Pepsi comparative commercials taken off the air in some countries  - is, in
effect, stoking the 'cola wars'. It has been suggested that the cola
conflict appears manufactured and is in the interests of both brands - and
that both Coke and Pepsi sales increase when their battle is being publicly
fought.
Even if it is a marketing ploy, Pepsi is not alone in wanting comparative
advertising laws liberalised. In the UK, the government is using a bill on
trademarks, currently being considered by parliament, as an opportunity to
clear the way for comparative advertising.
There is no absolute ban on the practice in the UK and there have been some
famous examples, including Qualcast and Flymo lawnmowers, Duracell and
Eveready batteries, St Ivel Gold and Flora spreads and, most recently, The
Sun and Mirror newspapers. The latter has appeared mainly in the trade
press, a sector which has produced some particularly strong comparative
copy.
But, because of existing trademarks' legislation, an advertiser can run into
trouble if a competitor's trademark - and names and packaging often form
part of the trademark - appears in a comparative advertisement.
The proposed UK trademarks bill clearly specifies that the use of trademarks
by others should be allowed 'for the purpose of identifying goods or
services'.
However, not everyone is happy about such liberalisation. The Confederation
of British Industry, the UK employers' organisation and representative of
some of the largest brand leaders, opposes the development.
The CBI attempted to get the bill amended at an earlier stage of its passage
so that trademark owners' permission would have to be granted, or, at the
very least, owners would receive a warning that the trademark was to be used
in comparative advertising.
Emily Marks, a CBI legal adviser, says trademark owners fear that brands in
which they have invested could be damaged by competitors 'riding on their
backs' to promote their own products. There could also be the danger of
selective or subjective comparisons being made and by the time complaints
are found to be justified, the damage to a brand would have been done.
Most of all, the CBI considers the trademarks bill provision ill-timed - a
European Union directive on comparative advertising is in the offing.
'The European directive may overturn anything that's in the trademarks bill,
so it'll all have to be gone into again,' says Marks.
European Commission plans for a directive have been around, in various
forms, since 1978. A detailed set of draft rules, which would have allowed
comparative advertisements - provided they were restricted to comparisons of
objectively verifiable features of goods or services - was thrown out by
member states as being overly-prescriptive.
A much simplified version is likely to emerge from the commission this year.
At present, eight EU countries allow comparative advertisements, with
varying conditions, while four - Belgium, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg -
either ban the practice or have restrictions making it virtually impossible.
If the EU directive does result in Europe-wide liberalisation, are there any
lessons that can be learnt from the US experience, where comparative
advertising has been used for the past 20 years?
Phil Dusenberry is chief executive in New York of BBDO, the advertising
agency which has produced a number of advertisements for Pepsi, including
the chimp one. It has also produced comparative campaigns for Visa and
American Express, and Pizza Hut against its competitors. Dusenberry says the
technique has many advantages but also numerous pitfalls. 'You have
assiduously to avoid confusing the consumer. The casual television viewer
will sometimes confuse your competitor with your product. That's like
throwing money down the drain,' he says.
Dusenberry also believes that a light touch works best, particularly when
the difference between brands is a matter of taste - as in Pepsi and Coke -
rather than a clear-cut product advantage.
'If you come on too heavy-handed, you could look like a bully or a terrier
nipping at the heels of the competition in a way that's off-putting and
offensive. Usually the best kind of comparative advertising is done with a
sense of humour, with a smile, rather than a sledgehammer,' he says.
Coca-Cola, meanwhile, fails to see the joke. A statement in response to
questions about Pepsi's latest advertising reads: 'The Coca-Cola Company is
not opposed to comparative advertising as long as the comparison is
objectively chosen material, relevant, and scientifically measurable.'
Somehow, one suspects Coca-Cola is unlikely to see the chimps experiment as
scientifically valid.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Technology: Deadly challenge proves costly - Daniel Green
examines the continuing search for an effective sepsis treatment, in a
series on drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sepsis kills more than 200,000 people a year in Europe and North America and
has been almost as lethal for at least three large US biotechnology
companies.
Each tried to develop drugs to treat sepsis, which literally means
infection. The drugs promised much in early development but eventually
failed to fulfil their promise at a cost of millions of dollars.
The demand for a sepsis treatment nevertheless remains strong. Sepsis
victims can spend weeks in intensive care where costs can exceed Pounds
2,000 a day. With no clear cure yet, the financial rewards for any company
that develops a successful sepsis drug are enormous.
The medical challenge is just as large, because of the condition's
complexity. Sepsis is difficult even to define. Doctors variously describe
it as a bacterial infection of the blood, acute low blood pressure (which is
why it is sometimes called septic or toxic shock) or a body-wide
inflammation of vital organs.
All three are correct in their way. A sepsis drug is one that tries to deal
with the kind of overwhelming infection that sends people into intensive
care wards.
Once there, the problem is not only the infection, but the body's response
to it. As the infection spreads, the body releases scores of chemicals,
called cytokines, to try to fight it. The effects of these include a rapid
fall in blood pressure, leading to shock, and inflammation in many parts of
the body - systemic inflammation.
This combination of infection by poison-exuding bacteria, low blood pressure
and systemic inflammation leads to the failure of vital organs and
eventually death.
One doctor working for a health regulatory body says: 'The body is simply
overwhelmed. Even heavy doses of antibiotics do not work.' About half of all
sepsis sufferers die within 28 days of diagnosis.
Infection, shock and inflammation affect each other in the human body by a
variety of biochemical mechanisms called a cascade. The precise mechanism is
not yet clear, and there may be more than 100 cytokines involved.
This means that even if a drug succeeds in blocking part of the cascade, the
step could be bypassed and shock or systemic inflammation arise by another
route, according to intensive care specialist Dr David Bennett of St
George's Hospital, Tooting, London.
As if that were not enough, sepsis victims can range from a young person in
a car accident to a mother in childbirth or a pensioner suffering from a
chronic disease such as diabetes or cancer. Not surprisingly, these patients
can react differently to the sepsis and any drugs they receive. A typical
large hospital may have only one sepsis victim a week, so conducting
statistically significant clinical trials is difficult.
With such uncertainty over the mechanism of sepsis and how to test potential
treatments, drug companies follow any of a score of different approaches to
controlling the condition. The three US biotechnology companies that have so
far failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of their drugs illustrate two
such approaches. Centocor and Xoma developed anti-endotoxin drugs which
block some of the poisons produced by bacteria.
Last year, Centocor had to stop clinical trials of its drug Centoxin after
data showed that patients on a placebo lived longer than those on the drug.
Most of the company's huge sales and marketing team, built up for Centoxin's
launch, lost their jobs. Six months earlier, the US Food and Drug
Administration decided that trials of Xoma's E-5 drug did not prove its
efficacy.
But in the third case, that of Synergen, the evidence is more ambiguous. Its
drug, Antril, is designed to block the effects of interleukin-1, a chemical
involved at an early stage in the onset of sepsis. A year ago the company's
chief executive left after Antril's apparent failure in clinical trials.
The three companies had a combined peak market capitalisation of Dollars
4.5bn (Pounds 3.1bn) two years ago. The figure now is less than Pounds 1bn.
Further analysis of the Antril trials, published two months ago, shows that
it may be effective in especially sick patients, says Bill Sibbald, a
professor of medicine and head of the critical care programme at the
Victoria Hospital in London, Ontario, Canada.
Sibbald acknowledges, nevertheless, there needs to be more data from
clinical trials before there is strong evidence of whether Antril works.
That applies to a greater extent to those drugs yet to face the full rigours
of large clinical trials.
One popular alternative to tackling interleukin-1 is to block the action of
another protein - tumour necrosis factor (TNF) - involved early in the
sepsis. Companies that have followed this route include Celltech, one of the
biggest UK biotechnology companies, Bayer, the German pharmaceuticals group,
Chiron, one of the largest US biotechnology companies, and Centocor with
another drug.
However, this method may not solve the problem of sepsis either. At least
one set of clinical trials with an anti-TNF drug has been stopped in recent
months because there appeared to be no benefit to patients. 'TNF may not be
in the right place in the cascade to be the right target,' says the deputy
chairman of one biotechnology company.
British Biotechnology, which announced plans this week to raise Pounds 93m
from its shareholders, has a drug called Lexipafant. It acts against
platelet activating factor (PAF), yet another part of the cascade. PAF
activates the body's defensive white cells, but when over-produced
encourages the white cells to attack healthy tissue.
But PAF combatting agents have also had mixed fortunes in trials. A number
of established drug companies on both sides of the Atlantic are thought to
have abandoned or cut back on PAF research.
Another route is being followed by Cortech. The US company has a compound
called Bradycor which interferes with the action of bradykinin, part of the
inflammatory cascade. Other companies, such as the UK's Wellcome, are
tackling nitric oxide (a corrosive chemical produced during sepsis that
lowers blood pressure), chemicals that bind bacterial poisons to cells and
those that attach the body's defensive white blood cells to otherwise
healthy tissue. Wellcome announced yesterday that it had licenced a nitric
oxide fighting chemical from Fujisawa USA and hopes to start clinical trials
later this year.
Yet more approaches are being followed by companies from small biotechnology
businesses like California's Gilead through to drug industry giants such as
Eli Lilly of the US and Japan's Eisai.
Sepsis is an example of a high-risk, high-reward therapeutic area in
healthcare. That combination virtually guarantees that there will be no
shortage of companies trying to find the solution.
But one thing independent observers agree on is that if an effective drug is
identified in the short term, this will have as much to do with luck as
science.
As Sibbald concedes, each of the clinical trials is also a test of theories
of how sepsis works: no-one yet knows precisely which part of the cascade is
crucial.
The difficulty of conducting statistically meaningful clinical trials
remains. Bennett says perhaps 5,000 patients have been the subject of
trials, compared with the tens or even hundreds of thousands normally
demanded by government regulators of the healthcare sector. This is
indirectly acknowledged by the drugs companies.
Robert Thompson, Synergen's vice-president for research and clinical
affairs, says the right treatment for such a complex condition may have to
be a combination of drugs.
There is still room for optimism, however. 'We are not more than five years
off from having therapies which modulate the inflammatory response syndrome
in a beneficial way,' says Sibbald. And then, he says, we can move from cure
to prevention.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Technology: New directions for research resources - Why
European companies must look to the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's industrial base is in danger of being eroded because of wrong use
of its research resources, according to Hartmut Weule, head of research and
technology at Daimler-Benz, the German motor, electronics and aerospace
group.
Too much effort has gone into preserving the old and not enough into
creating the new. Research funds have too often been allocated by the public
sector, and this has tended to inhibit innovation.
Weule, addressing the European Union's industrial research and development
advisory committee in Brussels, said Europeans were not tight-fisted
nationally when it came to spending money on research. Germany spent 2.7 per
cent of its gross national product on R&amp;D compared with 2.8 per cent in the
US and 3.05 per cent in Japan.
But in 1991, only 16 per cent of Germany's exports were of
research-intensive, high technology products - in which R&amp;D funding
accounted for more than 8.5 per cent of turnover. In Japan, the figure was
27 per cent and in the US, 43 per cent.
The reason was that German exports had a high concentration of products from
traditional sectors such as the mechanical engineering, electrical, chemical
and motor industries.
Weule's comments are in line with the findings of Ifo, the German economic
research institute, which said recently that the country's research efforts
were too heavily weighted towards low-growth sectors.
'However,' Weule said, 'it's not just the Germans who are stuck in their
ways. It's a European problem.' Many companies did not make proper use of
resources for research into future products. Nor did they put enough effort
into evaluating the success of research. None of this was easy, Weule said,
citing the extensive changes that Daimler had been forced to make in
targeting its research after its 1980s expansion through acquisitions.
Daimler now compares its R&amp;D efforts with those of other companies in
different fields. Its spending is also focused. Some 70 per cent of its
annual long-term research budget of DM500m (Pounds 200m) - part of the total
R&amp;D budget of DM9.3bn, 10 per cent of turnover - is concentrated on five
future-oriented areas: transport drive systems, materials, energy
technology, microelectronics, and technology and society.
Daimler was also increasing the efficiency of its use of resources by
co-operating with other companies and institutes. 'Anyone trying to 'go it
alone' dissipates his energies,' he said. Also, group research spending was
organised strictly on a project basis, with clear time and cost frameworks.
Two years ago, Daimler was the first European company to introduce a special
research audit for its main research fields, involving group managers and
outside scientists who also assess how well research is translated into
products.
Weule said state funds should be redirected in the same way and not simply
go into broad research areas of national economic interest. 'We must
concentrate on just a few future-oriented key fields.' These would include:
advanced production systems, information and communications technologies,
power engineering, environmental technology, and vehicle and traffic
engineering.
The allocation of funds would have to be planned by industry, science and
the state. 'To be successful in these fields, we Europeans must be ready to
co-operate more closely - despite our tendencies to individualism.' Daimler,
for example, was co-operating with France's Aerospatiale on various
projects, within the framework of Airbus Industries and of the Eurocolumbus
space and Eurocopter helicopter programmes.
Individualism, Weule said, was a European strength where it led to
creativity and a weakness where it led to egoism. 'The complex high
technologies we need to produce competitive products, processes and services
for tomorrow's markets can only be realised in partnership.'

FT  31 MAR 94 / People: Succession becomes clearer at M and S
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Clinton Silver, deputy chairman and joint managing director of Marks and
Spencer, is retiring at the end of July after 42 years with the company. He
is to be replaced as deputy chairman by fellow joint MD, Keith Oates.
The appointment is seen as marking out Oates (right) as the likely successor
to chairman Sir Richard Greenbury - a prospect welcomed yesterday by City
analysts.
In three years as vice chairman, Silver, 64, has seen Marks and Spencer
regain from J. Sainsbury the title of the UK's most profitable retailer. He
is described by company insiders as having 'an encyclopaedic knowledge of
the business' and as having provided invaluable support to Sir Richard.
Analysts say the affable Silver formed an effective partnership with his
more ebullient chairman. He is likely to retain some links with M&amp;S through
his chairmanship of the British Fashion Council.
Silver, 64, joined M&amp;S in 1952 and held several positions in head office
before being appointed an alternate director in 1974 and a director in 1978.
He became a joint MD in January 1990, responsible for buying all clothing,
homeware and food.
Oates, 51, by contrast, is not a career M&amp;S man, joining as finance director
in 1984.
A strong personality with a sharp financial brain, he has been the driving
force behind M&amp;S's expansion in the financial services field. He spent seven
years in finance at IBM and four at Black and Decker's European headquarters
in Brussels, before spending six years with Thyssen-Bornemisza in Monaco,
where he rose to become vice-president, finance.
Oates was appointed joint managing director of M&amp;S in 1991, with
responsibilities for finance, group expenditure and overseas operations. He
was a governor of the BBC from 1988 to last year.
M&amp;S also announced the creation of three new managing directors' posts - one
of whom, analysts suggest, may be the next chairman but one.
Andrew Stone, since 1990 director responsible for ladies' outerwear and
lingerie, becomes MD responsible for clothing, homeware and general
merchandise. Guy McCracken, director responsible for the food division since
January 1993, becomes managing director with responsibility for food.
Peter Salsbury, director of personnel since 1990 and of store operations
since last year, becomes MD with the additional responsibilities of store
development and estates.
In addition, Derek Hayes, divisional director responsible for European
retail operations, and Barry Morris, divisional director responsible for
womenswear, are both promoted to the board.

FT  31 MAR 94 / People: Taking stock at Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Hall, 49, head of public policy and external affairs at the London
Stock Exchange, is to leave at the end of June.
Hall, an ex-diplomat who joined the exchange in 1988, is the latest in a
string of departures. Jane Barker, 44, the chief operating officer and
finance director, left in February to move to California, and Peter Gerrard,
62, is retiring as general counsel in April.
The departure of Hall, who had been in the running to be head of corporate
affairs at the BBC, appears to have been prompted by the decision of the new
chief executive, Michael Lawrence, to split Hall's job in two and take the
public policy element under his own wing.
The responsibility for handling the exchange's corporate communications will
be taken over by Kate Bowes, 45, head of publicity and promotion.
The retirement of Gerrard, a former senior partner of Lovell White Durrant,
means that his responsibilities for regulation will be taken over by a new
head being recruited from outside.
The new executive will be responsible for the exchange's five regulatory
functions - listing, market surveillance, market supervision, membership and
settlement regulation, and regulatory development.
Meanwhile, the exchange is still seeking to fill the other slot vacant in
its reorganised top management team - head of finance and planning. Last
month Christine Dann was promoted to director of business operations.
The other members of the exchange's management, in addition to Dann and
Bowes, are: Giles Vardy (markets development and marketing), Keith Robinson
(secretariat and legal), Lorraine Trainer (human resources and property).

FT  31 MAR 94 / People: Gap half plugged at Severn Trent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Severn Trent has taken steps to fill the gap which will be left when the
outspoken John Bellak retires as chairman today. However, the appointment
was greeted by the City as something as a stopgap measure.
Richard Ireland, deputy chairman since December 1992, was yesterday named as
chairman 'until the appointment of a new chairman who will lead the company
into the next decade'. Ireland, also finance director of Wolseley Group, has
been a director of Severn since privatisation in 1989.
Severn refused to elaborate on the oddly-worded statement. 'We are being
up-front by saying that Richard Ireland will be chairman as from tomorrow,
but the search for a chairman to lead us into the next century continues,'
it said.
The City speculated that Severn was hedging its bets. 'It is understood that
Ireland had wanted the job, but the company was frightened of taking him
on,' one analyst said. 'He is known to be very strict and . . . would pare
the business down to what is sensible.'
Severn has been widely criticised for the financing of Biffa, the waste
management company it purchased for Pounds 212m in 1991. Analysts estimate
that although profitable at the operating level, it could be some time
before Biffa pays its financing costs.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Accountancy Column: Beyond this point predators may lurk -
The possible consequences of the latest round of potential mergers in the
profession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumours are rife this week of a radical merger that would provide a
substantial shake-up to the existing structure of the accountancy
profession.
A hefty giant is threatening to take over a collection of smaller entities
in a consolidation that could have substantial ramifications for the
delivery of services.
A new stage has been reached following discussions in the last few days,
although it may yet be a good length of time before any deal comes to
fruition while all those involved huddle together to debate the options.
It follows a long period of sometimes tense courtship, with successive and
competitive bouts of broken engagements in the past and role-reversal as
pursuer and pursued for the prize.
There is a risk that if things do not go to plan, attempts at merger could
instead lead to a further and embittered fractionalisation.
The potential for failure is certainly high. Fragile egos are at stake,
careers could be jeopardised, jobs may go, and there is also an enormous
potential for a clash of cultures.
A good degree of bitterness and backstabbing has already been in evidence,
with those less reluctant to go ahead indulging in selective and
embarrassing leaks to the press.
In spite of the emphasis on the word 'merger' in public, such combinations
generally end up as takeovers by the dominant party, as any accountants
worth their charge-out rates will concede.
The driving force is naturally a commercial one, with some keen competitive
concerns between the rivals making the merger attractive as a way to gain
clients and maintain or boost market position.
The spread of resources from around the country and the potential market
across the world make the merger seem in many ways an attractive
proposition.
The rumour in question is, of course, the possible merger of the UK's six
leading professional accountancy bodies. Equally, however, it is the
possible merger of the two accountancy firms Arthur Andersen and BDO Binder
Hamlyn.
For in all the respects listed above, both mergers are remarkably similar.
Yet in most other ways, they are extraordinarily different.
The former has a history stretching over decades, will probably take years
more to evolve and is characterised by a good deal of hostility. It is also
frankly all but irrelevant to the outside world.
The latter has been just a few months in the making, will likely be
concluded one way or another by the summer, and looks set to be conducted on
relatively friendly terms. It will also probably have a more important
outcome for the world at large, as the 'Big 6' firms boost market share
still further.
At the start of last week, the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies
met to ratify the report of a working group it had set up nearly a year
earlier chaired by Mr David Bishop of KPMG Peat Marwick. This endorses calls
for 'rationalisation' of the profession.
A week before, Mr Jim Wadia, managing partner of Arthur Andersen, the UK's
fourth largest firm, wrote proposing a merger to Mr John Norton, senior
partner of BDO Binder Hamlyn, the eighth largest firm.
Drawing comparisons between the two accountancy firms in question and one or
more of the six professional accountancy bodies is difficult. There is
perhaps at least a limited parallel, with the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales playing the Arthur Andersen role in taking
the initiative.
Some sceptics suggest that the institute has been driven to act by financial
worries and concern about its waning influence in the longer term, notably a
tailing off in the growth of student recruitment.
This is happening at a time - and partly as a result - of the success of the
other professional bodies, notably the Chartered Institute of Management
Accountants in the UK with its members steeped in practical experience, and
the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants with its aggressive
marketing of its qualification overseas.
Meanwhile, Andersen believes that Binder is a tempting target because of its
healthy list of quoted clients, and because it thinks it may be difficult
for the smaller firm to hold on to this group for much longer.
Arguably some of the 11 regional partnerships within Binder - which must
each vote on the merger - are in the position of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland, which is proud of its small but separate stance
while a little nervous of being swallowed alive in a merged entity.
Andersen stresses that Binder would be able to retain something of its own
identity and possibly its name in a merged UK firm. The Bishop proposals
make similar claims for the professional bodies and their constituencies,
with a tortuous set of elected and co-opted regional bodies, co-ordinating
groups and special interest sections.
The sceptics in both mergers would argue that before long the differences
and distinctive qualities are more likely to disappear, after a good bout of
indigestion and some blood-shed.
The two firms need to be sure that a merger will not lead to assuming
substantial overheads and less significant smaller clients while losing
Binder partners, staff and worthwhile clients.
The six professional bodies need still to justify how a single body will
cope any more effectively than the present system with such a diverse group
of members' interests and public interests.
The next few months will be decisive. Andersen's Jim Wadia has already been
given considerable authority to negotiate a merger, and final approval at a
worldwide partners' meeting could be granted by July 1 if Binder agrees.
In the labyrinthine world of the politics of the professional bodies, such
speed will be lacking. Market researchers can at least look forward to a
lucrative time, with several surveys of accountants to canvass views in the
offing.
Judging by unpublished information from some joint market research conducted
more than a year ago, the UK and Ireland's three chartered bodies will have
an uphill task trying to persuade their members to agree to their colleagues
sharing the title 'chartered accountant'. Less than 30 per cent in each body
approved the idea then.
That should come as no surprise, given that it was the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales which failed to vote in
sufficient numbers for a merger with the Scots in 1970, or with the
Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy in 1990.
Equally, other confidential responses in the research suggested that only a
third or less of the members of four of the six bodies supported the idea of
an institute divided in three geographically. The exceptions were the
Scottish and Irish chartered accountants.
Mr Ian Plaistowe, a former president of the English and Welsh Institute, may
be a senior Andersen partner as well as a member of the Bishop working
group.
But there the similarities do end. The action taken by his firm is likely to
be far more clear-cut and rapidly resolved than that of his professional
body.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Arms For Iraq - The Scott Inquiry: Cast of characters in a
Whitehall farce - In the firing line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR NICHOLAS LYELL, attorney-general, is trying to resist being set up as
the 'fall guy' if the Scott inquiry delivers a harsh verdict. However, as
the minister most directly responsible for the overall conduct of the Matrix
Churchill case, he remains vulnerable.
Sir Nicholas gave evidence which was defensive rather than convincing,
although he is widely regarded as an honest man. However, even his friends
concede that the arms-for-Iraq affair has left him politically out of his
depth.
MR WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE, minister for open government, faces opposition knives
out for him. They have been sharpening since he told the inquiry rather
lamely that he approved defence-related machine tools to Iraq because he was
not given vital intelligence about their end-use.
Mr Waldegrave, who was a Foreign Office minister from July 1988 to November
1990, has also left himself open to charges of misleading parliament. He
accepted a form of words drafted by one of his officials which did not tell
the whole truth about the government's policy towards Iraq.
Nevertheless, other evidence shows he was usually more cautious than the
more gung-ho Mr Alan Clark and Lord Trefgarne at the ministries of trade and
defence.
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, may rue the day he promised to resign if
he was seriously criticised by the inquiry. He says he signed a PII
certificate in the Matrix Churchill case to protect the intelligence
services. But his insistence, along with the other serving minister Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, now defence secretary, and former Foreign Office minister
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, that he had a duty to sign based on well-established
law, has since been questioned by the judge.
MR ALAN CLARK, a former trade and defence minister, has made few new friends
as a result of his involvement in the Matrix Churchill affair.
Some of his former colleagues say that it is only he who is really to blame
for the way the trial of three businessmen turned into a Whitehall farce of
potentially tragic consequences. He said one thing to Customs and Excise and
the government, and another thing to the judge.
Mr Clark's evidence to the Scott inquiry provided a further twist in the
tale when he declared that the change in the guidelines should have been
announced to parliament. He has also dropped a mischievous hint that
Baroness Thatcher, as prime minister, had known more about what was going on
that she had told the judge.
MR ALAN MOSES QC, the chief prosecutor in the Matrix Churchill trial,
performed a remarkable U-turn over PII certificates. Having argued strongly
for the application of these certificates to prevent disclosure of official
information, he told the inquiry that the system he had adhered to was
fundamentally flawed.
He also admitted to the inquiry that he may have failed in his duties as
prosecutor by not chasing some of the documents he needed.
Previously Mr Moses was regarded as on the fast track to become a High Court
judge. Some colleagues wonder if this promotion might now take a
considerably longer time.
CUSTOMS AND EXCISE: The role of Customs in investigating and prosecuting the
Matrix Churchill businessmen was not a happy one entirely.
Officials have been questioned by the judge over their failure to fully
familiarise themselves with the facts of the case, and over the way that
witness statements were drawn up.
WHITEHALL: The list of trade, defence, and Foreign Office officials who have
emerged less that sweetly from the Scott inquiry is considerable. A few are
likely to be moved sideways. Some already have been.
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES: They may escape along with the arms manufacturers,
dealers and bankers who have not been called to give evidence.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Arms For Iraq - The Scott Inquiry: Probe lifts the lid on
government secrecy - Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the export of defence
equipment to Iraq has provided an unprecedented window on the secret
workings of Whitehall. Jimmy Burns examines the evidence behind an affair
which has caused deep political embarrassment and threatened the reputations
of senior officials and ministers / The evidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Scott inquiry has concluded its main public hearings, which have frayed
nerves in Whitehall and threatened to do serious damage to the government.
The inquiry was set up after the November 1992 collapse of the trial of
three executives of the Matrix Churchill machine tool company on charges of
breaching export regulations by selling arms-related goods to Iraq. The
court heard evidence that Mr Paul Henderson, managing director, was keeping
British intelligence informed of their actions.
Lord Trefgarne, who finished giving evidence yesterday, was the latest
witness called by Lord Justice Scott over the past 11 months. Other
witnesses have included former and present members of the cabinet, prime
ministers, senior government law officers, intelligence and Customs officers
and Whitehall officials. Mr John Major's appearance was the first time a
serving prime minister had given evidence in public to such an inquiry.
The inquiry was set up to establish whether the government connived in
breaching its own regulations restricting defence-related exports to Iraq
and whether it used Public Interest Immunity (PII) certificates to cover up
its policy - at the risk of sending innocent men to jail.
The judge's main achievement has been to force ministers and officials to
account for their actions in a way that they have never been required to do
before in public.
He and his counsel, Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, have consulted thousands of
documents and employed a relentless style of cross-examination to elicit
information from even the most un-cooperative witnesses. Their detractors
have accused them of being inquisitorial - others wonder whether the inquiry
would have got anywhere with a gentler touch.
The result is that Britain's machinery of government has been shown to be
over-secretive and less than respectful of the need for parliament to know
the whole truth, while extraordinarily deft in exploiting legislative
loopholes in pursuit of policy objectives.
The evidence so far appears to prove beyond reasonable doubt that:
Britain's arms licensing system was designed to allow the export of
potentially lethal equipment. The onus was on the exporter to describe goods
accurately - although in practice licensing decisions often followed wider
political considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the
goods exported.
Ministers and officials breached their own guidelines - never intended to be
law - by approving exports of machine tools to Iraq, knowing that they were
going to be used for munitions manufacture.
The government kept its guidelines from MPs for nearly a year and later gave
misleading answers to parliamentary questions which tried to elicit the
truth about relations with Iraq in the 1980s. Ministers and officials
approved the export of arms to countries such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia
after ignoring intelligence information that those countries were being used
as a diversionary route to Iraq.
There were serious failings in the way intelligence was disseminated between
departments.
Inadequate procedures were followed by government lawyers during the
prosecution of the Matrix Churchill case. This raised serious questions
about the conduct in particular of Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general.
Documents made available to the inquiry show that if ministers never
deliberately lied to parliament they acted on advice from their officials
which covered up policy.
In preparing his report, Lord Justice Scott will have to judge whether this
catalogue of failings is the product of the nature of government or whether
it underlines political culpability for which individual officials and
ministers deserve to be held accountable.
Ministers have told the inquiry the guidelines formulated by Lord Howe,
while foreign secretary at the end of 1984, contained an 'inherent
flexibility' - any decision on arms exports would be judged according to
political and military circumstances.
Thus the decision to loosen guidelines to allow more machine tools to go to
Iraq following the ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war was not seen as
necessarily contradicting the guidelines' main stipulation that: 'In future,
we should not . . . approve orders for any defence equipment . . . which
would significantly enhance the capability of either side to prolong or
exacerbate the conflict.'
Sir Nicholas Lyell has dismissed as 'utterly untrue' the allegation that
ministers tried to use PII to protect the government by preventing
publication of embarrassing material.
In a statement supported by Mr Gilbert Gray QC, a senior defence barristers
in the Matrix Churchill trial, Sir Nicholas told the judge the use of PII
certificates was in accordance with guidelines laid down by senior judges in
previous cases.
Yet, as Sir Nicholas put it to the judge last Friday, 'there were a number
of things that did not happen as they should'.
Sir Nicholas went further than any of his cabinet colleagues in assuming
some measure of responsibility, although he pointed the finger at civil
servants who had handled the PII claims. Crucially, he admitted that
government lawyers under his supervision had not told the judge or the
prosecuting counsel that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
had objected to signing a PII certificate.
Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary, was forced to admit that no attempt was
made to stop the Matrix Churchill prosecution even though senior Whitehall
officials knew that it was on shaky ground.
Mr Alan Moses QC, Matrix Churchill chief prosecutor, said he doubted whether
he would have gone ahead if he had seen documents demonstrating the
'clearest possible indication of (government) knowledge' of Matrix Churchill
military-related exports to Iraq.
The government insists that only one person is really to blame for the
Matrix Churchill debacle: Mr Alan Clark, former trade minister, who misled
colleagues and Customs and Excise in a way that made a mockery of
ministerial accountability and the system of justice.
Yet it was Mr Clark's evidence to the inquiry which seemed to point to the
circularity of Whitehall's conduct in the affair: 'Intelligence was telling
you that machine tools had to be provided to protect the source that was
telling you about the machine tools.'
Unlike other officials, intelligence officers - including the departing head
of MI6, Sir Colin McColl - have been allowed to give their evidence in
private.
The extent to which the intelligence agencies may have been part of a
conspiracy to pervert the democratic process or whether, as they appear to
have indicated, they provided information which others failed to
disseminate, is another issue for Lord Justice Scott.
The role of the intelligence agencies in the supergun affair remains to be
clarified, as does the reason why Customs abandoned its prosecution of those
involved.
Ultimately, where the protestations of ministers and officials have have
seemed less convincing is in arguing that this was how it was done because
the demands of realpolitik willed it so.
The common thread which runs through many of their statements is
justification, based on a notion of political convenience and a refusal to
accept responsibility for getting it wrong.
A minority of civil servants believed from the outset that the government
seriously misjudged the nature of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's regime.
Their opinions were ignored by Whitehall and the arms which the licensing
system was unable and unwilling to prevent going to Iraq came to be used
against the west following the invasion of Kuwait.
As he sifts the evidence in the coming weeks, the judge will have to decide
at what point, if at all, the arrogance of power misplaced accountability in
Britain's dealings with Iraq.

Where will the buck stop? Over the summer Lord Justice Scott and Presiley
Baxendale QC will consider the roles of Matrix Churchill prosecutor Alan
Moses QC, who claimed he was not shown key intelligence papers. Ministers
Alan Clark and William Waldegrave relaxed guidelines for defence exports but
Alan Clark later described his colleagues' explanations as 'Alice in
Wonderland'. Prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major both denied
all knowledge of the affair. Michael Heseltine was reluctant to sign a
certificate to suppress official documents but was overruled by Sir Nicholas
Lyell, who later insisted he was as steady as a lighthouse. Paul Henderson,
former Matrix Churchill managing director and MI6 spy, was one of three
businessmen pursued by Customs and caught in the Whitehall web of civil
servants and intelligence agents.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
November 9 1992 Government faces demands for inquiry into arms-for-Iraq
policy after Matrix Churchill trial collapses.
November 11 John Major announces the setting up of an independent judicial
inquiry. 'There have been some extraordinary stories about this matter . . .
they must be clarified beyond any measure of doubt.'
March 31 1993 Lord Justice Scott says he will hear evidence in public unless
there is an 'overriding national-interest reason' not to.
May 4 Public Hearings Day One: The first witness, Mr Richard Luce, Foreign
Office minister 1983-85, tells the judge: 'I do not think there is anything
very sinister in all this.' The judge asks senior Foreign Office official Mr
Stephen Day: 'Would you not say that the British public and parliament were
entitled to know about these important matters?'
May 11 Ministry of Defence official Lt-Col Richard Glazebrook says Whitehall
ignored his warnings about Iraq's military build-up: 'I realised this was a
can of worms and that there really was a lot happening.'
May 12-15 Anonymous MI5 and MI6 officials give evidence in secret. 'The
public interest in an open hearing is outweighed by the public interest in
protecting from disclosure in public the information,' the judge says.
May 17 Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, counsel to the inquiry, tells Sir Adam
Butler, defence minister between 1984-85: 'Papers we have seen show there
was government knowledge that Jordan was being used as a diversionary route
for military equipment to Iraq.' In 1985 the government signed a Pounds 270m
defence package with Jordan.
May 28 Sir Patrick Mayhew, former attorney-general, denies attempting to
suppress evidence in the Supergun affair as earlier alleged by former Tory
MP Sir Hal Miller.
June 11 Inquiry hears how IMS, a government-owned defence company, equipped
an Iraqi military complex which could have been used for testing missiles.
Mr Norman Lamont, when defence minister in February 1986, tells then foreign
minister Mr Timothy Renton: 'IMS work cannot be interpreted as a real
enhancement of Iraqi war effort.'
June 28 Mr William Patey, Foreign Office official, says advice by civil
servants to ministers on the export of machine tools was 'deficient - the
advice could have been clearer . . . It could have been better put'.
July 15 Mr Mark Higson, Foreign Office official, says that ministers misled
parliament about the government's policy on arms-for-Iraq. 'It wasn't
telling the truth . . . I can't say I always liked it. It was a sham and a
contributory reason as to why I left the Foreign Office.'
July 30 In his first interview, Lord Justice Scott tells the FT - against a
background of a Whitehall whispering campaign against him - 'If you are
going to have an inquiry, you had better have a thorough one and put up with
the price that has to be paid for that thoroughness.'
September 13 Mr David Gore-Booth, Britain's ambassador to Saudi Arabia,
says: 'Intelligence is an imprecise art', and adds that half an answer to
parliament can be truthful. 'The extent to which a parliamentary answer
should be full, half full or empty is very much up to the minister.'
September 20 Mr Tim Renton, former Foreign Office minister, says the
government approved the export of potentially lethal chemical products to
Egypt in spite of intelligence that Egypt was a diversionary route for Iraq.
September 22 Mr William Waldegrave, former Foreign Office minister, tells
the inquiry: 'I don't remember thinking for a moment we had a frightfully
secretive policy of changing the guidelines. It would have been suicidal if
we had.'
October 12 Mr Waldegrave retracts his statement that 'no dual-use exports to
Iraq were allowed if it was believed they were to be used to produce
weapons.'
December 8 Baroness Thatcher says that as prime minister she had no
knowledge of much of the detail behind the decisions taken by officials and
ministers. She tells the judge to look carefully at intelligence failings:
'Either the machinery was there and was not effective . . . or else the
machinery itself was defective.'
December 17 Mr Eric Beston, a DTI official, admits he misled the jury in the
Matrix Churchill trial.
January 12 1994 Lord Howe lashes out at the conduct of the inquiry, saying
that Lord Justice Scott is acting as 'detective, inquisitor, advocate, and
judge'.
January 26 Senior DTI official Mr Michael Petter talks of his department's
pressure on Customs and Excise over the Matrix Churchill affair. He says: 'I
don't think I appreciated as I ought to have done the constitutional point
about the independence of Customs.'
February 3 Mr Anthony Steadman, a senior official at the Department of Trade
and Industry, says he wrote inaccurate draft witness statements before the
Matrix Churchill trial under advice from government lawyers.
February 9 Sir Robin Butler, head of the civil service, accuses the media of
making wild allegations and prejudging the issues. The judge tells him:
'Think critically about the established practices and convention of
Whitehall.'
February 10 Sir Robin concedes that the prosecution against the Matrix
Churchill three went ahead even though an important argument in their
defence had been accepted by senior officials at Whitehall.
February 17 The government took a 'generous view' as to what documents
should be suppressed in a criminal trial, government lawyer Mr Andrew
Liethead tells inquiry.
February 28 Mr Michael Heseltine says attorney-general Sir Nicholas Lyell
gave him contradictory advice on PII certificates.
March 2 Mr Gerald Hosker QC, Whitehall's most senior lawyer, backs reform of
PII system and questions whether Matrix Churchill trial should have taken
place.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Arms For Iraq - The Scott Inquiry: 'Every government gets
its knickers in a twist'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Domestic interest in the Scott inquiry has not in general been reflected
internationally. Continental European and US press coverage has been thin,
and international commentators remain puzzled by the excitement in the UK.
France
A senior executive in the defence industry:
'Every government in the world gets its knickers in the twist every once in
a while. What seems to be typically British is the apparent convergence of
businessmen, the intelligence services, and government operating a policy
which was decided at quite a high level - very John le Carre. The nearest
you come to that is in the US.
'The difference with France is that we were quite overt in our arms exports
to Iraq. The British government seems to have said one thing in public and
done another in private.'
Germany
Mr Joachim Krause, former adviser to the UN special commission on Iraq:
'The Scott inquiry has clearly pointed to the limits of export controls in
the field of dual-use goods. Whenever a government thinks it is in its
strategic interest to buttress the defence capabilities of a certain case -
even if this is a rogue state - there may be loopholes to be used or one can
simply connive with violations of existing rules.
'It has also shown that Whitehall - like Washington, Paris, Bonn, and most
Arab states - succumbed in the 1980s to Saddam Hussein's strategic
deception. Such a failure is grave and embarrassing for any government.'
United States
Mr Kenneth Juster, former senior State Department official in the Bush
administration and a partner in a Washington law firm:
'In the US everything is very open and officials are used to being
questioned in public. We have had a wide range of investigations over the
past 4 1/2 years into all sorts of Iraqgate allegations of wrongdoing . . .
hearings by several congressional committees, the turning over of every
document requested with no claim of executive privilege, including
classified information.
'So far nothing has substantiated the allegation that there was any
wrongdoing or conspiracy involving the US and the UK. What has happened is
that certain political figures have been been unjustly accused of being
criminals simply on account of policy decisions, and the energies of
government have been used up in countering false allegations. There has been
no fire but a lot of smoke.'

Lord Justice Scott will write his report during the summer with publication
expected before Christmas. He will make recommendations on Public Interest
Immunity certificates and export legislation, and although his independent
report was commissioned by the government, it is not binding in law.
There will be no public hearings in April, but some further hearings early
in May. In the meantime, the inquiry team will continue to assemble written
evidence.
So far, the inquiry has considered:
4.3m words of typescript in evidence
200,000 pages of documents, each copied five times
166 witnesses have given written evidence:
 -of these, 57 have given a total of 400 hours of oral evidence in public
 -12 have given 50 hours of oral evidence in closed session
Cost of the inquiry estimated at Pounds 940,000, mainly covered by DTI
Before making a criticism of a witness in his report, the judge will give
that witness an opportunity to make, in writing, any comment.
Every witness was sent a comprehensive request for detailed background
information as well as the questions Lord Justice Scott would ask. The
longest questionnaire, to Mr Alan Moses QC, ran to 172 pages.
Witnesses could call on lawyers, or anyone else, to assist them in preparing
written statements and to sit beside them at oral hearings.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Business failures fall 14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business failures fell 14 per cent in England and Wales in the first quarter
of the year, according to figures released yesterday by Dun &amp; Bradstreet,
the business information group.
However, Dun &amp; Bradstreet warned that companies were facing as many cashflow
difficulties as a year ago, hindering a further reduction in failures.
It found in a separate survey that 80 per cent of companies' cashflow
problems were worse or no better.
A survey by the British Chambers of Commerce reported that 94 per cent of
small companies reported negative effects as a result of late payment, and
85 per cent backed the introduction of statutory interest on overdue bills.
The Institute of Credit Management, however, warned that the proposed
introduction of a statutory right to interest on late bills could cripple
small businesses.
Dun and Bradstreet found that there were 10,941 business failures in the
three months to April, compared with 12,648 in the first quarter of last
year. The number of company liquidations in the same period fell 17 per cent
to 4,295, while the number of business bankruptcies fell 11 per cent to
6,646.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Tecs attacked on jobless training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of long-term unemployed adults with problems such as illiteracy
will be denied training places because of cuts in funding, it was said
yesterday.
Training providers said that training and enterprise councils, which
administer government training programmes in England and Wales, have been
told to get providers to achieve more qualifications and jobs for unemployed
adults with fewer resources.
Providers have questioned why Tecs should be able to make, and keep, savings
from training programmes. They also question why they should face cuts while
Tecs maintain their staff levels and, in some cases, provide BMW cars for
chief executives.
The Tecs' budget for the main scheme for unemployed adults, Training for
Work, will fall to Pounds 705m in 1994-95 from Pounds 762m in 1993-94. At
the same time the Department of Employment is demanding increases in the
number of those achieving jobs or qualifications - up to 40 per cent higher.
Mrs Anne Weinstock, chief executive of the Rathbone Society, which trains
people with special needs, said many providers were already selecting those
most easy to train or to get jobs for.
Many Tecs are negotiating with the employment department over their budgets
for 1994-95.
Mrs Pat Richards, who chairs the Tecs' funding and contracting working
group, said: 'Tecs are saying these contracts will not be easy to manage and
some have warned that budgets may have to be reviewed mid-year.'
The concerns of providers - over Tecs making savings and maintaining staff
levels - highlight the tensions inherent in the way these private companies
are funded.
Mr Tony Lloyd, Labour's training spokesman, said it would be ridiculous to
blame Tecs for having surpluses, which are needed to fund their work in
economic development. But he said a future Labour government would review
the funding of Tecs and might require that funds for programmes such as
those catering for people with special needs be ring-fenced.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Gas regulator accuses her predecessor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas regulator,
yesterday accused her predecessor of acting 'illegally' in allowing the
costs of energy-efficiency projects to be passed on to customers.
Her concerns, which she said arose 'in the first week' of her appointment in
November, were made to the Commons environment select committee yesterday.
Mr Robert Jones MP, the Conservative chairman of the committee, accused her
of making 'a robust condemnation' of Sir James McKinnon.
The controversy - which surfaced when Ms Spottiswoode gave evidence to the
trade and industry select committee in January - is over whether gas and
electricity customers should pay for projects initiated by the Energy Saving
Trust.
The trust is intended to help the utilities identify ways in which their
customers can save energy. Ms Spottiswoode's concern is that the trust will
need to spend in the region of Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m a year by the end
of the decade to meet government targets. This could add several per cent to
household fuel bills, on top of the controversial imposition of value added
tax announced in last year's Budget.
The trust was featured prominently by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in
the UK's strategy for combating global warming.
Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of
Energy, said: 'Until this problem is solved it is hard to see how Mr Major's
strategy is on the road.'
Mr Jones argued that there was 'a clear difference of opinion' between Ms
Spottiswoode and Professor Stephen Littlechild, her counterpart at Offer,
the electricity regulator.
Offer said yesterday: 'We are confident that we have acted totally legally
in formulating our supply price control.
'We will look at Clare Spottiswoode's comments to the environment select
committee with interest.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday announced tighter planning controls on houses in
conservation areas.
The proposals will give wider powers to local planning authorities wanting
to restrict homeowners' ability to make changes to the outside appearance of
their properties. Authorities will be required to publicise their proposals
in advance and pay regard to the views of local people.
The measures are a response to last July's consultation paper on the
protection of conservation areas issued by the environment and national
heritage departments.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Ativan users fail in legal aid appeal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than a thousand people who claim to have been adversely affected by the
tranquilliser Ativan have lost their appeal against a decision to withdraw
legal aid funding of their action against the manufacturer.
The announcement by the Legal Aid Board, the reasons for which have yet to
be given, was an 'enormous blow' for 1,200 litigants, said solicitor Mr Paul
Balen. They would now not have the opportunity of seeing the full defence of
John Wyeth &amp; Brother and all its documentation.
He said the decision could be challenged by application to the High Court
for judicial review.
Ativan was introduced into the UK in 1972. Litigants claim there was a risk
that long-term use of the drug could lead to tolerance dependence and
substantial problems when it was withdrawn.

Three hospitals in the Aberdeen area are to close with the loss of 700 jobs.
Grampian Healthcare, a health service trust, said Kingseat at Newmachar, and
Woodlands, in Cults, would close next April, and Arduthie Hospital in
Stonehaven in 1996.
The trust said 360 permanent jobs and 240 temporary posts would go and 100
would be transferred to Aberdeen. It said the Care in the Community
programme had led to the fall in numbers of long-stay patients in hospitals.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices on average rose 0.6 per cent last month compared with February,
said Nationwide, Britain's second-largest building society, Andrew Taylor
writes.
It said yesterday that the average price of a UK house had risen by 2.8 per
cent to Pounds 53,751 since March 1993.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, said: 'There is little
sign that tax increases due to take effect in April are having an influence
on the housing-market recovery.
'Market turnover in the early part of the year is up substantially on the
same period of 1993 while current indications are that the stronger trend in
mortgage lending apparent over recent months is being maintained,' he said.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Compulsory purchase fear halts Cammell Laird bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bid by Coastline Industries to buy the Cammell Laird shipyard at
Birkenhead, Merseyside, has been put on hold after worries about whether the
site might be compulsorily purchased and government failure to provide a
Pounds 2m derelict grant.
VSEL, the Barrow nuclear submarine builder which owns the yard, had given
Coastline until today to complete the deal or withdraw.
VSEL says the deal is now off, although Coastline's advisers yesterday made
clear it has not been abandoned.
Coastline, a ship repair company, wants to buy the all-weather construction
hall, three dry docks and a wet basin. It is already leasing the facilities,
with 600 people employed. It plans to expand the workforce to 1,600 by the
end of next year.
VSEL's deadline, however, seems to have made it impossible to tie up loose
ends with Merseyside Development Corporation, a government agency with
planning authority over the site. Mr John Stafford, Coastline's chief
executive, wanted guarantees against future compulsory purchase and a Pounds
2m derelict land grant for environmental improvements. Without certainty of
these, he was not prepared to take the risk of purchase.
Compulsory purchase is an issue because Coastline was not trying to buy the
whole site - only the shipbuilding and ship repair facilities.
Mr Chris Farrow, corporation chief executive, said it was unlikely that
working shipbuilding and repair facilities would be sought for purchase.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Property deal shows stronger demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Amicable, the insurance and investment group, has agreed to buy the
Camberley Shopping Centre in Surrey for about Pounds 90m from the receivers
of Mountleigh, the property company that failed in May 1992.
The deal, the largest retail transaction since the sale last September of
Merry Hill, a shopping centre in the West Midlands, reflects the continued
strength of institutional demand for commercial property. Several
institutions, property companies and overseas buyers made bids for the
centre, which had an asking price of Pounds 77.5m.
The strong interest in the property contrasts with the absence of buyers
when it was first put on the market 18 months ago.
The 350,000 sq ft property has an annual rental income of about Pounds 7m.
The sale brings the total realised from Mountleigh's portfolio to more than
Pounds 250m.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Hercules grounded by labour on urinals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Significant structural repairs were needed to the RAF's 61 Hercules C-130
transport aircraft because of corrosion caused by leakage around urinals,
the Commons defence committee said yesterday.
'Spending a penny correctly would have saved tens of thousands of pounds,'
said the committee in a report on the programme to refurbish or replace the
Hercules fleet.
The MPs said they were deeply concerned that a relatively simple factor such
as leakage around urinals could lead to significant structural repairs - a
glassfibre shield has been recommended to protect the aircraft.
They also expressed dismay that wings that had already been replaced on the
1960s-built aircraft needed to be refurbished or replaced again.
Almost half the fleet is out of action at any one time because of corrosion
and ageing. The cross-party committee said this was 'unacceptable'.
Lockheed of the US has submitted a tender to replace part of the fleet with
the new Hercules C-130J. British Aerospace is urging refurbishment until the
European Future Large Aircraft (FLA) is available next century. The MPs
ruled out refurbishment and urged the MoD to replace half its fleet with the
C-130J by the year 2000. But when the remainder of the fleet is replaced,
the committee recommended buying a larger aircraft such as the FLA.

FT  31 MAR 94 / AGR N-plants lead performance table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's advanced gas-cooled (AGR) nuclear power plants performed better
than any other atomic reactor type in the world last year.
It is a remarkable transformation for a technology which scientists
struggled for years to operate efficiently.
Last year the AGRs' annual load factor was 73.68 per cent, just ahead of
pressurised water reactors at 73.16 per cent, according to Nuclear
Engineering International, the magazine for the industry.
Only three years ago the AGRs were the world's worst-performing nuclear
plants with load factors little better than 50 per cent.
The improvement has helped Nuclear Electric, operator of five AGR plants in
England and Wales, to increase its market share to more than 25 per cent
from less than 20 per cent three years ago.
It is making a bid to become the second largest generator in those countries
after National Power.
Scottish Nuclear operates two AGR stations.
The Nuclear Engineering International survey comes before a government
review of the nuclear industry.
In the review Nuclear Electric is pressing to be privatised, and to gain
approval to build a new station at Sizewell C in Suffolk.
It is thought that the government has agreed to study privatisation
possibilities in the review, the terms of reference for which are expected
to be published the week after next at the earliest.
Nuclear Electric said yesterday that it was on course to beat its 60
terrawatt hours target for the financial year, with about 39tWh coming from
the AGRs.
The improvement in AGR efficiency has been achieved by raising power
ratings, reducing downtimes, and improving refuelling and thermal
efficiencies.
The magazine's league table showed that eight of the world's 424 commercial
nuclear reactors had 100 per cent availability during the year.
Two of them are Magnox stations owned by Nuclear Electric - Hinkley Point A
2 and Oldbury 2. Five of the top 10 reactors last year were Japanese units.

FT  31 MAR 94 / MPs condemn handling of Pergau aid deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's handling of a Pounds 234m aid offer to Malaysia to help
build the Pergau dam was yesterday condemned in a unanimous report by the
most powerful of parliament's select committees.
The Commons public accounts committee, whose members include Mr Stephen
Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, criticised many aspects of the
government's handling of the dam deal in the three years to 1991. The report
acknowledged that Sir Timothy Lankester, former permanent secretary at the
Overseas Development Administration, had been right to seek a 'ministerial
direction' to spend money on the project in July 1991, thereby absolving
himself of blame for 'signing the cheques'.
It also blamed the government for not using numerous opportunities to
renegotiate the deal in 1989 and 1990.
But the committee stopped short of condemning the decision by Mr John Major,
the prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to give
final approval for the deal in July 1991, saying it could 'recognise the
government's reasons for going ahead with the project'.
Mr Hurd has repeatedly defended his decision to endorse the aid offer by
arguing that cancellation would have damaged Britain's wider interests in
the region.
The Commons foreign affairs committee, which is also investigating the deal,
may take a different view of the government's overall interests in pursuing
the Pergau deal. Its report, scheduled for the early summer, will also judge
the extent to which the deal was linked to a Pounds 1bn defence contract
between Britain and Malaysia concluded at the same time.
In its 30-page report the PAC says the ODA's two-day appraisal of the dam
project in March 1989 was 'superficial and inadequate'.
Giving evidence to the committee, Sir Timothy had said it was a 'lamentable
slip-up' that a longer appraisal was not conducted. The appraisal was cut
short because Baroness Thatcher, then Britain's prime minister, wanted to
give Dr Mahathir Mohamad, her Malaysian counterpart, an assurance of funding
at that time.
The PAC also expresses 'astonishment' that British contractors for the
project increased the overall cost from Pounds 316m to Pounds 397m two weeks
after Lady Thatcher and Dr Mahathir approved the deal.
This week representatives of the British contracting companies said the
Pounds 316m figure had been based on vague estimates of cost.
The PAC considers it was 'unacceptable' that the UK government should have
continued to make the offer to the Malaysian government based on the lower
figure.
'The government should have taken advantage of the lapses in the offer to
reconsider details of the scheme and examine how the project could be
adjusted,' the PAC says.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Channel 4 seeks review of ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel 4 is to seek a judicial review of a decision by the Broadcasting
Complaints Commission after complaints by two former chancellors of the
exchequer.
The commission found that Lord Howe and Lord Lawson were treated unfairly in
a Channel 4 programme on monetary policy, A Brief Economic History of Our
Times, made by Fulcrum Productions.
The commission came to its conclusion in spite of deciding that the
programme was not inaccurate in any way. It decided that the co-operation of
the two Tory peers was secured on a misleading basis.
The programme consisted, the commission found, of unrelieved criticism of
the handling of the economy by Lord Howe and Lord Lawson. Had they known the
programme makers' intentions, neither would have taken part, it said.
Channel 4 said it had considered issuing libel proceedings against
commission members, but this was considered unlikely to succeed because the
complaints body is statutory and its members are covered by qualified
privilege.
Channel 4 has been told, however, that it has a case to seek judicial review
of the decision on the grounds that the commission exceeded its powers.
It is believed that Lord Howe and Lord Lawson were given written questions
in advance by Fulcrum and also saw the extracts that were going to be used.
Lord Lawson was paid Pounds 1,000 for his interview. Lord Howe did not
receive a payment - apparently because he did not ask.
Lord Howe also complained to Fulcrum about 'negative' clips in the programme
of the main news events of the years. These included events such as the
Brighton bomb and the York Minster fire, and were used by Fulcrum to remind
people of what was going on apart from monetary policy.
Lord Howe complained in a letter to Fulcrum about the other events and
people portrayed, which included: ' . . . the Piper Alpha disaster, the
unexplained cripple in a wheelchair - even the fall of the Berlin wall is
made to look like an ugly riot.'
The 'unexplained cripple' mentioned by Lord Howe was Professor Stephen
Hawking, the physicist and author of A Brief History of Time.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Rival expected to take over LBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LBC, the troubled London commercial radio station, is likely to be taken
over by London News Network in the next few weeks if agreement can by
reached with receivers Arthur Andersen.
The station, which lost its two London licences to LNR and was then outbid
in the battle for the third national commercial radio licence, is expected
to continue broadcasting for the time being.
Mr Murdoch McKillop, one of the joint receivers appointed on Monday,
yesterday said he believed that LBC's audiences were increasing and that the
company would carry on broadcasting while its future prospects were
reviewed.
LBC, which is believed to be trading profitably, will cease broadcasting in
October when its licences run out.
One reason for calling in the receivers was the prospect that contingent
liabilities, including redundancy payments, would exceed assets.
The other was to concentrate the minds of LNR after talks had failed to
reach an agreement.
It would be very damaging for LNR if LBC were to go off the air prematurely,
dissipating both the audience and a 90-strong team of experienced
journalists.
LNR made clear yesterday that it wanted a 'seamless transition' from LBC to
the new licence holder.
The likeliest outcome is that LNR will buy the assets of LBC, including
goodwill, from the receiver and, in effect, begin broadcasting more than six
months early.
Talks between Mr McKillop and LNR began last night.
Talk Radio UK, the highest bidder for the national speech-based franchise,
is also monitoring events at LBC.
Yet if the company linked with LBC to try out some of its ideas in London,
they would have to go off the air for three months. The national licence
does not start until the beginning of next year.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Lib Dems offer pact to beat BNP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats yester-day launched an appeal for party politics to be
put on hold in part of east London in an attempt to prevent the far-right
British National party from making fresh gains in May's local elections,
David Owen writes.
The party said it was prepared to stand aside in the Tower Hamlets ward of
Millwall, where the BNP won its first local authority seat in a by-election
in September - if the Labour and Conservative parties offered to do the
same.
Labour - which holds the other two seats in the ward - rejected the
proposal.
The Liberal Democrats said their proposal would clear the way for a
'community' ticket of three candidates to be drawn up with the express
purpose of defeating the BNP.
Mr Peter Hughes, the Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrat leader, said his party's
proposals were 'probably the only real way' of defeating the BNP. But he
said Liberal Democrat candidates would stand down only if the other two
parties agreed to similar action.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said in a letter to Mr Hughes he
was 'glad decisive action is being taken to prevent fascism . . . gaining a
foothold in Britain'.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Row over jobless figures escalates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Angry letters between senior civil servants at the Department of Employment
and Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, were yesterday given
a public airing after he refused to apologise for making 'misleading
statements' about the official unemployment figures.
Mr Peter Stibbard, director of statistics at the department, has accused Mr
Prescott of misrepresenting the outcome of a meeting between them held
earlier this month.
He published the letters after Mr Prescott failed to retract his comments by
yesterday's deadline.
In a letter dated March 23, Mr Stibbard robustly denies a claim by Mr
Prescott that official statisticians 'now recognise that the unemployment
rate is certainly half a million more than is recorded' and had 'admitted
that changes in the way unemployment is counted have removed at least
400,000 people from the official figures'.
'I object very much to the way we have been used to shore up misleading
statements issued by Mr Prescott, particularly as we neither 'recognise' nor
'admitted' anything of the kind,' writes Mr Stibbard.
Mr Prescott, who made his comments earlier this month, yesterday stuck to
his assertion that the monthly statistics are a 'con on the public'.
'My dispute with the statistics is that they are not an accurate measure of
the level of unemployment, but that the government continues to represent
them as such,' he said.
'The monthly claimant count and quarterly Labour Force Survey both show
useful trends in the labour market. What neither show is how many people are
really out of work in the UK. That is why we need a new, broader measure to
run alongside the two,' he added.
Mr Stibbard's decision to publish the letter - a rare move for a senior
civil servant - is the latest twist in a long-standing row.
Critics of the government say the monthly claimant count, which includes
only people out of work and claiming benefit, does not capture the true
jobless total. They say it excludes nearly 1m, such as young people who are
not on Youth Training schemes but are not eligible for benefit, married
women seeking jobs and people who are on other forms of state support such
as sickness and disability benefit.
The department says its quarterly labour force survey, based on
International Labour Organisation guidelines, compensates for the
shortcomings of the claimant-count series.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Treasury optimistic on recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury yesterday painted an upbeat picture of the UK economic
recovery, and took a sanguine view on inflationary pressures, as it
published its monthly monetary report.
The report was prepared for the monthly meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, who
met yesterday.
Analysts believe that the meeting will not result in any immediate cut in
interest rates.
'I can't see how they can cut rates now, with sterling so weak and the bond
markets extremely jittery,' said Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at
stockbroker James Capel.
The monetary report is mainly a compendium of statistics but it contains
some judgmental statements on the health of the UK economy.
It says: 'The March CBI Monthly Trends survey was encouraging and suggested
that the economic recovery is not running out of steam.'
Referring to the recent clutch of economic statistics, it says: 'The latest
monthly indicators are again mixed, but still consistent with continuing
recovery.'
However, there is some acknowledgment of the likely impact of the
forthcoming tax increases. Discussing a Gallup survey of consumer confidence
in March, the report says: 'The fall (in confidence) may have reflected
speculation about the likely effects of the tax rises in April.'
There is no indication in the report that the Treasury is concerned about an
upsurge in inflation.

FT  31 MAR 94 / MMC lifts price control on condoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday lifted price controls on condoms supplied by LRC
Products, manufacturers of the Durex brand, after the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission said concern about Aids had created an increasingly competitive
market.
However Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said LRC, a subsidiary
of London International Group, would have to undertake not to enter into
agreements under which wholesalers or retailers stocked only its condoms.
Mr Hamilton said he had written to Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of
fair trading, asking him to negotiate such an undertaking with LRC. Sir
Bryan asked the commission to investigate the condom market in March last
year.
Controls on LRC's prices were introduced in 1982 after an earlier inquiry.
LRC, which has about 75 per cent of the UK market, told the current inquiry
that it would over time raise its prices to average European levels if the
controls were lifted.
The commission said, however, that changes in the market meant other
suppliers would challenge LRC if it raised prices. It said the easing of
condom advertising restrictions and government publicity campaigns had
resulted in a sharp increase in demand in 1987-88. Although growth later
slowed, the commission said it appeared to have picked up again in the past
two years.
Mates condoms, owned by Pacific Dunlop of Australia, were launched in 1987
and have a UK market share of 14 per cent.
The commission said condoms were now stocked in an increasingly wide range
of outlets, including supermarkets. Last year Superdrug Stores started the
first condom price war by cutting its prices by a third. The commission said
greater competition between retailers meant that an increase in LRC trade
prices would not necessarily be reflected fully in retail prices.
Mr Hamilton said he had considered the position of the National Health
Service, which purchased 23 per cent of UK condom supplies for free
distribution. He said the commission felt there would be sufficient
competition to protect the NHS. The NHS was in a position to look for
quality suppliers worldwide, he said.
London International Group said: 'Competition, supported by advertising and
marketing, could substantially increase the number of condom users, helping
further to reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies and to combat the
spread of HIV/Aids and other sexually transmitted diseases.'

FT  31 MAR 94 / Employee company ownership rules eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of companies owned by their employees through Employee Share
Ownership Plans (Esops), which give tax incentives for employee ownership,
is set to rise substantially after a technical change announced in the
finance bill earlier this week.
There are only two statutory Esops, created under the rules of the 1989
Finance Act. But there are about 50 'case law' Esops, set up outside the
terms of the act, which are simpler but less tax-efficient.
The Esop Centre, a lobby group, believes the total could now rise to about
500. The change removes the obligation for most of the trustees of statutory
Esops to be employees. This has been one of the main disincentives as
trustees are not protected from financial liability if a company fails.
The amendment, moved by Tory MP Mr Ian Taylor, was first floated in the Esop
Centre's Ten Point Plan for boosting the appeal of Esops. Mr Malcolm
Hurlston, the Centre's chairman, said: 'This change opens the door into the
workplace for statutory Esops. I am pleased that the government has given
new support to the Esop.'

European Union health ministers yesterday dismissed German attempts to
impose a ban on UK beef exports.
Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, replied by threatening to
seek a unilateral ban from his government, but his support has yet to be
tested. He had sought a ban on exports of live cattle and beef from the UK,
arguing that bovine spongiform encephalopathy - 'mad cow disease' - could
enter the food chain.
Brussels made clear once more that it would take legal action if Germany
attempted to impose a unilateral ban.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Banks given fraud warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England has warned banks to be alert to frauds where their names
might be used to persuade investors to put money into complex schemes
offering high returns, Alison Smith and Robert Rice write.
Mr Michael Foot, head of banking supervision at the Bank, warned of 'prime
bank guarantee frauds' - schemes in which a fraudster promotes low-cost or
high-return bonds said to be issued or guaranteed by well-known banks, but
restricted to professional investors. Would-be investors must pay an advance
fee before being let in on the deal. The 'prime bank' may be unaware its
name is being used.
He emphasised that supervisors needed 'full, frank and prompt information'
from banks to enable them to focus their monitoring properly.
The Bank has also decided against any significant extension of the scope of
regulation or of the powers of regulators.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Panic and rumours upset skittish Tories: Leadership fears
sweeping the Commons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will he stay or will he go? If he goes, when will he go? And when he goes,
how will he go? Mr John Major's leadership was the only issue in Westminster
yesterday.
Throughout the day, the Westminster hothouse was feverish. An abusive front
page in the increasingly disloyal Daily Mail added to anxiety on the Tory
back benches that the prime minister's compromise on Europe had crippled his
leadership.
There was panic in the air. A flurry of pre-lunchtime ministerial meetings
led to rumours that several ministers - perhaps the prime minister himself -
might be on the verge of quitting.
The first rumour was that cabinet ministers were in Number 10 discussing
somebody's future. But no, the meeting was on the government's efficiency
white paper.
Then there was news that Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, had driven
to the home of Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury and
a fellow rightwinger, for breakfast. A bit of rightwing plotting? 'Come on,
Michael is having chats with people the whole time,' said an MP close to the
home secretary.
By the evening, nerves had calmed. But the mood among backbench Tory MPs was
bleak as they prepared for a grim and pensive 10-day Easter break. Much will
depend on their mood when they come back. As one said, they are exhausted at
the end of a long session of committees and late-night votes.
If yesterday's despondency has not lifted after the Easter break, even Mr
Major's staunchest supporters say they will look elsewhere for leadership.
It was pointed out yesterday that the political complexion of MPs attacking
the prime minister has changed. For the past 18 months the right of the
party has sniped at him on Europe and on the welfare state.
Now, some rightwing Tories are hesitating to go in for the kill, fearing
that they have no candidate to pitch against Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade
and industry secretary, or Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
As one staunch rightwinger put it: 'I'll do anything to stop Heseltine's
white-knuckle ride.'
It is MPs on the centre-left of the party, the pro-European wing, who are
now getting nervous about the prime minister's prospects.
'There are people round here backing Michael Heseltine who would have had
nothing good to say for him three months ago,' said one MP. Another said:
'You should have seen the number of MPs wheedling around Heseltine last
night.'
It is the doubts of these MPs, the sensible, utterly pro-Major tendency,
that could rock him.
'He is finished,' said a former minister at the centre of the political
spectrum. 'There is a growing inevitability about things.' He predicted that
even a ridiculous 'stalking horse' candidate in a leadership race could
trigger enough abstentions to damage Mr Major seriously.
Another pro-European back-bencher who was happy with the result on qualified
majority voting, said: 'What has damaged him so much is his tactics. They
have helped no one.'
A member of the 1922 executive - one of the 'men in grey suits' - was no
more encouraging. 'His performance in question time last Tuesday was the
last straw. It was very, very damaging because it raised the spirits of the
large group of MPs who had held their noses while supporting the government
on Maastricht, only to disappoint them again.'
A handful of MPs still expressed support. 'There are simply no other
candidates whom the party can back and stay united,' said one. Another said:
'The state of the economy is still the key card he has to play.'
But unqualified and unreserved support for the Conservative party leader was
nowhere to be heard.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Binder firms see merger backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The four largest regional partnerships within BDO Binder Hamlyn, the UK's
eighth-largest accountancy firm, have expressed tentative support for a
merger with Arthur Andersen, the fourth largest, it emerged yesterday.
Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle and the partnership covering London and
Leeds all expressed support for the idea of a merger, proposed by Andersen
earlier this month.
These four represent more than two-thirds of Binder's total partners and
more than 70 per cent of staff and fee income, making approval for the
merger highly likely if the final terms are favourable. The remaining
partnerships are still considering the proposals, with Scotland currently
most opposed. The others are East Anglia, Northern Ireland, Bristol, Poole,
Nottingham and Wolverhampton.
Those involved in the discussions, which include topics such as partner
equity and responsibility for any litigation, are hoping to present outline
'heads of agreement' for the merger to all Binder's partners next week.
In a memo to senior partners on Monday, Mr Adrian Burn, Binder's managing
partner, said that the initial proposals would allow the firm to maintain a
separate identity within an enlarged Andersen, and continue to practise
under the Binder Hamlyn name.
He stressed that any merger would not lead to material changes in personnel,
the manner in which clients were served, or fees charged.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Hurd walks Euro tightrope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservatives will campaign for the European elections on a platform
which stresses both the importance of the European parliament and the
party's commitment to national sovereignty, it emerged yesterday.
In a letter to all Conservative MPs and MEPs, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, urged the party to raise its sights from the debacle over
enlargement of the European Union.
Mr Hurd, the Conservative campaign manager for the election, distributed a
six-page statement of election themes, approved by Mr John Major, the prime
minister.
The document sets out to bridge the deep divisions between the party's
federalist wing, which is strongest among MEPs, and the rebellious minority
of Euro-sceptics at Westminster.
Party strategists believe the document is sufficiently broadly based to
quell murmurs of revolt from both wings that have threatened to destabilise
the Tory campaign.
However, senior ministers remain fearful that the Conservatives will perform
badly in the June 9 elections. A full-scale manifesto is expected to be
published after local government elections on May 5.
Mr Hurd told the MPs and MEPs in his letter: 'A contrast has to be made
clear between our vision of a decentralised, free-trading Europe built on
the nation states, and the centralised, interventionist, bureaucratic
superstate after which Labour and the Liberal Democrats hanker. I believe we
can unite behind an approach of this kind,' he said.
'We have the opportunity over the next few years, in particular at the
intergovernmental conference of 1996, to shape a European Union in which we
can feel comfortable. Our job now is to get that across.'
The campaign document answers complaints from MEPs that the campaign for the
last election in 1989 was too negative by acknowledging that the European
parliament has 'powers and influence'.
It accuses the parliament's socialist majority of obstructing the European
single market, and claims that Labour MEPs are committed to creating 'a
socialist superstate'.
However, the guide aims to please Euro-sceptics by drawing a clear
distinction between Westminster and the Union. It says the European
parliament 'is not a sovereign parliament like ours in Britain'.
It also emphasises Conservative opposition to the transfer of further powers
from London to the Union, and stresses British support for subsidiarity -
the principle of minimum interference in national affairs.
'The nation state is here to stay. That has been the clear message of
British Conservative governments,' the guide says. 'We don't want a Europe
which interferes in every detail of national life. Conservatives are opposed
to the creation of a federal European state.'
The document appeals to the party to 'set out the case for a more flexible,
decentralised Europe which respects national feeling and the nation state'.

FT  31 MAR 94 / 'Misleading' Maxwell receiver reprimanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading insolvency practitioner charged with recovering assets belonging
to Robert Maxwell was yesterday severely criticised by the Commons social
security committee for allegedly misleading MPs.
Mr Peter Phillips of Buchler Phillips, who is the receiver of the Maxwell
personal estate, over-emphasised potential recoveries in a way which allowed
his firm to 'maximise its fee income and to garner more publicity
opportunities', the committee says in a report published yesterday.
It claims that he had provided estimates of gross potential realisations
from the estate of more than Pounds 8.7m, when he knew the figure he would
be able to collect was far smaller.
The scathing report is the most critical yet issued by the committee,
chaired by Labour MP Mr Frank Field, which began examining the operation of
pension funds in July 1991 after the collapse of the Maxwell business
empire.
The report concludes that the personal estate of Mr Maxwell should now be
declared insolvent and a trustee in bankruptcy appointed. It urges that this
job should not be given to Mr Phillips.
Mr Phillips yesterday said he was 'outraged' at the report. 'I can only view
this as a publicity-seeking exercise from a committee which sadly, after
months of investigation, has produced nothing of any impact,' he said in a
statement. 'Mr Field has continually and deliberately ignored the facts I
have presented to him. With hindsight I now regret the enormous amount of
time I have spent helping the committee.'
The report says that Mr Phillips and his lawyers, Nabarro Nathanson, have
charged more in fees - at Pounds 1.1m - than the total value of the Maxwell
assets that he will be able to recover.
It says that his firm's and his lawyers' average hourly fees - at Pounds 167
and Pounds 193 respectively - are the highest rates among the four sets of
Maxwell insolvency practitioners, and highlights that he charged a higher
proportion of his work at partner rates than the other firms.
Mr Phillips said the work he was carrying out needed more experienced
staffing, and stressed that he had recovered assets totalling more than
Pounds 5.3m, much of which had then been claimed by other parties.
Members of the committee were irritated by early discussions they held with
Mr Phillips at which they believe they were misled over the amount of money
that he would be able to realise.
Mr Neil Cooper, of accountants Robson Rhodes, liquidator of the
Maxwell-controlled fund manager Bishopsgate Investment Management, said:
'There remain a number of questions to be answered on Maxwell to do with
banking, regulation, the duties of auditors and the like. I think they are
much more important than this sort of thing.'

FT  31 MAR 94 / Price of keeping Jaguar in native habitat may rise: The
carmaker's strong position over government aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's decision to give Jaguar Pounds 9.4m grant aid to persuade
it to keep assembly of its new sports car in the UK could be dwarfed by the
scale of the support that would be needed to ensure the company's next new
range is manufactured in Britain.
Jaguar, the British luxury carmaker, acquired an array of new options for
production locations after its Pounds 1.6bn takeover by Ford of the US late
in 1989.
Ford - which has made little secret of its pique at the UK government's
strong support and encouragement for the rival Japanese carmakers Nissan,
Toyota and Honda in the UK - is clearly determined to extract maximum
advantage from any 'mobile' investment projects.
Outside the company it had always been taken for granted that the new luxury
sports car range - to replace the XJS coupe and convertible - would be
produced at Jaguar's plants at Castle Bromwich, Birmingham (body welding and
paint), and Browns Lane, Coventry (trim and final assembly).
But Ford made clear to the Department of Trade and Industry that the car -
code-named X100 - could just as well be assembled at its plant at Azambuja,
Portugal, where the authorities were ready to provide handsome amounts of
state aid to acquire such a prestige project.
This time Pounds 9.4m was enough to keep the X100 project in the UK. It is
likely that much more will be needed when the bidding starts to attract the
project for Jaguar's planned smaller sports saloon.
The project - code-named X200 - is for the development of a new car range
for Jaguar, below the XJ6 luxury saloon, which would compete with rivals
such as the BMW 5-Series.
This car, planned for production towards the end of the decade, could
radically increase Jaguar's production volumes, but it is far from clear
that it would be built in the UK.
No final decision has yet been made, but it is expected that the new car
would be a derivative from a new range of rear-wheel drive cars planned by
Ford for production in North America.
The Jaguar version could be assembled in the UK, but it may need a large of
amount of state aid to convince the US carmaker to make such a choice.
Ford has faced a difficult ride with Jaguar in its early years of ownership.
It has been in loss for the past five years and is not expected to return to
profit until 1995.
Its fortunes are improving after radical restructuring and help from rising
demand in the US and the UK, its two main markets. It should be further
boosted by the launch later this year of the substantially revamped version
of its XJ6 luxury saloon, the X300.
Jaguar cut its operating loss last year to Dollars 371m from a loss of
Dollars 412m in 1992 and one of Dollars 354m in 1991. Last year it increased
its retail sales by 22 per cent to 27,000 - including a 47 per cent jump in
sales in the US to 13,000.

FT  31 MAR 94 / PIA urged to register agents individually
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect private
investors, should register every adviser and sales agent individually, one
of the regulators it is replacing said yesterday.
Sir Kenneth Clucas, chairman of Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for
independent financial advisers, told the cross-party Treasury committee of
MPs that Fimbra was 'disappointed' that the PIA had been deterred from
opting for individual registration because the number of sales agents
employed by life companies was so great.
Fimbra registers IFAs individually, but the numbers in that sector of the
financial services industry are significantly smaller. Both a system of
individual registration and a publicly available register of those who have
been subject to disciplinary action have been among the ideas backed most by
MPs in the inquiry into financial regulation.
Sir Kenneth, who originally proposed a single regulator for retail financial
services, also suggested that the Securities and Investments Board, the
City's chief regulator, should be made more accountable.
He proposed that it should be answerable to the Audit Commission, the
government's spending watchdog.
In the Commons MPs raised some fundamental doubts about the regulatory
system - in particular about the way it had operated over the sale of
personal pensions to people transferring or opting out of occupational
schemes.
Addressing what he admitted was an area of concern, Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, said the government would soon issue guidance for
employers on how they could advise their employees about pensions -
including personal pensions - without infringing the Financial Services Act.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, accused the government of
having allowed 'unacceptable practices' to develop in the selling of
personal pensions.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour spokesman on City affairs, forecast that the
establishment of the PIA would prove to be a 'stop-gap solution'.
Replying to the debate, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the
Treasury, described the PIA as the 'best show in town' and said he believed
it was 'on track'. He insisted: 'The PIA should not be deflected by the
self-interest of some of its detractors.'
A Labour motion condemning the government's failure to prevent widespread
abuse in the sale of personal pensions and advocating direct regulation of
the pensions and financial services industry was defeated by 55 votes
(309-254).

FT  31 MAR 94 / Lilley issues rightwing warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the four rightwing cabinet ministers who argued against the
compromise deal over European Union voting rights last night warned Mr John
Major not to turn his back on the Thatcherite ideas that underpinned Tory
success in the 1980s.
In a defiantly upbeat speech, Mr Peter Lilley, the social security
secretary, predicted that Conservative ideas that dominated the economic
debate in the 1980s were set similarly to dominate European policy in this
decade.
But, delivering the first Spectator lecture, he said that this agenda needed
to be developed 'with vigour and conviction'.
He urged the party to do more to 'debunk the fallacies' of European
supranationalism.
Mr Lilley called on the party to 'emphasise the positive side of our own
vision of Europe'.
Self-government was 'a good thing, not a bad thing'. Voluntary co-operation
was 'much better than subordination'. Free markets were 'better agents of
change, harmonisation and solidarity within the Community than are central
directives, transfers and programmes'.
He added: 'Ideas of choice and competition, less government rather than
more, self-reliance rather than dependency, still ring true with most
people's experience and chime with their values.'
He said Conservatives were united in favour of a 'co-operative,
decentralised Europe'.
Mr Lilley said that the real divide on Europe was not within the Tory party.
Instead, he claimed that the commitment to a free market was now in the
centre ground of British politics and that it would become 'the centre
ground of European politics as the decade proceeds'.
The biggest difference was between the Conservatives on the one hand, and
Labour and the Liberal Democrats on the other, the latter being
'increasingly committed to submerging Britain in a super-state'.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Channel 4 challenges ruling on complaints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel 4 is to seek a judicial review of a decision by the Broadcasting
Complaints Commission after complaints by two former chancellors.
The commission found that Lord Howe and Lord Lawson were treated unfairly in
a Channel 4 programme on monetary policy, A Brief Economic History of Our
Times, made by Fulcrum Productions.
The commission came to its conclusion in spite of deciding that the
programme was not inaccurate in any way. It decided that the co-operation of
the two Tory peers was secured on a misleading basis.
The programme consisted, the commission found, of unrelieved criticism of
the handling of the economy by Lord Howe and Lord Lawson. Had they known the
programme makers' intentions, neither would have taken part, it said.
Channel 4 has been told it has a case for judicial review on the grounds
that the commission exceeded its powers.
Lord Howe also complained to Fulcrum about 'negative' clips in the programme
of the main news events of the years.
He said these included: ' . . . the Piper Alpha disaster, the unexplained
cripple in a wheelchair - even the fall of the Berlin wall is made to look
like an ugly riot'.
The 'unexplained cripple' was Professor Stephen Hawking, the physicist and
author of A Brief History of Time.

New credits worth Dollars 650m are being sought from the IMF's Extended Fund

3.5-4.5 per cent, on a projected inflation of 8.5-10 per cent. If the
Philippines meets all targets specified in the letter, this package will be
its 'exit programme' from the IMF, according to Mr Singson.

Production halted yesterday at the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea,

went on strike, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The strikers were protesting at
alleged bribing of officials to obtain visas for expatriates. But in Port
Moresby, BHP said it had already conducted an internal investigation into
these accusations, and found no wrongdoing. It expressed surprise they had
been cited as grounds for industrial action.
BHP said it viewed the strike as illegal under PNG's industrial relations
laws, and had called on the labour department for assistance. Ok Tedi has a
relatively stable industrial relations record, but suffered three industrial
disputes last year, which shut the mine for several days.

Korea continued to baulk. The Chinese indicated they were opposed to an
alternative plan, favoured by the US, UK, France and Russia, to pass a
resolution aimed at North Korea.
Security Council President Jean-Bernard Merimee of France Merimee said he
still expected a resolution to be put to the vote today. He believed China
would abstain rather than veto it. While a resolution would carry greater
weight than a Security Council statement, a Chinese abstention would weaken
the message conveyed to North Korea.

negotiations, which began in January, had made faster progress than expected
and he hoped for an initial draft treaty text by late spring 1995.
A treaty could be finished just before or just after the April 1995
conference on extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. A number of
developing nations have made a test ban treaty a condition of their agreeing
to an indefinite extension of the NPT.
Mr Marin-Bosch said there seemed to be broad agreement for the treaty 'to
ban all tests in all environments for all time'. This would include
so-called 'peaceful' nuclear explosions as well as nuclear weapons tests,
though the possibility of exceptions was being discussed. The treaty would
contain verification measures and provisions for sanctions against countries
violating the ban.
China, the only one of the five declared nuclear powers still testing atomic
weapons, says it will stop tests after 1995.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Bank chief urges curb on deficit

Mr Bernie Fraser, Australia's Reserve Bank governor, yesterday threw his
weight behind a faster curtailment of the federal budget deficit, suggesting
additional revenues generated by a sudden surge in economic growth be used
for this purpose.
He warned that a rise in interest rates could be required 'in due course',
but added: 'The time to begin that adjustment is still some way off.'
Mr Fraser said the government's goal of reducing the budget deficit to
around 1 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97 was a useful
benchmark.
However, he added: 'Given the present outlook, the case is for doing more,
rather than less.
'Calls to use any higher revenues flowing from a stronger economy, the
so-called growth dividend, to boost spending, rather than reduce the
deficit, are misguided in my view,' he said.
Mr Fraser's comments come as the Labor government is drawing up its 1994-95
finance plans ahead of the May 10 budget. It has already come under pressure
from its own rank and file, and from minor parties, to use any additional
revenues to fund various social and infrastructure programmes, and to tackle
the country's double-digit unemployment rate.
Mr Fraser's comments, together with some much-as-expected balance of
payments figures for February, helped steady the fast falling bond and
equity markets yesterday, although both share and bond prices ended slightly
lower. The balance of payments data showed a current account deficit of
ADollars 1.256bn (Pounds 890m) last month, compared with a revised deficit
of ADollars 1.233bn in January.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Japanese unions faced with a dwindling role: They have been
slow to match up to falling membership and new conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the Japanese Electrical, Electronic and Information Union
recently held a mock strike in preparation for shunto, or the 'spring
struggle', Japan's annual wage offensive.
'Some of our members have never experienced a strike, so we simulated one
for the experience,' explains Mr Yukuo Ajima, bureau director of the JEIU,
which represents the country's electronics and software industries.
But in the event, the JEIU and private railway unions, which were also
threatening to strike, opted to avert stoppages and settle for less than
they had demanded.
The current wage round is proving to be producing the most modest wage
settlements in recent Japanese history.
Average wage increases, which are at present running at about 3 per cent,
are likely to be the lowest since shunto began some 40 years ago.
Despite the show of resistance by some unions, such as the JEIU, this year's
shunto has followed a familiar pattern of compromise that has characterised
Japan's labour movement for the past 20 years.
The wage settlements for others in the IMF-JC, a grouping which represents
the key steel, shipbuilding, electrical appliance and car industries, have
been in line with levels that had been widely publicised beforehand.
The predictability of the shunto agreements has raised questions about the
relevance of the annual event and the willingness of union leaders to put up
a decent fight for their members.
'The past 20 years have been a labour-management honeymoon,' charges Prof
Ryohei Magota of the International Buddhist University, who is a specialist
on labour relations. 'Japanese labour unions have become just another
business division within the company and cannot be expected to play a major
role in reforming society.'
In the wage negotiation ritual, labour and management gradually move closer
to each other's position, with a very good idea of how far the other is
likely to compromise.
Indeed, the results of the spring wage offensive have been forecast with
considerable accuracy by William Mercer, the consultancy which boasts an
average discrepancy of just 0.1 per cent between its forecast and the actual
agreed rate of increase for the past nine years.
Japanese unions are enterprise-based rather than industry-wide, and as a
result, tend to identify strongly with the interests of the company.
If unions are convinced, for example, that a high wage increase would hurt
the company's competitiveness, and thus would end up eventually damaging the
prospects of the workers themselves, they tend not to ask for much of an
increase, says Prof Atsushi Seike of the labour economics faculty at Keio
University.
Japanese management for its part also tries to maintain smooth relations
with workers, points out Prof Michio Nitta at Tokyo University. Nissan, for
example, has agreed a 2.89 per cent increase for its workers despite making
a loss this year.
But as Japan's economic growth has stalled and as industrial restructuring
proceeds, unionisation has fallen steadily over the past decade. After
falling below 30 per cent of the workforce in 1983, the proportion declined
to 24.2 per cent last year.
The fall is attributed to the growing number of people working in new
industries where organising labour has been difficult, and to the rising
number of part-time workers.
But there is little question that more workers feel that unions have not
lived up to expectations.
'Wages have not increased substantially over the past several years and more
people feel that the high union fees are not worth paying,' notes Mr Magota.
'It is doubtful whether Japanese labour unions in general are able to
protect the interests of their members,' admits Mr Takumi Takeuchi,
vice-president of the East Japan Railway Workers Union.
Unions have, for example, often been willing to sacrifice current gains for
future benefits. During the late 1980s, when the Japanese economy was
growing strongly, unions, particularly in the motor sector, did not press
for significant wage increases.
Instead, they allowed management to channel excess funds into capital
investment in the hope that this would raise the competitiveness of their
companies.
But with the current slowdown, far from reaping the benefits of their hard
work and modest demands during the good years, workers are suffering the
impact of excess capacity in their industries. The result was damaging from
a macro-economic perspective as well, in that it allowed companies not only
to increase capital investment but to turn to speculation, Mr Seike says.
Unions have also been slow to address other trends such as companies
introducing some forms of merit-based pay, which make the conditions and
interests of workers much less uniform than they have been in the past.

coalition

<TEXT>
Japan's prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa faced mounting criticism from
within the ruling coalition yesterday over attempts to push for political
realignment.
Strong opposition from the left wing of the coalition forced Mr Hosokawa to
shelve his plan to form a policy study group comprising coalition members,
independents and some members of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. It
was feared such a group might become a new party.
Mr Hosokawa's political manoeuvrings have widened a growing divide between
the coalition's left and right wings. The Social Democratic party, the
largest coalition member, as well as the New Harbinger party and the
Democratic Socialist party, which form the leftist camp in the coalition,
resisted Mr Hosokawa's moves.
The coalition's two camps differ over economic, fiscal and industrial
policies. On international affairs, Mr Ozawa's conservatives favour an
internationally active Japan, while the liberals want a lower profile.
Those on the left are suspicious of the right wing's aim in fielding single
joint candidates against the LDP in the next general election.
They are against the strong-armtechniques of Mr Ichiro Ozawa of the Japan
Renewal party, the government's backroom powerbroker, and Mr Yuichi Ichikawa
of the Buddhist-backed Komeito, or Clean Government party. They believe Mr
Ozawa and his allies are masterminding Mr Hosokawa's plans.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, leader of the SDP, said setting up such a group 'would
cause confusion within the coalition (and) should be avoided when the budget
for next fiscal year is being delayed.'
Parliamentary debate on the Y73,080bn (Pounds 705bn) budget plan for the
year starting tomorrow has been stalled due to the parliamentary wrangle
over a Y100m loan made to Mr Hosokawa a decade ago by Sagawa Kyubin
transport company.
While Mr Hosokawa has denied any impropriety, his public approval rate has
declined steadily. The LDP is also pressingMr Hosokawa to make clear his
role in the purchase of 300 Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shares by his
father-in-law in 1986.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Japanese court yesterday ordered Matsushita, the leading electronics
group, to pay damages to an Osaka construction company in a landmark case
which could have an impact on product liability legislation Japan is
considering adopting.
The Osaka district court ruled that a fire which destroyed the office of the
plaintiff originated in a television set manufactured by Matsushita. The
ruling is the first ever in Japan to acknowledge a consumer electronics
manufacturer's liability for its products.
Under Japanese law the burden of proof in product liability cases lies with
the consumer.
Presiding Judge Takeshi Mizuno said in his ruling that 'if a maker bearing
the high responsibility of guaranteeing the safety of its products does not
prove specifically that there was no defect, it cannot escape responsibility
for the error'.
The ruling was expected to trigger further debate about the need for a
product liability law in Japan.
Hitherto, Japan has lagged behind the US and other industrialised countries
in introducing this form of consumer protection.
A draft law is expected to be presented to parliament in April. Product
liability legislation is expected to be finally introduced in fiscal 1995.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Japan's output 'disappointing'

</DATELINE>

Japan's industrial production increased 0.2 per cent in February against the
previous month.
The figure, released by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
yesterday, disappointed economists who had expected an increase of between
0.8 per cent and 3 per cent.
Miti forecast production would increase 4.7 per cent next month but fall 3.4
per cent in April, adding it was too early to say whether industrial output
had hit bottom. The yen's continuing appreciation threatened demand and the
direction demand was taking remained unclear.
Mr Mike Naldrett, economist at stockbroker Kleinwort Benson, said production
data tended to be distorted by the end of the March financial year when
companies boosted output to increase sales.
'This is the sort of thing that happens in Japan in spring. It's impossible
to judge whether the economy is on the move from one month,' Mr Naldrett
said.
'Production is likely to be up in the first quarter, down in the second, and
we'll really have to wait until the third quarter to know what's happening.'
Transport output, primarily cars, was down 13.2 per cent, depressing the
overall figures. This was partly because the sales tax on cars is due to be
cut in April and manufacturers were anticipating a fall in demand until
then.
The small increase in industrial output in February compared with a 1 per
cent rise in January. Shipments rose 1.2 per cent during February, while the
inventory index dropped 1 per cent. Miti said inventories remained high.
Continuing problems afflicting manufacturing industry were underlined
yesterday when the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan announced that capital
spending by Japanese companies had been cut by a record 6.5 per cent during
the 1993 financial year.
It forecast expenditure would fall another 4.2 per cent during 1994. The
only sector increasing capital spending would be electronics, up 4.3 per
cent, it said.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Hopes rise for agreeing nuclear test ban treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty (CTBT) could be completed by early
1995, according to Mr Miguel Marin-Bosch, chairman of the United Nations
negotiating committee, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. He said yesterday
that the negotiations, which began in January, had made faster progress than
expected and he hoped for an initial draft treaty text by late spring.
A treaty was 'do-able in a relatively short time of 12-18 months', he added,
enabling it to be finished just before or just after the April 1995
conference on extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
A number of developing nations have made a CTBT a condition of their
agreeing to an indefinite extension of the NPT.
Mr Marin-Bosch, Mexico's ambassador to the UN Disarmament Conference in
Geneva, said there seemed to be broad agreement for the treaty 'to ban all
tests in all environments for all time'. This would include so-called
'peaceful' nuclear explosions as well as nuclear weapons tests, though the
possibility of exceptions was being discussed. The treaty would contain
extensive verification measures and provisions for economic sanctions
against those violating the ban.
There was universal support for a CTBT despite 'varying degrees of
enthusiasm', Mr Marin-Bosch went on. China, which is still testing atomic
weapons despite a moratorium by the other four declared nuclear powers, has
said it will not test after 1995.
More than 2,000 nuclear tests have been carried out since the second world
war, equivalent to one a week, the majority by the US and the former Soviet
Union.

FT  31 MAR 94 / De Klerk ready for KwaZulu showdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South African President F W de Klerk last night appeared ready to impose
emergency measures in the KwaZulu black 'homeland'. The KwaZulu government
vowed to resist any crackdown with force.
Amid fears of further violent confrontation, the South African cabinet met
for several hours to consider whether to impose a full state of emergency in
Natal/KwaZulu province or more limited emergency measures. These would be
aimed at halting political violence which has left a record 266 dead this
month in Natal/KwaZulu and allow next month's all-race elections to take
place.
Mr de Klerk is expected to announce the government's next step at a press
conference today after pressure from the African National Congress to
declare an immediate state of emergency. KwaZulu is run by Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, whose Inkatha Freedom party wants the April polls delayed.
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, said yesterday: 'We would want
the state of emergency to be declared right away. It is quite clear that the
chief minister and Inkatha are determined to drown the country in blood in
their determination to stop the election from taking place.'
In the latest of a series of atrocities in Natal, five ANC members were
executed when they were sent as peace envoys to a migrant workers' hostel
controlled by Inkatha. A survivor of the attack said the killers had told
him they were avenging the deaths of Inkatha members in shootings in
Johannesburg on Monday. In a separate incident, a busload of Inkatha
self-defence unit members was ambushed by ANC supporters near Eshowe, in
northern Natal. No deaths were reported.
Comments from Inkatha officials including Chief Buthelezi have added to the
mood of impending confrontation. Mr Ziba Jiyane, an Inkatha spokesman,
yesterday responded to rumours of an imminent declaration of a state of
emergency by warning that 'we have not made a secret about the fact that we
will resist' while Chief Buthelezi said Monday's violence was the beginning
of 'a final struggle to the finish between the ANC and the Zulu nation'.
What took place in Johannesburg was 'only the precursor of what will yet
come', he said, warning ominously: 'There is no saying what the people will
do in taking the law into their own hands.'
ANC officials are confident that imposition of a state of emergency will
dramatically reduce violence in Natal and leave Chief Buthelezi isolated,
but emergency measures could backfire, infuriating Inkatha members and Zulu
royalists and provoking more atrocities.
Even the intervention of the security forces with emergency powers may not
be enough to restore stability. KwaZulu's fragmented and mountainous
geography makes it difficult to fight a guerrilla force like Inkatha's,
however badly armed; and it is not clear whether the security forces will
pursue the fight with vigour against a party which many of its members still
consider to be the government's natural ally.
Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, yesterday insisted that the crisis in
Natal could not be allowed to delay the elections. 'Any attempt to postpone
the elections or drown them in blood cannot be countenanced,' he said in a
speech read on his behalf at a business meeting in Johannesburg.

FT  31 MAR 94 / More Israelis take hard line over Hebron: A growing mood for
vengeance is abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Across Israel, Jewish families sat down at home at the start of this week's
seven-day Passover festival for the Seder, the annual retelling of the
Israelite exodus from slavery in Egypt and the arduous journey to the
Promised Land.
Towards the end of the Seder service, after the Passover meal has been
eaten, the front door of the home is traditionally opened and a paragraph of
prayer read aloud that has always seemed problematic to some liberal Jews.
'Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen who have not known thee,' it exhorts
Jehovah. 'Pursue them and destroy them in anger, from under the heavens of
the Lord.'
This year, barely a month since Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein poured out
his wrath in a stream of gunfire at rows of kneeling Palestinian worshippers
inside Hebron's Tomb of the Patriarchs, that Passover prayer seemed
particularly inappropriate. Indeed, a group of liberal Israeli rabbis issued
a statement urging Israelis to excise it from the Seder ceremony.
Ms Shulamit Aloni, the left-wing communications minister who has little love
for Jewish religious traditions, concurred. The desire for vengeance against
Palestinians who know not the Jewish God, she reasoned, was apparently all
too widely endorsed already among sections of the Israeli public.
An opinion poll earlier this month showed that one in 10 Israelis refuse to
condemn the Hebron massacre, arguing that it should be 'understood against
the background of Arab terror against Jews,' and 3.6 per cent actually
praise Goldstein's actions.
In the first hours after the February 25 killings, Israeli leaders across
the political spectrum fell over themselves to issue condemnations, to
assert that what Goldstein had done was inhumane, 'unJewish'.
But in the days and weeks since, other voices have been heard, first
defending Goldstein, then praising him. The first to speak up were his
colleagues in the Kach movement, disciples of the ideology developed by the
late Rabbi Meir Kahane, which elevates the killing of Arabs to the status of
a divine mission. Next, Rabbi Dov Lior, spiritual leader of Goldstein's home
settlement Kiryat Arba, eulogised him at his funeral as a Jewish hero. Rabbi
Yisrael Ariel, head of a Jerusalem religious institute, declared he followed
in the glorious tradition of that legendarily powerful biblical figure
Samson.
But then the voices spread out of the ideological hothouses and towards the
mainstream. Condemning the massacre at a gathering of Jerusalem
schoolteachers, Mr Micha Goldman, deputy education minister, found himself
heckled by educators who endorsed Goldstein's assertion of Jewish pride.
Participants in a TV debate intended to explore the evils of Goldstein's
actions were struck dumb when a teenager in the audience took the microphone
to declare he and others in his school had stood to attention and marked a
minute's silence in honour of Goldstein's suicidal heroism.
On a different level, Israel's two chief rabbis last week appealed to the
government to release temporarily the handful of leading Kach activists
placed in administrative detention in the wake of the massacre. It was
Passover, the rabbis pleaded. These men should be at home with their
families.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin rejected that request, remarking that if the
massacre had been shocking, the growing evidence of support for the murder
of Arabs was more so.

The Belizeans say Guatemala's 130-year-old claim was revived in a letter

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso yesterday resigned as Brazil's finance
minister, as expected, in order to run in October's presidential elections.
His replacement is Mr Rubens Ricupero, a former ambassador in Washington,
who is due to take up his new post soon after Easter.
Mr Cardoso said his departure would not endanger the anti-inflation package
he has negotiated through Congress. 'If there was a risk the plan would be
altered, I wouldn't consider leaving,' he said. 'The programme's complete,
there's nothing left to do.'
Mr Ricupero says he fully supports the plan and will keep Mr Cardoso's team
of advisers.
The biggest doubt about the implementation of the final stage of the plan, a
new currency, stems from President Itamar Franco. Although he allowed Mr
Cardoso to run economic policy, even where it contradicted the president's
populist instincts, it is not clear whether Mr Ricupero will have the same
freedom.
Inflation is not likely to fall until a new currency is introduced later
this year. According to some indicators, inflation has increased sharply in
recent weeks to over 40 per cent a month. If prices continue to rise, there
is a risk Mr Franco will demand urgent, unorthodox action.
Today is the last effective day for candidates to resign from office before
the constitutionally imposed deadline. Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the
left wing Workers' Party leads the opinion polls. Other main candidates are
Mr Orestes Quercia, who has the backing of the Brazilian Democratic
Movement, the country's largest political party.
Mr Paulo Maluf, right-wing mayor of Sao Paulo, surprised analysts by
announcing he would not run. He is thought to have been dissuaded because
the Liberal Front party, his natuaral ally, appears keener on an alliance
with Mr Cardoso.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Zedillo sports his pro-market credentials: Party papers over
antipathy as able economist assumes the PRI mantle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Carlos Salinas has selected a bright, pro-market economist to
succeed the late Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio as presidential candidate of
Mexico's ruling party.
Mr Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, who this week became the presidential
candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, is considered by many as
the most intelligent member of the government.
From a humble background, he earned a doctorate in economics from Yale
University, became a top central bank official in his twenties, budget
minister at 36, and four years later, education minister.
The party faithful, however, view Mr Zedillo as dry and politically inept,
and deeply resent his nomination. Unlike Mr Colosio, Mr Zedillo does not
easily bridge the gulf between party traditionalists and foreign-trained
economists who have run the administrative side of the Mexican government
for the past decade. Mr Zedillo has never run for elective office, and often
appears ill at ease in party functions.
'Mr Zedillo is a cold man, calculating and hard in his decisions and,
despite his background, is far from possessing political and social
sensitivity,' wrote the columnist Francisco Cardenas Cruz in yesterday's El
Universal.
Even allowing for the mourning that has followed Mr Colosio's murder, the
reception afforded Mr Zedillo in the PRI after his nomination was remarkably
cold. 'If they had waited another 24 hours they could not have done this.
The PRI would have chosen its own candidate,' said one PRI official who,
like many others, bemoaned the imposition of a candidate by President
Salinas, and lack of internal democracy.
Mr Zedillo, nevertheless, is the strong favourite to win this August's
elections. The PRI has been in power for 65 years, has previously united
around unpopular candidates, and is well ahead of the opposition in opinion
polls.
Mr Zedillo was the only eligible candidate certain to preserve and deepen
the economic and social reforms of the past six years. Because of his
impeccable pedigree as a pro-market economist, Mr Zedillo enjoys broad
support from the domestic and foreign business community, and from the US
government.
If elected, Mr Zedillo is likely to ensure that the same group that has run
Mexico for the past six years will remain in power for another six years.
Mr Zedillo's close friends and allies include Mr Jose Cordoba, the
president's powerful chief of staff, Mr Jaime Serra Puche, the trade
minister, Mr Miguel Mancera, the central bank governor, and Mr Guillermo
Ortiz, deputy finance minister.
Under Mexico's constitution no presidential candidates can have worked in
government for six months before the election. This stipulation ruled out
potential rivals to Mr Zedillo, such as Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister.
Although criticised for political failings, Mr Zedillo has proved himself an
able administrator while in government. He succeeded in cutting the budget
deficit in the early 1990s, and more recently persuaded unions to accept the
decentralisation of education policy.
'His contribution to economic reform was fundamental. He controlled spending
and brought about a structural reform of public finances,' says Mr Ortiz,
the deputy finance minister.
Despite such accolades, Mr Zedillo is best known nationally for his farcical
attempt to publish new history textbooks. These books revised Mexico's
nationalist view of its history, and created a storm from both the left and
right. Mr Zedillo had to recall the books and substitutes have not yet been
made available.
Although the PRI had been lobbying and pressing for the candidacy of Mr
Fernando Ortiz Arana, its party president, Mr Salinas calculated that after
Mr Colosio's assassination, officials would finally put party unity before
personal ambition.
President Salinas seems to have calculated correctly. Mr Ortiz Arana pledged
his loyalty to Mr Zedillo, so did Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy in
Chiapas, and other party members promised to toe the line.
Mr Zedillo also has the advantage of having been campaign manager of Mr
Colosio, and thus in a position to claim to be his legitimate successor. In
his acceptance speech Mr Zedillo mentioned Mr Colosio's name more than 30
times, and promised to endorse his programme and ideals.
Mr Colosio's supporters have nowhere to turn but to Mr Zedillo. Some now say
Mr Zedillo was the intellectual force behind Mr Colosio, and largely
responsible for thinking up Mr Colosio's programme.
'Mr Zedillo will win the election as the heir of Mr Colosio' says Mr
Raymundo Riva Palacio, a columnist with Reforma newspaper. 'Mr Colosio is
the only thing that is now keeping the party together.'
But as Mr Zedillo delivered his acceptance speech, there remained the task
of grooming him for office and turning him into a politician of the people.
His delivery came across as wooden and stilted, while his wire-rimmed
glasses typified his academic background. He also avoided meeting the party
faithful, preferring instead to stay closeted in the PRI headquarters with
his handful of close advisers.

Belize says neighbouring Guatemala has revived its claim to Belizean
territory, despite an interim agreement reached two years ago between the
two Central American countries, Canute James reports from Kingston.
The Belizeans say Guatemala's 130-year-old claim was revived in a letter
sent this month by the government to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary general, saying that an end to Guatemala's claim on the former
British colony would come only with a final treaty.
The latest Guatemalan statement coincides with the dismantling of a
1,500-strong British garrison which had been stationed in Belize to
discourage the Guatemalan military from invading in pursuit of the
territorial claim.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Congressman William Natcher, chairman of the House of Representatives
appropriations committee, died on Tuesday night at the age of 84.
In his 40 years in Congress Mr Natcher never accepted a campaign
contribution nor, until illness kept him away earlier this month, missed a
single vote. His record of appearing in person for 18,401 consecutive roll
call votes and quorum calls appears unlikely to be surpassed.
Although scarcely known outside the confines of Capitol Hill - he never
hired a press secretary, and attracted substantial media coverage almost for
the first time when his voting record ended - Mr Natcher was viewed by
congressional insiders as the epitome of the old-style legislator, committed
to getting results.
'What distinguishes the best of the old bulls from the rest of the House is
their dedication to making things happen when something needs to be done but
there is no consensus, to fulfilling their charge as legislators. What
distinguishes many of the junior colleagues from old bulls is their
dedication to posturing over legislating,' lamented Mr Norman Ornstein, a
political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, in
an article in Roll Call, Congress's village newspaper.
Mr Natcher, who represented northwestern Kentucky, left his mark on decades
of labour, health and education spending through his long chairmanship of
the appropriations subcommittee in charge of these sectors.
Although the appropriations committee is supposed merely to dole out annual
spending allocations within the policy framework set by the various
congressional authorising committees, its decisions on whether to provide
the money for a programme more often than not has the effect of fixing US
policy.
The House and Senate appropriations committees have long been the bastions
of the seniority system, in which members of Congress climb to power in
accordance with their length of service.
Mr Natcher himself only took over as chairman of the full committee in 1992,
succeeding the ailing Congressman Jamie Whitten of Mississippi.
Mr Whitten is seven months younger than Mr Natcher, but holds a record of
his own with 52 years of continuous service in the House.
When Mr Natcher himself became too ill to continue, Democratic House members
voted to break with the seniority system, picking the outspoken Congressman
David Obey of Wisconsin to take over the appropriations committee, rather
than Congressman Neal Smith of Iowa, the 74-year-old, next in line to Mr
Natcher.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Guatemala's government and leftist rebels have signed a human rights accord
which boosts hopes of ending 33 years of civil war by the end of this year,
Reuter reports from Mexico City.
Under the accord, a UN human rights mission will be set up inside Guatemala
as soon as possible and will visit any part of the country and demand
information at any time from the army and the government.
The agreement, reached in Mexico City on Tuesday after five days of talks,
ends almost three years of talks aimed at improving Guatemala's human rights
record, one of the worst in Latin America.
More than 100,000 people have been killed and another 40,000 'disappeared'
since the war began in the early 1960s.
'This is a huge advance. It is the first major agreement signed in the peace
process,' said Mr Marrack Goulding, the UN under-secretary-general for
political affairs.
He said the United Nations would send down a preliminary team to prepare the
ground for the mission.
Guatemala's warring sides also agreed on a broad agenda for talks aiming at
definitive peace accords by December.

FT  31 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Cocom sets stage for successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Member nations of Cocom - which curbed cold war exports to communist
countries - agreed yesterday on the eve of the organisation's demise to
continue talks to establish a successor organisation.
The new body is to restrain arms sales and the transfer of sensitive
technology to countries which threaten peace in the Korean peninsula, the
Gulf and South Asia.
Cocom - the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls - is
being wound up today after 47 years of co-ordinating a western embargo of
militarily sensitive items and technology to the Communist bloc. Its 17
member nations met yesterday in The Hague to confirm its fate and set the
stage for further talks.
But with its strategic rationale no longer tenable as the cold war
disappeared, Cocom has so far been unable to agree on the precise shape and
power of its successor organisation.
Agreement was reached in The Hague on a framework for the new arrangement,
but the goals and principles are still under discussion. Technical working
groups will continue to meet and it is hoped the new organisation will be in
place by autumn.
While talks continue, Cocom members agreed to maintain the current lists of
proscribed products (industrial, military and atomic energy lists) and to
allow each member country the discretion to issue licences under national
laws. The Cocom secretariat in Paris will continue to monitor licensing
during this transition period.
In line with this, the US Commerce Department announced last night it would
remove individual licensing requirements on virtually all low level
telecommunications equipment and computers to former communist countries,
except North Korea.
Mr Robert Rubin, National Economic Council chairman, said by removing
controls that were no longer needed, the US could focus on real security and
proliferation concerns. 'In the post-cold war world we face new threats of
proliferation and we must be vigilant in respect to restricting access of
sensitive technologies to countries like Iran,' he said. Items controlled
because of proliferation concerns - chemical weapon precursors, viruses,
supercomputers and sensitive electronic equipment - will remain subject to
licensing requirements. Controls on items that help develop weapons of mass
destruction and ballistic missiles will also be retained.

Top trade negotiators yesterday agreed to make January 1 1995 the target
date for implementation of the Uruguay Round trade liberalising accords,
committing the leading trading nations to ratifying the accords this year.
The date will be formally endorsed by ministers next month when they meet in
Marrakesh to sign the Gatt Uruguay Round agreements on April 12-15.
Continued wrangling over a US demand for labour rights to go on the agenda
for future trade talks prevented approval of a draft ministerial
declaration. The row is also blocking agreement on setting up a preparatory
committee to manage the transition between the Uruguay signing and
establishment of a new World Trade Organisation next year.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt said yesterday he stood ready
to call a meeting of senior trade officials next week to try to resolve the
worker rights issue. The matter did not pose a threat to the signing of the
agreements, but Mr Sutherland said it would be 'very unfortunate' not to
have consensus on the ministerial declaration.

<TEXT>
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, yesterday announced a series of
deals between US and Russian companies which fell short of his hopes  - but
which heralded US investment 'greatly in excess of the present Dollars 1bn.'
His most significant breakthrough was in achieving a lifting of a 50 per
cent tariff on aerospace products. This allowed the Russian private air
company TransAero to import two Boeing 757s on a lease deal it had
previously threatened to cancel because of the new tariff imposed on March
15. The company is also negotiating the leasing of a two more Boeing 757s.
In talks with Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian premier, Mr Brown said he
extracted a promise Russia would not impose tariffs retrospectively on deals
already signed and would review all new tariffs imposed this month. However,
he failed to get lifted an export tariff of Dollars 5 per barrel of oil.
The tariff threatens to make many oil joint ventures between foreign and
Russian companies unprofitable and jeopardises a deal on Sakhalin offshore
reserves.

FT  31 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Demise of a battle-scarred veteran of the
cold war - Nancy Dunne writes the obituary of a secretive group dedicated to
keeping dangerous technology in the West
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cocom, the secretive Paris-based group formed in 1947 to keep equipment and
technology out of the hands of communist regimes, today will become history
along with other cold war anachronisms.
For weeks its members have been struggling to agree the shape and powers of
a successor organisation. Because there was no agreement on this at a
meeting of the 17 Cocom member nations in The Hague last night, the old
lists of banned items will stay in place, with enforcement at the discretion
of national governments.
But it was agreed at The Hague that the successor to the Co-ordinating
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls would control the export of dual
use technology (such as computers, telecommunication equipment and
chemicals) and conventional arms to 'rogue regimes' or to governments
considered likely to develop or use weapons of mass destruction.
The US also wants the new body to include only those countries, mostly in
the industrialised world, that participate in the three other international
proliferation control regimes: the Missile Technology Control Regime, the
Chemical Weapons Convention and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. These were
formed in the past ten years as it became clear the emphasis on export
controls was shifting away from the perceived communist threat towards
'mavericks' such as Iran, Iraq and North Korea.
Russia and other former Communist countries, which it had been thought might
join, are unlikely to be in at the beginning, a move perhaps reflecting
concern about the region's stability.
However, their aid will be sought in the non-proliferation efforts,
according to Mr William Reinsch, the commerce department under secretary in
charge of US export controls.
In contrast to its controversial passing, Cocom's birth was comparatively
easy. The US had most of the world's advanced weapons and technology, and
its companies had little interest in alien markets. Europe was still ravaged
by war. Memories of the second world war were fresh and fed unity against
the communist threat.
Even as Europe and Japan recovered, Cocom had a virtual monopoly on
commercial dual-use technologies. 'There was a common understanding and a
political will to treat problem countries as a direct threat to Western
security,' said Mr Reinsch.
Cocom was a little known organisation when the Soviet Union invaded
Afghanistan in 1979. The US learned then that trade weapons, when applied
unilaterally, had their limits: when President Jimmy Carter slapped a wheat
embargo on the Soviet Union, US allies and competitors took the market for
themselves.
Export licensing - more onerous in the US than elsewhere - was costing US
companies contracts. They were being challenged everywhere by strong
European and Japanese competitors.
But in 1981, the Reagan Administration began to beef up enforcement of
unilateral US controls and at the same time, it sought to strengthen Cocom.
Mr Paul Freedenberg, a commerce department undersecretary at the time, says
the US was 'overbearing and imperial' in its demands. The resentment which
resulted may have sown the seeds of Cocom's demise.
'The problem is we do have some risks out there, and we need international
co-operation,' says Mr Freedenberg.
Countries - such as Iraq, North Korea and Iran - seeking to develop mass
destruction capabilities can usually find other supplies or can manufacture
the items themselves. 'It is useless to maintain long lists of controlled
items when they are readily available from numerous suppliers outside the
regimes,' says Mr Reinsch.
Instead, he said, the US wants to focus on items which are critical for
weapons and can be effectively blocked by multilateral co-operation.
Mr David Earnest, of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies,
believes that what emerges after Cocom will be a weaker regime, whose
members will be unable to veto other countries' exports.
The successor is likely to control items on the basis of national
discretion. Licences will remain the sole responsibility of the member
states, which will not have to get prior approval from other members, says
Mr Earnest.
'This will increase the disparities in enforcement,' said Mr Earnest. 'At
least under the old system there was uniformity.'
The list of controlled items will be narrowed considerably. Negotiators,
working in The Hague, have agreed to maintain existing lists until they
reach agreement on the new ones.
Some critics believe Cocom moved too quickly to disband, that it could have
survived with a shorter control list and preserved a united front.
Despite assurances from the Commerce Department that the impact of the new
regime on US exporters will be negligible, US business is worried that
Washington may deny export licences that governments in competitor countries
will approve. The Clinton Administration - at the insistence of the Pentagon
and State Department - has de-cided to retain a system of unilateral
controls. The US is still in withdrawal from its expensive habit of world
leadership.

FT  31 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo defends access package, tells US to
look again
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese officials yesterday defended the government's package of
market-opening measures, stating that it was the most Japan could do for the
moment.
They also expressed hope that the package would lead to a revival of the
framework trade and economic talks with the US, which have been stalled
since February.
The package, announced on Tuesday, was dismissed by the US as being 'of
little substance'. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said the
US reaction was 'regrettable'. He added Japan would do what more it could
before June, which Tokyo has set as a date for presenting details of its
market opening measures.
In the meantime, Japanese bureaucrats have indicated they will explore
diplomatic channels in an effort to convey the substance of the measures to
the US.
'We hope to win US understanding towards the package which clearly shows the
direction of deregulation and macro-economic reform. There will be many
opportunities to do so through diplomatic channels,' a foreign ministry
official said.
The Japanese defence followed negative US reaction to Japan's efforts to
stimulate the economy, open its markets and bring down the country's
towering trade surplus.
Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to Japan, yesterday added his voice to the
critical response from Washington. He described the deregulation measures as
'very vague, delayed and what they mean or might not mean is very difficult
to determine.'
The US response put further upward pressure on the yen, which broke through
Y103 to the dollar in Tokyo for the first time since mid-February when the
US-Japan summit failed to produce agreement on the framework negotiations.
Since then, the US has often accused Japan of not living up to its
commitments to achieve a 'highly significant' reduction in its current
account surplus. The two sides agreed on a cooling-off period during which
Japan, having rejected US calls for quantitative indicators to measure
progress in opening up its markets, was expected to come up with its own
scenario for reducing its surplus.
But despite the Japanese government's good intentions, the package has done
little to appease US calls for more concrete steps and threats of unilateral
action by Washington.
The package also failed to remove the threat of retaliation under Super 301,
the trade bill giving the US the right to retaliate against unfair trading
partners. Senior bureaucrats in Tokyo yesterday lamented that Washington had
not fully appreciated the significance of the measures.
While admitting that the language of the voluminous document produced in
Tokyo may have been somewhat obscure, there was much to read between the
lines, they said.
The US should look more carefully at the package before pronouncing it as
unsatisfactory, a foreign ministry official complained, adding that the
changes were part of an on-going process. While parts of the package need
further work, others are moving matters forward, said an official at the
trade ministry.
'We are introducing revolutionary changes in government procurement from
April . . . that is a very difficult thing to do,' he added, describing the
market-opening package as 'a firm foundation for reform.'
While the negative response from the US dashed immediate hopes for an early
resumption of the framework talks, officials made it clear that the two
sides could nevertheless work towards reviving the talks sooner rather than
later.
'The important thing is that both Japan and the US have kept the door open.
The framework talks can be revived at any level. It doesn't even have to be
official at first but some steps need to be taken,' a foreign ministry
official said.
'We believe that with these measures Japan has fulfilled its commitment
under the framework talks,' he added. Noting that Japan will endeavour to
firm up the package by June, he said: 'It is no longer fair to say that the
ball is in Japan's court. As responsible governments, the US and Japan must
both work towards resuming the negotiations. The ball is in both courts.'

Mr Brown said that, in talks with Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian
premier, he extracted a promise not just to lift the tariff but also not to
impose tariffs retrospectively on deals already signed and to review all of
the new tariffs imposed this month. President Boris Yeltsin has himself said
that the tariff issue must be re-opened.
However, he failed to have lifted an export tariff of Dollars 5 per barrel
of oil.
The tariff threatens to make many oil joint ventures between foreign and
Russian companies unprofitable and jeopardises the conclusion of an
agreement on the Sakhalin offshore reserves which a group of Western
companies, including the US corporations of McDermott and Marathon, the
British-Dutch Shell and the Japanese Mitsui, have been waiting to sign for
two years.
The commerce secretary said that Mr Chernomyrdin had promised only to
'review' the tariffs, and said he hoped the deal would be signed in April.
He announced agreements signed by, among others, Westinghouse Electric to
maintain nuclear power stations; the Cytran biotech company to build the
first internationally certified laboratory and manufacturing facility; and
the conversion of a defence plant into a packaging producer by Allen
Associates.
Mr Brown, who had a 45 minute meeting with Mr Yeltsin, said: 'I leave with a
renewed sense of optimism about the future (of Russia).'

<TEXT>
Staff at the Paris headquarters of Cocom, the western export controls body,
were in a state of confusion yesterday about whether or not they should pack
up and leave.
Cocom is due to be wound up today after 47 years, but the fate of its 20
staff is apparently undecided.
There was no official word on this from senior officials of the 17 member
states meeting in The Hague yesterday to discuss the future of controls on
technology exports. 'It is complete confusion here,' said one of the 20
members of the Cocom secretariat, which has long maintained a shadowy
existence in a US embassy annexe on Paris's rue de la Boetie. 'No one here
knows anything about what will happen', she said, following last November's
decision by Cocom member governments to put an end to the organisation 'in
its present form' by March 31.
The Dutch government chairing the discussions on Cocom's future said
yesterday that Cocom members stood by their decision to change the
organisation into something less elaborate than the Cold War body which
vetted the sale of militarily sensitive technology to the former Warsaw Pact
and its allies.
But he said there was a consensus in favour of using Cocom's experience to
control technology exports to sensitive destinations.
There was 'no specifically European position' on this at the Hague meeting
attended by officials of 15 Nato allies (11 of them EU members), plus Japan
and Australia. Ireland, the EU's only neutral member, attended as an
observer, with Sweden, Finland and Austria, Switzerland and New Zealand.
EU members wanted to draw on Cocom experience as the basis for common
controls on technlogy exported out of their single market.
In its final phase, Cocom had become prepared to avow an existence that had
earlier been very sensitive to several European governments, particularly
those with sizeable communist parties.
The predecessors to Cocom's current president, Mr Menno Goedhart, a Dutch
official, had, for instance, always been Italian. Successive governments in
Rome had always been too embarrassed about their country's membership of
Cocom to want to write into their national budget a financial contribution
to Cocom's running. So, they preferred to pay in kind by providing the
president.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
China has announced plans to phase out quota restrictions on most categories
of imports by 1997 as part of a continuing effort to satisfy requirements
for resumption of membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation (Moftec) said
yesterday a removal of quotas imposed on some 50 import items would be
carried out in three-stages. 'Within the next three years China will
gradually cancel licenses for most of the existing 53 categories that still
require an import license,' the ministry said.
In the past five years, an official noted, China had progressively cancelled
import quotas and reduced tariffs on a wide range of items.
Western officials, responsible for monitoring China's efforts to comply with
requirements for Gatt entry, described the latest announcement as a 'further
step forward', but said China still had 'some way to go.'
At a meeting in Geneva earlier this month, Gatt members expressed support
for China's re-entry, but also made clear they would require further
evidence of trade liberalisation.
Western countries are calling for greater transparency in Chinese trade
regulations, improved market access to China for foreign service companies
such as banks, and more commitment in combating infringements against
intellectual property rights.
China was a founding member of Gatt, but withdrew after the Communists came
to power in 1949. Beijing has been seeking to re-enter the organisation
since 1986.
It has made no secret of its desire to become a founder member of the World
Trade Organisation when it supercedes Gatt in 1995.
China was an active participant in the Uruquay talks, and one of its senior
trade officials will travel to Morocco next month to sign the Uruguay Round
package.
AP Moller, the Danish shipping group which operates one of the world's
largest global container-shipping operations under the Maersk Line name, has
been given permission to set up in China, the group said yesterday, reports
Hilary Barnes from Copenhagen.

The Italian government was forced yesterday to defend its decision to

won the licence for the new Europe-wide GSM mobile telecommunications
contract, writes John Simkins in Milan. Mr Maurizio Pagani, postal services
minister, said the decision had been made according to transparent technical
guidelines 'independent of the elections'. He said the decision had to be
taken considering that the government's advisers had already delivered their
report. Mr Pagani's intervention followed criticism from politicians about
the timing, including from within Forza Italia, led by Silvio Berlusconi. Mr
Berlusconi's Fininvest company was among members of Unitel, the losing
consortium.

<TEXT>
Belgium yesterday became the latest country to follow the downward trend in
European interest rates by trimming two of its key money market rates. The
central bank cut its central rate from 6.15 per cent to 6.05 per cent and
its end-of-day rate to 7.55 per cent from 7.65 per cent. The central rate is
an overnight lending rate for primary dealers of government debt. The
end-of-day rate is an overnight lending rate for all other banks. The
Belgian cut follows the fall in the German repo rate from 5.80 per cent to
5.76. 'There has been greater political stability, the Belgian budget
control has been completed and we have had business surveys showing a big
increase in confidence,' said Mr Peter Praet, chief economist at Generale de
Banque.
West German construction will experience a 1.5 per cent rise in activity
this year after a 0.5 per cent decline in 1993. French retail sales fell an
estimated 3.8 per cent last November compared with the average of the three
previous months.

European travellers will from tomorrow be allowed to bring almost four-times
more goods into the European Union from other non-EU countries such as
Turkey or the US, the European Commission said yesterday. The new allowance
raises the monetary limit on goods purchased at duty-free shops outside the
union from Ecu45 (Pounds 34) to Ecu175. The decision had been taken as part
of a general reform of the European customs system, which is seeking to give
European consumers greater freedom to bring in tax-free goods for personal
consumption. The allowance for duty-free goods bought within the union has
been doubled to Ecu90, although the numerical quotas for cigarettes and
alcohol brought into the union from non-EU countries will remain the same.

<TEXT>
Lithuania decided yesterday to peg its litas currency to the US dollar in an
attempt to attract more foreign investment and pave the way for full
convertibility, a government spokesman said. The litas was set at four to
the dollar from April 1, a compromise between exporters who wanted a lower
rate of around 4.2 and economists who preferred 3.8-3.9. Lithuania is the
second of the three Baltic republics to fix its exchange rate. Estonia has
pegged its kroon at eight to the D-Mark since it was introduced in 1992.
Lithuanian currency trading has been in turmoil since parliament voted on
March 17 to link the litas to either the dollar or the D-Mark. The daily
Respublika newspaper said the authorities had sold Dollars 10m in the past
week to defend the litas. Commercial bankers were critical of the decision
to tie the litas, saying it was unnecessary and would disrupt the currency's
stability. The prime minister, Mr Adolfas Slezevicius, defended the move on
television, saying it would enable foreign investors to forecast accurately
the exchange rates they would be dealing with.

<TEXT>
UN commanders yesterday discussed plans for the deployment of peacekeepers
along the 1,000-mile confrontation line between Croatian and Serb forces in
the breakaway state of Krajina after the two sides signed a ceasefire
agreement.
International mediators see the agreement as a key step towards hammering
out an overall settlement in the Balkans. It marked the formal end to the
six-month war in 1991, when Serb forces carved out their own state in
Krajina in defiance of Croatian independence.
But peace mediators made clear that agreement would pave the way for peace
in the region, only if it were followed by economic and political accords on
the status of Krajina, which cuts Croatia in two. Mr Vitaly Churkin, the
Russian special envoy to former Yugoslavia, said it was 'only a beginning of
the road toward peace and normalisation of relations between Serbs and
Croats'. After 18 hours of talks, and considerable pressure from the
Russian, US, UN and EU envoys, the two sides endorsed 35 maps determining
the frontlines in Croatia. The agreement calls for a ceasefire to come into
force on April 4 and the withdrawal of heavy weapons 20km from the
confrontation lines by April 5.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Uncertainty hits Italian financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The accuracy of the Italian rumour mill has proved to be a double-edged
sword for the Italian government bond market. On Monday, before the official
results of the election were made public, both the bond and stock markets
rallied sharply on speculation that Mr Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing
Freedom Alliance would achieve an outright victory in the lower house, the
Chamber of Deputies.
The June contract of the 10-year Italian government bond future on Liffe,
which is seen to be a good barometer for the underlying cash market, surged
by nearly three points to 112.67 on Monday, but since then it been unable to
build on these gains. Yesterday afternoon the contract traded at 111.27, up
just over one point on the day.
Analysts hold out three reasons for the market's failure to make further
gains in the wake of the elections. Firstly, the sharp gains achieved at the
start of the week and the strength of the lira against the D-Mark has
prompted a wave of profit-taking by speculators who had bought Italian bonds
in the weeks leading up to the election in the hope that Mr Berlusconi would
come out on top.
'These professionals are closing out their positions and this will put
downward pressure on bonds and the lira,' says Mr Troy Bowler, international
strategist at PaineWebber in London.
Secondly, the market could face up to three weeks of uncertainty as Mr
Berlusconi attempts to iron out differences between his two coalition
partners, the Northern League and the MSI/National Alliance, in order to
form a strong government.
Thirdly, the bond market is worried about the possible adverse effects of Mr
Berlusconi's tax-cutting policies on Italy's runaway budget deficit and on
inflation, which could in turn force up interest rates. Mr Bowler notes that
Italy's budget deficit for 1994 has already overshot its target of L145
trillion (Pounds 58.7bn) by L15 trillion. 'It is not clear whether there is
the political will to present a mini-budget in order to bring the deficit
back on target.'
Other analysts believe that although the uncertainty is far from resolved,
the risks are worth taking. Mr Julian Jessop, economist at Midland Global
Markets in London, says that the most likely scenario is that Mr Umberto
Bossi, the leader of the Northern League, will come to an agreement with Mr
Berlusconi. 'A good general rule with any politician is to watch what they
do and where their interests lie and not what they say,' says Mr Jessop.
Mr Jessop also believes that a right-wing government is not a threat to
economic reform and that in some aspects, such as privatisation, reform
could be accelerated.

<TEXT>
Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League, was under pressure
yesterday to drop his reservations about forming a government with media
magnate, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance
party of Mr Gianfranco Fini.
Mr Bossi's reluctance is the principal hurdle to forming a new government in
the wake of the Freedom Alliance's obtaining 366 of the 630 seats in the
general election.
Mr Berlusconi sought to overcome Mr Bossi's objections to the presence of
the MSI in a future government in their first meeting since the elections.
Afterwards a spokesman for Mr Berlusconi said the meeting had been
'positive'.
He went on to voice optimism about the early formation of a government
composed of the League, Forza Italia, the MSI and the small break-away
faction of the former Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Centre.
However, from the limited comment it was clear serious differences remain
between Mr Bossi and his putative partners in government.
Mr Bossi has argued strongly that he formed an electoral alliance with Forza
Italia and no other political grouping. The Forza Italia electoral alliance
with Mr Fini's MSI did not concern the League, he maintains. Thus he is not
obliged to associate in government with the MSI whom he has labled as
'reactionary fascists'.
At the same time, Mr Bossi's has insisted - at least in public - that a
League figure become the next prime minister rather than Mr Berlusconi. Mr
Bossi maintains that the premiership should go to the party with the most
deputies. The League has 118 against Forza Italia's 101 and the MSI's 105.
This, however, ignores the support provided by Forza Italia to ensure the
election of most League deputies. While the pressure was on Mr Bossi to drop
his reservations, the other political parties made it clear the Freedom
Alliance was under an obligation to form the next government.
Several political leaders said if the Alliance had fought the election as a
bloc, then it owed a responsibility to the electorate to form a government
now that it had a majority in parliament.
The outgoing government also signalled a degree of impatience yesterday with
the politicians. After a cabinet meeting, it issued a statement saying it
hoped to be able to hand over to the new executive 'as soon as possible'.
As efforts concentrated on the difficult task of forming a new government,
the first political fall-out occurred among the losing parties. Mr Mino
Martinazzoli resigned as leader of the Popular party. Mr Martinazzoli had
been brought in from retirement in late 1992 to guide a demoralised
Christian Democrat party.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Brussels to draft works directive
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The months of dialogue between unions and employers at European level in
search of agreement on the establishment of works councils in European
multinationals finally broke down yesterday.
With voluntary agreement between the social partners ruled out, the European
Commission will now proceed with a works council directive which is likely
to be passed at the end of the year.
The directive will require at least one meeting a year between employer
representatives and top management of a company to discuss investment,
production plans and redundancies. It is is likely to affect about 1,000
companies in Europe and become law in most countries in 1996 or 1997.
Works councils have been a matter of controversy between European unions and
employers for more than 20 years, with employers insisting that the form of
consultation should be left to companies.
It had been hoped that a voluntary agreement between Unice, the European
employers' body, and the European Trades Union Congress, might be possible,
especially after Unice shifted towards the ETUC position by accepting the
principle of a legal right to information for employees.
But yesterday ETUC said that the withdrawal from the negotiations of the
Confederation of British Industry, the main British employers' body, had
undermined Unice's negotiating authority. The CBI was unhappy about the
earlier concessions that Unice made.
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the British TUC, one of the main
affiliates of the ETUC, said: 'What the employers have now done is make a
directive on this inevitable.'
The directive is likely to be passed under the German presidency later this
year, but will not become law for another two years at least.
It will not directly affect the UK as works councils are covered by
Britain's opt-out from the Maastricht Treaty. However, it is estimated that
at least 100 UK companies will be affected through their continental
European subsidiaries and most of them are likely to include their UK
employees.
Elsewhere, the directive will affect companies with more than 1,000
employees operating in a minimum of two EU countries and with a minimum of
100 in one of the countries.
The directive will provide for voluntary arrangements within companies but
will have a fall-back statutory model.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Commission twists knife into UK

<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday twisted the knife deeper into the UK
government, underlining the limited scope of the weekend compromise on
voting rights in an expanded European Union.
One day after rebutting Mr John Major's claims to have received assurances
on future social policy legislation, the commission issued a public
declaration that the compromise was not legally binding.
The agreement on rules for allowing a small minority of member states to
block EU measures was struck at an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers
in Greece.
Yesterday in Brussels, representatives of the 12 sealed agreement on entry
terms, paving the way for Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway to join the EU
next year.
Brussels said that although this was a political agreement entered into 'in
good faith', both Britain's partners and the commission could end any
prolonged attempt to delay decisions by simple majority.
The commission declaration signalled a much more robust tone after months of
self-effacement, and it followed a row at a meeting of all 17 Commissioners
on Tuesday.
Mr Jacques Delors, commission president, was questioned closely about a
private breakfast meeting with Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, last
Sunday in Ionnanina.
Mr Hurd was said to have pleaded with Mr Delors for assurances on social
policy legislation in order to win support for the voting rights compromise
later presented to the UK cabinet.
These assurances were not forthcoming, and yesterday Britain was still
seeking the tightest form of written guarantees it could get.
Commission wrangling over how to treat the UK's demands led to a
confrontation between the two British commissioners, Sir Leon Brittan,
conservative, and Mr Bruce Millan, a former Labour cabinet minister. Mr
Millan accused Sir Leon of complacency about Britain's efforts to circumvent
EU rules. This statement prompted a vigorous rebuttal by the senior British
commissioner.
The commission noted in its declaration that there would be a fundamental
review of institutional questions at the 1996 inter-governmental conference
to take account of a possible increase in the Union to more than 20 member
states.
'Majority voting will have to be arranged so that the Union can improve its
ability to take decisions and act,' the commission said.
Member states agreed not to make statements clarifying support for the
compromise, but they endorsed the commission position.

FT  31 MAR 94 / How the British blundered in Brussels

<TEXT>
Britain's decision to pick a fight with her EU partners over voting rights
is more than a political disaster for Mr John Major. As the British prime
minister battles for survival in London, the view is gaining ground in
Brussels that his government's tactics during the enlargement negotiations
could turn into a serious long-term diplomatic setback in Europe.
'There's nothing new about Britain being criticised about her attitude to
European integration,' said one senior Commission official yesterday.
'What's new is that Finland, Sweden, Austria, and Norway thought they had a
British friend, but in the end their friend turned out to be Germany.'
Germany is the big winner as a result of enlargement. Vigorous Bonn
diplomacy has kept prospects bright for bringing in four wealthy neighbours
into the European Union by January 1, 1995, lightening Germany's burden as
the paymaster of Europe and expanding her role as the power-broker at the
heart of the Continent.
As a champion of a wider Europe, Britain was well-placed to take joint
credit with Germany for expanding the Union from 12 to 16 new members.
However, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, passed up a mouth-watering
opportunity: instead of standing shoulder to shoulder with Mr Klaus Kinkel,
his German counterpart, Mr Hurd found himself trapped in all-night arguments
in Brussels, arguing a brief in which he had little confidence.
How did this come about? Aside from political misjudgements by the UK
cabinet inside Downing Street, it seems that the British Foreign Office
fundamentally miscalculated in their assessment of how their European
partners would respond to UK and Spanish demands to preserve voting rules in
an expanded Union.
These rules prevent two large countries and one small member state being
out-voted, with 23 votes at present needed to muster a 'blocking minority'.
For the past six months, senior British officials, including Sir John Kerr,
the permanent UK ambassador to the EU in Brussels, held out hopes of
persuading the large member states to sign up to the 23-vote blocking
minority. Ironically, they placed most of their bets on Germany on the
grounds that Bonn would agree to almost anything in the interests of keeping
enlargement on track.
UK policy rested on five other assumptions.
France, Spain and Italy would support enlargement, but not if it further
distorted the relationship between a country's voting strength and its
population.
Increasing the blocking minority from 23 to 27 would mean that a combination
of smaller states could out-vote large states representing 40 per cent of
the population, an important democratic principle which the majority of
member states would not ignore.
Most states were at best neutral on voting rights, with only federalist
Belgium, Holland, and 'plucky little Luxembourg' arguing strongly for an
increase.
Rising French and German concern about encroachment by Brussels strengthed
the case for making EU decision-making more difficult.
The flaw was that while France and Germany shared many of these doubts,
neither wanted to open up the question of power-sharing ahead of the 1996
inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty. 'We don't
want another constitutional debate,' said one senior French official.
Bonn in particular expressed horror at the idea of linking population to
voting weights, because it would mean a more populous Germany acquiring more
votes than France, thus jeopardising relations with its closest ally. In one
Brussels session, German officials warned the British that they risked
stirring up German nationalism in an already sensitive election year.
Lastly, no member state wanted to be accused of jamming the EU's
decision-making. After labouring to ratify Maastricht, 'the member states
are committed to making the treaty work', said a senior EU official.
Mr Peter Ludlow, head of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels,
believes that the Foreign Office's misreading of the intentions of her EU
partners on the voting rights issue is as serious as any since 1945.
Britain can still claim that though it lost a battle, it may win the war.
Voting rights and institutional reform will be tackled 'root and branch' at
the 1996 conference, combined with planning for a Union of 20-25 member
states, including the east Europeans, according to Mr Hurd.
The EU's tilt eastward has already aroused misgivings in France. These may
grow as Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic press to join the Union by
the end of the century, and the Baltic states take encouragement from
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's support for their own candidacy.
At this point, Britain is likely to face a choice much more difficult than
the argument over voting rights. For all British diplomats' claims that the
UK is relaxed about the shift eastward, their views rest on the assumption
that 'widening' will not mean 'deepening'. The setback in this round of
enlargement means that Britain's hand will be much weaker - and Germany's
much stronger - than it might have been ahead of the 1996 review.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Balladur to subsidise youth jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday decided to dip
deep into the public purse to subsidise youth jobs - as the alternative to
the ill-fated wage-cutting law that he abandoned in the face of student
protest earlier this week.
A statement said that 'to give employers an incentive to anticipate the
emerging economic recovery', a subsidy of FFr1,000 (Pounds 117) a month
would be paid for the first nine months to any company giving a young worker
a first job lasting at least 18 months.
The monthly subsidy would be doubled for young people hired before October
1.
This move appeared partly to pre-empt the mission Mr Balladur gave Mr Michel
Bon, head of the ANPE national employment agency.
Mr Bon was to take a week to consult unions and employers and to propose a
successor plan to the abandoned 'contrat d'insertion professionelle' (CIP),
which would have allowed unskilled youths in job training to be paid less
than the minimum wage.
Mr Bon said yesterday that the subsidy should help 500,000 young people find
a job at a cost of FFr6bn.
But Mr Balladur said he was still looking to Mr Bon to propose ways of
improving his agency's services to the young unemployed, though the prime
minister backed away from the idea of a separate employment agency to cater
for young job-seekers.
In the wake of the government's humiliating climbdown on the CIP, Mr Bernard
Pons, parliamentary leader of the ruling Gaullist RPR party, said that
ministers were served 'as fuses' and when 'blown' should be replaced.
He appeared to be referring to Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister.
Mr Balladur's unexpectedly rapid announcement of his subsidy plan, as well
his formal repeal yesterday of the CIP, seemed designed to head off a
planned student march in Paris today.
But the march still looked likely to go ahead.
Students again demonstrated yesterday in the western city of Nantes.
Meanwhile, Mr Francois Perigot, president of the Patronat employers'
federation, said it was necessary 'to show courage, even if little by
little, to deal with the problem of labour costs'.
But he said this could be done either by reducing wages, as envisaged in the
CIP, or by reducing social welfare charges on payrolls, as the Balladur
government is already doing slowly.
The Patronat has kept a very low profile throughout the whole row over the
CIP.
This is partly because it did not want to join the government in being
pilloried by students and unions but also because it believes that existing
forms of apprenticeships are adequate.
Young workers entering these apprenticeships are also paid below the minimum
wage, but they have accepted this pay cut because the training they get is
more formalised and for a longer guaranteed period than envisaged under the
CIP.
Last summer, the Patronat pledged to put an extra 200,000 young people
through these apprenticeships by the end of 1994.
So far, from July 1993 to February 1994, it has increased the number of
apprentices by only 25,000 over the comparable period of 1992-93.
But the Patronat claimed yesterday this was a big improvement over the 'free
fall' in apprenticeships in the 1990-93 period, and was confident that it
would hit its target of an extra 200,000 this year.

<TEXT>
The European Union should use its institutional review in 1996 to discuss
how its military capabilities can help its political aims, the head of the
Western European Union defence group said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Brussels.
The WEU's secretary-general, Mr Willem van Eekelen, whose organisation might
one day become the EU's defence arm, said that 'to a certain extent,
Maastricht has already been overtaken'. He told the European parliament's
foreign affairs and security committee that he was 'talking about the use of
our military capabilities in a wider context to support our political
objectives outside Europe'.
Mr Van Eekelen said the WEU could take over some operational activities from
the EU where it was involved in such tasks as providing police training in
former Yugoslavia.

FT  31 MAR 94 / IRA puts pressure on London with ceasefire plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Provisional IRA last night announced an unconditional, 72-hour
ceasefire, starting at midnight next Tuesday, in an effort to force
clarification of the Downing Street peace declaration.
The move - announced as Mr John Major, the prime minister, flew to Northern
Ireland for a short visit - is being seen as an attempt to expose any
differences in strategy between the British and Irish governments. It is
also intended to renew pressure on them to open a fresh dialogue with the
republican movement.
A statement issued last night in Dublin said that the IRA hoped the
ceasefire would be accepted 'in the spirit in which it is offered' and
called on the British government to take advantage of the new development.
But Mr Major dismissed as 'cynical' the decision to call a ceasefire,
describing it as a 'public relations gesture'. In a speech in Belfast, he
told the IRA that they were mistaken if they thought the move would alter
the situation. 'Temporary ceasefires are welcome for the peace of mind they
bring for a period,' he said. 'But unless they become permanent and
irrevocable, they will not end the conflict.'
But Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, appeared more
conciliatory. He described the IRA move as 'a very small step in the right
direction. I am encouraged on the one hand but disappointed on the other,
because while it is a small step it is only for a short period.
'What everybody wants to see are clear signs and signals that we are on the
road to developing a permanent peace process.'
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said the ceasefire represented an
important initiative and a chance to break the stalemate. He urged Mr Major
to take the opportunity to open immediate, direct talks with Sinn Fein.
Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour
party, declined to say whether he thought the British government should now
hold talks with Sinn Fein but said 'no stone should be left unturned' in
seeking an end to violence. He said that, if the IRA leadership were
bluffing, they would 'be isolated in a way they've never been isolated
before'.
The ceasefire comes a few days after London and Dublin moved quickly to
close an apparent split in attitudes over the likely response to a temporary
ceasefire. Comments by Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, had suggested
that Dublin might look more positively than London on a short-term halt to
violence.
Ulster Unionists were quick to condemn the IRA announcement. Mr Ken
Maginnis, their security spokesman, said he believed the ceasefire was
intended to portray Mr Major as 'intransigent and responsible for a
carefully pre-planned return to violence'.

FT  31 MAR 94 / World News in Brief: Israel and PLO agree on security pact
for Hebron
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation said early today they had
reached agreement on security arrangements for the West Bank town of Hebron,
where an Israeli settler massacred 30 Arabs at prayer in a mosque a month
ago.
PLO demands for greater security have been holding up implementation of the
agreement for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and the Jericho area of the West
Bank. But both sides said these talks could now resume after being suspended
since the mosque attack. The PLO said it was agreed there would be
international peacekeepers in Hebron but, contrary to expectations, there
would be no Palestinian police in the town. More Israelis take hard line,

FT  31 MAR 94 / Wall Street stocks slide amid fears of interest rates rise
</HEADLINE>

US share prices plunged again yesterday as investors sold stocks amid
growing fears about rising long-term interest rates and the outlook for a
rapidly-weakening US equity market. It was the fourth big decline on Wall
Street in the last five days.
In Tokyo, stocks opened lower amid concern about the sharp retreat in US
share prices. The Nikkei 225 index fell about 50 points to 19,510 in early
trading.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 72.27 at 3,626.75, its lowest
level since November 4, 1993. The Dow has fallen almost 250 points, or 6 per
cent, since last Thursday.
Traders said the selling was not triggered by any particular news, but
blamed the declines on growing fears among investors that long-term interest
rates, which have climbed sharply since February, will rise steadily
throughout the rest of the year.
Yesterday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond - the chief
measure of long-term interest rates - rose to 7.1 per cent, its highest
level in 13 months.
Analysts say interest rates have been rising because bond market investors
are worried that recent rapid growth in the US economy will push up
inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income assets like bonds. Bearish
comments about the outlook for share prices from Ms Elaine Garzarelli, the
influential equities analyst at Lehman Brothers, served to further darken
the stock market's mood.
Ms Garzarelli, whose pronouncements have been closely followed since she
predicted the stock market crash in 1987, said the indicators she uses to
forecast the market had fallen sharply in recent months.
The Lehman analyst said: 'We feel the odds are about 50-50 that we may
already be in the 10 per cent to 15 per cent correctional phase.'
She had originally forecast a decline of no more than 10 per cent.
London share prices were hit by Wall Street yesterday. The Dow's overnight
fall knocked 36 points off the FT-SE 100 at the opening. The index later
recovered all but 5.7 points, but then slid to 3,092.4, a net loss of 31.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Official inquiry ordered into running of Credit Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yester-day dismissed Mr Jean-Yves Haberer after five
months as head of the Credit National banking group and announced an
official inquiry into the management of Credit Lyonnais during the period
when he was chairman.
Mr Haberer, 61, served as chairman of Credit Lyonnais, one of Europe's
biggest banks, for five years from 1988, when he was appointed by the former
Socialist government.
Last November the new centre-right administration moved him to the same role
at Credit National, a smaller and less prestigious institution.
His move followed fierce criticism of Mr Haberer's expansionist lending and
acquisition strategy at Credit Lyonnais. The criticism reached a climax last
week when Mr Jean Peyrelevade, his successor, revealed the bank had made a
net loss of FFr6.9bn (Pounds 790m) last year and that the government had
agreed to back a FFr44.9bn rescue which involves a FFr4.9bn cash injection
and the creation of a new company to take on FFr40bn of non-performing
property loans.
Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, government spokesman, said after yesterday's cabinet
meeting that ministers had decided that Mr Haberer should not be 'left in
charge of another public enter-prise' given 'the depth of the losses and the
magnitude of the mistakes' made at Credit Lyonnais during his chairmanship.
Mr Sarkozy rebuffed criticism of the decision to move Mr Haberer to Credit
National by saying ministers only realised the full extent of Credit
Lyonnais's plight last week when they saw the 1993 accounts and studied Mr
Peyrelevade's 'thorough analysis' of its position.
The cabinet yesterday yielded to a demand from Mr Francois Mitterrand, the
Socialist French president, for a formal inquiry into Mr Haberer's
management of Credit Lyonnais.
Mr Haberer on Tuesday called for such an inquiry, claiming he was not solely
responsible for Credit Lyonnais's problems. He said some of its difficulties
were due to the actions of previous chairmen and that, in some cases, he had
been acting on government 'recommendations'.
Liberation, the French newspaper, earlier this week published a leaked memo
sent to Mr Haberer in 1992 by Mr Michel Sapin, the former Socialist finance
minister who is a member of the Bank of France's monetary policy council,
expressing concern about Credit Lyonnais's condition. Mr Pierre Beregovoy,
Mr Sapin's predecessor, had in 1991 warned Mr Haberer about Credit
Lyonnais's involvement with a takeover bid for MGM, the US movie studio.
The present government is trying to distance itself from the Credit Lyonnais
affair.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Senior ministers rally to defend embattled Major: Tory
backbenchers warn PM that a leadership challenge is likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, ROLAND RUDD and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior cabinet ministers yesterday sought to shore up Mr John Major's hold
on Downing Street as backbench support for his leadership haemorrhaged
rapidly in the wake of the debacle over enlargement of the European Union.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, all issued strong public
declarations of support for the prime minister.
Mr Hurd definitely ruled himself out as a candidate for the leadership. The
foreign secretary, who stood against Mr Major in 1990, said: 'I don't regret
having had a go but I am not going to have another.'
However, Mr Clarke startled some MPs by saying that he intended to succeed
Mr Major as leader of the Tory party when the prime minister stepped down.
He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: 'I intend to succeed John Major when
John Major of his own volition goes, which I think will be a long way away.'
Mr Clarke's comments were seen by some MPs as an attempt to stall the strong
stream of support that has been developing behind Mr Heseltine.
But his declaration that the prime minister would remain in office did
little to cool the feverish atmosphere at Westminster, where centre and
leftwing Tory MPs joined rightwingers in condemning Mr Major's handling of
the enlargement negotiations.
Few were prepared to call publicly for his resignation. But most said a
leadership challenge in the autumn was inevitable unless the Conservatives
performed unexpectedly well in the local, European and Commons elections due
in the next three months.
'Both wings of the party are agreed that John Major will have to go after
the June elections,' one leading leftwing Tory MP said.
It emerged that informal talks have taken place between the Lollards, the
main backbench grouping on the left of the party, and the rightwing '92
Group.
Downing Street officials said Mr Major's mood was 'robust', and insisted
that he was not depressed by the almost uniformly hostile media reaction to
the enlargement deal.
In a speech to businessmen in Belfast last night, Mr Major again defended
his handling of negotiations over European Union voting, saying he was 'a
realist seeking to secure our success'.
He also hardened his challenge to the European Commission to ensure that the
safeguards agreed on majority voting should be maintained. 'If this deal is
not upheld, no one should expect the UK to continue the normal process of
Community business,' he said.
In Westminster, the prime minister's best hope appeared to be that tempers
on the back benches would cool during the 10-day Easter parliamentary
recess, which begins today.
A senior cabinet minister said privately, however, that the outlook for Mr
Major was bleak unless the mood of MPs had changed dramatically when they
returned from constituencies.
The mood of crisis was deepened by the disclosure that two of the four
rightwing cabinet ministers who opposed the enlargement deal - Mr Michael
Howard, home secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the
treasury - had breakfasted at Mr Portillo's London home.
Mr Portillo's friends said the pre-arranged breakfast had no connection with
the leadership fever. However, it stoked speculation that cabinet
rightwingers were plotting.
Mr Peter Lilley, the rightwing social security secretary, further fuelled
the impression of cabinet manoeuvring in a strongly Thatcherite speech
praising the 'intellectual tide of the 1980s'.
Mr Lilley, giving the first Spectator lecture in London, said Conservative
ideas could dominate the 1990s if they were expressed with 'vigour and
conviction' - qualities widely associated in the party with Baroness
Thatcher.
In a phrase which drew attention to the prime minister's deep unpopularity
in the opinion polls, Mr Lilley ended by urging the Conservatives to take
Sir Winston Churchill's advice and 'trust the people'.
Meanwhile, Mr Heseltine said Mr Major would lead the Conservatives into the
next election and 'win it with a large majority'. However, when asked to
rule out contesting a leadership contest, he sidestepped the question.

Gilt prices ended 1 1/2 points higher, encouraged by the Bank of England's
successful auction of floating-rate gilts, the first for 15 years. It was
over over-subscribed by 2.28 times.
Traders hope that further floating-rate issues will limit the supply of
conventional, fixed-rate gilts, which would help to support prices in that
market.

<TEXT>
Bobst, the Swiss packaging machinery group, suffered a second successive
profit decline last year, with consolidated net income down 31 per cent to
SFr44.9m (Dollars 31.6m).
However, the directors have decided to maintain the dividends, and are
forecasting an improvement in both turnover and profit in the current year.
The group, which specialises in machines for forming and decorating
cardboard, has been hit by reduced business in Europe and Japan. But order
inflow has improved since last autumn. Consolidated sales fell 7.9 per cent
last year to SFr932.7m and cash flow sank 21.5 per cent to SFr90.8m.
Lindt und Sprungli, the Swiss fine chocolate group, said its 1993 net profit
rose 4.2 per cent to SFr39.8m on sales up 11.2 per cent to SFr1.2bn.
Dividends are to be raised 2 per cent.
Mr Rudolph Sprungli, chairman, said he was confident of further growth in
the current year.

shake-up
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JI Case, the US manufacturer of farm machinery and construction equipment,
yesterday announced plans to restructure its French and UK operations to
improve efficiency and respond to depressed market conditions.
The measures will involve the closure of a plant in central France and job
losses at other French and UK sites.
Case, a unit of US-based Tenneco, said that faced with the current European
environment 'it cannot envisage a substantial natural improvement in
activity'. It outlined a series of restructuring measures to cut costs,
improve productivity and ensure 'long-term economic viability'.
The proposed measures, which the company said were the next steps in a
three-year restructuring programme, affect the group's French and UK
operations.
The Vierzon plant in central France, which employs 270, will be closed and
assembly of loader backhoes will be transferred to the company's plant in
Crepy en Valois, north of Paris. Some jobs will be transferred from Vierzon
to Crepy.
The company's Doncaster plant in northern England, which will become Case's
single European tractor assembly plant following the closure of a plant in
Germany, announced last year, will cease its component manufacture and
machining activities.
Jobs will be lost at the Doncaster plant, which currently employs about
1,400, although the number of positions affected is still unclear.
Foundry activities at Doncaster and St Dizier in eastern France will be
closed if alternative solutions, such as joint ventures, partnerships or
sales cannot be arranged. These activities employ 160 and 250 respectively.
The manufacture of backhoe transmissions at St Dizier will be replaced by
out-sourcing of these products.
Mr Steve Lamb, managing director of Case Europe, said that the steps were
necessary to assure the company's future.

FT  30 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Clinton may hit at China state business
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is considering targeting trade sanctions at Chinese state-owned
businesses if China does not move far enough to meet US human rights
concerns, a senior State Department official said yesterday.
Mr Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for Asia, said the US could
leave private enterprises untouched and withdraw Most Favoured Nation
trading privileges only from state-owned businesses if China did not make
enough progress by the June 3 deadline to justify an across-the-board
renewal of its MFN status.
Mr Lord said China had made progress in some areas, but would need to do
more. 'It is still possible to reach a credible outcome between now and June
3,' he said.
A partial withdrawal of MFN could pose 'definitional problems'. But that
solution could reduce the damage trade sanctions might cause to US
businesses involved in trade with China, as well as to Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Mr Lord acknowledged the US had not spoken with one voice over China: 'Mixed
signals had been coming out of Washington. I don't think they've stopped.'
This, he suggested, happened partly because the end of the cold war had
removed the overriding importance given to security issues in assessing
foreign policy priorities.
In the past, top national security officials would tell the Commerce
Department or the Treasury 'to get lost' when they raised concerns about a
trade or investment dispute.
'You know, don't bother us with these secondary issues. We're in a global
struggle with the Soviet Union and we can't jeopardise our alliance with
Japan over some silly trade dispute. Well, those days are over and they
should be over,' Mr Lord said. In the short term, this absence of a clear
hierarchy of priorities often led to difficult trade-offs.

The Swiss group said the orders, among the largest it had ever received, was
part of a major Syrian programme to modernise its textile industry.
One mill, to be built at Lattakia, will produce fine yarn via the ring
spinning process. Two Saurer German subsidiaries, Schlafhorst and Zinser,
will supply 37 automatic package winding machines with 109 ring spinning
machines and 37 speed frames, with a combined value of SFr55m.
The other mill, to be built in Idleb, will produce coarser rotor-spun yarns.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Malawi sets its sights on a rosier future: Agriculture and
industry begin to emerge from a thorny patch - Diversification pointing the
economy forwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three passenger flights per week connect Malawi with mainland Europe, and
each carries a hold full of roses.
Grown in 6.5 hectares of greenhouses on Lingadzi Farms, a few kilometres
from Lilongwe's international airport, 16m cut flowers were exported last
year, primarily to the Netherlands. Sales of 9m kwacha (Dollars 2m before
the kwacha was floated), hardly begins to rival Malawi's receipts from
tobacco, which still accounts for two thirds of export earnings but it shows
a potential way forward for the Malawian economy.
Since independence in 1964, President Kamuzu Hastings Banda has concentrated
on large-scale agriculture - tobacco, tea and sugar. This resulted in
occasionally impressive growth figures which have been vulnerable to the
vicissitudes of world prices, drought and the war in neighbouring Mozambique
which cut the rail link to the nearest Indian Ocean port. Little of the
export wealth, however, trickled down to the mainly rural population.
Diversification has long been desirable but the question was into what and
how? Macadamia nuts have fractionally broadened the agro-export base, but
the market for them is small and there are a growing number of international
competitors.
Increasingly it is argued that attention should focus on a range of
low-volume, high value horticultural crops. This will be one of the
recommendations of an African Development Bank mission, which has been
working with the trade ministry to identify industrial opportunities,
markets and potential investors.
Mr Ramesh Ardikari, head of the mission, sees a future for crops with modest
land demand, such as asparagus, if the government helps to provide air
freight facilities.
The first requirement of such a focus, according to Mr Ardikari, is the
right policy environment to attract investment. He sees February's lifting
of exchange controls and authorisation for exporters to hold hard currency
bank accounts as a step in this direction.
Ms Jenny Perepeckzco, general manager of Lingadzi Farms, says the move
facilitated expansion plans. These include a new irrigation scheme and
another 2 hectares of greenhouse, producing a further 4m roses per annum.
The liberalisation package came at a time of acute foreign exchange
shortage, before the April tobacco auctions, and when many foreign investors
had a backlog of dividends they had been unable to obtain the foreign
exchange to remit, a rapid result was the effective devaluation of the
kwacha by some 40 per cent.
Mr Jerry Jana, director of the Malawian Chamber of Commerce, commented that
'It's a large dose of medicine; some of us were not aware we were that
sick.'
The lifting of exchange controls was the latest stage in a process of
economic liberalisation which has been going on for a decade.
First on the list of targets for structural adjustment was Admarc, the
parastatal agricultural marketing board, which was divested in the 1980s of
various subsidiary operations.
The softwood furniture manufacturer, Wood Industries, has been privatised
while Malawi Railways is in the process of rationalisation before possible
privatisation. The telecommunications network has been hived off from the
Post Office and made to operate on commercial lines. It too may be sold.
Import liberalisation has also allowed rival goods into a local market which
has been protected for local manufacturers and established foreign investors
who are now seeking export markets.
Lonrho of the UK is the largest foreign investor with subsidiaries in
agriculture as well as transport and motor vehicle franchises, it has a key
position in the economy, not least through its monopoly of sugar production
both for export and local sale.
If Lonrho decides to reduce its stake in Malawi, a likely buyer would be the
country's own giant, the Press Group. With 20 subsidiaries and 12 associated
companies in distribution, manufacturing, agriculture and financial
services, including major shareholdings in both high street banks, the
group's turnover last year of kwacha 1.5bn amounts to about a fifth the
country's gross domestic product.
Such a concentration of economic power concerns World Bank economists, even
though one privately admits that Press is 'remarkably efficient.'
Restructured in the 1980s, the company has repaid loans ahead of schedule
and has started to pay dividends to its ultimate shareholder, the Press
Trust.
This shadowy body, intended to operate 'for the benefit of the people of
Malawi,' has as its chairman President Banda himself.
The only other declared trustees are Mr Louis Chimango, finance minister,
and Mr John Tembo, the uncle of Dr Banda's official consort who is in effect
his prime minister and also chairman of Air Malawi, Admarc, the main
publishing house Blantyre Print, and the Press Group itself, as well as
several of its subsidiaries.
None of the six opposition parties contending for power in the May elections
suggest serious alternatives to the liberalisation programme.
There is no perceptible difference in ideology, only a deep seated
suspicion, or envy, of the power which has accumulated along the Banda-Tembo
axis.
Mr Watipaso Mkandawire, an economist in the Investment Promotion Agency,
recently set up as a 'one-stop shop' to facilitate the setting up of new
companies, believes that the predominance of Press Group cuts two ways.
It can, he says, be very hard for Malawian entrepreneurs to break into areas
where the group has dealings; but foreign investors may be attracted by
Press' record of partnerships with firms companies British Petroleum,
Carlsberg, and the Guardian insurance group, and by the possibility of using
Malawi as a back door into South African markets.

Hong Kong's electoral watchdog launched a publicity campaign yesterday, to
persuade residents to register to vote in the last elections before the
British colony returns to China in 1997, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Mr
Woo Kwok-hing, Election Commission chairman, said he hoped a quarter of Hong
Kong's 1.94m eligible voters who have yet to register would do so by July 1.
The final local council polls fall in September, with Legislative Council
elections next year.

FT  30 MAR 94 / PLO leaders deny activists opened fire first
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PLO leaders in Gaza emphatically denied yesterday that the six Fatah
activists shot dead by Israeli undercover troops in the Jeblaya refugee camp
on Monday night had opened fire first on the soldiers, and Israeli military
officials appeared to backtrack on their earlier claims that the soldiers
had come under fire.
The military officials, having initially claimed their troops opened fire on
the uniformed Fatah activists only after being shot at themselves, revised
their account, saying only that since the Fatah men were armed, the soldiers
feared for their lives.
The Gaza killings triggered a furious backlash in the occupied territories,
with at least one Palestinian killed and more than 50 injured.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Honda, Mazda to buy more US car parts: Japanese carmakers
relent after sustained pressure from US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Honda and Mazda, the Japanese motor groups, yesterday followed the example
of their three main competitors and announced plans to increase use of
locally made components at their American factories. The companies also
promised to increase imports into Japan.
Separately, the ministry of international trade and industry announced it
was ending its voluntary cap on car exports to the US because it had been
made redundant by local manufacture of Japanese cars in the US.
The cap was introduced in 1981 to protect the US motor industry. About 1.54m
vehicles will be built by Japanese manufacturers in the US in 1994, the
first year they will exceed exports to the US of cars produced in Japan.
These are expected to reach nearly 1.4m units. Japanese exports have been
under the ceilings set by the voluntary agreement since 1987.
The announcements come as the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association
revealed that Japan's motor exports in February had fallen 23.5 per cent in
unit terms compared with the same month last year. The figure was down 2.6
per cent on the preceding month. In dollar terms, exports, including parts,
dropped 7.9 per cent to Dollars 6.85bn. Japanese car, bus and truck makers
have been struggling with the high value of the yen which has made their
products increasingly uncompetitive.
The car makers' undertakings on parts follow sustained pressure from
Washington for Japan to increase use of US vehicle components to reduce
Japan's trade surplus. Only 2 per cent of motor parts are imported. The
Japanese government insists it is unable to interfere in private business.
Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi have already revealed similar programmes.
Combined, the five groups have committed themselves to increasing US parts
purchases by more than Dollars 5.3bn by the financial year ending March
1998.
Honda said it planned to increase the use of US parts at its Marysville,
Ohio plant from Dollars 3.21bn in the 1992 financial year to Dollars 4.65bn
during the 1995 financial year. It would also raise imports of vehicles and
parts from Dollars 1.07bn to Dollars 1.27bn between 1992 and 1995.
However, the group said that while it would make every effort to achieve
such goals, it was not an enforceable commitment. 'Successful achievement of
the goal depends on maintaining strong sales in the US and continued
improvements in US suppliers' competitiveness,' it said.
Mazda announced it would increase imports of components into Japan from
Dollars 560m last financial year to Dollars 870m by the year ending March
1998. Over the same period local procurement of parts at its American
factory would increase from Dollars 1.65bn to Dollars 1.9bn.

Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Olivetti, yesterday said the winning of
the Italian mobile telecommunications licence by a consortium led by his
computer group had rewarded 'three years of enthusiasm'. Late on Monday the
government announced that Omnitel-Pronto Italia had been awarded the licence
for Italy's Europe-wide GSM network over a rival offer from the Unitel
consortium, which grouped Fiat, Fininvest, Vodafone and BellSouth.
Olivetti's shares yesterday rose 2.5 per cent, by mid-session, on the Milan
stock market, against a static market. The 15-year licence has been valued
at up to L4,300bn (Dollars 2.54bn) and will pit Omnitel-Pronto Italia
against the state-controlled Sip domestic network, which had held a monopoly
in the mobile phones market.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Krajina talks make progress: Negotiators hold out hope of
ceasefire in breakaway Serb territory

Croatian government officials and leaders of Krajina, the breakaway Serb
territory in Croatia, yesterday made headway in crucial talks on a
ceasefire, which Serb leaders said could avert another war in the region.
Negotiators held out the hope that the two sides might reach an agreement
late yesterday night.
'I don't see why the agreement cannot be reached today. . . . We are in a
perfect position. It is up to the two sides whether they want this
agreement,' said Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian special envoy to the region
who hosted the talks.
Mr Slobodan Jarcevic, foreign minister of Krajina, the self-styled state
which covers nearly a third of Croatia, said: 'If we get a ceasefire, which
is backed by the international community, then we could avoid war.'
Speaking by telephone from the Russian embassy in Zagreb, the Croatian
capital, where the two sides met for the second time in a week, Mr Jarcevic
said: 'The chances are fifty-fifty that we reach an agreement. The
atmosphere is very tense, but so much is at stake.'
International mediators see resolution of the Serb-Croat conflict, which
began in 1991, as the key to peace in Bosnia and stabilisation of former
Yugoslavia. 'They received a message that there is a sense of urgency and
even impatience in the international community that this opportunity should
not be allowed to pass by,' said Mr John Mills, spokesman for the United
Nations conference on former Yugoslavia.
Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy, and Mr Peter Galbraith, the US
ambassador to Croatia, also urged Croat and Serb representatives to reach an
agreement, which was to include the withdrawal of infantry by 1km and heavy
weaponry by 20km, said diplomats.
Ceasefire talks collapsed last week amid disagreement over the front line.
The two sides remain far apart in their political demands. Serb leaders
insist on independence for their breakaway state, carved out over a
six-month war, backed by the Yugoslav army, while Croatian authorities are
pressing the international community to bring Krajina, which cuts Croatia in
two, under Zagreb's control.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has reportedly suggested trading
parts of Serb-held land in exchange for the phasing out of UN sanctions on
what remains of Yugoslavia.
These areas include western Slavonija, which straddles the main motorway,
and Knin, the Serb stronghold in Krajina, which was once the key railway
junction for Croatia and has all but cut off access to the southern
Dalmatian coast.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (20): Most promising export
sector - Shiraz Sidhva takes a look at the food processing industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India's food-processing industry has attracted more than Rs300bn of domestic
and foreign investment in the last two years, more than any other sector
except power.
Realising the tremendous export potential and domestic market for processed
foods, the government is encouraging strawberry farmers, mushroom growers,
tomato paste and fruit juice exporters, aquaculture and deep-sea fishing
companies to set up joint ventures or 100 per cent export-oriented companies
in different parts of India.
Multinationals such as Pepsi, Lever Brothers, Cadbury's, Kellogg's, Nestle,
McCormick, Wimco, Dalsem Veciep and Haegens of Holland, and C Itoh, have
entered the market or shown interest in India's most promising export and
domestic industry.
India, with its range of tropical and temperate climates, abundant sunshine,
ranks second only to China and Brazil in the production of vegetables and
fruits respectively. For a country that produces nearly 80m tonnes of fruits
and vegetables, its share in the world market is negligible, at less than
one per cent.
About 0.6 per cent of the country's produce is processed (a poor comparison
to Brazil's 70 per cent, Malaysia's 83 per cent or the US 70-80 per cent).
About 30 per cent of the total produce is wasted due to inadequate or
underutilised food processing capacity, and poor harvesting techniques,
causing a loss to the country of Rs30bn per annum.
Realising the tremendous export potential of this relatively new industry
(India, until the late 1980s, concentrated on self-sufficiency in food), the
government is encouraging the setting up of 100 per cent export-oriented
fruit and vegetable processing units.
Changes in the export-import policy and an exchange rate adjustment have
helped improve export of fruit and vegetables.
Exports of processed fruits and vegetables including dried and preserved
fruits and nuts (excluding cashewnuts) have increased from Rs787.7m in
1988-89 to Rs2.63bn in 1992-93.
The ministry of food processing industries estimates that India has the
potential to increase its processed foods exports to Rs60bn in the next five
years.
Last year, exports registered a growth of over 30 per cent despite the
set-back received by exports to Russia and CIS countries.
Value addition is the key, say officials. For example, mango juice fetches
Rs40,000 per tonne, and tomato paste Rs12,000 globally, while the raw fruit
costs only Rs1,000 per tonne.
According priority status to the food processing industry, the government
has allocated Rs3bn for building up infrastructure by 1995-96. The estimated
installed capacity in the fruit and vegetable processing sector has
increased to 1.1m tonnes in December 1992 from 950,000 tonnes in 1991. But
even the existing capacity is often underutilised by up to 30 per cent.
Other factors that inhibit growth are the high costs of produce (due to low
yields) and variations in quality of raw material, attributed to small
agricultural holdings; inadequate and expensive storage facilities;
increasing transportation and distribution costs; unhygienic slaughter
houses; the poor quality of packaging and outdated technology.
Though most food processing industries have been deregulated - with the
exception of distillation and brewing of alcoholic drinks, sugar, animal
fats and oils - potential investors say government policies lack clarity,
and that high tariffs are a great disincentive.
India grows some of the most exotic fruits and vegetables in the world, but
many varieties are table quality, and not conducive to exports or
processing.
Companies entering the sector have to invest heavily on infrastructure and
on importing technology.
The most remarkable growth has been in the area of deep sea fishing, where
more than 25 proposals with foreign investment of about Dollars 6m have been
approved by the government in the last two years, which will add 113 large
deep-sea fishing vessels to catch tuna and other fish.
Some of these vessels include on-board processing of fish to produce
value-added products. An additional Dollars 12m worth of foreign investment
proposals have been approved for aquaculture and 100 per cent
export-oriented units for fish-processing and marketing.
India's domestic markets have been limited by the fact that Indians prefer
to cook and eat fresh produce, not processed foods.
But with increasing urbanisation and the disintegration of the family, a
burgeoning middle class is emerging, which could provide considerable
potential for processed foods. 'The sky is the limit,' says an official with
a food multi-national. 'India could be a world leader in processed foods by
the turn of the century if it tries hard enough to get there.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (19): Senior status among US
companies - Ray Bashford probes General Electric's Dollars 500m commitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY BASHFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Electric has emerged as the flagship of US investment in India.
After concluding four years ago that the country was transforming into a new
industrial frontier Mr Jack Welsh, the chief executive, launched a high
profile investment strategy which has given the conglomerate this senior
status among the US companies crowding into Delhi.
GE's much publicised plans to invest up to Dollars 500m in India in the next
three years also has made it an important participant in several vital areas
of infrastructural development through the private sector.
The group's diverse spread of operations is being replicated in India. The
power engine, finance, home appliance and lighting, locomotive and medical
divisions are at varying stages of growth. And to complete the group's
involvement, the television, electrical distribution and control and motor
engine businesses are seeking routes for entry.
Responsibility for GE's strategy in India has been handed over to Mr Scott
Bayman, 47,-who hails from Louisville, Kentucky. He took put the position
eight months ago but watched the Indian plans mature during three and a half
years as a senior executive in the group's appliance division.
'This is an exciting place to be for GE. It's being part of changing GE's
centre of gravity towards this part of the world and that is rewarding,' Mr
Bayman says.
GE is becoming known for 'what it has done not what it is going to do,' he
adds. 'This means that the government is able to point to GE when other
foreign companies are interested in coming in.'
US companies, particularly customers of GE such has Ford and Allied Signals,
have sounded out Mr Bayman on the opportunities in India. Many others groups
are watching GE's progress before making commitments.
Mr Welsh's study found that India, China and Mexico were the key growth
areas for GE into the next century. After follow-up investigations by the
corporation's strategists the decision to tilt investment funds towards
these areas was put into effect about three years ago.
'We came to the conclusion that there were large opportunities in India,' Mr
Bayman says. 'Look at the growth opportunities in India and compare them
with the mature markets of North America and Europe and you can get awful
excited.'
As the result of discussions on the ground with business and government
leaders, the company dismissed as out-dated the view of India as
over-populated, over-governed and irreversibly Third World. Instead it
concluded that India was potentially one of the two biggest markets in the
world, had a Western-based financial system and, most importantly, wanted
change.
To date, Dollars 150m has been invested. Final approval for two power
projects where GE is co-developer, equity partner and power equipment
supplier, could soon push investment to more than Dollars 250m.
With power engines one of GE's main businesses the group's success rests
heavily on the national government's ability to force through its energy
policy which is pivotal to the development of the industrial infrastructure.
Mr Bayman, while admitting a vested interest, expresses concern about any
slow down in the process of infrastructural development. 'If we are going to
build world-class products here I want to be able to get the products to
customers on time,' he says. 'We don't want to be unable to expand fast
enough because of the lack of water or power. Development of the
infrastructure has to be on the top of everyone's list.'
To capture the growing market for consumer items GE has cultivated joint
ventures with several of the country's leading companies. In the white goods
area it has teamed up with Godrej &amp; Boyce and in lighting with Gujarat Apar.
The Wipco-GE Medical Systems subsidiary will manufacture ultrasound
equipment and last November a joint venture with Indian Petrochemicals
Corporation began production of advanced engineering plastics.
The government is considering a radical proposal to upgrade the country's
locomotive fleet. It has offered to upgrade all electrical engines to boost
haulage capacity and speed before leasing them back to the government.
Two green field plants have been established through these joint ventures.
GE Capital is a fully owned subsidiary in India and has established a joint
venture with the Housing Development Finance Corporation based in Bombay.
GE will import a broad range of the finance arm's international activities,
including auto finance, credit arms and leasing. It will also become an
integrated support operation to finance the sale of GE capital equipment. By
transferring most of its business divisions to India GE believes it has
minimised the effect of possible failure in any single area. 'Although the
amount of each investment is big in relative terms it is not a
bet-your-business investment. If one venture does not make it you are not
risking the profitability of the group (in India),' the American says.
Mr Bayman believes that an increasing availability of consumer durables will
eventually help fuel the liberalisation process. 'The impact of foreign
investment will be to improve the standard of living and this has not been
felt yet. If we show the benefits we will see the benefits,' he says.
GE feels that there is not a shortage of international funds available for
investment in India, but that the onus rests with the government to
establish boundaries for acceptable risks and rewards.
'I tell Indians not to worry about competing against China for investment.
India has to compete against the world with competitive products,' Mr Bayman
says.
However, the question of what are acceptable profit returns from new private
sector industry is likely to become an increasingly politically charged
issue at a state and national level. It will certainly emerge as a key issue
in several of the coming state elections and GE is aware of its importance.
'We know there are going to be bumps in the road. There will be bumps in the
road for the next 10 years but there are also bumps in the road in North
America,' Mr Bayman says.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (18): Biggest surge since 1948
 -Bombay's finance markets are thriving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bombay's financial markets are booming, fuelled by the biggest surge of
foreign portfolio investment since India's independence.
The city is filled with international fund managers, stockbrokers and
merchant bankers touting for business. Hotels are full. Office space in
Nariman Point, the heart of Bombay's business district, is at a premium.
Recruitment agencies are on the prowl. 'It's like Seoul was in 1986,' says
one Hong Kong-based fund manager.
Even though equity prices fell sharply immediately after last month's
Budget, the stock market is more buoyant than at any time since the 1992
securities scandal. The Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share index, which hit a
post-scandal low of 2150 last summer, almost doubled to 4,236 just before
the Budget.
The rise has come amid signs of a modest recovery in Indian industry after
more than two years of stagnation. But the real trigger for the markets has
been a flood of foreign buying, far above the expectations of officials at
the finance ministry, who opened the market to non-Indian investors only at
the end of 1992.
As late as last September, foreigners had bought a mere Dollars 150m of
stock, so time-consuming were the procedures for securing permission to
enter the market. But by the year-end, the figure was over Dollars 1bn and
now stands above Dollars 1.3bn.
About 150 institutions have now registered with the Indian authorities -
around 90 are active buyers. Large overseas funds dedicated to India which
have yet to buy stock - notably Dollars 500m funds managed by Morgan Stanley
and Robert Oppenheimer, the US investment banks. Mr GB Desai, the Bombay
Stock Exchange president, says: 'With so much buying by foreign
institutional investors the mood is very positive.'
In addition, foreign fund managers have bought about Dollars 1.2bn in Indian
companies' Euroissues, including substantial offerings from Reliance
Industries, the petrochemicals and textiles group, the State Bank of India,
the country's largest bank. In the pipeline is a Dollars 1bn issue from
Videsh Sancahr Nigam, India's international telecommunications carrier.
While the post-Budget correction could temporarily delay some issues, at the
time of writing it does not seem likely to cause any longer-term disruption.
Indian companies have taken advantage of this demand to issue record amounts
of new equity to help repay old loans and raise funds for new projects. The
total market capitalisation of the Bombay Stock Exchange has topped
Rs3,000bn.
Nevertheless, the first flush of enthusiasm for Indian stocks could soon
fade. The driving force behind last year's surge in foreign buying was
principally a hunt for new developing countries in which to invest following
big increases in east Asian markets. This was coupled to moderate enthusiasm
about India's economic reforms.
But as fund managers crowded into Bombay, driving up prices, so some
important concerns have emerged. The first is that leading Indian equities
are not cheap by world standards, with the 30-share index trading on a
composite multiple of 50 times earnings - up from 30 a year ago. Smaller
stocks trade on multiples as low as 10: these are the real investment jewels
of modern India but identifying the suitable ones takes time and the markets
in them are often illiquid.
The next problem is the archaic trading, settlement and stock transfer
systems, which can cause delays of up to six months between payment and the
formal registration of share-ownership. If entering such a market can be
difficult, then getting out might be even harder - especially if, at some
future date, foreign fund managers all go for the exit at the same time.
The biggest bottleneck now is in custodial services - the handling of the
paperwork connected to share trading which is usually done by a custodian
bank on behalf of an investor. The three international banks offering
services in Bombay - Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Standard
Chartered Bank and Citibank - were overwhelmed by the investment surge.
Hongkong bank and Citibank, the two bigger operators, placed curbs on new
accounts and recruited extra staff to clear the backlog. Hongkong bank said
early this month that the backlog had virtually been cleared though the
trading curbs were still in place to make sure the paperwork did not swell
again.
The Securities and Investment Board of India, the markets watchdog,
authorised regulatory changes including the use of 'jumbo' transfer deeds
and share certificates to ease the transfer of large lots. Indian banks are
also offering to act as custodians for foreign investors.
However, Mr SS Nadkarni, the Sebi chairman, says the real solution will come
with the introduction of computerised trading, combined with computerised
settlement and share registration. These changes are to be introduced over
the next two years.
Also, the Bombay market will steadily become more accessible to foreign
investors as more foreign-owned financial services companies establish
themselves. Fourteen foreign-owned stockbrokers have been permitted to open
offices - though they are limited to dealing with foreign investors and
cannot yet join the stock exchange so must trade through Indian brokers. The
exchange has recently opened its doors to corporate membership, including
joint ventures between foreign companies and local partners, though none has
yet been admitted.
Moreover, the Sebi has done much to improve standards of honesty in the
market. Dealing with the 1992 securities scandal, in which money was
illegally siphoned out of banks into equities, has given Sebi an ideal
opportunity to start cleaning up bad practices including over-charging
clients, mixing client and own account trading, insider dealing, tax fraud
and poor book-keeping. 'There's a much more salubrious atmosphere at the BSE
now,' says Mr Nadkarni.
Sebi has this year also recorded a considerable success in reforming the
exchange's informal forward market, called badla, which has been widely used
for untransparent trading. Eventually the government plans to replace badla
with a formal futures and options market.
The remarkable progress in creating modern capital markets contrasts sharply
with much slower reforms elsewhere, notably in the state-owned banks which
dominate the banking system.
The government has partially liberalised interest rates and rules
controlling loan markets, though important restrictions remain notably an
obligation on banks to lend a chunk of their funds directly to the
government and lend a further slice to politically-favoured groups such as
farmers and small businessmen.
The state-owned banks will face tougher competition following the licensing
of nine new private sector banks, the first in 30 years which will join the
existing 55 (including 24 foreign-owned).
The government is also planning to sell off up to 49 per cent of state-owned
banks. The State Bank of India, the largest, has gone to the market raising
Rs32bn in shares and bonds and reduced the state-controlled stake from 98
per cent to 66 per cent. Other stronger banks will follow Meanwhile, banks
have been forced by new accountancy rules to reveal the full extent of their
bad debts for the first time - Rs100bn-Rs110bn at the end of March 1993 for
the 28 national banks. The government, which earlier injected Rs40bn into
the banks, has put in a further Rs57bn over the last year with another
Rs57bn promised in 1994-95.
However, none of this will change the state-controlled nature of the banking
system. As Mr C Rangarajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the
central bank, says: 'In five or 10 years' time there will still be a
state-dominated banking system.' If the system is state-owned it is
difficult to see how banks will be forced to become genuinely competitive.
Cutting loss-making branches, shedding staff, introducing labour-saving
computers. None of this will come quickly.
As Mr N Vaghul, chairman of the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation
of India, a diversified development bank, says: 'The capital and banking
markets have changed. The next logical step is institutional change. But the
government is shying away from it.'
The other major financial market dominated by the state is insurance, where
two giants - the Life Insurance Company and the General Insurance Company -
monopolise services. The finance ministry is considering a report
recommending liberalisation, including the licensing of privately-owned
insurance companies. But competition will not transform the market, unless
the the state-owned groups are also turned over to private hands.
Barring accidents, the prospect for Indian financial markets is of further
rapid growth in size, including increasing participation for foreign
investors and financial services. In new markets, private initiatives will
dominate.
But in the traditional bedrock of the financial system, particularly in
banking, government influence and/or interference is likely to remain
pervasive. The result could be an uneasy balance between old and new:
computers and manual typewriters, faxes and messenger boys, million dollar
deals and one rupee revenue stamps.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (17): The road to Santacruz -
Jewellery exports sparkle in Bombay free trade zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bombay's Santacruz export processing zone (Sepz) is the spearhead of India's
growing exports of processed diamonds and jewellery, writes RC Murthy.
At present, there are 33 manufacturing units there which last year earned a
total Rs. 5bn. there are 33 units which process diamonds and make jewellery
for exports.
According to Hitesh Mehta, manager of Intergold, the biggest of these units,
a lot more companies would like to diversify into manufacturing for export
to take advantage of one of India's chief assets, its cheap labour.
Intergold, which began manufacturing in the zone a couple of months ago, is
a subsidiary of B. Arunkumar, one of the top 50 jewellery exporters in
India, with 1,200 employees.
Mehta manager, says says that access to cheap labour enables the export
manufacturers to raise their added value to 35 per cent.
Two dozen new units have been recently been authorised. It is estimated,
however, that about 900 of India's 5,500 jewellery exporters would like to
join them there.
Businesses in the zone are permitted to import gold and precious stones
duty-free and and to export their finished goods without obstruction.
The zone has become a magnet for exporters. Though the administration is
deregulating the economy, the integration with the global economy has been
painfully slow and the process is may take another five years.
The trade reforms have given a fillip to diamond exports. The rupee was
devalued by nearly 30 per cent three years ago. Last March it was made
convertible on the trade account and this month was also allowed to float on
the current account.
India escaped relatively lightly from the world diamond industry's deep
recession of the last three years.
Exports of finished diamonds from India shot up last year to Dollars 3.28bn
from nearly Dollars 3bn a year before.
The Central Selling Organisation, the marketing arm of De Beers, reported a
turnround in rough diamond sales last year, after a steady three year fall.
The CSO's sales jumped by 29 per cent to Dollars 4.36bn in 1993. India's
exports of finished diamonds and jewellery jumped 26.7 per cent on a
year-by-year basis to Dollars 3.56bn in the ll months to February last, says
Mr Harshad Mehta, chairman of Intergold.
Gold jewellery is the best performer, with exports rising by nearly 30 per
cent against a 6 per cent drop a year ago.
India's share in the Dollars 30bn world gold jewellery market is still only
0.26 per cent, however. Exporters and the administration are eager to make
it easier to import primary gold and to build the infrastructure for
jewellery manufacture.
'We will be a force to reckon with in the next five years', says Mr Mehta.
His confidence stems from India's breakthrough in the Far Eastern market
last year. Korea, Taiwan and Thailand overtook France and Germany, India's
most important markets after the US, Japan and Italy. The Asian 'tigers',
including Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore, and other Pacfic Rim
countries have vibrant economies, which augurs well for Indian exports, says
Mr Mehta.
A jewellery show in Bombay this month was part of a plan to increase
overseas customers' awareness of India's potential. A similar show a year
ago was ruined by a series of terrorist bombs in the city. Nows the industry
has decided to hold the Bombay fair every year. This year it took place
immediately after similar exhibitions in Hong Kong and Bangkok.
The Indian diamond houses also talk of building a permanent exhibition
complex in the diamond bourse.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (16): Forward from rebellion -
Punjab's industrial hub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUDHIANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As the prosperous northern state of Punjab limps back to normalcy after 10
years of armed insurgency, industrialists are doubly relieved.
They can go about their work without fear of the gun, and run three shifts
in their factories, which had ceased full production after the trouble
started a decade ago. And they can concentrate on greatly expanding their
businesses as they experience the benefits of the dismantling of the
country's licence raj.
Within two weeks of the Union budget statement by Mr Manmohan Singh, finance
minister and the main architect of India's reforms programme, industry was
upbeat in Ludhiana, Punjab's industrial hub.
The effects of decontrol are apparent at the Focal Point industrial estate,
where more than 10,000 factories within a 12km radius are engaged in the
manufacture of steel, machine tools, heavy engineering goods, hosiery,
textiles, and sewing machine parts.
Mr Raj Kumar Sharma, exports manager in the Punjab Small Industries and
Export Corporation, a state government body to encourage industrial growth,
says that the return of normalcy has prompted many more units to apply to
set up businesses in Ludhiana. The effects of the government's incentives to
exporters have percolated to businesses here, he says.
Mr Jagdish Rai Singal, managing director at Eastman Industries, runs one of
the most successful businesses at the industrial estate. He is happy that he
no longer needs to visit New Delhi, the capital, to spend endless hours
knocking at the doors of bureaucrats, while his business is neglected in
Ludhiana.
Mr Singal's company is among the country's seven leading exporters of
engineering goods, shipping Dollars 25m worth of engineering and light
engineering goods a year, with a range of products including bicycles and
bicycle and moped components, handtools, forgings and fasteners, entirely
for exports.
Like other units in the engineering industry, Eastman experienced the first
benefits of economic reform with the de-control of steel in 1991. 'Steel was
regularly available to back-up units, and our supporting manufacturers as
well, which is a major benefit of reform,' says Mr Singal.
'The climate is just right for the expansion of industry,' says Mr Jagat
Singh, managing director of GS Auto International, manufacturer of
automotive chassis suspension components and radiators. Mr Singh's
collaborators include Llanelli Radiators of the UK and Nissan of Japan.
'Finance is easy to obtain, and the import of raw materials has never been
simpler,' he says. 'Fuels like high speed diesel and liquefied petroleum gas
are easily available, and there is no waste of time obtaining the few
permissions that are still required from the government.'
Mr Brijmohan Lall, chairman of Hero Cycles Limited, and past president of
the Confederation of Indian Industry, says: 'We used to waste a great deal
of time and energy trying to get things done in New Delhi, deputing very
senior people to do it.'
'The licence and inspector raj is practically finished and the reforms have
brought a lot of economy in our day-to-day functioning', says the head of
the world's largest bicycle factory, on Ludhiana's main road, minutes away
from the Focal Point estate. 'Earlier, we used to have to run around for
days before the most junior official of the Steel Authority gave us some
steel. Now we have senior personnel calling on us, wanting to make the raw
material available to us on a regular basis.'
Erratic supply and broken deadlines as a result of a delay in clearances are
also a thing of the past. Hero is in the process of setting up a steel mill,
and all it has to do is acquire the land, import equipment, and commence
manufacturing.
'Our equipment suppliers have started trusting us when we say we will remit
money to him, and once we settle on a price he knows I will import it and
not pull out at the last minute because the government did not grant
permission.'
A major advantage of reform is that permissions required from the Reserve
Bank of India have almost completely been abolished, with the simplification
of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) rules. Exporters and other foreign
exchange earners have been permitted to retain 25 per cent of their foreign
exchange earnings in foreign currency, and 100 per cent export-oriented
units and units in export-processing zones can keep 50 per cent.
'Our agents abroad were never sure that their commissions got to them in
time, or at all, and the new rules have made both agents and customers quite
happy,' says Mr Singal. Pricing quotations have become simpler, because the
exporters do not have to take 'incentive money' or bribes to officials into
account when quoting their prices.
'Our costing used to be different from week to week, because of erratic
supply, but that has stabilised now,' says Mr Lall. 'When in the past we had
to chase even the smallest bank loan, the availability of finance has
increased dramatically, and there is not a day when some financial
institution does not approach us with offers of funds.'
'Exporters have access to finance for exports at a 6.5 per cent interest
rate which is a very positive feature for keeping you competitive,' adds Mr
Singal.
The complexities of export notifications have been disbanded to a great
extent, with value-based advance licensing available for most items except a
few on the negative list for reasons of security or protection of the
environment. 'The few licences that are needed take a shorter time to get
than ever before,' says Mr Singal.
Inter-nodal transportation is to be introduced soon, which will allow a
clearing agent registered with the Ministry of Commerce to issue bills for
loading the ship, thus saving time and paperwork with the ministry. The
Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme for importing equipment at a
concessional rate of duty has also been very effective.
Other industrialists in the Focal Point estate agree that there is an
attitudinal change in the bureaucracy. 'But some snags persist at the lower
levels, because old habits die hard,' claims Mr Harbhajan Singh, who run a
small handtools business in the area. 'But the overall attitudinal change
for the better is reflected in the fact that more foreigners are keen to do
business with India, with a greater awareness than ever before of its
changing image.'
'The slow pace of our reforms gets accentuated when they are compared to
reforms in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia,' says Mr Singal. 'We may
be on the same route but are nowhere near them in terms of speed or
efficiency.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (15): A pygmy with giant
potential - The telephone system is being slowly restructured and widened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY BASHFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Residents of India's biggest cities can expect to wait up to five years for
a telephone connection to their house. Getting an outside line from an
international hotel can sometimes seem as slow.
As increasing numbers of people clamour for phones and tire of cross-lines
and break downs the Indian Government is getting down to the business of
dragging the service into a new age.
There is ample evidence around Delhi that foreign and domestic companies
believe that the cracks in the government's protective wall are about to
widen to expose one of the potentially two biggest markets in the world for
telecommunications.
International seminars on the industry, visiting delegations to local
companies and the creation of new Asian headquarters in Delhi for
multinational groups are signals of change.
Mr N. Vittal, the chairman of the Telecom Commission, is the man in charge
of throwing open the industry to competition by breaking the grip of the
protective Department of Telecommunications (DoT).
His energetic style and commitment to liberalisation has earned Mr Vittal,
during his five months as chairman, the nickname, the 'DoT breaker'.
However wide his support is in industry and broad sections of government,
the first important test of his authority will come early next month when
the government is expected to hand down its decision on his policy review.
Although already delayed by two months, Mr Vittal is confident about the
chances for his plan. He will not discuss its details but speaks as a man
who believes he has the tide of opinion running with him. 'It (his plan) is
being considered by the highest level of government and we are waiting for
approval,' he says.
Industry feels that the government will broadly embrace Mr Vittal's
proposals but they will be tempered by opposition from unions and the DoT
which want a more gradual and highly regulated entry of private capital.
For example, there is a widespread feeling that the companies will,
initially at least, be stopped from access to the creation of telephone
networks in major population centres. Instead they will be offered
opportunities in semi-urban and industrial development areas where
infrastructure spending will be higher and the demand less.
Mr Sunil Mittal, the managing director of Bharti Telecom which is bidding
for a relatively small network licence in the Punjab with New Zealand
Telecom, says that the big cities are 'the holy cows of the Department of
Telecommunications'.
'Mr Vittal's plans may not go straight through. It may take some time. But
there is no doubt that things are happening,' he says.
The potential demand and investment requirement are enormous. India lags
well behind developing Asian countries in terms of lines per capita. For
example, Malaysia has 10 lines per 100 inhabitants and Thailand four while
India has 0.68, placing it slightly behind China, India's main rival for
foreign investment, with 0.73.
India's 200m strong middle class are the target. Servicing the immediate
demand of the market would call for a rise in the number of lines from the
existing 7m to 20m, according to the government.
There are 3m people waiting for telephones, Mr Vittal says. 'It is the DoT's
experience that the moment the waiting list is removed, a larger waiting
list springs up.'
A rise to 20m telephones would call for the investment of Dollars 13bn. The
more optimistic in the industry believe that the installation of 23m lines
by the turn of the century is achievable.
Applications for 23 networks have been received, although some of these are
seen as not much more than expressions of interest. In addition to network
applications, the liberalisation has opened up the market for parts and
equipment in anticipation of expanding installations.
Leading domestic groups including RP Goenka, YK Modi, Tata Electronics and
Bharti Telecom, are positioning themselves to expand rapidly. While at the
same time international groups ranging from Northern Telecom, US West,
Motorola, Ericsson, Alcatel, AT&amp;T, France Telecom, British Telecom, Siemens
to New Zealand Telecom are also active.
In many cases local companies are linking in joint ventures to establish
networks with international companies or are forming technological exchange
tie ups or direct purchase agreements.
US West has made one of the more ambitious proposals to set up a fixed
wireless and fibre optic network in non-urban areas of Tamil Nadu, the south
eastern state. If approved by the government the bid, made on a
non-exclusive basis leaving the door open to other potential operators,
would call for a direct investment of Dollars 100m, subject to US West board
approval.
The role that DoT could play in this new, liberalised climate is unclear and
subject to intense speculation. A break-up of the department along regional
lines is the most likely first step, perhaps with the disposal of at least
part of each segment to private investors.
There are indications that the department is boosting its own efficiency.
Long seen as one of the most bloated arms of government, productivity has
risen during the past three years by holding staff levels down to 480,000
while the number of telephone lines has risen from 4m to 7m.
An important first stage of the privatisation of the Indian
telecommunications system came with the first sale of a stake in Videsh
Sanchar Nigam, the country's international service provider. The government
sold a 12 per cent in early 1992 and this could be reduced to 52 per cent by
the end of the year. The company is in the process of making a Dollars 1bn
international equity issue as part of this plan, the biggest ever made by an
India company. To oversee competition in this less regulated atmosphere the
government is establishing a Telecommunications Regulatory Authority which
will include members from outside the DoT.
Mr Vittel points to the promotion of value-added services, in particular
cellular telephones and paging services as others signs of deregulation.
However, this process as commenced inauspiciously.
The granting of the first eight licences for cellular networks, each of
which was a joint bid with a foreign partner, in the four biggest cities has
landed in the Indian High Court amid allegations from those among the 22
unsuccessful bidders of corruption, mismanagement and nepotism. The
long-overdue high court ruling and the government's decision on Mr Vittal's
recommendations are keenly awaited.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (14): Unravelling the
spaghetti - Joint venture profile / Lucas and TVS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY BASHFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management at Lucas-TVS used to call the inefficient production floor at the
automotive parts plant on the outskirts of Madras 'spaghetti junction'.
This reference to the tangle of motorway overpasses in Birmingham, the home
of Lucas Industries, is one of the many cultural legacies left by the
expatriate staff of the automotive, aerospace and industrial systems group,
during the 30 year life of the Lucas-TVS joint venture.
The plant today has a tight production system, is largely automated and is
poised to face the challenges thrown open by the Indian Government's
industrial liberalisation plans.
The venture with TVS, one of India's 20 biggest industrial conglomerates,
stands out as an example of industrial co-operation which has endured the
political uncertainty that has sent many foreign companies packing from
India.
Mr K. Seshadri, the executive director, speaks in glowing terms of the
assistance and direction that Lucas has lent the company as it has grown
through the production of principally starter motors, alternators and
dynamos.
'It's good to be exposed to fresh ideas,' he says.
'Englishmen have a different way of looking at things and the company has
benefited from this objectivity.'
He makes special mention of Mr Ron Flint, one of nine joint managing
directors from Lucas during the history of the company. He, in the decade
before his retirement last year, helped oversee a growth in sales from about
Dollars 10m to Pounds 42m.
This expansion rests heavily on the arrival in the Indian market of the
Maruti Suzuki, the country's first small car for the urban middle class.
Lucas-TVS used its established position as a producer of dynamos for the
Ambassador range of cars to capture the lion's share of the market for the
new car's starter motor and alternator needs.
Lucas-TVS saw off a challenge from a joint venture between SRF, a
diversified Indian industrial group, and Nippon Denso, the Japanese
components company, for this new market. SRF, as it is known, was
established in the mid-1980s but the combination of high tariffs and an
appreciating yen against the rupee made its trading conditions difficult.
Lucas-TVS developed out of a desire by both partners to extend and diversify
their existing operations. Lucas had, for 30 years prior to the
establishment of the joint venture distributed its home grown products
through a broad geographic dealer network in India while TVS had developed
from a small family concern into a national trucking and bus business.
Their union put the venture at the forefront the country's fledgling
automotive industry which was being buffeted by government interference. The
present shareholding structure is evidence of the wish by successive
governments to have a firm grip on the industry. The government still
indirectly holds 14 per cent as a result of a decision by New Delhi in the
1960s to force Lucas to cut its stake from 60 per cent to 51 per cent and
TVS to lower its holding from 40 per cent to 34 per cent.
Day to day management has been progressively handed to a local team.
Following the retirement of Mr Flint there are no Lucas staff at the site.
At its peak there were more that 20 British expatriate employees. There is
no plan to appoint a Lucas representative as a joint managing director.
'We have a very strong Indian management team,' says a Lucas spokesman in
London. 'We are confident and happy to let the present management run the
business.'
Mr T K Balaji, who is the sole managing director, speaks about the need to
push firmly ahead with automation to counter possible challenges to
Lucas-TVS's controlling position in its prime market.
In a reference to the possibility of foreign imports which may come from
lower import tariffs, he says it is no longer sufficient for the company to
rely on its cheap labour costs to provide a competitive advantage.
The impact of greater automation at the plant has already been felt. After a
decade of steady growth to 3,100 employees in 1988, the number has fallen to
3,000.
Highlighting the rise in productivity already achieved, sales in 1988 were
only Pounds 18.7m, less than half last year's figure.
'We must automate more and we are talking to many people about this,' Mr
Balaji says. Discussions have been initiated with Japanese companies about
possible collaboration and Nippon Denso is one of the groups understood to
have been involved.
The managing director is guarded about his development plans but he stresses
the need to expand into diesel fuel injection systems.
Mico, in which Robert Bosch of Germany is the biggest shareholder, is the
main participant in the Indian market for this component. Lucas-TVS has been
looking enviously at the returns the German-led venture has been achieving
and believes that a drive into this expanding area is important for
longer-term prosperity.
Lucas will feature heavily in any decision but will probably approach it
with a good deal more optimism about the future than at any time in the past
30 years.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (13): Pergau factor could hit
jets deal - Defence Purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY BASHFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The main talking point in the Indian defence establishment is when, if ever,
will even the Indian government give the go-ahead for the purchase of Hawk
trainer aircraft from British Aerospace.
The fact that the acquisition has been at the centre of the defence debate
for several years is symptomatic of the slow-down during the past five years
which has taken place in the modernisation of India's defence services under
pressure from stringent financial contraints.
Even the best placed defence analysts and foreign observers are unsure of
the progress of protracted negotiations between several ministries on the
purchase, although the Cabinet is know to have, on at least one occasion,
rejected a proposal. However, it is generally agreed that the fleet of
fighter training aircraft is one of several additions urgently needed to
strengthen the country's fighting capability.
With the purchase of the rival Franco-German Alpha trainer almost out of
question, the 66 Hawks would cost Dollars 1.5bn, escalating to an estimated
Dollars 2.5bn with the inclusion of spare parts and maintenance back-up.
Mr Jasjit Singh, the director of the Institute of Defence Studies and
Analyses, has no doubt that the purchase will go ahead but is concerned
about the cost of the delay to training. There is a feeling among some
observers that the delay has directly contributed to the relatively high
loss rate of aircraft on training missions in unsuitable alternative
aircraft.
The Pergau Dam controversy about the linkage of UK aid to defence contracts
in Malaysia is seen in Delhi as adding sensitivity to the Hawk deal. While
there is no suggestion of such a link, there is concern that a Dollars 2.5bn
defence deal with a British company would, at this time, come under under
intense scrutiny in London and Delhi.
A Hawk purchase would call for the Indian Government to find funds outside
its existing defence budget. The national budget introduced earlier this
month allocated Dollars 7.36bn to defence spending which is only slightly
ahead of the previous year's figure after taking inflation into account.
Defence spending as percentage of GDP has been on a sharp decline since
1985-86 when it reached 4 per cent. Today it is closer to 2.4 per cent, and
barring a rapid change in the strategic balance or a rise in domestic
unrest, is likely to remain at this level for the next few years at least as
the government wrestles to master public spending.
All government departments have come under tighter spending controls.
However, the dislocation of defence relations with the former Soviet Union
in the wake of its break-up coupled with an easing of tension along the
Pakistani and Chinese borders have made defence a target for particular
constraint.
The newly independent states in the former Soviet Union have been demanding
hard currency for arms deals, replacing the previous loan and barter
arrangements and adding to the budgetary problems. Several defence observers
in Delhi noted that in recent months there appeared to have been a
strengthening of contacts between India andstates of the former Soviet Union
following exchange visits by a number of highly placed officials.
Concern is being expressed that the cuts have reached a point where
standards are deteriorating and that this decline will accelerate as
equipment and hardware ages without the prospect of replacement.
Major General D. Banerjee, the deputy director of the Institute for Defence
Studies and Analyses, shares this concern and believes that it is due to
insufficient planning for future defence needs.
Several diplomatic missions cite the growing acceptance of outdated yet
cheap foreign hardware as evidence of a qualitative decline. They also
believe that the desire to step up indigenous production, while
understandable as a means of developing local industry and self-reliance,
will lead in the short term to a lowering of standards.
Several local defence companies have been forced to look at alternative
sources for sales as government spending falls. Mr RN Sharma, chairman of
the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics which has a long relationship with
BAe, said late last year that after the 'changes in the defence aviation
scenario world-wide, HAL has planned to launch a major restructuring of its
operations to place new emphasis on the civilian aviation market ..' Others
have moved computer software operations, using their experience in defence
and skilled staff to diversify into civilian markets.
Serious delays with several government-funded defence programmes have cast a
shadow over the strategy of indigenous development. Last year it was
discovered that locally produced Arjun battle tanks, which began testing
last year, were unsuitable for hot terrain while there have been long delays
with a helicopter project because of design faults.
The navy, with the smallest budget, has also been hit. The submarine
development programme has run into problems and it is looking at purchasing
four replacement, outdated UK Upholder class vessels at what is described as
'fire sale prices'.
In addition to the needs in these fields, the Indian defence force's three
most important requirements are 155 millimetre self-propelled guns, either
an upgrade or a replacement for the ageing MiG-21 aircraft  - which has
formed a key element of the airforce's strike power - and the creation of
naval service and shipyards.
A replacement plan for the MiG-21 has been virtually ruled out as too
expensive with the most likely option being a Russian-led upgrading. The
involvement of Israel in this plan is believed to be less likely, due in
part to political factors.
Although all these replacement or renewal plans possess their own element of
urgency, negotiations on each of them are well behind those for the Hawk
purchase, meaning decisions could be years away.
In the words of a seasoned observer of the Indian defence system: 'I don't
think people coming to India to do business with the military are going to
do much good. However, if they were to want to set up a power plant or
communication system the answer could well be 'yes, yes, yes'.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (11): It's a tough world -
Engineering Products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KANUL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indian exporters of engineering goods have been shocked by the ending of a
federal government scheme which enables them to buy Indian-made steel at
lower international prices, writes Kunal Bose.
The International Price Reimbursement Scheme (IPRS) for iron and steel is to
be ended because the government no longer believes it justified. Launched in
1981, the scheme was financed out of a levy on the steel industry's entire
bulk production.
The government, however, had never been entirely happy with the IPRS which
was naturally deeply unpopular with steel producers. It was also sensitive
to criticisms by other countries that it was a central government subsidy to
the engineering sector.
This is rejected by the Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC), which
says that the ending of the scheme came as a total surprise.
The EEPC claims that it recently received a promise from Mr Pranab
Mukherjee, commerce minister, that the IPRS would remain in force until
March 1995. Exporters had therefore taken many orders which they would now
find difficult to fulfil.
Indian engineering products will certainly be less competitive if
manufacturers can no longer obtain iron and steel at world prices.
Mr Moosa Raza, steel secretary, rejects the criticism, saying that the
exporters of steel-based goods could import duty free steel.
The EEPC says, however, that 'since the engineering exporters need various
kinds of steel in small quantities, it is not easy for them to organise
import. Mind you, there are special steels which are about 30 per cent
cheaper in the world market.'
To help ease the situation, MSTC, a government trading organisation, has
offered to import steel for the engineering sector by amalgamating their
requirements.
The government does not deny that the IPRS has helped to raise the value of
Indian engineering exports from Rs8.8bn in 1981 to around Rs90bn in 1993-94.
Nearly two-thirds of exports are thought to have benefited.
Mr Bijon Nag, managing director of IFB Industries, a leading exporter of
high value components and domestic appliances, believes that the government
and the industry together will be able to organise the import of steel,
though it would not be easy. 'The government will be able to win the
industry's confidence provided it clears quickly the huge backlog of Rs3.2bn
in IPRS payment,' he says.
Because of their volume and high added value, engineering exports, according
to Mr Nag, have taken an important position in India's foreign trade.
In spite of the break-up of the Soviet Union, the industry's single largest
market, and the recession in other parts of the world, Indian exports grew
by an average 37 per cent a year in the last five years.
The composition of exports also changed. Mr JS Bhasin, chairman of EEPC,
says that whereas in the 1970s and the early 1980s India primarily exported
low value added steel and iron based products, today nearly 60 per cent of
its exports consisted of capital goods and consumer durables.'
The commerce minister had offered to help make the engineering industry 'a
significant player in the global market through value added exports'. Unlike
the localised nature of many other countries' engineering industries,
India's engineering industry is based in many parts of the country, giving
geographical advantages to its hauliers and shippers.
India is becoming an increasingly important supplier of automotive
components to the US, Europe and Japan. It began in the low margin spare
parts market. But some manufacturers, including General Motors, Ford and
Chrysler, apparently hope to buy higher quality components from India at
attractive prices.
Indian exports of auto components grew from Dollars 120m in 1990-91 to
Dollars 190m in 1992-93. EEPC expects the figures to reach Dollars 335m by
1996-97.
Engineering exports are likely to be boosted further by the decision of some
international engineering groups to manufacture semi-finished and finished
articles in India either for their own markets or for delivery to third
countries. Bosch will buy washing machines from IFB for export to third
countries, while Siemens is to buy small electric motors from a Bangalore
engineering company.
In the past decade, the biggest growth in engineering exports has come from
the small and medium sectors. According to one estimate, these sectors
account for more than 60 per cent of engineering exports.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (12): Big names line up to
test the water - India's textiles increase their share of the world market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deregulation has transformed textiles into an export-driven industry to
attract the foreign investment essential for upgrading products.
All segments of the industry are working flat out, following two successive
years of bumper cotton crops.
Meanwhile, textile exports, including garments, rose to Dollars 4.32bn in
the year ended March last year, 7.5 per cent higher than in the the previous
year.
Exports for the year to March of this year are projected to rise strongly by
more than 15 per cent to Dollars 5bn. When the industry succeeds in
technological upgradation and enhances value addition, exports are expected
to jump to more than Dollars 8.5bn. in three years. Even so, with only 2 per
cent of the world market, India is still only a minor player - China's
exports last were worth Dollars 23bn.
Big names such as Arrow of US, Pierre Cardin, La Coste and Benetton are all
testing the Indian waters. Others are already trying to weave strategic
alliances with Indian counterparts.
Their first target is to win a slice of the growing local market. They also
see India as a springboard for exports to other countries with no quota
restrictions.
'The Indian middle class is as big as Germany (in population),' says Mr DK
Gupta, director of the apparel export promotion council. These world leaders
are waiting for the dismantling of the multi-fibre agreement (MFA) in six
years to exploit the free market in Europe and the US.
The MFA is to be phased out over the next 10 years to integrate textile
exports with Gatt in two stages - to a level of 51 per cent of quotas under
MFA by 2001 and full integration by 2005. Cotton, jute and silk have been
kept out of the MFA and India will have to negotiate bilateral agreements
with US, Canada and the European Union.
La Perla of Italy is to buy a 40 per cent stake in a joint venture with
Bombay-based Mafatlal group to make shirts, undergarments and lingerie.
Mafatlal, a traditioinal fabrics exporter, has opted for forward integration
to produce value-added garments.
Prem Malik, executive director of Mafatlal Industries, says, 'We are looking
at the upper end of the European and US makets and aim at 40-60 per cent
value addition.' The joint venture will use Mafatlal fabrics.
Two suit-making companies - Morrotto of Germany and Samsung of Korea - are
talking to two Indian textile exporters in New Delhi to turn out 100,000
woollen suits a year, using cheap Indian labour. Critical inputs such as
know-how, textile designs and marketing skills will come from overseas
partners.
As the overseas market became profitable by the 40 per cent rupee
devaluation two years ago, Indian textile groups are preparing to seize
export opportunities. Most are building facilities to produce yarn for
export.
More than 50 spinning mills are coming on stream to take advantage of the
duty-free import scheme for such plants. In other segments, strategies
differ but the aim is to find niche markets overseas.
Lalbhai group of Ahmedabad, the textile city in western India, has chosen to
put Indian denim on the world map. He plans to nearly treble denim exports
to 120m metres from the present 48m metres. 'We want to strategically locate
our manufacturing units,' says Mr Sanjay Lalbhai, managing director. One
plant is to be sited in Mexico to gain free access to Canada and the US as
fellow members of Nafta.
Another will be in Mauritius, which as a signatory to Lome convention, will
gain duty-free entry to European Community. An unnamed Israeli textile group
has proposed to its Indian counterpart a joint venture in India, to export
yarn to Israel for conversion into fabrics, which will be shipped back to
India for making garments for export to Europe. The garments will qualify
for duty-free import into Europe if the Israeli content is 40 per cent.
Knitwear is also benefiting. Courtalds of the UK is talking to New
Delhi-based Parasarampuria group to relocate its socks plant to India. Delta
Socks of Israel is setting up a joint venture to produce socks in India.
Delta will pick up 50 per cent of the new venture's output.
Sinterama, an Italian conglomerate, plans to shift its acrylic yarn plant to
India, management expertise being provided by Modern group. JCT Ltd. of
Thapar and an Italian company plan to make specialty yarn for export back to
Italy.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (10): Daimlers in Poona - The
View from Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A project to build 20,000 executive class Mercedes cars annually in Poona
speaks volumes for the Daimler-Benz group's expectations for Indian
prosperity. It also underscores sharpened German interest in investment in
India in the wake of economic and regulatory reforms instituted since 1991,
writes Christopher Parkes.
Encouraged by new regulations allowing foreign investors to take majority
stakes in joint ventures, and thereby exercise greater control over their
investments' destiny, Daimler and its long-standing partner, Tata
Engineering and Locomotive (Telco), have set up a 51:49 per cent operation
to be known as Mercedes-Benz India.
Production of the cars will start this year, while the factory will also be
kitted out to produce 50,000 diesel and petrol engines a year, starting in
1995.
The total investment of DM250m is modest in relation to the scale of the
Daimler group, but huge when compared with the Dollars 25m invested in the
sub-continent by the whole of German industry in 1992, the last year for
which figures are available.
On the one hand, the move marks a further stage in the company's
globalisation policy, summed up by Mr Helmut Werner, chairman, as a switch
from a 'made in Germany' to 'made by Mercedes'. On the other, and on the
basis of the popular credo that 'what's good for Daimler is good for
Germany', it is likely to be seen as a positive signal for other investors
to follow.
Even though deep-seated doubts remain in Germany about the wisdom of
investing in India, the reform programme has already had a clear impact on
intentions. Results of a poll published by the respected Munich-based Ifo
institute last November rounded up 32 companies (from a selection of 174
which were already direct investors or involved in joint ventures) which
said they were planning new investments in India.
While there were doubtless others which escaped the samplers' net, the most
significant finding was that 18 of the 32 said they would not even have
considered moving in if the reform programme had not been instituted. The
survey also discovered that in a reversal of previous practices, and as in
the Mercedes case, a considerable majority of the projects were to be
majority-controlled by the German companies.
The possibility of real control was selected by the surveyed companies as a
'very important' result of the reform programme so far. Also in this
category were the convertibility of the rupee, reduced restrictions on
imports of capital goods, semi-finished products and spare parts, eased
local content regulations, and a general reduction in bureaucracy.
Even so, more detailed questioning turned up considerable lingering
reservations even among this experienced group. Asked to name continuing
obstacles, 90 per cent of the direct investors plumped for the inefficiency
of the public administration. That 76 per cent of the joint venturers also
complained of the red tape suggested that having a local partner does not
automatically spell escape from its entanglements.
Other hindrances attracting significant numbers of mentions included the
labour laws, currency restrictions, difficulties in both foreign and
internal trade, and lack of legal security.
The Ifo study concluded rather dismally that such obstacles meant the stream
of German investment would grow only slowly. A pragmatic analysis of the
realities of reform and the survey responses suggested considerable
scepticism about the prospects for effective change.
Further liberalisation, such as the removal of more administrative levies,
charges (and corruption) would help, but what was really needed was
wholesale reform of the administration, it said. The Ifo analysis indirectly
assessed the likelihood of this in the next paragraph, devoted to
criticising the frequent, often sudden and retroactive changes in the law at
the Union level, which individual states failed to implement.
'Half-hearted' efforts to liberalise the labour market and trade union power
'considerably obstruct the practical application of reform measures', the
survey said.
There was still much to do to attract investment, and the Indian government
was well aware of the shortcomings of its efforts so far, the report
concluded: 'But the fact that some of the reforms already in place are
political dynamite implies a cautious rather than accelerated continuation
along the way to reform.'
In the light of such obstacles, and the relative attractions of high-growth,
or more accessible investment sites in eastern Asia, Latin America, east
Europe and even the US, German direct investment in India may accelerate
from its current snail's pace.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (9): The path becomes smoother
 -Arun Singh explains the legal framework for foreign companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARUN SINGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is now much easier for foreign investors to establish operations in
India, but there remain many regulations which have to be followed.
Since liberalisation in July 1991 regulations have been streamlined and
foreign companies have been actively encouraged to enter the Indian market.
Foreign companies are advised, nevertheless, to seek specialist advice from
the outset as to the legal form of collaboration, the market and taxation.
Broadly speaking, approval must be sought and while there is an automatic
process for this, it is only given if certain guidelines are met, such as a
set sum for payment for technology and royalties.
Foreign investors, too, are obliged under the regulations to enter into
collaboration with a local company or individual.
Generally, there are four main routes for pursuing business opportunities in
India, each route involving varying degrees of commercial risk.
Foreign companies may initially wish to appoint an Indian agent to market
and sell their goods in India and act as their local representative. Under
the new business environment this has become an increasingly attractive
route, particularly in view of the reduction of import controls.
It is a useful and effective method for developing sales contacts generally
and for targeting industries in the public or private sector. In view of the
geography of India, foreign companies often appoint a number of agents who
have the necessary knowledge or contacts in specific states or towns.
Secondly, foreign companies may, in the place of (or in addition to) agents,
open liaison offices in India to explore the market potential and
familiarise themselves with the Indian business environment. Government
approval has to be obtained to open a liaison office but it is a
straightforward and speedy process.
Thirdly, if foreign companies wish to undertake activities beyond those
permitted for liaison offices, they have to open a branch office in India.
The branch office would be connected to the business activities of the
foreign parent company, and can execute contracts. There are specific rules
for obtaining permission to open liaison and branch offices which should be
complied with, but if they are, the Reserve Bank of India will grant
permission within a matter of weeks, rather than months, as in the past.
Other options relate to the transfer of technology, and to the setting up of
a fully-fledged joint venture. Technology Transfer: Where a foreign company
wishes to transfer technology to an Indian company - generally through
licensing - automatic permission will be given, provided the application
meets certain guidelines, namely the technology payment, which is for the
transfer of technology and is not beyond Rs10m (some Pounds 220,000).
Royalties are 5 per cent for domestic sales and 8 per cent for export sales.
Lump sum payments and royalties may be paid for up to a period of 10 years
from the date of the agreement.
Joint Ventures: Foreign companies seeking to have a more permanent presence
in India can consider a joint venture to manufacture or they may establish a
wholly-owned subsidiary.
Until July 1991, the maximum equity that a foreign company could have in a
joint venture in India was 40 per cent but the limit on foreign equity
holdings has now been increased to up to 51 per cent in 35 high priority
industries. These include electrical equipment, boilers and steam generating
equipment, agricultural and industrial machinery, chemicals, food
processing, and computer software.
If the foreign investor's project does not come within the 35 high priority
industries, or if they require a greater amount of foreign equity, or
specific infrastructural projects, such as BOT/BOOs, (build
 operate-transfer/build-own-operate) they may make an application to the
Foreign Investment Promotion Board, in the Indian Prime Minister's office,
which considers each application on its merit.
If there is a transfer of proprietary information, there are intellectual
property rights and trade mark protection available to the foreign investor.
As well as making provisions for the protection of intellectual property
rights within any collaboration agreement, it is important to stipulate an
agreement regarding the governing law applying to the contract, and how any
dispute is to be resolved.
This might be through High Court litigation, arbitration, or some form of
alternative dispute resolution. Indian law permits agreements to provide for
disputes to be resolved in what is normally considered a neutral forum, such
as the International Chamber of Commerce.
Any arbitration agreement or clause should be carefully drafted with a view
to easing enforcement of arbitration awards. An Indian Supreme Court
decision not so long ago delivered a judgment which could have a serious
impact on the enforceability of shareholders agreements and international
arbitration awards, and investors would be advised to check the
applicability of these judgments with regard to their transactions.
In summary, before deciding to go ahead companies should:
check Indian Government regulations and comply with them. While there has
been liberalisation, specific regulations apply to foreign investors; be
clear as to the method of payment, commission, royalties, lump sums or
dividends;
define the role of your collaborator; incorporate a clause for dispute
resolution and set out the method of termination;
take specialist advice on market research, tax and legal matters and do not
rely on the advisers of your local partner. Although you may be working to a
common end, your individual interests may be different;
take steps to protect your intellectual property rights and confidential
information;
set a timetable for implementation of the collaboration, the length of
negotiations, and time for the execution of agreements and state approvals
to be obtained. Consider having a project manager for the negotiations and a
timetable for implementation.
remember that for foreign investors, whilst there are approvals and consents
to be obtained at both the central and state government levels, red tape has
given way to red carpet for foreign investors in India.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (8): The Americans are coming
 -Patrick Harverson discovers a dramatic change in US sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Viewed from the US, India is a country of enormous potential. Historically,
however, the hostility of Indian governments to the free market and to the
foreign business community has kept US companies and investors from seeking
to take advantage of that potential.
Now, after several years of a gradual economic liberalisation policy that
has opened up Indian markets to foreign capital, US money is pouring into
India in unprecedented amounts.
Mr Anil Trigunayat, the commercial consul at the Indian Consulate in New
York, says that US private sector investment in India between 1992 and 1993
exceeded the total amount of money invested by US companies in the previous
40 years.
In the first 10 months of last year, for example, Dollars 800m was invested
in India by US companies, and another Dollars 2.2bn was in the pipeline at
the end of the year. By contrast, in all of 1990, Mr Trigunayat says, total
US investment measured just Dollars 90m.
As well as the host of giant blue-chip corporations which have long ties to
India (such as Citibank, General Electric and IBM), scores of other big US
companies have been moving into - or in some cases, returning to - India,
through purchases of majority stakes in Indian businesses, or through the
establishment of new ventures.
According to Precision Sourcing International (BSI), a New York based
consulting company which works with US companies in India, among those which
have recently raised their interest in Indian companies to majority
shareholdings are Colgate Palmolive, Whirlpool, Chevron, Pepsico, Procter &amp;
Gamble and J Walter Thompson.
Others which have set up joint ventures include Duracell, Goodyear, Mobil,
and Alcoa. In the financial services industry, the Capital Group, Soros Fund
Management, and Kemper have all created asset management businesses with
Indian partners over the last year.
Mr Richard Hedberg, vice president of J P Morgan, which has an investment
banking joint venture in India, says interest in India has snowballed in the
past two years. 'It started slowly, because everyone didn't know (what the
reforms) meant, and you had a lot of left-over biases. Then, about a year
ago, all at once a lot of US companies started increasing their minority
ownerships to majority ownerships. Then you saw the snowball headed down the
hill.'
US money is flooding into India primarily because the government is opening
up the domestic financial and consumer markets, albeit gradually. Mr Manu
Bammi of PSI says: 'We have been involved in assisting US corporations in
India since 1989, and have a witnessed a sea change in the economic and
business environment. Rather than treat business as a necessary evil, the
government sees business as a critical part of the solution of India's
problems.'
Mr Bammi's comments are echoed throughout the US business community, which
applauds the economic reforms introduced in the past two years by the
administration of prime minister Mr PV Narasimha Rao and his finance
minster, Mr Manmohan Singh.
'Clearly the business climate has changed,' says Mr Neville Isdell, vice
president responsible for Coca-Cola's operations in India. 'That is the
direct result of the policies of the current government. They have really
attacked the major areas that were holding back investments by international
companies.'
Mr Robert Eichfeld, head of Citibank's operations in India, where the
company has a long-established consumer banking and corporate banking
business, as well as a unit developing banking software, is equally upbeat
about India's economic outlook, especially in the light of the February 28
budget presented by finance minister Singh. 'The feeling is that the reforms
are now pretty much irreversible in terms of direction, no matter what might
happen politically. This is the fourth reform budget in a row.'
Interest in India among US companies is especially strong in the consumer
goods sector, which is hungrily eyeing India's vast, well educated,
increasingly prosperous middle class. In consumer goods, the impact of
liberalisation was especially significant, because recent reforms mean that
foreign companies can now sell their products in India under their own brand
names.
Coca-Cola, for example, has wasted little time in returning to India (it
left with many other US companies in the late 1970s when the business
climate turned hostile). Last October, the company relaunched the Coca-Cola
brand in India, and a month later it bought the brands and trademarks of
Parle, the biggest Indian soft drinks manufacturer. Also last year,
Coca-Cola built a new beverage blending plant outside Poona.
Pepsico is also moving aggressively into India. As well as its bottling
plants, snack-food business and tomato paste manufacturing plant, Pepsico
has just received clearance to set up a holding company with Dollars 95m in
capital that is already negotiating to buy some of India's smaller soft
drinks companies.
Pepsico has also received permission from the government to set up Pizza Hut
and Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants.
Ensuring that the notoriously cumbersome Indian bureaucracy handles foreign
businesses efficiently has been a big part of the government's
liberalisation programme, and Mr Suman Sinha, head of Pepsico in India, says
approvals for the company's recent expansions were granted and processed in
just six weeks. This contrasts greatly with the pre-reform days, says Mr
Sinha. 'In the past, if we got (approval) in three years it would have been
a miracle.'
While the business climate has changed greatly, US companies still have
their concerns about doing business in India. The country's infrastructure -
particularly transportation and telecommunications - leaves much to be
desired. Tension between the different religious communities, which has
broken out into violence several times in recent years, is also a worry for
US businessmen.
And on the economic front, the recent budget, which placed the emphasis on
economic growth over fiscal rectitude, raised some eyebrows. 'The main
concern is that there is still a large budget deficit that is going to have
to be covered at some point in time,' says Mr Eichfeld of Citibank.
Moreover, the political situation, while stable now, could give cause for
concern if Mr Rao's government runs into trouble. Asks one New York banker:
'Will there be political stability for the long-haul? Will the reforms
continue? And can people count on being able to make long-term decisions
now?'
Yet, these concerns aside, US companies are bullish about India, a country
with a well-educated and skilled pool of labour, a British-based legal and
accounting system, and an English-speaking business and political community.
All these factors, plus the steady liberalisation of the economy, and a
business-friendly government, are in India's favour.
Mr David Thomas, head of Procter &amp; Gamble's Indian operations, says: 'If
India can build on this base through the efforts at deregulation, and
involvement of foreign and Indian private enterprise in the creation of a
national infrastructure, there is significant potential for growth. Asian
'tiger' countries have shown the way, and there is no reason why India
should be an exception.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (6): A multifaceted jewel in
the crown - The financial institutions have a wide choice of investment
options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India has earned the nickname of 'jewel in the investment crown' among those
emerging market specialists who scour the globe for new and exciting
investment opportunities.
Lured by the combination of the government's economic reform programme,
relatively attractive growth prospects, a vast array of listed companies,
and a gradual shift towards more modern stock market practices, foreigners
have been quick to take advantage of the various routes available - either
investing directly in domestically-quoted shares and internationally-traded
GDRs (global depositary receipts), or indirectly via the numerous collective
funds that have been launched in the last year.
Fund managers based in the UK point out that India has several attractive
features. They are encouraged by the process of economic liberalisation set
in train in 1991 by Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister. Such reforms
were born of necessity after India faced a balance-of-payments crisis and
came close to defaulting on loans. But three years into the reform
programme, many UK investors believe the process is irreversible, especially
since both the ruling Congress (I) Party, as well as the opposition BJP are
in favour of economic reform.
Mr Joe Scott Plummer, chairman of Martin Currie Investment Management
(MCIM), says the Edinburgh-based fund management group decided to launch its
Indian Opportunities Fund last July for several reasons.
'Our prime reason (for investing in India) stems from the major programme of
deregulation and the more efficient and effective management of the economy
forced on India by the IMF. India recognised the advantage of international
capital, and changed the regulations to allow it in,' he said. The Martin
Currie Indian Opportunities Fund raised Dollars 100m originally (which rose
to Dollars 150m in value), and is now raising an additional tranche of
Dollars 100m-Dollars 150m.
The process of liberalisation seems set to continue. The recent Budget (in
early March, 1994) was regarded as 'pro-industry' with measures to cut
customs duties and taxes, encouraging the import of goods and spare parts.
If foreign investors have reservations, they are more to do with the fact
that the reform process is associated so closely with the finance minister.
One UK-based portfolio manager points out, 'the danger is that the reform
process is so inextricably linked with (Manmohan) Singh that it would
clearly be a worry if he were to go, for whatever reason'.
Mr Jeffrey Chowdhry, director at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment
Management Limited which recently raised Dollars 510m for its India Fund,
expects economic growth to be about 5 to 5 1/2 per cent a year over the next
five years, which in the context of other Asian economies is not
particularly high.
But he points out that the growth in the Indian economy 'is dependent to a
lesser extent than, say, the Latin American countries and NICs (newly
industrialised countries) on growth in the outside world, because India has
nearly 900m consumers of its own'. Of particular interest to investors, he
says, is the presence of a rapidly-growing middle class, estimated to be
over 200m and increasing at 12 per cent a year.
The inducement of a very large population with rising aspirations and
increasing spending power may be a familiar one for international investors,
and is frequently cited in the case of China. But emerging market
specialists argue that the sheer size of India's stock markets and the
long-established tradition of investing in equities give it an added
advantage over China.
The Bombay stock exchange was set up in 1875 and with nearly two dozen stock
exchanges spread across India, investors have about 7,000 stocks from which
to choose, although in terms of liquidity and available research the
'universe of investments' is probably closer to 1,000 companies, according
to Mr Chowdhry.
China, by comparison, has more than 200 listed stocks, although several
companies have overseas listings. 'India has the advantage of a long
tradition of accounting standards, whereas China has a lot of opportunities,
but without the tradition' says one London-based emerging markets
specialist.
In spite of the large assortment of Indian listed companies, some fund
managers have reservations about the high price-earnings ratios. At present,
medium-sized companies are seen as offering better value for investors.
Mr Scott Plummer at Martin Currie points out that 'usually the pattern has
been with emerging markets that as foreigners discover a market, they tend
to go for the liquid blue chips'. However, he adds that while the big stocks
have p/e ratios in the 'high 20s  .. the second league companies have lower
p/e ratios in the region of 15-20 times'.
Overseas investors must register as Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs)
in order to invest directly in the domestic stock markets. Some of these
FIIs have been fairly active in the domestic market, although in recent
months, the long delays in settlement have hindered the process. These
problems are being addressed, but are still seen as time-consuming and
inconvenient particularly in such a paper-intensive stock market. Mr
Chowdhry of BZW says 'it has been estimated that about 400 pieces of paper
are needed for each Dollars 1m transaction'.
The other main way for foreign investors to gain exposure has been through
the international equity route, which has the advantage of providing
liquidity and avoiding the Indian domestic settlement problems.
Over the last couple of years, several of the biggest Indian companies have
turned to the international capital markets with international share
offerings.
In 1993, a total of about Dollars 900m was raised in this manner by Indian
companies, and a similar amount in the first couple of months of this year
as more and more companies rushed to take advantage of international
investor interest.
As a result of this spate of offerings, India's ministry of finance decided
in February to impose informal - albeit temporary - restrictions on Indian
companies seeking to raise funds abroad as it wanted to slow down the deluge
of international equity and convertible bond issues flooding on to the
market.
While international investors have had a wide choice of equity and
convertible bond offerings, Indian companies have so far shied away from
launching conventional eurobond issues. The Industrial Development Bank of
India (IDBI) was set to launch a eurobond this month, but held off because
of the volatile conditions in the international bond market.
However, talk of possible eurobond offerings has raised the question of
whether India's credit rating is likely to be upgraded given that it had
deteriorated from investment grade to speculative grade after the
balance-of-payments crisis.
Some of the more optimistic market participants appear to regard India as
another Mexico - in other words, as a country with the potential to achieve
investment grade thanks to its economic reform programme.
However, the credit rating agencies seem rather less bullish on this front.
India's long-term foreign currency debt rating is Ba2 (from Moody's) and BB+
(from Standard &amp; Poor's), both of which are below investment grade.
Mr Guido Cipriani, country analyst at S&amp;P, points out that the stable
outlook on S&amp;P's BB+ rating indicates that India is unlikely to be upgraded
for some time, although he adds that the agency is due to meet with
policy-makers in India to discuss the reform process.
While acknowledging that the government has taken several important steps in
the right direction, he still voices concern about subsidies and overmanning
in the public sector, and the need for further progress on the fundamental
structural reform of the public sector - a process which could take several
years.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (7): Welcome to the big
battalions - Foreign financial services are sprouting in Bombay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign financial services companies are rushing to open up shop in Bombay.
The caution which characterises the approach of companies in other
industries to India is largely absent, as investment bankers, brokers and
others hurry to find the best local partners and staff.
Major overseas investment banks are anxious for gain a foothold in India.
Tiny by international standards, local merchant banks have opted for joint
ventures with their foreign counterparts.
JP Morgan of the US took the plunge late last year with a 40 per cent
purchase of ISEC, an investment bank floated by the Industrial Credit and
Investment Corporation of India, a diversified development bank.
General Electric and Housing Development and Finance Corporation are
floating a joint venture for hire purchase credit and other financial
services.
The latest to arrive are Peregrine of Hong Kong and Daewoo of Korea.
Peregrine and ITC Classic, a subsidiary of ITC, the Indian affiliate of BAT
Industries, have formed a 50:50 joint venture.
Daewoo and CRB Capital Markets, a Bombay securities company, have signed a
memorandum of understanding to collaborate and are yet to work out details.
The oldest informal association is a decade old - between DSP Financial
Services, an offshoot of an old-established Bombay brokerage, and Merrill
Lynch of the US. They now urgently need a formal arrangement to transfer new
skills and technology and compete with the new investment banks coming up in
India.
Another well-established relationship - between Lazard Brothers of the UK
and Creditcapital Finance Corporation, an investment bank, has also recently
been strengthened with the British merchant bank lifting its stake at CFC to
40 per cent.
Ind Global Financial Trust, promoted by Mr R. Sankaran, a former Standard
Chartered executive, is associated with Salomon Brothers. Infrastructure
Leasing and Financial Services, after a brief honeymoon with Bear Sterns,
decided to join hands with Orix, the most active Japanese financial company
in India.
Kotak Mahindra Finance of Bombay and Goldman Sachs are currently in
discussions on whether to finalise a formal arrangement. The focus now is on
insurance. World insurance majors, Eagle Star, Sun Life, New York Life, AIG
and Cigna have sent representatives to India to scout for local
collaborators.
Sun Life has announced a tie-up with State-owned Life Insurance Corporation.
Eagle Star, a BAT Industries subsidiary, will form a joint venture with ITC,
once the guidelines are announced.
New York Life is talking to HDFC to form a joint venture. The most visible
impact is on the stock market. Nearly 150 foreign institutional investors,
registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the market
watchdog, have bought corporate stock on Indian bourses worth nearly Dollars
l5bn since the beginning of this year.
The inflow boosted the foreign exchange reserves, which hit a peak of
Dollars 14bn. The capital flows were halted abruptly as custodial and
depository services were unable to cope with the rush. The inflow will get a
new fillip after these services are back to normal. Institutions can now
either buy on the bourses or negotiate directly private placement of capital
by companies.
India opened its doors to for eign brokers late last year. Australian-owned
Marlin Partners, Kleinwort Benson, Credit Lyonnais Securities and James
Capel, a Hongkong and Shanghai Bank subsidiary, were the first allowed to
handle foreign portfolio investment into Indian stocks through local
brokers. Five others, including Jardine Fleming, have since won regulatory
approval.
The mutual funds market was opened to the private sector late last year.
Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank launched the first first domestic
foreign-managed fund and attracted record subscriptions of more than Rs.
10bn. Tata, the largest Indian business group, is to offer a 20 per cent
stake to Kleinwort Benson of the UK in an asset management company to be
promoted by Tata. Merrill Lynch is planning to float an asset management
company with Indian partner DSP Financial Services.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (5): The pressure is mounting
The unions and the need to cut jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade unionists fear that India's chronic problems of unemployment and
underemployment will be exacerbated by the structural reform programme.
Openings for India's workers, who increase at the rate of 2 per cent a year,
may be curtailed by technological change and a tougher line on redundancies.
Apprehensive of labour militancy and its political fallout, the government
has been dragging its feet over redundancy policy. Officials in the labour
ministry are reviewing the whole gamut of industrial labour laws, to ensure
they are in line with the other reforms, but the changes will be slow in
coming.
The retrenchment of labour will eventually be given a legal framework, and
the law relating to the regulation of trade unions may be revised, say
officials in the labour ministry. The government believes that the reforms
will benefit labour, at least in the long term.
'Trade unionists may be worried about the effect of reform on labour in the
short term, but in the long term, the government hopes that the reforms and
the encouragement of foreign investment will lead to a substantial expansion
of employment in more labour-intensive industries,' says a senior labour
ministry official.
Recognising that the reform process would increase structural unemployment,
the government established the National Renewal Fund (NRF)in 1992, a social
safety net instrument to provide compensation and transitional support to
workers who lost their jobs.
The NRF has two constituent windows:
the National Renewal Grant Fund (NRGF) compensates workers affected by the
closure of both private (those under liquidation orders from the state
governments) and public sectors, and provides payment for voluntary
retirement schemes by public sector units.
the Employment Generation Fund (EGF) provides grants for retraining,
redeployment and approved employment generation schemes. But labour leaders
complain that the Fund's safety net has been inadequate for the loss of 1m
jobs in 1992-93, swelling the country's unemployed to 18m. 'It should be
termed the National Retrenchment Fund, because the total compensation
package far exceeds the entire corpus of the fund,' says a senior labour
leader.
Despite the World Bank suggestion two years ago that a suitable policy be
framed to facilitate industrial restructuring, including a framework for
reducing barriers to reducing industrial manpower levels, government efforts
to introduce labour reforms and an exit policy have been minimal.
'The government has done nothing to protect the workers from retrenchment,
even though the law does not allow retrenchment of workers,' admits a
Congress (I) MP. 'The government is shying away from an exit policy because
it is afraid to antagonise labour, but workers continue to lose jobs because
businesses that are unviable simply shut down.'
Mr CP Rangarajan Kumaramangalam, a Congress (I) MP and former union labour
minister, says that changing labour laws alone will not solve the problem of
surplus labour. He has suggested that the government should try to persuade
management and labour to regard each other as partners in progress, instead
of adversaries.
He criticises the negative overtones of the term 'exit policy' (the official
euphemism for labour reductions), arguing that labour, like capital, can be
redeployed rather than simply rejected. 'Good labour relations make for good
business,' agrees Mr Krishan Lal Chugh, chairman of ITC, the Calcutta-based
company, which last year reached a landmark settlement hinging on improved
productivity.
Industrial relations have remained mainly peaceful in the last two years,
despite the loss of jobs as a result of structural reforms. The loss of
man/days in 1992-93 declined to 21.15m from 34.57m in 1991-92.
The main bone of contention between trade unions and government is the
closure of the economically sick public sector units. 'The government wants
to close down the sick mills, while we are fighting for their revival,' says
Mr Chittabrata Majumdar, secretary of the 1.1m strong Centre of Indian Trade
Unions, affiliated to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). 'We have put
forward a number of suggestions how sick mills can be run viably, but they
do not care to listen, and have only taken steps which have favoured more
sickness.'
Union leaders point out that employers can already exploit the workers,
using voluntary retirement schemes, increasing contract and casual labour
that can be easily retrenched, and subcontracting production. 'The
government has to evolve a practical policy to tackle the loss of jobs or
face a worker upheaval', a union leader says. Last year, the unions won an
important victory when they stalled the introduction of the Industrial
Relations Bill in parliament.
The Bill sought to delete a section of the Industrial Disputes Act,
requiring government clearance for the closure of a company employing more
than 100 workers.
Says a labour ministry official: 'The government may seem ostrich-like about
labour reform because it is caught between political considerations at home
and pressure from foreign agencies to initiate it. But it's not as if we are
neglecting this crucial area of reform.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (4): Friendship and an equal
partnership - British-Indian relations are being rebuilt on new foundations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL

<TEXT>
The Royal Yacht, anchored at Bombay last November, was a potent symbol of
the changes in Britain and India during this century, and in the
relationship between the two.
Far from being an emblem of empire, the Britannia was an instrument of
business. Parties and seminars on board were attended by 1,400 people,
including 300 visiting British businessmen, and contracts worth Pounds 1.2bn
were signed.
The week in Bombay was the highlight of the first year of the Indo-British
Partnership Initiative, an unusually energetic and close exercise in
boosting bilateral trade and investment which has already produced
significant results. Meeting last month in London, Mr John Major and Mr PV
Narasimha Rao, the British and Indian prime ministers, decided to extend the
initiative.
Since India gained independence from British rule in 1947, relations had
been 'friendly but distant,' according to British officials. Apart from the
awkwardness inevitable between former imperial power and subject state,
India had opted for Jawaharlal Nehru's brand of self-sufficiency and
socialism, which led it to be much closer to Moscow than to the west.
By 1991, however, India found itself having to face a new world.
The Soviet orbit, which had been a central element of its foreign policy as
well as its foreign trade, had disintegrated.
And despite sporadic, half-hearted attempts at reform, its economy had
finally slipped into a crisis which threatened financial collapse similar to
Latin America's in 1982, but in a country of nearly 900m, many of whom
already lived in poverty.
When Mr Major visited India in January 1993, Britain desperately needed to
boost export orders for British companies to help it out of a long
recession. The government in New Delhi had shown surprising determination to
shape a new economic structure. Mr Major, guest of honour at the annual
Republic Day ceremonies, decided to make his visit into a high-powered trade
mission from which sprang the IBPI.
The visit crystallised a dramatic improvement in bilateral relations,
furthered by a rapid series of ministerial visits. Britain's home secretary,
foreign secretary, Lord Chancellor, trade minister and others have all been
India's guests and, in addition to Mr Narasimha Rao, ministers including Mr
Manmohan Singh, architect of economic reform, have visited London. Virtually
all such visits over the past year have included activities connected with
the IBPI.
Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas, was asked to lead the British
side. His Indian counterpart is Mr Jamshed Irani, managing director of Tata
Iron &amp; Steel. The two men asked other business leaders to become patrons of
the IBPI - making it essentially a private sector-driven exercise but with
strong governmental involvement on both sides.
Among the patrons are to be found British companies which already had
considerable experience in India - cumulative UK investment in India is
estimated at about pounds 2bn - and those which are at the forefront of UK
export efforts around the world, such as GEC Alsthom, Cable &amp; Wireless and
British Aerospace. On the Indian side are giants such as Ashok Leyland and
Bajaj Auto, as well as companies with old UK links such as Dunlop India,
Hindustan Lever and Williamson Magor. The Confederations of British and
Indian Industry are both patrons.
In addition to several missions of business people to Britain and to India,
the IBPI has done considerable work on identifying business opportunities
for British industry in individual Indian sectors, such as power generation,
agro-food processing, manufacturing technology and communications, financial
services and infrastructure.
If the IBPI simply brought together the biggest companies, however, it would
have limited value since many of their top executives on both sides were
already well attuned to the opportunities afforded by India's decision to
open its economy.
An important purpose has been to raise awareness among smaller and
medium-sized companies with less extensive experience. The IBPI says nearly
1,000 British companies have attended its seminar programme on doing
business with India, and that 2,000 people visited British technology
exhibitions in Bombay and Bangalore.
Mr Irani, in a report to the prime ministers, said: 'The IBPI has been a
truly unique process, and has been successful in making Britain aware of the
'new' India, bringing with it new opportunities. On the other side, India
has become far more aware of British capabilities, technologies and
competitiveness.'
Bilateral trade, and British investment in India have increased
substantially over the past year, although it would be difficult to estimate
how much of the gains have been due directly to the IBPI. British exports to
India grew 20 per cent in 1993 to Pounds 1.13bn, and Indian exports to
Britain rose 26 per cent to Pounds 1.09bn.
In 1991, new British investment in India was virtually at a standstill at
only Pounds 7m. In 1992 it rose to Pounds 26m, and last year approvals
jumped to Pounds 139m, made up of more than 170 new collaborations.
The deals done so far vary widely. The biggest are in power generation,
which also offers the best potential for British companies in the future.
Rolls-Royce Power Generation Systems signed three contracts in November to
build power stations worth a total of Pounds 660m, and in March another
Rolls-Royce subsidiary, Peebles Electric, signed a technology transfer
agreement under which Kirloskar Electric of Bangalore will be able to build
transformers.
GEC, which had already been involved in a number of agreements, signed a
memorandum of understanding in March under which it will build a 1,000MW
coal-fired power station in Maharashtra state, and will have a Dollars 100m
equity stake. National Power, PowerGen and National Grid have also signed
contracts.
Other industries in which UK investment deals have been signed include
liquor, construction, leisure, finance and aerospace. A number of British
companies, including Cadbury Schweppes, Coats Viyella, Reckitt &amp; Colman,
Glaxo, Bush Boake Allen, BP and Castrol have increased their stakes in
Indian subsidiaries from the previous permitted limit of 40 per cent up to
51 per cent. Among interesting joint ventures is the planned refurbishment
of Moscow's old market region by Apollo Enterprises of India in partnership
with Bovis of the UK.
Clearly, the IBPI can by no means take the credit for all recent
Indo-British transactions. But it does provide a useful framework for
companies and, importantly, focuses the attention of companies and
governments on the impediments to business as well as the opportunities.
The British side is most concerned about intellectual property rights, high
tax rates and custom duties, labour laws, bureaucracy and exchange controls
 -all issues which have been widely identified both inside and outside India
as vital for the government in Delhi to address.
The Indian side worries about the cost of British technology, equipment and
services. It is also concerned that 'there is a preference among British
companies for specific contracts rather than long-term investment in India,
for new-build rather than refurbishment and for sales to India rather than
joint manufacturing ventures,' according to the IBPI report to prime
ministers. There are also problems with textile exports to the UK because of
sudden changes in quota classifications.
For the next year, the IBPI plans to continue its work but to make it more
sector-specific, to reach more companies and to encourage greater
participation by non-resident Indians. The private sector leaders believe
ministerial involvement is important and that India's economic reform
programme must continue. 'Faster and simpler negotiating and approval
procedures would enable agreements to be realised more quickly,' the leaders
said, adding that commercial disputes should be resolved more quickly in the
courts.
Underlining the belief of the participants in the success of the IBPI, Mr
Irani and Mr Evans wrote: 'Although India and Britain have special links
which have given the IBPI a unique aspect, there is no reason why it should
not be a model for relations between either India or Britain and other
trading partners.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (2): 'We will surprise
ourselves and the world' / Interview with finance minister Manmohan Singh
discusses development and makes a five year prediction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT and STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, was interviewed by Richard Lambert
and Stefan Wagstyl a few days after presenting his 1994-95 Budget, which
sets out the government's latest plans for further economic reform. Here are
highlights from the interview:
QUESTION: Was this Budget framed with political rather than economic
considerations in mind?
SINGH: I think every Budget is a political document. The economy anyway does
not function in a political vacuum.
Could you please comment on the fiscal deficit?
Well I would say that the fiscal deficit which has emerged in the current
financial year is not a happy development. As I said in my Budget speech we
have to get back to the path of reducing the fiscal deficits. But this year
had peculiar circumstances largely because of the very sluggish industrial
economy, which reduced the government's customs and excise revenues.
I could have cut expenditure further. But in the public sector we have cut
expenditure to the bare bones, except for social sector expenditure. Cutting
that would be economically as well as socially and politically an
unproductive exercise. It would perpetuate the stagflation and low-level
equilibrium with the fiscal deficit remaining as high as before. That would
discredit the whole reform process.
The only effective way to get the economy out of stagflation was to create
an enviroment which was friendly to higher growth. Now there are risks in
what I have actually done. If for example we have a drought things could go
wrong. But if we have a big drought, things could go wrong anyway. But today
we have an insurance against the drought which we never had for many years.
Record foodstocks of 23m tonnes, idle industrial capacity, and record
foreign exchange reserves. If we can ever bring about a balance between
demand and supply at a higher level of activity then this is the year it
could happen.
Hasn't over-spending also contributed to the size of the fiscal deficit?
It is true that our food subsidies, for example, have turned out to be much
higher than expected. It has happened because it was an election year. The
government raised prices paid to farmers but prices paid by consumers were
not adjusted until last month. We did the same with the administered oil and
fuel prices.
Will forthcoming state-level elections and the prospect of the next general
election, due by mid-1996, effect policymaking?
I think this is a normal cycle. We have this year four or five important
states having elections. But I am heartened I am being criticised that the
fiscal deficit is too much. That is a measure of the success of our
programme. When I started I was accused of inventing the fiscal deficit to
destroy the Indian planning system.
Looking at the reforms overall, what are the remaining challenges?
I have done a sweeping reform this year of customs and excise duties. In two
more Budgets the process of tax reform can be completed. Capital market
reforms have also gone pretty well, including deregulation, the
establishment of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (the markets
supervisor) and new codes of conduct. Our capital markets will function with
greater transparency. The badla system (speculative forward trading in
equities) has now been banned so that the bulk of deliveries are cash
deliveries. We are now in a position to create a futures and options market.
The National Stock Exchange, which links trading across the country and
should have started operation in April, will start operating in the next few
months. As regards the banking sector, the bill to allow the government to
disinvest up to 49 per cent in public sector banks has just been passed. The
State Bank of India already had legislative permission and has raised
Rs30bn. That process will now start for other banks. We will have private
sector banks. Banking is no longer a monopoly of the government.
International banks will be more active.
Next on our agenda is the insurance sector. We have a report I propose to
deal with (which suggests liberalisation). Since it was our party which
nationalised the banks and insurance I have to create a new climate,
therefore I want an extensive debate on insurance over the next two or three
months. As for exchange control, we have now a system of current account
convertibility. The next logical step is capital account convertibility. But
I would like to wait for some time more.
The prerequisite is a credible fiscal and monetary stance. As far as foreign
trade is concerned, the over-protection of industry is being reduced and
reduced fast enough. The levels of protection which will prevail in the
longer run, in two years we will reach them. We still don't import consumer
goods but I have started a debate. I feel confident we can manage that too.
Once that comes about I think foreign trade system will have only moderate
tariffs and the exchange rates will be the only determinant of trade flows.
We are 70-80 per cent of the way there.
We must also remove restrictions on farmers to enable them to export and
have an import/export regime with moderate tariffs and without quantitative
restrictions. Finally, there is exit policy (redundancy laws).
This is a sensitive issue, even though the present rigid system is hurting
labour itself because it gives our employers a strong disincentive to employ
more labour even where more labour is justified. But it takes time to carry
conviction in a country of high unemployment.
If we reach an economic growth rate of 6 per cent then I think we will reach
conditions where jobs are being created and we can make changes. But we are
still not there so that's why we are deliberately going slow in this area.
To help this change, we have to establish social security institutions. We
have an industrial relations bill which talks about all these things
including getting flexibilities.
I have to convince our Cabinet colleagues. I feel this thing also can be
tackled in less than a year's time. I think this whole programme should be
completed in less than two years' time, before we go to the next general
election in 1996. But we are deliberately not adopting the shock therapy of
the kind that has been advocated. Because I believe civilisation is a very
delicate plant. It's very easy to destroy it, especially in a large and
complex country like India.
Can you comment on the role of foreign capital?
As far as foreign direct investment is concerned, we welcome it, including
foreign majority participation for which permission is automatic in most
sectors. We have also opened markets to foreign institutional investors in
the past year. People have warned me that these are fair-weather friends so
we have moved cautiously. But these investors have behaved responsibly.
What is your attitude to disinvestment on a larger scale ?
I said in my Budget speech that in order to reduce my deficit in a big way I
must do something about my interest burden which is a heritage of the past.
Given my options I can reduce interest in a big way if I have the freedom to
disinvest in a much bolder way. How bold that is I will have to test with my
Cabinet colleagues and party. We have got consensus on disinvestment.
But the other ministers would like to keep the proceeds for themselves.
Politics is about patronage and patronage is about spending. So they say if
we disinvest you allow us to expand our empires. I have now to persuade them
to use the proceeds to retire debt.
How does India compare with other developing countries, including those in
east Asia?
I certainly would like the pace of reform to be faster in India but we have
to realise we are a large and complex country trying to carry out social and
economic transformation in the framework of an open society. Maybe the
changes we make will be more durable than changes in countries where you can
carry out reform by fiat.
Development is a complex process, it cannot simply be imported. We have made
mistakes for example in not universalising elementary education. At the same
time given our size, given our natural resources, given our science and
technology infrastructure, our skilled manpower, I have a gut feeling that
India in the course of the next five or six years will surprise itself and
surprise the world also.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (1): Air of quiet satisfaction
 -Many people recognise the difficulties India faces - and the need for
further radical reforms. What is missing is any widespread sense of urgency.
India, it seems, will modernise - but at its own steady pace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
India is beginning to enjoy the first fruits of the economic transformation
it launched three years ago.
Foreign investment and exports are rising fast, the stock market is up, and
long-stagnant industrial output is starting to recover.
After six years of good harvests, the richer farmers are content - and
spending money as never before.
An air of quiet satisfaction hangs over the government of Mr PV Narasimha
Rao, the prime minister, whose position is stronger than at any time since
he took over the ruling Congress (I) party from the assassinated Rajiv
Gandhi in 1991. He has steered India through a balance-of-payments crisis
and through the unrest which followed the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque in
December 1992. The Bharatiya Janata party, the main opposition party whose
supporters stormed the mosque, no longer looks the threat it was a year ago.
Mr Rao has silenced his critics in the Congress party and seems likely to
stay in command at least until the next general election which is due to be
held by mid-1996 at the latest.
While the post-Ayodhya violence came as a shock, India has avoided the
deep-rooted social unrest which has hit Russia and some other states
struggling with pro-market reforms. As Mr Rao told the Financial Times in a
recent interview: 'The best thing is to show people that (reform) works . .
. Perhaps in many other countries it has taken a longer time, therefore
people have lost their faith and all kinds of difficulties are threatening
to come. In India fortunately we have been able to convince the people
though, of course, much more remains to be done.'
The question is whether the celebrations will prove short-lived - or whether
India has at last entered a time of rapid and sustained economic
modernisation.
With luck, including further adequate monsoons, the energies released by the
reforms which have already been carried out should enable India to achieve
the government's target of a steady growth rate of 5-6 per cent over the
next year or two, up from an estimated 3.8 per cent for the year ending this
month. However, this aim is quite modest, given that India grew at an
average rate of 5.5 per cent in the pre-reform 1980s. To reach a
significantly higher rate, India may need to undertake the radical reforms
it has so far largely avoided - notably organising large-scale investment in
infrastructure and cutting its bloated public sector.
Moreover, as ministers acknowledge, without a growth rate of above 6 per
cent, the country is unlikely to create jobs for its unemployed and
underemployed masses or generate sufficient resources for education, health
care and other development spending. As Mr P Chidambaram, a former commerce
minister and staunch supporter of reform, says: 'Only if we grow at 6-8 per
cent for 10 years will growth percolate down to the poor.'
The immediate prospects seem bright. In last month's 1994-95 Budget, Mr
Manmohan Singh, the reformist finance minister, deliberately relaxed curbs
on public borrowing to stimulate growth, the second pump-priming in two
years. He also extended the deregulation policies which have been a central
feature of reform since 1991, cutting peak customs duties from 85 per cent
to 65 per cent (300 per cent before 1991).
He announced an overhaul of the complex and confused domestic indirect tax
system. He cut interest rates by a percentage point to 14 per cent for the
minimum lending rate. The Budget also set out plans for further financial
market reforms, including steps to promote efficiency in banking and
insurance.
Mr Singh admitted he was taking a calculated risk with the public finances
by permitting high levels of public borrowing. He justified the decision by
pointing to record food stocks and record foreign exchange reserves of
Dollars 14bn (up from Dollars 1bn in 1991) combined with much idle capacity
in industry.
Businessmen have pledged to seize the opportunities created by the
pro-growth Budget. Industrial growth in the first half of 1993-94 was just
1.6 per cent; but there are signs of a marked recovery in the winter, led by
consumer demand. Rural outlets, in particular, are posting large sales
increases as farmers spend some of the gains of the good harvests.
Indian companies are raising record amounts of capital: though some of it is
being used to repay bank loans, some is intended for substantial projects.
For example, no fewer than five oil refineries and nine petrochemicals
complexes with investment totalling Dollars 30bn are planned, though not all
are likely to come to fruition.
For foreign investors, India looks more promising than at any time since
independence. With signs of the Chinese economy over-heating, many
international investors looking for alternatives among developing countries
are turning to India and its vast unexploited market of 890m people.
Since mid-1991, India has approved foreign direct investments totalling
Dollars 5bn, including over Dollars 3bn in the past year. Much of it is
concentrated in power, a top government priority.
The amount actually flowing into India is also growing - from Dollars 148m
in the 1991-92 to an estimated Dollars 1.5bn in 1993-94.
Foreign financial investment has mushroomed, since India in late 1992 opened
its stock market to foreign institutions and eased rules for Indian
companies to issue paper overseas. Investment from these sources has soared
from virtually nothing three years ago to an estimated Dollars 3.5bn in
1993-94.
The growth has been so fast that it has clogged the Bombay market's
settlement machinery.
Across India, there are high-growth cities where reforms are already
bringing wealth. In Bombay, businessmen are no longer embarrassed about
being rich. 'Before even if you had a Mercedes, you kept it in the garage,'
says one,' Now it's okay to take it on the streets.'
Jobs for well-educated commercially-minded young people are growing fast,
particularly in financial services, advertising and other business services.
Bombay yuppies no longer limit themselves to Indian-branded goods but shop
for foreign names, often abroad, but increasingly in India, where, for
example, Lacoste T-shirts, Ray-Ban sunglasses and Pierre Cardin ties are all
available.
The same is true in affluent corners of Delhi and in Bangalore in the south.
Some rural districts also share in the spreading wealth, notably in the
western states of Gujarat and Maharashtra, and in Punjab in the north, where
farmers have grown rich supplying the nearby cities. Scores of entrepreneurs
are benefiting from the expansion of exports - up 21 per cent in the 10
months to the end of January - and from exporters' tax-breaks. 'If you can't
make money exporting from India now,' says Mr Narayana Bhatt, a
Bangalore-based exporter of leather garments, 'then you should not be in
business.'
What is to prevent the activities of Mr Bhatt and thousands like him from
pulling India towards full-scale economic modernisation? Unfortunately,
there are potential blocks on the road to modernity, and not all of them are
being tackled with sufficient vigour by the government.
First, while the government cut public borrowing in the early stages of
reform, it is now relaxing the purse strings. The biggest surprise in last
month's Budget was the revelation that the fiscal deficit for the year
1993-94 would reach 7.3 per cent of GDP - compared with a target of 4.7 per
cent. The target for 1994-95 was set at a generous 6 per cent.
Mr Singh defended his decision by saying that there was scope in the
slow-moving economy for pump-priming. The underlying reason is that the
government does not wish to reapply the brakes so close to important state
elections this year and the next general election. The danger is that
inflation - now running at 9 per cent annually - may rise, adding to the
sufferings of India's poor. It would only take a bad monsoon or an external
shock such as a rise in oil prices to knock the government's plans off
course.
Poor infrastructure is an even greater hurdle. While India is making
progress in trying to attract private investment into power projects, it
will be the late 1990s before these new schemes make much of an impression
on the general shortages. The government originally planned to install
48,000 megawatts of generating capacity in 1991-96, a figure cut to 30,500MW
because of financial constraints. However, a review late last year showed
the public sector would only build 13,000-14,000MW; private companies would
have started work on stations with an output of 3,000MW.
The inadequacy of telecommunications is equally acute, with investment
delayed by a combination of legal disputes over contracts for mobile
telephone networks and political argument about privatisation policy. The
liberalisation of investment in roads, rail and ports is even further away -
though domestic air travel has quite successfully been opened to
privately-owned carriers.
The inefficiency of publicly-owned services and industries remains a strong
drag on the economy, accounting for nearly half the nation's capital but
producing only about 27 per cent of its output. The government has sold
stakes in leading state-owned enterprises, including banks, steel operations
and electronics manufacturers. But ministers have opposed selling more than
49 per cent of a unit for fear of losing control. As Mr C Rangarajan, the
governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, says: 'There's not
been much movement on reforming public sector units, we recognise that.
Partial disinvestment is where it stands.'
Ministers are also reluctant to liberalise India's restrictive labour laws,
which seriously limit employers' rights to make surplus workers redundant.
While companies can find ways around the law - through voluntary schemes and
redeployment - large-scale dismissals are virtually impossible.
Finally, India's progress could be held back by the low educational
standards of much of its population. Only 52 per cent of Indians can read,
compared with about 75 per cent of Chinese. It will take time to integrate
the remainder, or even their children, into a modern economy.
None of these medium- and long-term problems is insoluble. India has one of
the best-educated elites in the developing world, including civil servants,
businessmen and technical experts. Indians living abroad are a fund of
energy and ideas, as well as capital. Many of these people recognise the
difficulties the country faces - and the need for further radical reforms.
What is missing is any widespread sense of urgency. India, it seems, will
modernise - but at its own steady pace.

FT  30 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAe foreign limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace was forced yesterday into its second announcement over the
level of foreign investment, revealing a breach of the 29.5 per cent
ownership ceiling. BAe said it would now take steps to sell the 0.03 per
cent of shares exceeding the government-imposed limit at 'the best price
reasonably obtained'. The announcement came after the market had closed and
BAe shares had slipped 5 to 501p on turnover of about 700,000.
BAe finds itself in a similar situation to Rolls-Royce, which has also had
to force the sale of foreign-held shares breaching its 29.5 per cent limit.
Both companies are believed to be lobbying to have the ceilings - which were
imposed to prevent the two defence-related companies being dominated by
foreign interests - raised to 49.5 per cent. Rolls-Royce declined 6 to 175p.
Shares in high street bank Lloyds jumped yesterday as hopes for a pick-up in
growth and for lower UK interest rates prompted one securities house to lift
forecasts and another to promote the sector. The shares were 13 better at
best before drifting with the market to close a net 6 ahead at 568p.
UBS sharply upgraded dividend and profits forecasts and issued a buy
recommendation. The house believes Lloyds has begun to adopt a more
expansionary attitude and that the bank's dividend will increase by 15 per
cent a year to hit 25.5p this year and 34p in 1996. UBS raised its 1994
forecast by Pounds 50m to Pounds 1.37bn and its 1995 number by Pounds 70m to
Pounds 1.62bn.
Meanwhile, Salomon International, the US investment bank, highlighted its
belief that interest rates have further to fall and focused on the banking
sector as offering attractive yields as well as exposure to further rises in
the stock market. National Westminster, up 6 at 470p, and TSB, a penny
firmer at 219p, also benefited from the Salomon recommendation.
Strong results from Next powered the shares forward 6 to 231p, with turnover
reaching 7.3m. Profits for the high street retailer were at the top end of
market forecasts and the final dividend was doubled. Analysts were further
encouraged by the comments on current trading, with talk that sales from the
mail order business were 20 per cent above last year's level.
A raft of upgrades pushed next year's forecasts towards the Pounds 90m mark,
with some bullish analysts looking for another doubling of the dividend to
8p. But with the shares having performed so strongly, there were some notes
of caution being struck. Hoare Govett was one house suggesting the shares as
a 'hold', with doubts over whether the impressive sales performance could be
sustained.
Croda International fell steeply after announcing a big increase in
full-year profits to Pounds 48.9m. The company said there would be no
pension holiday this year and some dilution from a disposal. The two
technical factors are expected to knock about Pounds 3.9m off earnings and
analysts lowered forecasts accordingly. Smith New Court reduced its 1994
estimate by Pounds 4m to Pounds 40m and advised customers to take profits
yesterday. The shares weakened 24 to 352p.
Hickson International eased only 2 to 208p in spite of a year which saw
profits drop to Pounds 22.1m from Pounds 24.3m previously. Analysts felt
most of the bad news was out of the way and there was optimism over a new
washing detergent agent. Kleinwort Benson held its profits forecast at
Pounds 28m.
Oil shares again reacted to this week's sharp falls in oil prices.
Fundamentally bearish broker SGST reiterated its gloomy stance and argued
that oil price weakness was now a long term fact of life rather than a
temporary phenomenon. British Petroleum retreated 9 1/2 to 356 1/2 p on very
heavy turnover of 14m shares following a sharp fall in New York on Monday
night. Exploration and production group Enterprise Oil lost 3 at 404p. Shell
Transport recovered 2 to 659p from what many consider an oversold position.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo shed 7 to 614p after Swiss rival Ciba-Geigy said
it was confident about its efforts to market a cheap version of Glaxo's
Zantac, the world's top-selling drug.
British Biotechnology, which announced a one-for-three rights issue at 400p
a share to raise Pounds 40m to pay for product development, added 5 at 470p.
The rights issue had been flagged but analysts pointed out that the issue
included a warrant which would yield a further Pounds 48m in 1996, thus
solving the company's funding requirement for the next two years.
Standard Chartered was one of the few banks in the sector to lose ground as
Credit Lyonnais Laing lowered its profits forecasts and reinforced its sell
stance. Worries on Hong Kong margins prompted Lyonnais Laing to cut this
year's estimate by Pounds 26m to Pounds 441m and next year's by Pounds 23m
to Pounds 425m. The shares receded 17 to 1046p while rival HSBC moved
forward 17 to 764p, with some talk of switching between the two.
Manufacturer Dominick Hunter made an encouraging market debut, opening at
the issue price of 200p but gaining 24 at 224p.
Coal Investments, which was suspended last month at 76p, resumed trading at
77p and jumped to 84p.
Publication of the full report and accounts saw Reed International bounce 16
to 851p. The shares fell recently in spite of increased figures as analysts
focused on the pressure from rising paper prices, but those worries have
receded as companies have stressed that they have locked in prices.

FT  30 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Property valuations concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern over stock market valuations of property stocks was underlined
yesterday by a disappointing announcement from Hammerson. The board
statement showed Hammerson's net asset value (nav) as 343p a share, well to
the lower end of market forecasts. This highlighted nervousness ahead of a
batch of impending property share flotations.
With the sector undergoing a correction following a powerful performance in
the past 18 months, analysts fear these flotations may prove disappointing.
First of the batch is Capital Shopping Centres, which begins trading today.
Some brokers suggest the shares could open at about 210p, a 20p discount to
the issue price of 230p. The issue price was calculated at a 13 per cent
premium to net asset value at a time when the property sector was trading at
an average premium to asset value of about 20 per cent. However, this has
now fallen to around 5 per cent.
Last week it was revealed that only 14.4 per cent of the public offer had
been taken up.
Hammerson's shares, which fell back on the results, later rallied on
consideration of a Pounds 143m deal with Postel, the investment group. After
dropping to 348p, they finished 8 down on balance at 354p.
Mr Graham Stanley at Goldman Sachs said: 'This sensible deal bolsters short
term income and provides some interesting medium term redevelopment
opportunities.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A somewhat featureless trading session in derivatives left the June contract
on the FT-SE 100 Index showing a discount of several points to the
underlying cash market yesterday, writes Terry Byland.
However, trading volume was moderate, with some 14,000 contracts transacted
by the close of after-hours' dealing.
The session opened well, with the Footsie contract supporting a firm start
by the underlying stock market and then moving to a good premium even
against the day's peak in the cash market. But there was no follow-through
and by mid-morning both cash and futures had begun to slide.
It became clear that the initial firmness reflected little more than the
backwash of a selling programme in the stock market and there was little
further strength in the markets.
By the close of official trading, the June contract had slid back to 3,117
from its morning high point of 3,156. There was no reappearance of the US
houses which had made the running on the previous day.
Activity in traded options was similarly subdued, with the number of
contracts dealt dipping to 23,741, from just over 28,000 on Monday. The
FT-SE 100 option, however, recorded 9,446 lots, compared with 8,470.

FT  30 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices close easier in
uncertain trading - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices moved sharply in an erratic trading session in London
yesterday, as equally uncertain trends in bonds kept investors confused over
the near term outlook for domestic securities markets. The blue chip trading
houses continued to wind down their positions ahead of the Easter weekend,
and gilt-edged specialists were focusing on today's auction of Pounds 2.5bn
short-dated bonds in London's first floating rate offering of government
securities.
The day's peak of 3,144.9 on the FT-SE 100 Index, 15.4 above the overnight
level, came very early in the session. Once again buying interest was thin
and shares turned off sharply when the government bond market began to fall
away. An easier trend in sterling helped shares in the export leaders
towards the close but this was counter-balanced by a fall of 33 points on
the Dow Jones Industrial Average early in the New York trading session.
The closing reading put the FT-SE 100 at 3,123.4 with a decline on the day
of 6.1 points. Much of the movement in the Footsie stocks originated from
the stock index futures sector. Lacking this distraction, the FT-SE Mid 250
Index gained 3.1 at 3,788.8, although trading in second-line issues was
modest.
Although oil prices steadied, shares in the major producer companies
weakened on overnight selling in US markets. Pharmaceuticals drifted lower
in nervous trading towards the close, when Wall Street was reacting sharply
to data on consumer confidence and housing starts. Glaxo eased following
confirmation that Losec, Astra's rival to Glaxo's highly successful Zantac
drug, had been licensed for sale in the UK.
Gyrations in the UK bond market, while not affecting share prices as
directly as in some recent sessions, unsettled market confidence yesterday.
There are constant rumours that at least one London based securities house
has suffered heavy losses in gilts and that the erratic trend in the bond
market reflects its attempts to restructure its trading position.
Bonds are also perturbed by the interest rate pressures from outside the UK.
The rest of the week, including Friday when most European markets are
closed, will feature a flow of important economic statistics on the US
economy, which will refocus investment attention on the likelihood of a
further tightening in credit policy by the Federal Reserve.
Both fund managers and market traders have already begun to concentrate on
keeping positions tightly trimmed over the Easter holiday weekend. Seaq
volume, at 673.9m shares, was higher than on Friday but at the low end of
daily averages; Friday's Seaq volume was worth only Pounds 1.2bn in retail
worth.
Underlying confidence remains firm, however, with several leading investment
banks continuing to urge clients that UK equities present a buying
opportunity at present levels.
BZW said that the stock market 'has now moved into overshoot'; in focusing
almost exclusively on interest rate prospects, it has overlooked the
'positive indications for earnings recovery' appearing in the company
results list.
Last week's 'poor' retail price index has not changed the outlook for
inflation, believes Mr Chris Dillow at Nomura Research. He suspects that the
underlying rate will end this year at 3.2 per cent and next year at around
4.4 per cent.

FT  30 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US shares weaken in line with
bond market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
The four-day sell-off in US stocks accelerated yesterday as the yield on the
benchmark Treasury bond pushed above an important psychological barrier,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 63.33 weaker at 3,699.02, its
lowest level since December 1, 1993. The New York SE's 'uptick rule', which
restricts program sales, was implemented late in the session, but it failed
to stem the tide. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 7.98
to 452.48 as declining issues overwhelmed advances by 2,016 to 272.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was down 7.78 at 454.42.
The Nasdaq composite plunged 17.19 to 755.31, bringing its cumulative loss
over the past week to 48 points, or nearly 6 per cent.
The late recovery in share prices on Monday failed to carry over into
yesterday's opening. Again, stocks closely paralleled activity in the US
Treasury market, which was hit by renewed selling pressure after a one-day
reprieve.
In early trading the yield on the 30-year government security again pushed
above 7.00 per cent after receding below that level in the previous session.
The move yesterday came after the Conference Board said its March consumer
confidence index made a stronger than expected recovery from February's
weather-related decline.
For equity investors, the unsettled mood in the bond market clearly
outweighed the implications of more buoyant consumer spending in the coming
weeks.
The impact of bond yields on market sentiment was clearly reflected in a
recommendation issued yesterday by one of Wall Street's biggest brokers.
Smith Barney Shearson urged its clients to cut their equity holdings from 55
to 50 per cent of their portfolios, saying the uptrend in interest rates
could depress share prices by a further 8.7 per cent before the correction
ends. The Dow Industrial index has already dropped by 7 per cent since
peaking at the end of January.
Cyclical stocks again led blue chips down. Caterpillar fell Dollars 3 1/2 to
Dollars 110, Deere Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 81 3/4 and DuPont Dollars 2 1/2
to Dollars 54 3/8 . But the damage to the market was widespread. Airline and
trucking issues were very weak, as reflected in a 2 per cent drop in the Dow
Transportation index to 1,675.36.
UAL, parent of United Airlines, shed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 130 1/2 after
filing details of a proposed buyout by the carrier's employees with federal
regulators.
On the Nasdaq, the sell-off in computer-related shares showed no signs of
abating. Microsoft slid Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 82 1/2 , Intel Dollars 2
3/8 to Dollars 66 1/4 and WellFleet Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 71.
Canada
Rising interest rates and weak commodity prices combined to push stock
prices sharply lower in Toronto.
The TSE 300 composite index closed 94.4 down at 4,393.6, while losing issues
far outpaced rises by 740 to 169. Trading volume was 73.2m shares valued at
CDollars 812.7m.
All of the sub-indices weakened. Industrial products, consumer products,
financial services and golds each lost more than 2 per cent. The energy
group was down 1.8 per cent.
Mexico
Equities opened lower on news of a rise in interest rates, before rallying
at midday on rumours, later confirmed, that the ruling party had chosen Mr
Ernesto Zedillo as presidential candidate following last week's
assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio. The IPC index gained a net 11.44
at 2,457.59.

Goodman Fielder, Australia's largest food group, yesterday told the
Australian Stock Exchange that it was 'not aware of any recent major change
in the beneficial ownership of its shares', writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
The statement followed a spate of intense bid and/or stake-building
speculation, resulting from some very heavy trading of the group's shares on
Monday. Around 26m shares changed hands, more than 2 per cent of the equity,
but the share price, at ADollars 1.62, has failed to move. Goodman has been
the subject of much management upheaval in recent times, and reported a 12
per cent fall in first-half profits after tax.

FT  30 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Politico-economic bet on
Euroconstruction stocks / A look at prospects for the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As economic recovery across Europe remains limp and equity markets nervous
and fragile, the construction sector is attracting politico-economic bets.
Typically, governments attempt to boost flagging economies in periods of
recession by gearing up infrastructure programmes.
The turnround in the industry may not be instantaneous, with several
analysts maintaining forecasts of further, albeit slight, slowdowns for
1994. But looking to later this year and early 1995, many of them are
positive about better prospects for the sector.
In France, housing starts are up by 12.7 per cent in the first two months of
this year against the same period last year. Nikko Europe is expecting a
bounce of 2 per cent in French construction output this year, after a 2 per
cent decline in 1993.
Lafarge and Saint-Gobain, the building materials groups, stand out as two of
the stronger stocks. Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko says that the exposure of
Saint-Gobain and Lafarge to the US is becoming less of a concern.
'Saint-Gobain is a very good recovery stock,' he says. 'Its prospects are
multifarious with eight or so divisions.' Lafarge, he adds, also had the
benefit of having better than expected results for last year, inspiring more
confidence over its present and future performance.
Spain's construction sector is in bullish mood, having enjoyed a large boost
from infrastructure projects, many of which began two years ago. That boost
was enhanced by last year's huge increase in public tender awards, which
coincided with Spain's general elections. Tenders rose by 80 per cent.
The positive sentiment has been seized upon by Fomento de Construcciones y
Contratas (FCC), which will soon make the largest ever equity placing by a
private Spanish company. FCC, one of the top two stocks in the sector, is to
place 20 per cent of its shares. The majority will be offered to US and UK
institutions in two main tranches.
Ms Alexandra Perricone of James Capel believes that FCC, along with
Dragados, with which it shares leadership of the industry, has identified
that diversification is the key growth area for the sector. 'Urban waste
management is one of the expanding areas,' she says, 'and these companies
have responded by diversifying more.'
Ms Perricone warns, however, that while Spanish construction stocks are
enjoying a measure of interest, companies are labouring a little under
reduced margins.
For the Netherlands, this point is echoed by Mr Marc Slendebrook of
Kleinwort Benson, who says that as life is stirring in the industry,
'operating margins are stuck at 2 to 3 per cent in a fairly competitive
market'. But he is reasonably upbeat about prospects for stocks in the
sector as a significant increase in public spending on construction begins
to take effect.
Italy, having suffered the triple burden of a cut in the government's public
spending, the European recession, and the corruption scandals, saw
investment in construction tumble 23 per cent between 1992 and 1994. Hoare
Govett, however, is confident that this steep slide will be reversed this
year, and that recovery will begin in earnest now that the elections are
over.
It recently issued a strong buy recommendation for Cogefar, the country's
largest private construction company. Although Cogefar is facing full-year
figures shortly, likely to record a loss and prove the worst in its history,
Hoare Govett predicts a strong recovery next year. The shares have generally
outperformed a weak market over the past few months.
Germany remains Europe's wild card for the industry, given the country's
reunification and the consequent boost for rebuilding projects. In western
Germany, business has been lifted by increased activity in residential
development, propelled largely by increased tax incentives and the lure of
low mortgage rates.
James Capel is cautious about Germany, recommending an underweight position
with a buy stance only on Dyckerhoff, which has just taken control of
Ciments Luxembourgeois from Arbed. On Hochtief, a stock favoured by many
analysts following reunification, Capel advocates a sell.
Meanwhile, NatWest Securities notes that German construction stocks have
tended to outperform in the first quarter of a given year, and wane a little
thereafter.

<TEXT>
A weaker gold price added to the upset on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange,
still reeling from the impact of Monday's gun battles in the city centre
which rocked market confidence, writes Matthew Curtin in Johannesburg.
The overall index shed 58 to 4,968 after losing nearly 3 per cent the day
before. The golds index fell 97 to 2,026 as bullion failed to hold above
Dollars 388 an ounce. But dealers said bargain hunting by local institutions
pushed the industrial index up 36 to 5,762 after the previous day's 2 per
cent drop.
Mr David Schapiro, of stockbrokers Frankel, Pollak, Vinderine, said that
Monday's events had done severe damage to international investor confidence
in the short term, even if there had been little panic selling.
The finrand closed at R4.765 against the dollar after starting the week at
R4.705.

FT  30 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fall in oils as German
financials revive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses mostly fell, oil shares dropping into line with their North American
counterparts, although German financials took a turn for the better, writes
Our Markets Staff.
MILAN reacted uneasily to the general election victory of the right wing
Freedom Alliance, with profit-taking by domestic investors evident following
Monday's sharp gains. The BCI index rose a modest 0.30 to 693.82.
Reaction from analysts was mixed. Mr Fabio Basagni of Actinvest was bullish,
saying that this was the first time in 50 years that a government had been
elected with a clear majority. A free market policy would be adopted, and
there would be an acceleration in the number of privatisations.
Mr Richard Davidson, a Morgan Stanley strategist, commented that there
remained a question mark over how the alliance partners would co-operate.
'We maintain a zero weighting in our model portfolio,' he said. 'We think
that the incoming government is unlikely to continue with budgetary policies
as vigorous as those of the past two governments ..and that will damage
interest rate hopes'.
Elsewhere Olivetti, which led the consortium awarded the licence for the
second mobile telecommunications network by the outgoing government late on
Monday, went against the trend, rising L54 to L2,650.
PARIS was hit by weakness in the bond market and a fall in oil stocks, the
latter reacting belatedly to falls in oil prices, following the Opec
agreement to maintain output until the end of the year.
The CAC-40 index lost 22.01 or 1 per cent to 2,122.48.
Turnover was slack at FFr3.6bn.
Elf Aquitaine and Total both fell back on the Opec news, the former losing
FFr12.70 to FFr387 and the latter FFr7.10 at FFr310.50.
Casino, which held its 1993 dividend at FFr5, dipped FFr5.50 to FFr171.
FRANKFURT put up a relatively strong performance, the Dax index closing the
session 6.93 higher at 2,168.35 and the post bourse at 2,162.82.
Ms Barbara Altmann, at B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that the influence of
the bund futures market had been moderated by the strength of the D-Mark
against the dollar: 'People don't want to get out of it just now,' she said.
Turnover rose from DM7.7bn to DM8.2bn. Share prices reflected a
consolidation in cyclicals, favoured in the first quarter of 1994, and a
revival in financials.
Allianz was the outstanding winner, up DM50 to DM2,575 for a two-day gain of
DM99 although Dresdner Bank, up DM10 to DM406, ran the insurer close. Among
the big cyclicals, BMW and Hoechst fell DM9 to DM829 and DM6 to DM332.50
respectively; both of these were strong performers on Monday.
MADRID hit a new low for the year, the general index falling 2.84 to 324.48
on Wall Street's losses as turnover picked up to Pta30.8bn.
Repsol was the hardest hit, falling Pta135, or 3 per cent to Pta4,365 on
Wall Street, the weaker dollar and falling crude oil prices.
ZURICH chose to ignore favourable analytical reaction to the Ciba-Geigy
results, and a drop in Swiss inflation. Ciba registered fell SFr17 to SFr864
and the SMI index by 35.0, or 1.2 per cent to 2,827.4.
Banks were pressured by continued worries that European interest rates might
not decline as far, or as quickly as previously thought.
UBS headed the actives list and dropped SFr19 to SFr1,209.
AMSTERDAM was marked down in low volume, with some heavy falls seen among
the major issues. The AEX index slipped 4.03 or 1 per cent to 406.90.
Royal Dutch, off Fl 1.60 at Fl 190.20, reacted to volatility in oil prices
following the meeting of Opec at the weekend.
ING, the financial services group, which said that it was planning to issue
a Fl 1bn bond and reported a 11 per cent rise in 1993 net profit, in line
with expectations, lost Fl 1.80 to Fl 81.10.
BRUSSELS was flat, the Bel-20 index ending just 0.83 lower at 1,480.65, but
a loss at the Luxembourg-based steelmaker, Arbed, left the latter down
BFr175, or 4 per cent at BFr4,235.
STOCKHOLM racked up another decline in a two-week downtrend which has wiped
out the gains achieved earlier in 1994. The Affarsvarlden General index fell
18.2 to 1,416.7.
On the world stock market prices and indices page highs and lows are now
shown for 1994.

FT  30 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Dollar decline triggers
Nikkei loss
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei 225 average lost 1.2 per cent as prices were pulled down by the
sharp fall in the dollar, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was down 232.05 at 19,709.74 after a day's high of 19,969.19 just
after the opening and a low of 19,653.03 in the afternoon.
The dollar moved below Y104 for the first time since March 4, currency
traders fearing that the US government would be dissatisfied with Japan's
trade package, which included macroeconomic measures and market opening
schemes.
Analysts predicted volatility in the dollar/yen market. 'The US is going to
maintain pressure on Japan to meet its demands over trade, using the yen as
a stick,' said Mr Richard Werner, chief economist at Jardine Fleming
Securities.
Volume remained almost flat, at 260m shares. The Topix index of all first
section stocks slipped 16.33 to 1,596.51 and the Nikkei 300 shed 3.39 to
292.47. Declines led rises by 693 to 328, with 148 issues unchanged. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 5.21 to 1,309.46.
Export oriented high-technology stocks retreated on profit-taking. NEC
dipped Y30 to Y1,120 and Toshiba Y20 to Y779. Multimedia and
telecommunication related shares were down, with NTT losing Y18,000 to
Y914,000.
Mining and non-ferrous metal stocks, recently firm on the rise in commodity
prices, declined: Dowa Mining relinquished Y25 to Y550 and Nippon Light
Metal Y13 to Y617.
Ricoh, the high-technology office equipment maker, drew heavy buying, was
the most active issue of the day, and rose Y13 to Y838. The group forecast
double digit increases in profits for the third consecutive year due to
restructuring efforts.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 108.90 to 22,020.61 in volume of 28.3m
shares.
Roundup
A more positive mood pervaded many of the region's markets yesterday. Taiwan
was closed for a holiday.
HONG KONG ended sharply higher, assisted by a late surge in index futures.
The Hang Seng index advanced 283.11, or 3 per cent, to 9,480.14, although
turnover contracted from HKDollars 5.2bn to HKDollars 4.5bn.
Investors appeared unperturbed by news that measures to cool speculation in
the property market would be announced this summer. Among property stocks,
Cheung Kong rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 41.50, Sun Hung Kai HKDollars 2 to
HKDollars 56 and Henderson Land HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 46.
Major banks were strong, with HSBC surging HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 91 and
its Hang Seng Bank unit gaining HKDollars 2 at HKDollars 54.
SINGAPORE saw bargain hunting after falling in recent sessions. The Straits
Times Industrial index rallied 33.79, or 1.6 per cent, to 2,093.72.
Brokers said some investors were heartened by reports that Malaysia's Bank
Negara will report smaller than expected losses in its foreign exchange
dealings.
KUALA LUMPUR rebounded on bargain hunting after Monday's 2 per cent decline,
but brokers said that sentiment remained nervous. The composite index
recovered 10.35 to 961.78.
SEOUL eased as banks encountered profit-taking. The composite index lost
7.62 at 875.62 and the financial sub-index shed 10.25 to 1,034.50.
MANILA ended higher on buying of major issues. The composite index added
17.45 at 2,703.13. Turnover slipped slightly to 1.15bn pesos.
AUSTRALIA was dragged lower by volatile trading in the futures and bond
markets.
The All Ordinaries index lost 8.1 at 2,100.8 after a steep fall in the
banking sector.
BOMBAY improved on active buying by mutual funds and financial institutions.
The BSE 30-share index put on 67.02 at 3,780.20. KARACHI opened the new
account with the KSE 100 index recovering 15.92 to 2,577.42.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Markets Report: All eyes on Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers kept a wary eye on Italy yesterday as markets sought to assess the
implications of the election victory of the right wing Freedom Alliance,
writes Philip Gawith.
Trade was subdued following the earlier rise in the currency based on exit
polls. After appreciating by more than L10 on Monday to L978.4 against the
D-Mark, the Italian currency had a quiet day and finished marginally firmer
at L977.9.
That one of the political groupings achieved a victory was regarded as
positive, but concern remains about whether the Alliance can form a stable
government.
Elsewhere in Europe, tighter money market conditions induced a measure of
pessimism about the scope for a cut in the German repo rate today. The
D-Mark finished slightly firmer in London against the French franc, at
FFr3.424 from FFr3.422. It was weaker against the Spanish peseta, closing at
Pta82.08 from Pta82.15.
Sterling, meanwhile, fell to its lowest levels this year. The trade weighted
index finished at 79.8 from 80.2. The UK currency was hit by the
government's climbdown over voting rights in the European Union. It closed
in London at DM2.4889 from DM2.5035. It was also lower against the weaker
dollar, finishing at Dollars 1.4927 from Dollars 1.4966.
With Italy apparently set to have a Berlusconi government, the question now
occupying markets is whether it will be a sustainable one. The Forza Italia
leader will have to settle differences between his two squabbling allies -
the separatist Northern league and the neo-fascist National Alliance.
Although there is broad agreement among analysts that the lira is
undervalued and the economic outlook good, stable government is seen as a
prerequisite for optimism. A period of uncertainty, however, lies ahead as
the victors attempt to form a government before parliament reconvenes on
April 15.
Mr Stephen Yorke, chief European analyst at Chase Manhattan, is pessimistic
about the outlook. He says the result is 'what everyone feared. No clear-cut
winner who can govern alone over the medium term, but rather a populist
whose ability to govern within a coalition will be in direct proportion to
the havoc he wreaks on Italy's budget'.
The Chase analyst predicts that the lira could fall to L1,000 against the
D-Mark by April 15 and said it is difficult to be positive after that. He
believes the only way the coalition will be kept together is by offering
'fiscal sweeties' to the South, and tax cuts to the North. 'The budget will
be hit at both ends,' he said.
Other are less downbeat. Lehman Brothers, for example, sees the lira
finishing the year at L920.
Sterling's weakness can be traced to a host of factors, including interest
rate uncertainty, tax increases casting doubt on the sustainability of
economic recovery, and poor trade figures.
A further factor which has reasserted itself is political risk. The
compromise over EU voting procedures appears to have further weakened the
authority of Prime Minister John Major.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, commented: 'There is
growing concern that both wings of the Tory party are calling into question
John Major's leadership qualities.'
There is little expectation of a near term rate cut emerging from today's
monthly monetary meeting between UK chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr
Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England.
The futures market continues to provide a very bearish view on interest
rates. The June short sterling contract fell 7 basis points to 94.55. The
contract has dropped 35 basis points in the last three weeks.
Over the same period the December future has lost 70 points to 93.96,
implying base rates of above 6 per cent at the year-end. The December 1995
contract is discounting an 8 per cent base rate.
Many analysts believe the market is too pessimistic and predict that subdued
inflation will allow a further rate cut.
In the discount market the Bank of England provided Pounds 915m of
assistance after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 900m.
Tight end-of-month conditions caused German call money rates to jump from
5.70/5.75 per cent to 6.25/6.75 per cent as banks were forced to borrow at
the Lombard window. This dampened hopes for any substantial fall in the repo
rate at today's weekly tender.
Banks are likely to have been more cautious in their bidding for fear the
Bundesbank would not allot them the necessary amount to meet their month-end
requirements.
The dollar was weaker again, finishing at DM1.6675 from DM1.6728. It also
ended lower against the yen, at Y103.600 from Y104.620. In New York the
dollar closed at DM1.6727 and Y103.125.
Analysts said yen strength was the result of capital repatriation
accompanying the fiscal year-end. Further evidence of government opposition
to numerical trade targets also renewed fears that the US government would
try to talk up the Japanese currency.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Plumbing the depths in search
of food - Fishermen are showing increased interest in unfamiliar, deep-sea
varieties, but scientists warn that this is a particularly vulnerable
resource
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Odd-looking fish that live in total darkness in the deep waters of the North
Atlantic are causing something of a stir among fishermen and marine
scientists.
The fishing industry is increasingly interested in these deep sea species,
which include orange roughy, blue ling and round nose grenadier, as stocks
of better-known fish such as cod dwindle and international quotas are
tightened.
But scientists are warning that controls on deep sea fishing must be
introduced before commercial exploitation becomes too widespread,
threatening to wipe out a particularly vulnerable resource.
Deep water fish grow and reproduce more slowly than common species and the
danger is that they may be caught before breeding and replenishing the
stock. The orange roughy, for example, lives to 100 years, maturing at
around 20 or 30. Cod, by comparison, lives to about 15 years if it escapes
the nets, and matures at about three.
'If you have a lot of fishing effort on one stock you could clean it out
very quickly and it would take a hell of a long time to recover,' says Mr
John Tumilty, technical director of the UK's Sea Fish Industry Authority.
Spurred by French success in the last five years in catching deep water fish
off western Scotland and creating a domestic market for them, the authority
convened a meeting of international scientists this month to pool the
limited knowledge about these species.
The aim is to prevent over-exploitation of the kind that has led to a
collapse in fish stocks off Newfoundland and the north-east coast of the US
and a serious depletion in stocks of cod and most other common species in
the North Sea.
'We see this as an opportunity to take early management decisions on these
species to try to avoid the mistakes there have been in the past,' says Mr
Tumilty.
There are at least 120 different species living at depths of between 500m
and 3,000 metres off western Scotland, and about 25 of these could be of
commercial importance, according to Dr John Gordon of the Scottish
Association for Marine Science. Dr Gordon is conducting a one-year study to
ascertain whether fishing these species is sustainable commercially and
ecologically.
Some are already well-known and appreciated in other parts of the world. The
orange roughy, for example, has been caught in New Zealand waters since the
1970s and its thick, white, boneless fillets find a ready market in the US.
Russian fishermen have been catching North Atlantic deep water fish for ten
to 15 years and there has been activity in the past few years by Faroese and
Spanish fishermen in the waters off Scotland.
French trawlers began fishing there in 1989. But it is their recent success
in exploiting orange roughy, which skulk off steep slopes in depths of about
1,200 metres and are among the most valuable fish caught off Scotland, that
has created the new flurry of interest.
The French, understandably secretive about where they fish, land their
catches in Scotland and transport them overland to be shipped to markets in
France. They are believed to be catching some 5,000 tonnes a year.
According to Dr Gordon, the orange roughy contains a high proportion of
valuable oil with similar properties to sperm whale and jojoba oil, but only
a small amount is currently recovered by the New Zealand fishing industry.
Some UK fishermen are now also keen to venture beyond the continental shelf,
where they catch fish at depths of 100m to 250m. But there is uncertainty
about whether Britons will accept the strange appearance of some of the deep
water fish.
'It's market driven,' explains Mr Tumilty. 'Grenadier is found in most
supermarkets in France and there's no problem of acceptability. But the
French tend to be less conservative in their eating habits.'
Following this month's meeting of experts, detailed recommendations on
controls such as quotas will be sent to the European Commission and to
governments including the UK, France, Canada, Russia, Iceland, Norway and
Spain. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, which
groups marine scientists from many countries, will meet in Copenhagen in
August to study the problem.
'Our message to fisheries managers is clear,' says Mr Tumilty. 'This
resource is fragile and needs to be managed sensibly and sensitively. If
this is done, it has the potential to provide us with valuable food.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mixed feelings greet Nigeria's
big cocoa crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cocoa farmers, traders and exporters in Nigeria are greeting the end of the
1993-94 season with mixed feelings: delight at the crop yields and fear that
foreign exchange restrictions will drive the export of cocoa beans
underground or out of business.
This season's crop matched last year's but the world price for Nigerian
cocoa is much stronger - averaging Dollars 1,200 a tonne. The 1993-94 crop
produced 135,000 tonnes of which 120,000 has been harvested. The remaining
15,000 tonnes will be harvested in the mid crop starting April till August,
when weight and butter fat content of the beans are low.
'It has been an excellent season for Nigerian farmers and traders. Everyone
has made money,' said a spokesman for one of the leading cocoa exporters.
The 1994 budget in January put a stop to the optimism. The budget pegged the
official rate of the naira at 22 to the US dollar, outlawed the parallel
market and decreed that all exporters must repatriate and sell their dollars
at N22 to the central bank of Nigeria.
Exporters who paid farmers N47,000 a tonne and sold for Dollars 1,200 a
tonne would have to re-sell the same dollars to the government for only
N26,400, making a loss of 56 per cent on the currency transaction alone.
Traders predict that farm prices for Nigerian cocoa for the mid-season crop
will be down to N35,000 a tonne (Dollars 730 at the parallel rate).
Some traders were able to carry on exporting cocoa legitimately after the
budget because they had sold dollars far enough forward to see them through
the season. All but 15,000 tonnes of the harvest had been shipped by
mid-March. Exporters without forward dollar contracts had two choices:
either stop buying from the farmers or smuggle the cocoa so that the dollars
did not have to be repatriated.
Cocoa remains Nigeria's biggest export earner after oil, despite
inconsistent government policies affecting trade and investment. It is one
of the successes of deregulation in the 1980s, which abolished the state
marketing board, brought international traders into the market.
As farmers' prices improved the crop almost doubled in less than a decade.
Although the currency has depreciated by about 90 per cent on the legal
parallel market to about N48 in the past year, the farm gate prices have
risen sharply in real terms.
'It is fortunate that the budget came at the end of the harvest - most of
the cocoa had been exported,' says an international trader. 'We are just
hoping some sanity will be restored before the main 1994-95 harvest.'
Fears over the outlook for the 1994-95 season could undermine the hard work
and investment that goes into cocoa farming between April and October. The
investment in fertilisers and chemicals to stop black pod disease has been
essential to the improved output in recent years. With the export market so
uncertain the farmers' commitment and the necessary credits may be in short
supply.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian earnings up 16 per
cent in 1993 despite sales curb
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia's timber export earnings are estimated to have risen by 16 per cent
to MDollars 12.2bn (Pounds 3bn)in 1993, Mr Lim Keng Yaik, the primary
industries minister, said yesterday.
However, he said the country's log exports were thought to have plunged by
50 per cent to 9.4m cubic metres, valued at MDollars 2.9bn because of
Malaysia's policy of sustainable management. 'Total log exports are expected
to be lower this year in view of export ban on logs by Sabah state,' he told
a news conference. Sabah banned the export of logs in January 1993.
The higher revenue from timber exports was due largely to the strong
performance of sawn timber, estimated to have generated about MDollars 4.4b
in 1993 against MDollars 3.4bn in 1992, Mr Lim said. Sawn timber prices rose
to an average MDollars 1,823 a cubic metre in 1993 from MDollars 1,149 in
1992.
'However, in terms of export volume, sawn timber experienced only a slight
increase of 0.9 per cent to around 5.44m cu m in 1993,' the minister said.

FT  30 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Silver prices recoil after bull
run - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SILVER prices recoiled at the London bullion market yesterday after the
recent bull run as traders came to the conclusion that hopes of breaching
the Dollars 6 a troy ounce resistance level for spot metal were premature.
The spot price closed at 567.5 cents, down 9.5, and other precious metals
moved lower in sympathy.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices retreated in sluggish conditions
and dealers suggested further losses were possible. The three months price
closed at Dollars 1,936.50 a tonne, down Dollars 22.
ALUMINIUM prices were more resilient as the market's fundamental's were seen
to be improving.
London Commodity Exchange COCOA market, although the May position dropped
back below Pounds 900 a tonne, was at least comforted by the fact that
further aggressive selling did not emerge in New York in the afternoon. May
seemed content to hover around the Pounds 890, last trading Pounds 13 down
at Pounds 892.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Papua New Guinea plans to phase
out log exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Papua New Guinea plans to phase out all log exports by the year 2000 in
order to achieve sustainable forestry, Mr Tim Neville, the forests minister,
said yesterday, reports Reuter from Sydney.
From 1995, log exports would be reduced by 10 per cent a year until 2000
when there would be no more export of round logs, Mr Neville told the 1994
Australian Forest and Timber Conference. 'This government is committed to a
phased reduction of log exports and would like to see an end to this by the
year 2000.'
He said all logging companies had until the end of July to conduct
feasibility studies for processing their timber within Papua New Guinea.
'Those that respond positively will be given priority for negotiation of new
or revised timber concessions. Those who do not comply. . . may be denied
further permission to export logs,' he said.
Mr Neville estimated that the country's forests were worth USDollars 50bn at
present and thought the figure could go as high as Dollars 190bn. Recent
studies indicated that the country had a sustainable harvest volume of more
than 3m cubic metres a year, he said, but the government-permitted cut was
8.5n cu m. The actual cut was only around 3m cu m in 1993 but this was an
increase from less than 1m in 1980 and nearly all timber was exported as
unprocessed logs.
'The reality is we have allowed a gross imbalance whereby permitted harvest
greatly exceeds the forest's capacity to replace itself,' said Mr Neville.
'This is a forestry sector which has not been controlled.'
The phasing out of log exports was one of a number of initiatives to develop
Papua New Guinea's forest resources as a renewable asset.
Others included measures to encourage the development of a domestic
processing industry involving foreign investment, a new forest revenue
system to provide greater benefits to landowners and the hiring of an
independent log export monitoring and border surveillance service.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (8): Key changes are in
place - Bond Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese domestic bond market, long hindered by archaic practices, has
at last started to modernise.
Until now, the high level of fees charged, limits on the amount of issuance
allowed by individual companies and the lack of secondary market trading
have effectively capped the domestic market's development - although some
borrowers have continued to use the market, partly as a means of gaining
access to Japanese retail investors.
In the past year, the limit on the maximum amount of new issues has been
lifted.
'Shelf registration has been very much simplified by the Ministry of
Finance,' said Mr Keiichi Yoshida, manager of the treasury division at NEC
Corporation. 'Before, you had to get permission to issue a single bond. Now,
you can register a maximum amount for two years.'
The finance ministry has also lowered the minimum credit rating for issuing
foreign and domestic yen bonds by Japanese companies to triple-B from
single-A, opening the market to a broader range of borrowers. Restrictions
on the issuance of floating-rate notes have also been lifted.
In addition, high fee levels, which used to make the market very
uncompetitive relative to the Euroyen bond sector, have been substantially
reduced - by as much as 50 per cent, according to market practitioners.
The granting of securities licenses to a handful of Japanese banks has
helped generate more competition in the sector.
In addition, efforts have been made to modernise market practices,
eradicating the traditional structure of fee-earning securities houses and
chief commissioned banks.
In December 1991, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone launched the first domestic
bond using a fixed price reoffer mechanism, which is designed to set the
price of an issue according to market sentiment and create a more
transparent price for investors.
In addition, rather than dividing, say, a Y30bn issue into three tranches of
Y10bn, dividing business between different securities houses in order to
keep them sweet, companies have started to issue bonds in large amounts,
which helps improve their liquidity.
'So far as issue volume is concerned, we are trying to issue bonds as big as
possible,' said Mr Hiroshi Tsuchiya, deputy general manager, finance and
treasury division, at NTT.
However, the market is not without its problems. Most fundamentally, it
suffers from the lack of an efficient clearing system.
The market could also be held back by a general lack of issuance, since many
companies do not need to borrow fresh money in the recession.
'We need the economy to improve so that there is borrowing for capital
expenditure, said Mr Hiroshi Hayakawa, general manager, capital markets at
Nomura Securities. 'Companies are still slimming down their balance sheets
rather than borrowing.'
The domestic market has also been affected by changes to the rules governing
issues in the Euroyen bond market.
Last year, the selling restrictions for Euroyen bonds issued by sovereign
and supranational borrowers were lifted. Previously, there was a 90-day
lock-up period before such paper could be sold in Japan.
This easing is expected to be extended in time to Euroyen bonds issued by
companies. In the longer-term, the result is likely to be a convergence, in
pricing, between the domestic and Euroyen bond markets.
However, one casualty of the changes has been the Samurai bond market - the
domestic bond market for foreign borrowers, once widely used by sovereign
and supranational borrowers. The ability to place Euroyen paper directly
into Japan has removed the incentive for top borrowers to tap the Samurai
market. Instead, the market is now frequented by lower-rated sovereign
borrowers, such as Turkey and Hungary, who are taking advantage of the fact
that the domestic market is less credit-sensitive.
Although a number of key changes to the domestic market are now in place,
the development of an actively traded corporate bond market is likely to
take some time - some market participants put it at five or 10 years.
However, the concentration of issuance by Japanese companies in the Euroyen
market is likely to shift.
'As a long-term trend we think that borrowers will return to the domestic
bond market,' said Mr Hayakawa of Nomura.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (7): Firms switch staff
to Hong Kong - Foreign Institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the foreign financial institutions which flock to Tokyo, the city is
still a key financial centre, at the heart of the world's second-largest
economy. But Tokyo is losing its status as a base for the entire Asia
Pacific region.
Even five years ago, it would have been unheard of for a large foreign
institution to set up its Asian headquarters anywhere but Tokyo. The
standard split was to divide the world into three main regions: North
America, Europe (including the Middle East and sometimes Africa) and Asia.
The development of business in emerging markets in the past few years has
changed that view of the world.
At the same time that business in Asia's emerging markets was becoming
increasingly profitable, the Japanese market turned. The collapse of the
stock market, the slide into economic recession and the relative isolation
of Japan from the rest of Asia began to make Tokyo seem a less obvious
choice as Asian headquarters.
Hong Kong was the most obvious rival for the title. At the time, rents were
cheaper and salaries and taxes lower, and many banks and securities houses
started to shift staff from Japan to Hong Kong - or at least to build up
staff in Hong Kong rather than Tokyo.
This process has accelerated in the past year, even though Hong Kong's costs
have now caught up with Tokyo. Salomon Brothers, for example, has just
created an Asia Pacific group which excludes Japan.
One banker estimates that the number of staff in Hong Kong employed by US
firms has doubled in the past year or two, while numbers in Tokyo are static
or falling.
Salomon currently employs 500 staff in Tokyo; 60 fewer than a year ago.
Merrill Lynch also has a staff of 500; down 100 after running down its
private client business, although its institutional business is growing. But
Merrill's Hong Kong staff base has trebled in the last year.
There has also been a build-up of staff in Singapore, which many banks view
as a back-up, in case things go wrong in Hong Kong when the Chinese take
over in 1997. Some bankers feel that the greatest threat to Tokyo could
ultimately come from Shanghai, where they think the Chinese may try to set
up a new financial centre for Asia.
Back in Tokyo, different groups of foreign institutions have tended to focus
on different areas of business. While the UK houses entered the brokerage
side of the market, the largest players in the Japanese market are the US
houses, which came in on the bond side of the business but have tried to
build up a broad capital markets base, incorporating foreign exchange,
corporate finance and derivatives.
The US firms which at first concentrated on proprietary or programme
trading, such as Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley, have now moved into
broader capital markets business.
In the past few years, there has been a shift from equities to bond
business, reflecting the depressed state of the Japanese stock market, and
the bull market for bonds in 1992 and 1993.
'Given what happened in the equity market, there has been a noticeable shift
in investor demand from equities to bonds,' said Mr Louis Faust, branch
manager of Salomon which has made 'some selective additions in fixed
income,' while introducing a voluntary retirement programme in the equity
support group.
Some areas of business - particularly underwriting - have proved, not
surprisingly, difficult to break into. Most foreign institutions say they
are not trying to compete for domestic underwriting business, but that, for
example, a US house should be able to win mandates to bring Japanese
companies to the US market.
'We are not trying to compete with domestic institutions on their own turf,
but where there is a cross-border advantage or smart technology,' said Mr
Richard Dunn, managing director of Merrill Lynch in Japan.'
The big Swiss banks, while lagging behind the largest US houses, have also
built up sizeable operations, and are also active in the trust business.
Other firms have built up businesses in niche areas, for example Societe
Generale in derivatives.
Meanwhile, conventional stockbroking has proved an extremely difficult area,
for domestic as well as foreign institutions.
NatWest is so far the only foreign stockbroker to give up its membership on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange (in 1992), which it obtained in 1988 after pressure
had been put on the Japanese authorities by the UK government. NatWest is
now trying to rebuild its position, concentrating on the fixed income side
of the business.
Other UK banks, mainly the merchant banks, continue to concentrate on
mainstream stockbroking business, but many have been forced to cut staff.
Baring Securities cut back in 1992 because of the reduction in share volume
from about Dollars 2bn a day in 1989 to about Dollars 200m, and has been
building up its emerging market business. 'There has been a net transfer of
staff out of Japan to elsewhere in Asia - about 30-40 people in the past two
years,' said Mr Diarmaid Kelly, deputy chairman of Baring Securities. Tokyo
staff has dropped from 245 to 190. However, he believes that in time the
Japanese operation will benefit from the growth in Baring's emerging market
expertise.
'The Japanese haven't invested a great deal in emerging markets or foreign
equities yet, but that is coming, as night follows day.' He argues that
Japanese companies have invested huge amounts in businesses in Asia in the
past few years and that is bound to be followed by investment by investors.
For the moment, although the basic business of the foreign brokerage firms
in Japan is selling Japanese shares to European clients, or less frequently
European shares to Japanese clients.
If predictions of an upturn in the Japanese equity market are realised,
Japanese equity volume could also be set to increase. Some analysts are
already predicting that Japanese investors will shift from bonds to equities
at the start of their new financial year in April.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (6): More bad loans
than expected - Collateral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until the collapse of the asset boom of the late 1980s, Japan had been
gripped by the 'land legend' - that property prices never fell and that a
piece of real estate would be the solution to any financial problem.
Among the many believers were the country's banks, which lent limitlessly
during the 1980s as long as the loans were backed by land collateral.
However they have become casualties of the plunge in land prices and are
burdened by mounting bad loans and the inability to sell the real estate
collateral due to the property market's prolonged slump.
The banks have recently started to tackle their bad loan problems due to the
realisation among bureaucrats that the amount of bad loans are far larger
than initially expected - widely believed to be about Y30,000bn at the top
21 banks.
Although this approach deviates from the Ministry of Finance's traditional
attitude to bad loans - where banks would sit on their bad and risky loans
until the economy recovered rather than writing the loans off or making
provisions - financial authorities fear that the financial system will face
a credit crunch if the banks are unable to make new loans due to their
deteriorating balance sheets.
The need for banks to warehouse their bad loans until the real estate market
and the economy recover led to the creation of the Co-operative Credit
Purchasing Company (CCPC) established by the banks themselves a year ago.
The CCPC was created after strong public opposition to the government's
suggestions of using state funds to bail out the banks. The banks sell their
bad debt backed by real estate collateral to the CCPC at a discount,
subsequently writing the difference off as an income loss. The CCPC, which
buys a loan with funds injected by the bank selling the loan, then tries to
recover it, in some cases selling the property collateral to the real estate
market.
However, the efforts of the CCPC so far have raised doubts over how much of
the banks' problems it can solve. Banks have sold Y2,857.1bn of their bad
debt to the CCPC, but by the end of February, it has only been able to
collect 0.6 per cent of the total loans purchased and has only managed to
sell 0.5 per cent in land collateral.
Since a bank's lending to one entity is limited to 20 per cent of the bank's
capital, commercial bankers fear that unless the CCPC can dispose of the
loans, a second and third CCPC would need to be created.
The finance ministry is also considering plans to allow banks to set up
subsidiaries which will buy land collateral from the banks at a court
auction price. In short, the banks will sell the land to themselves, while
booking the loss on the sale as a tax deduction.
Mr James Fiorillo, financial analyst at brokers Baring Securities, reckons
that the plan, if implemented, would speed up the disposal of bad debts
since the possession of the land collateral will change from the original
owner to the banks.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance has recently announced plans to allow
banks to set up special purpose companies to which they can shift
'restructured loans' - loans on which banks have waived all or most of the
interest to help restructuring - to non-bank financial institutions.
According to IBCA, the UK bank credit rating agency, resolving the bad loan
problem could cost the leading 21 banks more than Y10,000bn, assuming that a
third of total problem loans needed to be written off.
The banks are likely to write off or set provisions for some Y4,000bn this
business year. They will be left with Y6,000bn plus further increases in bad
loans which the agency expects will take at least three to five years for
the stronger banks to resolve.
However, plans where banks fund separate entities to buy and warehouse the
bad or restructured loans and land collateral until the economy or real
estate market picks up, leave the financial institutions vulnerable to a
rise in interest rates.
And while the schemes will speed up the process of bad loan write-offs -
thus allowing banks to remove problem assets from their books - it will pose
problems for investors because the complex structure and the lack of
transparency make virtually impossible the assessment of the real risks
which the banks face.
When selling a bad loan to the CCPC, a bank will need to supply the funds in
order for the purchasing company to buy it. In effect, the bank is changing
a non-performing loan to a company into a performing loan extended to the
CCPC.
Since the banks only reveal non-performing loans on their balance sheets and
not those transferred to the CCPC, the amount of disclosed bad loans will be
significantly distorted.
IBCA warns that such accounting practices deviate from western standards and
are far from prudent. However, on the other hand, it claims that credit
risks associated with Japanese banks remain low since the measures reflect a
strong commitment of the financial authorities to maintain the integrity of
the country's financial system.
Rather than helping individual banks, the Ministry of Finance is providing
support to the 'system' by establishing a framework in which banks can
tackle their bad loan problems at their own pace with limited public
scrutiny.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (5): A good year
despite bad debts - The Non-Banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the casualties of the deterioration in asset prices in Japan are the
country's non-banks - the group of financial companies which sprang up in
the 1970s to meet market demands ignored by the banks.
But despite their bad debt problems, non-bank stocks performed well last
year. The non-bank 'other financial' sector rose 32.17 per cent last year,
compared with 10 per cent for the broad Topix index, according to Nomura
International.
Mr David Snoddy, an analyst at Jardine Fleming, says the three factors which
drove share prices higher were falling interest rates, a perception that the
risk profile of the sector had improved and the liberalisation of commercial
paper issuance rules for non-banks, allowing some of them to raise funds
more cheaply.
However, he believes that these factors have provided a relatively
short-term boost and that non-banks will only continue to out-perform other
sectors of the stock market if 'the basic businesses of the non-banks are
growth businesses.'
So what are these basic businesses? In fact, the non-bank sector covers a
wide range of areas: credit cards, consumer lending, loan guarantees,
corporate loans and leasing - and different companies focus on different
businesses, often exclusively.
Broadly, those active in consumer rather than corporate lending tend to be
viewed more positively, partly because any pick-up in the economy is
expected to show first in greater consumer spending, rather than in
corporate borrowing for capital investment.
In particular, Japan's credit card business is expected to expand rapidly in
the 1990s, given the relatively low base for credit card use in Japan. In
1991, the last year for which figures are available, the ratio of credit
card transactions to total consumption was 7.1 per cent in Japan, compared
with 17.6 per cent in the US.
'For Japan to go to only 10 per cent means an almost 50 per cent growth in
the credit card business, even assuming that consumption stays flat,' Mr
Snoddy points out.
Among the large non-bank companies set to benefit from the expected growth
of the credit card market are Daiei Finance and Credit Saison, which have
extensive retail affiliations, and Nippon Shinpan, which already has a large
market share and a relationship with Citibank, one of the largest US
issuers.
Credit Saison, which is linked to Seibu, the country's largest retail sales
group, has had an annual increase of 1m cards for the past 11 years, with an
estimated 11.5m cards in circulation as of March 1994.
However, there are a number of black clouds on the horizon for the credit
card companies. One threat is the rise of discount stores, most of which
only accept cash. Another is competition from banks. According to Mr Snoddy,
of the 203m cards in issue in 1992, 76m were issued by bank-related
companies, of which the largest is JCB. In the past 10 years, the banks'
share of the card market has risen from 27.6 per cent to 37.5 per cent.
Others question whether the credit card business in Japan will reach the
same relative size as in the US. Some analysts argue that in a country where
it is still safe to carry large sums of money in cash, and savings rates are
high, there is less need for consumers to carry credit cards.
Other consumer lending businesses are less attractive. Instalment loans, for
example, are widely seen as a declining business. They are being replaced in
part by greater use of credit cards for financing all but the largest
consumer durables. In part, this stems from the relative fall in prices of
consumer durables such as televisions.
Instead, lenders are concentrating on instalment loans for cars. However,
the finance arms of car companies are becoming increasingly aggressive
competitors in this market.
Some non-banks are retaining the guarantee part of the loan business. For
example, Aplus, which used to have a monopoly on financing BMWs sold in
Japan, lost its monopoly to BMW Japan Finance but continues to handle
guarantees for the finance company's instalment lending.
Straightforward consumer lending is still the mainstay of the group of
companies known as the sarakin - or loan sharks. They too are under pressure
from the banks, and tend to lend on an uncollateralised basis. However,
because their interest rates are higher - the maximum allowed is 29.2 per
cent - they can tolerate greater losses. Mr Kyosuke Kinoshita, president of
ACOM, predicts 10 per cent growth for his company.
However, the prospects of many non-banks are blighted by bad debt problems,
largely stemming from property investments which went awry. For many
companies, the loans were not just straightforward commercial property loans
for office blocks in Tokyo, but ambitious resort developments, such as
condominiums on the Australian Gold Coast.
'Many of these investments are so far under water' that the low interest
rate environment in Japan will do little to help, according to Ms Alicia
Ogawa, vice-president, equity research at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. 'More
important is support from their lending banks.'
Worse, the extent of individual companies' problems can be hard to trace.
'The problem with non-banks is that each has dozens of unlisted,
unconsolidated companies involved in real estate development. Many of these
companies are in serious trouble,' says Ms Ogawa. For example the exposure
of Nippon Shinpan to affiliates in real estate is at least three times the
size of its own capital, she said.
However, some companies believe that they are nearing the end of the tunnel.
Mr Yoshihiko Miyauchi, president and chief executive officer of Orix
Corporation, believes that 'we are now very close to the bottom', having
marked most of the company's property exposure to market.
While Orix Corporation, whose main business is leasing, has already
announced a 5 per cent decline in net income on the previous year, there are
some bright spots. 'We are depreciating questionable accounts more than we
had planned,' said Mr Miyauchi. 'We are taking a more conservative
approach.'
While leasing is Orix's core business, it also has some property exposure.
However, Mr Miyauchi believes the company has benefited from its
geographical diversification. 'International transactions account for one
third of our income,' he points out.
The prospects for the industry as a whole depend largely on the impact of
the government's economic package announced earlier this year. Japanese
banks lent heavily to non-banks in the 1980s and are now faced with a heavy
burden of bad debt.
The package allows banks to shift deteriorating assets off their balance
sheets by securitising the loans.
However, according to David Marshall, an analyst at IBCA, 'The measures
could be viewed as another round of shuffling problem assets and not a real
solution to the banks' asset quality problems.'
It seems likely that the bad debt problem will continue to hang over the
sector for some years to come. 'The general pattern here in Japan is that
writing off loans takes a long time,' says Mr Kyosuke Kinoshita of ACOM.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (3): Small firms face
the abyss - The Brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER

<TEXT>
In a small restaurant in the maze of busy streets behind the Tokyo stock
exchange, Mr Yoshihiro Emoto has been selling eels for 45 years. The
slippery fish are a rare delicacy for most Japanese - a taste to be indulged
only when times are good.
After four years of unparalleled austerity, in the first half of last year
the restaurateur detected the first signs of renewed interest. But the
recovery was short-lived and business has slowed again in the past six
months.
Mr Emoto says the current market is like a high-flying aircraft that has
landed with a bump, but is now taxi-ing down the runway. He expects it to
stop for repairs later this year, then take off again. 'It will probably
take two to three years before full recovery. People just have to be
patient.'
Mr Emoto's auguries are confirmed by more orthodox indicators of market
sentiment. None of them offers much comfort to the nervous occupants of
Japan's overcrowded securities market.
Average daily trading volumes on the Tokyo stock exchange were up by 34 per
cent in the first half of the current financial year, averaging more than
400m shares a day - a far cry from the billion shares a day frenzy of the
bubble years, but enough to prompt widespread optimism that the long dark
night of Tokyo's stock market was over. But the rally dissipated and trading
has settled back into its diffident pattern in the second half.
The threat to the broking sector is transparent. The Big Four firms -
Nomura, Daiwa, Yamaichi and Nikko - are sufficiently capitalised to
withstand all but the most apocalyptic of trading conditions. But it is the
more than 200 small and medium-sized firms - many of whom need sustained
trading volumes of 400m shares a day or more simply to stay afloat - who now
stare directly into the abyss.
And the chronic dearth of equity business is compounded by two other
factors: the overcapacity brought about by huge investment programmes during
the bubble years; and the financial deregulation that threatens brokers'
very existence.
For the Big Four, last year marked a turning point. Having posted historic
losses (Daiwa and Yamaichi) or minimal profits (Nikko and Nomura) in 1992-3,
they all returned to healthy profits in the first half of 1993-4, buoyed by
higher trading levels.
Although the slump in the second half will cut earnings, Alicia Ogawa,
securities analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo estimates that the four will
all report profits for the full year.
Investors' continuing reluctance to revisit the scene of their losses in the
past few years is forcing brokers to place more emphasis on quality. Last
year, Nomura broke with Japan's tradition of coyness and became the first
large broker to introduce a 'buy, sell, hold' formula for equities.
But while more attention has been paid to the product, the Big Four have
been slow to cut costs. Although employee numbers did fall by 9 per cent
last year, most of that decline was the result of natural wastage. They may
need to dig much deeper.
The Big Four have one overwhelming advantage over their smaller rivals - a
diversified business. In the past few years, Japan's tiny corporate bond
market has been opened up and the country's corporations have turned away
from their historic dependence on bank loans for finance. In the six months
to September, new bond issues were 61 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Unfortunately for the brokers, the lucrative fees for bond underwriting and
distribution are the business in which they now face direct competition from
the broking subsidiaries of banks established in the past year in the latest
wave of financial deregulation. Although the inroads made by the banks are
so far small, they will grow.
If the Big Four can claim to be past the worst, the rest of the broking
sector expect the ordeal to continue. Despite aggressive cost-cutting, the
selling, general and administration costs are still above operating
revenues. Many of the brokers are saddled with huge investments from the
years of plenty.
Kankaku Securities is a classic middle-tier company. In the late 80s it had
grandiose aims of challenging the Big Four. Huge capital projects were
commissioned, including - most ambitiously - a vast computer centre 30 miles
from Tokyo. Last year, the computer centre was sold, unused, a monument to
the hubris of the bubble years.
As the president, Mr Akihiro Ieda, says: 'Most of the smaller firms have
relied too heavily on equities. The key to survival is to diversify.'
The rare success stories have been those firms with a more balanced
portfolio. Kokusai Securities consciously emulated the Big Four - only 31
per cent of its revenues now derive from stock commissions. The other two
thirds come chiefly from bond commissions and trading income. 'We are the
perfect tripod', says Mr Yoshitaka Matsutani, the company's president. 'A
tripod cannot function unless all three legs are the same length.'
Most firms were not so prescient. While stock commissions account for about
one third of the Big Four's business, most smaller and medium-size firms
still have more than half their business tied up in equities.
Time is running out. Last year's recurring loss at Kankaku was equivalent to
nearly 4 per cent of its capital; typical of the losses companies face. And
the competition from the subsidiaries of banks is slowly eroding the extra
ground available.
The constant threat of the failure of smaller brokers continues to exercise
the minds of the regulators at the Ministry of Finance. Most of the
threatened companies are linked financially to their larger competitors or
to banks. The demise of Cosmo Securities last year may provide the model for
any future failures. The finance ministry, fearing systemic collapse,
prevailed upon Daiwa Bank, which owned 5 per cent of Cosmos, to rescue the
broker.
But with liabilities of their own, would-be rescuers are expressing their
alarm to the finance ministry. As a senior executive of Nomura put it: 'We
understand the ministry's position, but in these difficult circumstances, we
cannot do anything that is against the interests of Nomura's shareholders'.
Brave words in the comfortable land of the hypothetical. They may not be
repeated with such confidence, however, should the crisis come and the Big
Four find themselves staring down the barrel of the finance ministry's
celebrated administrative guidance.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (4): Revolution has
been orderly and cautious - The Banks as Brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a sultry July morning last year, Mr Atsuyoshi Yatsunami took the short
walk from his office at the Industrial Bank of Japan to the offices of the
brand new IBJ Securities, and opened a chapter in Japanese financial
history.
Mr Yatsunami is the president of the fledgling broker, one of the three
subsidiaries of banks to open that day and the first to conduct securities
business in Japan's domestic market.
Although he believes that the reform will in time represent a radical change
in the way financial markets work, he regrets the fact that it is far from
complete.
The opening up of the securities market had been legislated in April 1992,
despite heated opposition from the existing 200 or so brokers, for whom life
was tough enough already. It was the latest breach in the dam of tight
financial regulation that has been eroded since the early 1980s.
But in typical Japanese style, the revolution has so far been orderly and
cautious. The Ministry of Finance permitted three companies to start last
July; IBJ Securities, and LTCB Securities, both subsidiaries of long-term
credit banks, and Norinchukin Securities, a subsidiary of the agricultural
bank. They were joined later in the year by subsidiaries of two trust banks
 -Sumitomo Trust and Mitsubishi Trust. This month the Ministry of Finance
gave permission for the powerful city banks to enter the market later this
year.
The business of the new securities companies is severely circumscribed. They
may underwrite bonds and equities, but may only trade in straight bond
markets. They are not permitted to trade in equity-related secondary markets
 -equities, convertible bonds or warrant bonds. Since the secondary bond
market is still - despite recent deregulation there too - in the words of Mr
Shigeaki Katagiri, president of LTCB Securities, 'miserably small', the new
brokers rely heavily on bond underwriting business.
They might have regarded that as a blessing. Equities have not been
providing the established brokers with a high life of late and the banks'
subsidiaries would have had a hard time eking out a living on the stock
market.
But the tiny plot they have been allowed to cultivate has been a fertile
one. In their first six months, IBJ SEcurities were involved in 26 domestic
bond issues, 20 as a manager. They lead-managed two samurai bond issues and
managed nine others. LTCB Securities were involved in 16 domestic issues and
several samurai bond issues. Although these are small beer in comparison
with the near-oligopolistic shares of the Big Four, they represent a gradual
encroachment on the territory of the existing brokers.
The limits on the activities of the banks may seem more stifling if, as some
suspect, the current buoyancy in the fixed income market proves transitory.
The last year has been an exceptionally strong one for bond issues. Having
increased by 60 per cent in 1992-3, the total value of new bond issues looks
set to double in the financial year 1993-4, to nearly Y7,000bn. Some
brokers, however, put that down to weakness in equity markets and see the
pace of corporate bond issuance tailing off if equities recover.
But such a setback would probably be short-lived. There is a growing trend
in Japanese markets towards direct borrowing by corporations. LTCB's Mr
Katagiri says: 'Currently only 20 per cent of Japanese corporate borrowing
is through the bond market, compared with nearly 80 per cent in the US. We
only need that proportion to rise slightly in the next few years to bring
about an enormous increase in our business.'
Strict fire walls are enforced by the regulators - at LTCB and IBJ
Securities, the staff even wear different-coloured uniforms from their
parent's employees. Under pressure from the established brokers, the
Ministry of Finance ruled that broking subsidiaries were forbidden from
lead-managing issues for companies whose main bank was the subsidiary's
parent.
Despite this, the banks' primary advantage over the competition is their
client relationships. At IBJ, the entire staff of the subsidiary was
seconded from the parent bank. Last month the fruits of the links with bank
customers were realised when IBJ revealed that it was, for the first time,
lead-managing a bond issue by Nissan; the most significant feather in its
cap so far.
The arrival of the banks has stung the brokers into action. On the day the
subsidiaries opened, Nomura announced a cut in its commissions, and fees are
expected to fall further. Senior Nomura officials, although troubled by the
competition, believe the real threat is still to come.
Nomura says that the current participants - the long-term and trust bank
subsidiaries - are not a significant challenge. Their clients tend to be
very large companies who already exercise considerable choice in their
selection of brokers. The city banks, who arrive later this year, have
clients who are smaller and much more likely to cling to the bank's skirts
when venturing into the stockbroking business.
The established companies' response has been two-pronged: hold on to their
existing market domination by developing ever-more-sophisticated products
for their clients, and retaliate by encroaching on enemy territory. To this
end the Ministry of Finance has relaxed the rules on the type of products
they may offer. Some funds they sell look increasingly like bank deposits:
more and more liquid and an important source of competition for bank
deposits.
The new firms have little more than the narrowest of niches in the
overcrowded securities business. If deregulation is pursued further, there
is little doubt that they pose a severe threat to many of the middle-tier
brokers, already stricken by the excesses of the bubble years. Their capital
strength and strong client base will mean they can survive all but the worst
vicissitudes of the market.
But the finance ministry is clearly in no hurry to complete the revolution.
The new players, although pleased with their performance so far, feel that
the strait-jackets they occupy are too tight. Their current business amounts
to a small fraction of that of the Big Four brokers.
When the city banks join the fray, their pleas for more deregulation will
become harder to resist. But until then, the banks must continue to compete
on a playing field that, as one analyst says, is tilted at an angle of about
45 degrees against them.
Or, as Mr Yatsunami puts it: 'We are like an aircraft with one wing. We
can't really be said to be functioning properly until we acquire a second.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (2): Costly surprises
possible - The Banking System
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A big worry overhanging the Japanese economy's capacity to recover is the
convalescent state of its banking system.
The finance ministry and the banks themselves have only recently admitted
the seriousness of the damage inherited from the late 1980s boom in lending,
much of which was to property developers or companies using overvalued land
as collateral.
Now they have stepped up efforts to tackle banks' two main problems - bad
debts caused by the collapse in land prices, and a fragmented, hence costly,
industry structure.
Bad debts pose the most urgent immediate problem for small and large banks
alike. Even on Japan's official relaxed definition of a dud loan, banks'
declared bad debts are a bigger drag on the economy than were US banks' non
performing assets at the depth of the US banking crisis, points out a Bank
of Japan official.
Japan's top 21 banks admitted to Y13,700bn of bad debts, at the latest
count, although most analysts believe the figure would be at least double if
tougher western criteria were used. Disclosed bad debts currently total 2.9
per cent of gross national product, as against the 1.8 per cent of US GNP
represented by their US counterparts' non-performing loans in mid-1991.
'In the end, the only way to finance this loss on the financial system is
through growth,' says the central bank official.
The problem is distributed unevenly through the system, challenging the
finance ministry's traditional strategy of encouraging banks to perform at
the same rate, the so-called 'convoy system,' designed to buttress public
confidence.
Not surprisingly, most of the 11 large city banks, representing 30 per cent
of total lending, are relatively strong, except for Hokkaido Takushoku and
Sakura Bank. Breaches are also appearing in the balance sheets of the
smaller trust and long-term credit banks - another 14 per cent of lending -
and the sometimes weakly capitalised regional and agricultural co-operative
institutions, which make up the rest.
In an attempt to clean up their balance sheets before the upturn comes,
Japan's banks have broken with their previous strategy of delaying loan loss
write-offs in the hope of better times.
Write-offs by the top 21 doubled to an unprecedented Y1,400bn in the six
months to last September and the finance ministry's banking bureau is
thinking of Y3,000bn or more for the full-year ending tomorrow. That
represents just over 80 per cent of gyomu-juneki, or core profits and is as
much as the banks can afford, believes IBCA, a credit rating agency which
specialises in banks.
However, banks' new eagerness to write off unperforming assets is being
blunted by the continued growth in bad loans, up by 55 per cent in the fist
half of the fiscal year, according to Salomon Brothers Asia.
At this rate, finance ministry officials believe the banking system needs
between three and seven years, depending on individual institutions, to
write off the Y6,000bn to Y7,000bn which it estimates is needed to bring the
problem under control.
This indicates that banks' profitability and capacity to lend could continue
to be hampered well into the recovery. So far, demand has been weaker than
the supply of credit.
The public sector has also helped, by doing some of the banks' job on their
behalf. New lending by public sector institutions, mainly for housing and
small businesses, overtook new private sector lending for the first time in
1992, according to the Bank of Japan, and probably did so again the
following year.
Yet bank lenders are coming under growing criticism for continuing to be
addicted to collateral-backed lending at a time when assets are falling in
value, rather than taking a cue from US practice and lending on cash flow
forecasts.
The decision to get tougher on bad debts was partly helped by the finance
ministry, which has to approve every write-off, from a small loan to a
corner store to a giant property developer. It has processed applications
faster and been less miserly than in the past in permitting banks to write
off losses against tax.
The ministry also allowed banks last year to establish a mechanism to help
them liquidate and realise tax deductible losses on property loans, which
account for an estimated 60 per cent of the total bad debt burden. The
bank-owned Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, launched last March, buys
bad loans at a discount and then tries to sell the collateral, usually Tokyo
office space, in the open market.
The CCPC's main problem is that the banks are so unwilling to sell property
at its real market value - down at least 50 per cent over the past three
years - that it has found hardly any buyers. By the end of last month, the
CCPC had raised a trifling 1.1 per cent of the Y1,522bn it had paid for
loans with a face value of Y2,857bn.
In an attempt to help banks better tackle bad debts, the finance ministry
now says it will allow them to sell land collateral at auction, so as to
define a real sales price on which they can declare a tax write-off. Failing
a buyer, banks will be allowed to sell the collateral to an affiliate
established for the purpose.
Further ahead, the banks are impatiently awaiting the results of a finance
ministry panel on the possibility of packaging bad loans into marketable
securities, a technique used by US banks to help them liquidate poorly
performing assets. A decision is expected by mid-summer, say officials.
The finance ministry and Bank of Japan are meanwhile continuing to do their
best to avoid letting a crisis develop in the system itself.
An estimated 80-100 officials from both institutions are on secondment or
transfer to mainly small banks, where they are engineering rescues and
ensuring that the long overdue streamlining of Japan's fragmented banking
industry gets under way in an orderly manner.
A string of mergers between smaller banks and credit associations has
occurred.
On the whole, the most troubled institutions are assured of rescue by the
government, a parent or bigger associate, if only to prevent a rush on
similar banks. Toyo Shinkin, Osaka Fumin Shinkin, Taiheiyo Bank and Hyogo
Bank are among the small institutions to have been bailed out during the
recession.
Bank collapses are almost unheard of. There is one exception - the
government's decision last May to stage an orderly liquidation of Kamaishi
Shinkin Bank, a small credit association in rural northern Japan, and to
distribute its assets among three other institutions in the area.
In another break with the tradition of containing, rather than facing
crises, banks themselves are taking a tougher line on customers they used to
think were too big to abandon.
One indicator of this new toughness is the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan's
decision last July to leave EIE International, a large property developer,
to fend for itself. Another came in November when Daiwa Bank allowed
Muramoto Construction, a construction group with debts of Y590bn, to file
for protection from its creditors, the largest post-war financial collapse.
It is a worrying sign that a year previously, Muramoto was not even listed
as a bad debt in its creditor banks' accounts - also true of several other
large collapses and bail-outs. This means that despite the finance
ministry's assurances that the banking system's problems are well under
control, other costly surprises might be waiting to burst out.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (1): Bureaucracy is
forced to switch focus - Four years of collapsing share and property prices
have forced the administration to concentrate on more open and competitive
financial markets. But officials, banks, their affiliates and customers are
closing ranks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Japanese bureaucracy's guiding hand has returned to the financial
markets, in an attempt to steer them through the worst recession since the
second world war without hitting a crisis.
Four years of collapsing share and property prices have forced the
administration to switch focus away from its previous gradual progress
towards more open and competitive financial markets.
Now officials, banks, their affiliates and customers are closing ranks,
despite pressure for more deregulation from Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime
minister, who is eager to deflect US frustration at Japan's remaining market
barriers.
The return to old ways is illustrated by a revealing meeting one morning
last November, in one of the typically shabby, grey-painted rooms of Japan's
finance ministry.
Officials had called in senior executives of Japan's life insurance
companies, among the biggest investors in the Tokyo stock market, to explain
the ministry's attitude to the previous day's fall in share prices to nearly
16,000, a new low for the year.
Both sides knew that at that level, Japan's banks start to become worried
that their capital, part of which is in equities, will begin to suffer,
posing a danger of a credit squeeze for the hard-pressed economy. That
afternoon, Nippon Life Insurance, Japan's largest insurer, bought Y10bn of
shares. A day later, the market picked up slightly. Nippon Life insists that
it acted purely on its own decision.
The anecdote shows that the ministry's 'administrative guidance' is as
effective as ever. It is encouraging financial institutions to confront the
problems caused by the financial excesses of the late 1980s, yet the
ministry is also doing all it can behind the scenes to prevent markets
sliding out of control.
The administration's scope to intervene has been made all the stronger by
the erosion of political authority, with the collapse of the Liberal
Democratic Party in last summer's elections and the ensuing political
upheaval. For this reason, Japan's financial markets can expect a longer and
gentler adjustment than did Wall Street after its cataclysm in late 1987.
Banks are accelerating the pace at which they deal with their most pressing
problem: the need to write off a mountain of bad debt. Increased write-offs
will be the main feature in an expected decline in net profits of the 11
leading city banks to Y356bn in the year ending tomorrow, from Y421.1bn in
1993, forecasts SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo.
Yet banks are facing up to non-performing loans only slowly by western
standards. The real extent of the problem, and hence its future impact on
the supply of credit, is hard to measure.
Officially, the 21 leading banks calculated their non-performing loans at
Y13,700bn, at the last count at the end of September.
Yet the definition of a bad loan, one on which no repayments have been made
for six months, is lax by the US standard, under which a debt must be
declared bad the moment the terms of the loan are breached. Under this
tougher US regulation, Japan's bad debt mountain would grow to at least
Y30,000bn. The difference highlights Japanese banks' traditional concern
with helping big corporate customers through bad times.
To make matters worse, the lingering recession and the yen's relentless rise
are adding dud industrial loans to the debts of property developers, or
companies using overvalued property as collateral, which lay at the origin
of the problem.
Worryingly, corporate bankruptcies caused by the recession rose to a record
60.8 per cent of total collapses last year, according to Teikoku Databank, a
private credit bank. In January, the overall number of company collapses
climbed to a seven-year high.
All this cyclical turmoil coincides with an underlying change in Japanese
banks' basic role. 'There is great change going on in the financial system.
. .' says Mr Yasuo Noda, managing director of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Japan's
largest.
'The economy of Japan was built up over the past 40 years by a financial
system dedicated to providing cheap capital for industry. But we cannot
continue in exactly the same way. There has to be a more diversified
formula, to cope with economic change and a more diversified client base,'
he explains.
The main change cited by Mr Noda and his colleagues is an acceleration in
corporate borrowers' tendency to turn away from banks to the bond markets
for funds. Bank loans have dropped over the past decade from just under 85
per cent of corporate borrowing to about 70 per cent, according to Salomon
Brothers Asia. The drop will get faster as companies, under pressure to curb
costs, chase cheaper funds and as Japan's fledgling corporate bond market
develops in response, predicts Salomon.
Banks would dearly love to capture this business. Their appetite is made all
the sharper by a decline in the underlying demand for capital, with
corporate investment set to fall this year for the third year running,
according to the Industrial Bank of Japan.
Yet the government has allowed banks to step into the protected securities
business only gradually, under resistance from Japan's powerful
stockbrokers, still suffering from the plunge in stock market prices.
The 10 trust and long-term credit banks were allowed last April to establish
securities subsidiaries to issue, but not market, convertible and warrant
bonds, and to deal in straight bonds. City banks' subsidiaries will be
allowed to follow next year in what the finance ministry says will be an
'orderly manner to avoid confusion.'
Another change in old values, accelerated by the recession, is the partial
dismantling of the outer fringes of Japan's keiretsu of relationships
between diversified groupings, bound together by cross-shareholdings.
In the past, these were seen to be an important strength of Japanese
industry's competitiveness, helping to bind together banker and corporate
client, and manufacturer and supplier.
They continue to be criticised by the US as a way of keeping foreign
companies out. Yet a growing number of Japanese businesses have come to see
part of their keiretsu links as disposable. That is why Nippon Steel
announced recently that it will sell Y66bn of securities, to help reduce its
operating losses, while Kobe Steel will sell Y31bn.
Yet keiretsu are only weakening at their outer boundaries. The core is
stronger than ever. The big banks which are often at the heart of these
relationships report that they are being asked to offer increasing help for
their leading corporate customers.
Financially unsound companies unfortunate enough not to be linked to a
friendly keiretsu bank soon join the queue of bankruptcies.
That was a lesson of last autumn's collapse of Muramoto Construction, the
largest post-war financial failure, which had failed to cultivate
sufficiently close links with Daiwa Bank, its leading lender.
Japan's biggest stockbrokers, by contrast, appear to be further into their
restructuring than is the banking industry.
The big four brokers, Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities
and Yamaichi Securities, are just starting to see the benefits of the staff
reductions and closures of retail outlets they made in the 1980s.
Reduced costs will be one of the two main features of an expected turnround
by the big four, from a combined loss of Y60.1bn in the year to last March
to a net profit of Y100bn this year, forecasts Mr Mark Faulkner, financial
analyst at SG Warburg Securities.
The other feature is a pick-up in average stock market turnover, from Y250bn
per day to about Y400bn over the same period; comfortably over the Y350bn at
which the big four break even, he says.
However, the legions of second-tier brokers clearly need to cut costs or
reduce their dependence on commission income if they are to be profitable at
the market's present level.
They still need average market turnover of about Y450bn to break even,
estimates Warburg's Mr Faulkner.
One of the few bright spots in Japan's otherwise unsettled financial markets
is the pension fund industry. Fund management is set for strong growth for
the next few decades, thanks to the fact that Japan has the world's fastest
ageing population, in which the proportion of people over 65 will roughly
double to 26 per cent by 2020.
Pension assets, will grow by 50 per cent from their present Dollars 1,600bn
by the end of this decade, forecasts Morgan Stanley Investment Advisory.
About 94 per cent of pension fund assets are managed by the 15 main Japanese
life insurance and trust companies, estimates Morgan Stanley.
Not surprisingly, foreign fund managers, as well as Japanese ones, are
fighting hard to get into this tightly protected market, one of the hottest
areas in the US-Japan trade dispute.
But the government has so far proved resistant to pressure to open the
market to newcomers. The outcome of this dispute will be closely watched as
a test of whether the government is confident enough to switch the focus
back to making the financial markets more competitive.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US long bond yield surges back over 7%
barrier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The yield on the long-dated US Treasury bond surged back over the 7 per cent
barrier yesterday as traders reacted badly to news of an unexpected jump in
consumer confidence.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  15/16 lower
at 90 1/16 . The yield climbed 8 basis points to 7.05 per cent, after
dipping below the 7 per cent level the previous session on a big decline in
oil prices.
On the short end, the two-year note was down  1/8 to 99 7/16 , to yield
5.175 per cent.
Although the day's economic news was unfavourable, analysts linked the sharp
downturn to a broader shift in the market's psychology in recent weeks.
After Monday's half-hearted rally, the session opened on a weak note, with
many retail accounts staying on the sidelines before Friday's employment
data, a keenly watched measure of economic strength. Forecasts centre on a
March increase of 250,000 in non-farm payrolls, a figure which would suggest
a solid recovery from the weather-related slowdown experienced in the
previous two months.
Such a pattern was evident in the Conference Board's latest reading on
consumer confidence. The board's March index came in at 86.7, well ahead of
February's 79.9.
Against the backdrop of last week's interest rate boost and the approach of
Friday's employment data, the news was enough to push prices across the
yield curve moderately lower by midday. As the afternoon progressed the
selling pressure intensified, with few buyers willing to wade into the
market while prices continued to weaken.
UK government bonds fluctuated in fairly light trading yesterday but the
underlying trend remained weak as political concerns and a softer pound kept
investors on the sidelines, traders said.
Further liquidation of positions at the short end of the market kept
downward pressure on gilts, so much so that the market was now discounting
base rates of 6 per cent by the end of this year and 8 per cent by the end
of 1995.
The June contract of the long gilt future on Liffe fell by 1 3/32 point in
the late afternoon to 105 1/4 , down from the day's best level of 107 1/8 .
However, there was some optimism that today's auction of the Bank of
England's first offering of floating-rate notes for 15 years would proceed
smoothly. Traders forecast that the Pounds 2.5bn offering of five-year notes
would be covered by between 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 times. Some traders expected
most of the bids to come in at 99 3/4 , above the Bank's minimum bid price
of 99 1/2 , which would imply a discounted margin of  1/16 below Libid.
Nevertheless, the market's overall weakness weighed on the when-issued price
of the notes which fell from par to around 99.80, traders said.
Italian government bonds failed to build on Monday's gains despite the
accuracy of the election outcome rumours which had propelled the market
higher. 'It has been a classic case of buying on the rumour and selling on
the fact,' said Mr Andre de Silva, a market strategist at Paine- Webber.
The weaker tone of the market also reflected investor concerns about the
ability of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing alliance to form a government.
These doubts have been fanned by the tension between the Northern League of
Mr Umberto Bossi and Mr Gianfranco Fini of the neo-fascist MSI/National
Alliance, Mr de Silva said.
Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson, said Mr
Berlusconi's pro-growth policies could be negative for the long end of the
Italian government bond market.
A loose monetary policy and less restraint on fiscal tightening would make
it difficult to reduce Italy's public sector deficit and would fan
inflation, he said.
The June contract on 10-year Italian government bonds on Liffe stood at
110.30 in late trading, down 1.28 point on the day and well below the day's
best level of 112.75.
German government bonds outperformed other European bond markets, supported
by hopes that the Bundesbank would announce a further cut of up to five
basis points in its repo rate today. The rate fell by eight basis points to
5.80 per cent last week. The June bund future on Liffe eased by 0.23 point
to 95.93 in the late afternoon.
However, some analysts warned that the sharp rise in call money yesterday
due to a month-end liquidity squeeze could make it difficult for the
Bundesbank to engineer a further reduction this week.
Some German credit institutions were thought to have taken advantage of the
Bundesbank's 6.75 per cent Lombard emergency lending facility in order to
cover their minimum reserve requirements.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Steady demand for Deutsche Finance's
DM1bn offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A handful of borrowers braved the international bond market yesterday as
underlying government bond markets remained volatile, keeping plenty of
traditional institutional investors at bay.
Deutsche Finance (Netherlands) launched a DM1bn, five-year deal with a 5.75
per cent coupon. Deutsche Bank, the lead manager, reported good demand from
retail investors in Switzerland, the Benelux countries and Germany, but
admitted activity was slower than usual.
Deutsche Bank said it held the yield spread steady at 25 basis points over
the 5 per cent Treuhand issue. However, the bonds traded outside fees at
99.15-99.20 by late after-noon as the underlying government bond market
tumbled.
Bank Austria, Austria's largest bank, tapped the Eurolira sector of the bond
market with a L170bn deal, hoping to take advantage of favourable swap
opportunities and investor enthusiasm for lira-denominated paper in the wake
of the general election.
The triple-A rated bonds carry an attractively high coupon of 9.125 per cent
and have a 10-year maturity, although they are callable after two years. The
proceeds were swapped into floating rate dollars to give sub-Libor funding.
BCI, one of the joint lead managers, noted that it could take some time for
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia party, to form a new
government.
It added that prospects for lira-denominated paper were favourable, given
that interest rates are expected to fall and there is scope for the lire to
appreciate against other European currencies.
BCI quoted a redemption yield of 9.42 per cent based on a 10-year maturity,
and of 10.19 per cent if the bonds are called after two years.
One syndicate official said the borrower was in the enviable position of
being able to call the bonds if interest rates decline rapidly, allowing
Bank Austria to refinance at more attractive rates.
'Whichever way you look at it, investors are going to lose out - the chance
of seeing capital appreciation is better if they buy longer-dated paper,'
said one official, adding that there is still plenty of Eurolira paper
'sitting around' following the flood of new issues earlier this year. The
bonds traded at 98.35 by late afternoon, within full fees.
The Kingdom of Sweden took advantage of a favourable swap opportunity in the
Dutch guilder sector of the bond market, launching a Fl 400m four-year issue
with a coupon of 5.75 per cent. The borrower obtained funding at about 20
basis points below Libor by swapping into floating rate guilders.
While guilder experts said the deal was sensibly priced, yielding 5.885 per
cent at the re-offer price of 99.53, syndicate officials said it would take
time to sell the issue given market conditions.
Sweden's foreign currency borrowing programme for 1994 is about Dollars
10bn-Dollars 11bn, and in the first three months it has achieved more than
half.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: CBoT finds way to stay in
Globex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chicago Board of Trade said yesterday it would put forward a
counter-proposal designed to allow the exchange to remain a partner in
Globex, the electronic futures trading system jointly developed by the CBoT,
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters.
However, agreement between the various parties seems unlikely, unless the
CBoT is willing to back down on several key issues.
The CBoT board of directors voted on Monday to continue participation in
Globex, 'subject to certain conditions specified by the board'.
A CBoT spokesman declined to elaborate on the board's demands but said that
'it means that we are interested in continuing participation in Globex, if
the CME and Reuters can agree to certain points'.
Earlier this month, the CBoT declined to join a new agreement between
Reuters, the CME and the Matif, the French futures exchange whose products
have been most heavily traded on Globex.
Under the new plan, Reuters releases participating futures exchanges from
some financial obligations and creates a management consortium that gives
any participating exchange an equal voice in the day-to-day running of the
system.
In return, the exchanges make a commitment to 'seamless' trading - starting
Globex trading immediately after the exchange's official close  - and agree
not to use any other electronic trading systems to compete with Globex.
Unless the CBoT's new proposal shows a willingness to budge on these key
issues, a fresh agreement including the CBoT seems impossible.
Ms Ros Wilton, director of Reuters transaction products, said yesterday that
Reuters believed these two issues were 'the main criteria for the success of
Globex'. She added that she looks forward to hearing any proposals by the
CBoT.
Any fresh plan would have to be formulated before April 18, as the CME has
given notice of its intention to drop out of the existing agreement. If that
lapses, the two-year fall-back plan agreed last month would come into force,
without the CBoT's participation.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Captial Markets: SocGen's derivatives boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Societe Generale is preparing to launch a derivative product - known as
Boosts - aimed at investors who expect a period of stability in a particular
market, writes Tracy Corrigan.
Boosts is an acronym for 'Banking on overall stability'. It is designed for
long-term institutional investors, particularly those whose funds are
limited to certain markets, who seek to enhance their returns during periods
of stagnation.
The purchaser of a Boost anticipates that a certain instrument, such as a
government bond, will trade within a certain band for a specific period of
time. Every day the underlying instrument remains in the band, the purchaser
earns Dollars 1 (if the underlying instrument is denominated in dollars).
Thus if a one-year Boost remains in this range throughout its life, the
investor earns Dollars 365 (less the upfront cost of the product). Existing
strategies such as 'straddles', 'strangles' and 'butterflies', all using
options, express a similar view on the market.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: La Rinascente seeks to increase
capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SIMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
La Rinascente, Italy's largest retailing group, plans a substantial capital
increase.
The move has prompted speculation in Milan that La Rinascente, which is
controlled by the Agnelli family's Ifil holding company, is planning to put
in a bid for the Gs supermarkets and Autogrill restaurants, which are being
sold as part of the government's privatisation of the remains of its SME
foods group.
La Rinascente is to raies a total of L48.7bn (Dollars 29.8m) in new capital
through the issue of ordinary shares. The company also plans a L390bn
debenture loan to be co-ordinated by Mediobanca.
La Rinascente, together with the Centromarca foods consortium and FinComit,
the finance arm of Banca Commerciale Italiana, has expressed interest in the
SME concerns.
La Rinascente said group stores increased sales by 10.7 per cent, to
L5,579.4bn, in 1993. Net profits were up from L102.2bn to L105.3bn. It is
lifting its dividend from L190 to L200.
Belleli, the Mantua-based engineering group with a strong presence in the
Middle East, increased group sales to L1,380bn in 1993, compared with
L1,295bn the previous year.
Snia Fibre, the fibres arm of the Fiat group, has won shareholder approval
for a L152.5bn capital increase to tackle heavy restructuring costs. Snia
Fibre incurred a net loss of L49.6bn in 1993, against a loss of L66bn in
1992.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: The costs of quicker settlement
 -SEC share-trade reforms do not suit everyone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although it was six and a half years ago, the repercussions of the stock
market crash of October 1987 are still being felt on Wall Street.
The latest seismic ripple from 1987 comes in the form of a rule proposed by
the Securities and Exchange Commission that will shorten the period in which
investors in the US have to settle their securities transactions.
Currently, after a trade has been executed on US financial markets,
investors have five days to either pay for securities they have bought or
deliver securities they have sold. Under the new rule, the SEC wants to
reduce the settlement period to three days.
The rule - called T+3, for trade day plus three - comes into effect in June
1995, and is designed to reduce risk in the US securities markets by cutting
the number of unsettled trades at any one time. It will also make it harder
for investors to renege on transactions during periods of market volatility,
which is what happened too often during the 1987 crash.
One of the key recommendations made by the Brady Commission which
investigated the 1987 crash was that the settlement period should be
reduced.
Yet, the planned introduction of T+3 has not been welcomed by everyone in
the securities business. Although most firms agree that reducing settlement
risk is a good thing, some are unhappy at the prospect of having to spend
millions of dollars to update their settlement systems to handle T+3.
The smaller, regional brokers feel particularly exposed. The big firms,
which are used to settling institutional transactions electronically, should
find it relatively straightforward, if not necessarily cheap, to adapt their
systems to retail business.
Smaller firms outside the main financial centres, however, do most of their
business with individual investors, and many of their retail trades are
settled only after cheques or securities have been delivered by the US mail,
a notoriously slow and unreliable service.
As one stockbroker at a retail firm explains: 'In most cases, unless the
client has funds in an account with us, there is no way we are going to be
able to send a confirm (trade confirmation slip) out to a client, and get a
cheque back through the mail, and clear it, all within three days.'
Also, when many individual investors buy shares they want the stock
certificates delivered to them, a demand which only complicates and slows
the process further.
The smaller brokerage houses know that if they are to meet the requirements
of T+3, they have either to invest in an electronic trade settlement system
that links the retail customer with the broker, or set up facilities
enabling customers to keep funds permanently on account at the firm.
The problem with the first choice is that there is little chance that such a
system will be developed soon. For it to work, every retail customer would
need access to a computerised network, through which they could transfer
funds and securities to their brokers.
Brokerage houses, therefor, are more likely to take the second route. Many
will do so reluctantly, because they would have to start acting like banks,
keeping clients' funds and securities on deposit and offering bank-style
services such as cheques, electronic funds transfer and cash management
accounts.
Some of the big brokers already offer bank-style services as part of their
asset management business. However, for the smaller firms, setting up the
systems to provide such services would be prohibitively expensive.
Even those firms which could afford to offer clients bank-style services are
not necessarily keen on the idea of having to operate more like banks.
Mr Peter Devine, vice-president of operations and administration at the
brokerage firm Oppenheimer, says: 'The momentum is gathering for brokerage
firms to offer more banking services. Yet, traditionally, brokerage firms
are good at execution services, investment advice and clearance. Banking
services have not been our forte, although I'm not saying we don't have the
expertise to offer them.'
The securities industry is also worried that T+3 will bring more banks into
the broking business. Although banking and stockbroking have been kept
separate in the US by law, a few banks have been allowed to offer customers
brokerage services through separate subsidiaries. With their experience in
deposit-taking, asset-gathering and funds transfer, they could prove
powerful competitors for the broking community.
Any bank keen to develop this business, however, will be closely watched by
industry regulators. While bank deposits are federally insured, money held
in an account at a bank's brokerage subsidiary enjoys no such guarantee -
regulators do not want customers confused about whether their funds are
insured by the government or not.
The brokerage industry's unhappiness was clear when the SEC last year asked
firms to respond in writing to their T+3 proposal. Of the 349 replies, a
clear majority - 248 - was critical of T+3. The SEC, however, believed
reducing settlement risk was worth the disruption to the industry.
Competition is increasing between international markets for stock listings
and order flow, and the volume of cross-border securities transactions is
growing. In the face of these developments, the agency is eager to ensure
the US does not fall behind markets in those countries which settle trades
in less than five days.
Reform of the settlement system is unlikely to stop at T+3. Regulators see
it as only the first step in a process leading to securities transactions
being executed and settled on the same day, as happens in the US government
securities market.
If US brokers are finding it difficult adjusting to T+3, wait until they are
faced with T+0.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Casino defies sector weakness
with rise

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Casino, the French food retailer, last year managed to shrug off the
pressures on the French supermarket sector with a 2.3 per cent increase in
net profits, to FFr451m (Dollars 78.8m), against FFr441m in 1992.
The group, which expanded dramatically in 1992 with the acquisition of the
Rallye hypermarket chain, has since been rationalising its interests by
selling peripheral businesses and reorganising core food retailing
busi-ness.
Mr Antoine Guichard, chairman, said its French stores had been affected by
the recession, which had triggered a price-cutting battle in the supermarket
sector. However, he said Casino was making progress with its expansion plans
in the US and Mexico.
Turnover rose 2.7 per cent to FFr72.52bn, with operating profits increasing
by 12.8 per cent to FFr1.27bn.
However, the increase in net profits was constrained by a sharp reduction in
exceptional profits, which fell to FFr9m from FFr94m in 1992. Earnings per
share rose 24.5 per cent to FFr6.61.
Casino plans this year to limit capital spending to FFr1.85bn, against
FFr2.19bn last time.
The group's main initiative is an experiment with 'AS des Prix', a new
discounting concept being tested in the Lyon area. If successful, it will be
adopted over the next two years by all Super Rallye stores.

Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, aims to boost its
operations in Latin America, the fastest growing market for personal
computer software.
The company will open a regional office in Miami, and double the number of
employees dedicated to marketing and support of Microsoft products in Latin
America.
Microsoft's sales there rose 174 per cent last year, making it the fastest
growing market for the company, said Orlando Ayala, senior director of Latin
American operations.
Microsoft plans to establish manufacturing partnerships in Brazil and Mexico
in May. This will allow it to produce products locally for these and
neighbouring countries.
By increasing the level of product support to customers, Microsoft's moves
may help to combat rampant software piracy in Latin America. According to
data released this week by the Software Publishers Association, Latin
American countries have some of the highest rates of software piracy in the
world.
Illegal copies of PC software represent 89 per cent of software in use in
Brazil, 82 per cent in Mexico, and 95 per cent in other Latin American
countries, the industry group said.
Microsoft also announced management changes in its European operations, in
line with its recent re-organisation of worldwide marketing. Regional
executives have been reassigned to reflect the increasing segmentation of
the software market into corporate, individual and computer industry
customers.
The company is also focusing more on the emerging central European market,
where it sees potential for sales of Dollars 1bn over the next few years.
Microsoft employs more than 2,500 people in Europe, where its retail sales
were Dollars 1.2bn in fiscal year 1993, up 26 per cent over the previous
year.

Strong performances in banking and life insurance helped Internationale
Nederlanden Group, the Dutch financial services group, to lift 1993 net
profit by 10.9 per cent to Fl 2.03bn (Dollars 1.07bn).
Pre-tax profits showed an even sharper rise of 18 per cent to Fl 2.82bn. But
a 39 per cent increase in ING's tax bill - reflecting increased earnings in
Japan and the US and the absence of the previous year's tax windfalls in
Canada and Australia - accounted for the slower rate of increase in net
profit.
ING is to raise its dividend to Fl 3.50 from Fl 3.19 in 1992.
ING also announced it was launching a Fl 1bn bond issue. Mr Aad Jacobs,
chairman, said Fl 700m of the proceeds would be used to strengthen the
shareholders' equity of its banking subsidiary, ING Bank, and fuel its
growth. The bank has expanded rapidly in eastern Europe and Asia Pacific.
The rest of the proceeds would be held in reserve.
Banking results showed a strong improvement virtually across the board last
year, with pre-tax profits up 27.3 per cent at Fl 1.34bn.
ING cited the favourable development of interest rates and its continued
successes in emerging markets.

<TEXT>
Amdahl, the US mainframe computer company, plans to offer high-performance
database systems based on massively-parallel processor (MPP) supercomputers.
Its announcement yesterday pre-empts the expected introduction of similar
products by IBM.
Amdahl has formed an alliance with nCube, a US manufacturer of MPP
computers; Oracle, the leading database software company; and Information
Builders, a software company that specialises in linking different types of
computers on networks.
Amdahl, which has been struggling to keep pace with rapidly falling prices
for its mainframe computers, sees the alliance as an opportunity to broaden
its market.
MPPs achieve very high processing speeds at low cost by linking thousands of
microprocessor chips, similar to those used in personal computers, to work
together in parallel. Most MPPs have been used in scientific and technical
applications.
However, IBM is expected next week to announce an MPP system aimed at the
commercial market. Amdahl and its new partners said they too would enter
this field within the next few months.
Applications include systems requiring quick access to a lot of information.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: SA's Anglo plans to unbundle JCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo American, South Africa's largest mining and financial group, is to
unbundle Johannesburg Consolidated Investment, an associate mining house
with a market capitalisation of R13bn (Dollars 371m), in a move which could
give black business a significant stake in the country's mining and
industrial sectors.
JCI said that it envisioned one company holding the group's platinum
interests, which include Rustenburg Platinum Holdings, the world's largest
producer.
A second company will be formed to hold JCI's other mining and minerals
interests, which include gold, coal, diamonds and base metals. JCI controls
several large gold mines in South Africa. It also has an interest in diamond
group De Beers Consolidated.
The third group will include JCI's industrial interests, including shares in
food group Premier and UK-based catalyst producer Johnson Matthey.
JCI said it would list the shares in all three companies separately. 'Key
objectives of the exercise include enhanced share value and the creation of
a platform for the future introduction of black business interests into
South Africa's mining and industrial sectors,' the group said.
'Anglo and JCI are strongly of the opinion that black South Africans should
be given every encouragement to participate meaningfully in mining and
industrial finance groups,' it added.
The flotation of the mining and industrial interests could prove a platform
for the black community's involvement in those sectors.
It is understood that overseas or local institutions could invest in more
than one black business consortium, which would acquire control of JCI's
mining and industrial interests. Anglo, meanwhile, would retain the group's
platinum mining and diamond trading operations.
Companies in the Anglo fold have recently been in the forefront of moves to
widen black business ownership. Last month, Southern Life, the group's
listed life assurer, disposed of its insurance subsidiary African Life to a
consortium of black businessmen in a R160m (Dollars 38m) transaction.

New World Development, the Hong Kong property, hotels and infrastructure
group, yesterday reported a 37 per cent rise in after-tax earnings to
HKDollars 1.9bn (USDollars 245m) from HKDollars 1.39bn in the six months to
the end of December.
Profits were struck on a 41 per cent growth in turnover to HKDollars 8.37bn
from HKDollars 5.94bn, with most of the earnings growth coming from a strong
performance by the hotels division. Earnings from rents and property sales
were flat, while those for construction and piling were slightly down on the
same period a year ago.
Earnings per share advanced 34 per cent to HKDollars 1.21. Directors
declared an interim dividend of 28 cents, 12 per cent up on a year ago.
Directors sought to underline the importance of its activities in China.
They said the company would maintain between 20 and 25 per cent of its net
assets in mainland investments.
Pre-tax profits from hotel interests rose 51 per cent to HKDollars 401.2m.
The company said it had cut its stake in Asia Television from 47.5 to 27.5
per cent.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Chemical compound that spells
trouble - Japan's petrochemical groups face falling demand and rising costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Japan's petrochemicals companies close their books for the 1993
financial year tomorrow they will make sorry reading. The country's 12
largest makers of ethylene, the basic building block for plastics, are
expected to post combined losses of Y51.6bn (Dollars 493m) for the year to
the end of March.
Like much of Japanese heavy industry, the sector, one of Japan's most
important manufacturing industries with sales of more than Y6,000bn, is
being plagued by poor domestic demand and high costs, as well as wilting
exports caused by the high yen and increasing Asian competition.
The question is whether Japanese petrochemicals manufacturers' problems have
been caused merely by the longest and deepest recession since the second
world war, or whether a secular change is occurring which threatens their
long-term viability.
In the short term, the industry's problems are severe enough. The sector is
haemorrhaging red ink. 'Almost every Japanese plastics manufacturer is
losing money at the moment,' says Mr Yukio Murakami, director of Chem
Systems Japan, the specialist consultants.
The reason for the plunge in profitability is simple, explains Mr Hiromasa
Yonekura, director of basic chemicals at Sumitomo Chemical, one of Japan's
largest plastics makers. 'Demand is falling at the same time that supply is
increasing.'
Demand for various grades of plastic was down between 5 per cent and 10 per
cent last year and is expected to fall 7 per cent this year, according to Mr
Yonekura. The sector's largest customers - the automotive, electronics and
construction industries - are all suffering from the recession.
The drop in demand would be bad enough on its own, but the industry
compounded its misery by increasing capacity.
'During the late 1980s we were making record profits for about five years.
Everybody expected that to continue. All the companies made the same mistake
of adding capacity simultaneously,' says Mr Yonekura.
As a result, ethylene capacity increased from 4.7m tonnes a year in 1987 to
7m tonnes this year, when demand is expected to be only 5.8m tonnes.
The industry is still inflicting additional wounds, adding yet more capacity
this year. Mitsubishi is commissioning a new plant, adding 300,000 tonnes a
year. A massive 700,000 tonnes a year complex, built by Maruzen, Mitsui
Petrochemical and Sumitomo Chemical, has just been completed and is
scheduled to come on stream later this year.
Not surprisingly, given the imbalance between supply and demand, plastics
prices have tumbled. The price of styrene monomer, used to make polystyrene,
has fallen from a peak in 1992 of Y120 per kg to only Y60. Mitsubishi
Petrochemical says Japanese domestic prices are so low that the company is
incapable of making money at the moment.
Although domestic demand is dire, Japanese petrochemicals companies have
been unable to export their way out of trouble. The groups are handicapped
by high costs compared with international competitors.
In any case, international prices are so low that Japanese manufacturers are
exporting below fixed costs at the moment, says Mr Murakami. The
appreciation of the yen has exacerbated the Japanese companies' problems.
One bright spot is that the rise in the yen has not been followed by an
increase in imports.
Most Japanese petrochemicals manufacturers acknowledge the existance of a
secular shift in demand from the domestic market to the rest of Asia. 'Our
customers, such as the Japanese automotive and electronics companies, are
migrating to low-cost manufacturing sites overseas. We will have to follow,'
says Mr Yonekura. Chem Systems estimates plastics demand in east Asia,
excluding Japan, will increase by 7.8 per cent a year until the end of the
decade.
The migration has already begun. Sumitomo has set up a joint venture in
Singapore with Shell to manufacture polypropylene and low-density
polyethylene. Mitsubishi Petrochemical is building a styrene monomer plant
at the same site. Idemitsu has a joint venture with BP Chemicals and
Petronas of Malaysia to manufacture polyethylene in Malaysia, and Showa
Denko and Marubeni have combined to set up a polyethylene plant in
Indonesia.
'The future of the Japanese industry is outside Japan,' says Mr Yonekura.
'We can take advantage of the high value of the yen to invest elsewhere.
And, in spite of the red ink, we can always borrow whatever we need.'
But although Japanese manufacturers believe their long-term future is
outside Japan, they are unwilling to face up to the inevitable decline of
their domestic market. Faced by massive domestic losses, Japanese plastics
makers have been implementing stop-gap measures to reduce the damage. Plants
have been moth-balled, maintenance periods extended and plans for new plants
shelved. Just-in-time delivery is being abandoned. The number of grades
being offered to clients has also been cut.
But such fiddling does not deal with the root cause of the sector's
difficulties. Capacity is still not being cut. Historically, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry intervened at such moments to encourage
consolidation. In the early 1980s, it co-ordinated a 36 per cent cut in
capacity. However, this time Miti is unwilling to adopt such a role, at
least in part because of US complaints about its interference.
Without the guiding hand of the Miti, little rationalisation has occurred.
'The industry understands the problem. It understands the solution. The
problem is doing anything about it,' says Mr Murakami.
Admittedly, a few companies, such as Idemitsu Petrochemical, Showa Denko and
Asahi Chemicals, are setting up joint ventures to pool their resources. Two
large groups, Mitsubishi Petrochemical and Mitsubishi Kasei, have announced
they will merge, forming Japan's biggest petrochemicals manufacturer.
However, industry observers question the benefits of the move. 'Mergers are
all very well, but they're only really of use if you then cut staff. But
Japanese companies are still reluctant to do that,' says Mr Murakami.

six months

Hopewell Holdings, the Hong Kong property and construction group controlled
by Mr Gordon Wu, yesterday announced an 83 per cent leap in profits to
HKDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 194m) for the six months to December 31, up from
HKDollars 843.5m in the same period the previous year, due to an exceptional
item which yielded 73 per cent of earnings.
Earnings at the operating level slipped 8 per cent to HKDollars 358.9m,
reflecting the role played by November's HKDollars 1.2bn spin-off of
Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA), a vehicle incorporating Hopewell's
power stations.
The results put Mr Wu on track to reach the doubling of full-year earnings
that he forecast in November. This would require profits in the full year to
reach HKDollars 4bn.
However, if achieved it will be on the back of certain reversals in
strategy, including the proposed sell-off of the remaining 51 per cent of a
44-storey residential tower block and car park in Happy Valley. This is
likely to yield profits around HKDollars 850m, according to early estimates.
CEPA itself turned in net profits of HKDollars 20.5m, which according to
Hopewell calculations equates to HKDollars 101.7m on a pro-forma combined
basis, and compares with HKDollars 60.8m in 1992. The company did not
undertake any business until November 1993.
Hopewell also benefited from a sharply lower tax bill in 1993, at HKDollars
63.2m compared with HKDollars 85.6m in the previous interim. The Hong Kong
profits tax levy was slashed to less than one third of the 1992 interim
bill, partly due to the 1 per cent cut in profits tax.
Earnings per share rose to 80 per cent to 36 cents from 20 cents in 1992.
Directors are proposing an 18 cent dividend, up from 16 cents.

after-tax profits of ADollars 266m, (USDollars 189m) up from ADollars 181.2m
in 1992, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
However, the improvement was due to a ADollars 88.3m income tax credit, and
pre-tax operating profits slipped from ADollars 296.7m to ADollars 267.4m.
Most sectors showed an improved performance, with the core upstream oil and
natural gas division making ADollars 184.2m after tax but before allocation
of financing costs, compared with ADollars 140m a year ago.

over year

<TEXT>
Maruti Udyog, India's biggest carmaker and a flagship industrial enterprise,
yesterday reported a 31.5 per cent increase in sales to Rs22.22bn (Dollars
708m) for the past 12 months, due to a sharp recovery in demand after two
years of recession.
Maruti, a joint venture between the Indian government and Suzuki Motor of
Japan, estimated pre-tax profits to have trebled to Rs1.36bn as the sales
increase brought down unit production costs. The company has produced
158,000 vehicles in the year, mainly 800cc compacts based on a Suzuki model
of the early 1980s.
Maruti's performance highlights a steady recovery in Indian industry since
last summer, particularly among makers of consumer goods.
Carmakers have benefited from cuts in excise taxes and other government
measures to boost industrial growth taken in the 1993-94 and 1994-95
budgets.
Mr RC Bhargava, Maruti's chairman, said he was convinced that the company
wasset for sustained growth in sales 'in view of what we have seen in the
last two budgets'.
Maruti expects to produce at least 181,000 cars in the next 12 months,
including 13,900 vehicles of a new model called Zen, a modern compact, which
will also be exported to western Europe.
The company says it will complete by September a Rs7bn expansion of its
assembly plant near Delhi to increase capacity by 70,000 cars a year.
Maruti exported 17,200 cars in the year just ending, mainly to western
Europe, up from 14,600, and plans to export 23,000 in 1994-95, including Zen
vehicles.

New World Development, the Hong Kong property, hotels and infrastructure
group, yesterday reported a 37 per cent rise in after-tax earnings to
HKDollars 1.9bn (USDollars 245m) from HKDollars 1.39bn in the six months to
the end of December.
Profits were struck on a 41 per cent growth in turnover to HKDollars 8.37bn
from HKDollars 5.94bn, with most of the earnings growth coming from a strong
performance by the hotels division. Earnings from rents and property sales
were flat, while those for construction and piling were slightly down on the
same period a year ago.
Earnings per share advanced 34 per cent to HKDollars 1.21. Directors
declared an interim dividend of 28 cents, 12 per cent up on a year ago.
The company added its voice to the growing number of Hong Kong property
developers seeking to allay fears about the colony's property market. It
said that it remained confident that the property market in Hong Kong would
continue to experience 'healthy growth' over the coming years.
New World directors sought to underline the importance of its activities in
China. They said that the company would maintain between 20 and 25 per cent
of its net assets in mainland investments, with infrastructure and property
development constituting the main focus.
Pre-tax profits from hotel interests rose 51 per cent to HKDollars 401.2m.
The company said that New World Hotels would open a hotel in Manila this
summer and one in Saigon in later. In the past six months it has signed
management contracts for four hotels in China.
The group's other hotel operation, Ramada International Hotels and Resort,
has been undergoing a reorganisation aimed at improving efficiency. A new
division has been created to manage Ramada's growing interests in the US.
The company said that it had cut its stake in Asia Television from 47.5 per
cent to 27.5 per cent. It gave no details of the price.
Sumitomo Realty &amp; Development, Japan's third largest property developer,
said it would post a Y48bn (Dollars 458m) extraordinary loss in the year to
end-March after a wholly-owned subsidiary, Sumitomo Fudosan Finance, writes
off Y56bn of bad loans, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Sumitomo Realty will make up for some of the loss by selling facilities in
Kyoto for Y38.4bn it said.

Bow Valley Energy, the Calgary-based oil and gas producer, said yesterday
British Gas was reviewing its 53 per cent stake in the company.
British Gas played down the announcement, saying the exercise is part of an
overall review of its international operations. However, Bow Valley said it
had supplied confidential information on its operations to not only to
Britis Gas, but also to unspecified third parties.
Bow Valley said British Gas had made no decision as to whether to dispose of
its investment, which at current market prices, is worth about CDollars 580m
(USDollars 433m).
Mr Duncan Mathieson, analyst at Wood Gundy in Toronto, said a management
shake-up over the past two years had given Bow Valley 'good focus and good
direction'.
The company, whose operations are centred on western Canada, the North Sea
and Indonesia, posted net earnings of CDollars 7.4m last year on revenues of
CDollars 243m. It produces about 24,000 barrels of oil and 162m cubic feet
of gas a day.

Hearst Corp and Capital Cities/ABC have agreed to purchase Viacom's

reports from New York.
Hearst and Capital Cities, which currently each own one-third interests in
the cable network, will each own half interests upon completion of the deal.
Viacom said that it made the sale because 'a minority interest in the
network does not fit into our strategic objectives'.
Lifetime is available on more than 5,800 cable systems, serving nearly 59m

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Northrop criticises Grumman
timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A timetable proposed by Grumman for a rapid auction of the company has been
sharply criticised by Northrop, one of two companies which have launched
offers for the defence manufacturer.
Grumman, which became a bid target earlier this month, called on Monday for
Northrop and rival bidder Martin Marietta to submit their best bids for the
company by 5pm on Thursday - a remarkably short takeover timetable by normal
US standards. Grumman said this would prevent disruption to its business.
However, Northrop, which has the higher of the two bids on the table,
complained that Grumman was in essence proposing that Northrop bid against
itself.
Grumman agreed on March 7 to a friendly Dollars 1.9bn, or Dollars 55 a
share, bid from Martin Marietta. However, Northrop, with which Grumman had
held secret takeover talks, which ended in January, then launched a hostile
Dollars 60-a-share bid, worth Dollars 2.04bn.
In a letter to Grumman, Mr Kent Kresa, Northrop chairman, said the proposed
timetable continued an 'unlevel playing field'.
Northrop, he said, still faced a Dollars 50m 'lock-up' fee, which Grumman
has agreed to pay Martin Marietta if another bidder wins control of Grumman.
Further, since Northrop had the higher bid on the table, it was 'being asked
to bid against a purely hypothetical price increase from Martin Marietta
without any notice or knowledge of whether such an increase is in fact
submitted'.
Mr Kresa said while Grumman's board spoke of wanting 'free and open
competitive bidding,' the proposed process was not open: 'It is not in the
best interests of Grumman's stockholders to prematurely cut off potential
bidding and potentially deprive stockholders of the opportunity to receive
the maximum value for their shares.'
Lockheed Aeronautical Systems, a division of Lockheed, said it plans to
eliminate more than 2,000 jobs by the end of 1995, Reuter reports.
The company said the job cuts would result from the pending completion of
the P-3 aircraft programme and transition from producing the C-130H
airlifter to the new generation C-130J.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Moscow Narodny back in black
with Pounds 43.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moscow Narodny, the London- based trade and project finance bank, made a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 43.6m (Dollars 63.65m) in 1993 after two years of
significant pre-tax losses, culminating in losses of Pounds 316.1m in 1992.
The bank said the turnround came from two sources. Its operating income rose
11 per cent to Pounds 30.9m from Pounds 27.9m, and it was also able to
release some Pounds 26m in provisions, as a result of selling debt - mainly
sovereign debt - at above net book value. It had not, however, altered its
provisioning for former Soviet Union debt.
The bank still has an accumulated deficit of Pounds 347.3m and is not
proposing to pay a dividend. It last paid a dividend in 1988.
Moscow Narodny is owned by Russian institutions, principally the Central
Bank of Russia, but is licensed and supervised by the Bank of England. Its
annual meeting is today.
Last year also saw the first significant growth in total assets - to Pounds
952.4m from Pounds 884.9m - after a period in which MNB had had to be
prudent and reduce its exposure to the former Soviet Union.

Coors Brewing Company, the US beer producer, is acquiring a brewery in
Zaragoza from El Aguila, Spain's second-ranked brewer, to serve as its
European export base.
The purchase, part of an initial Pta7bn (Dollars 51m) investment in Spain,
gives Memphis-based Coors its first manufacturing base in Europe.
Under the agreement, Coors will continue to produce El Aguila brands at the
Zaragoza plant over a four-year period and will gradually introduce its own
product, Coors Extra Gold, for the Spanish and the European markets.
The sale of the plant relieves El Aguila, 51 per cent owned by Holland's
Heineken group, of a considerable burden and represents the virtual
completion of a lengthy rationalisation process.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Pirelli plans to raise L1,000bn
for expansion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables group which has completed a two-year
restructuring, yesterday announced plans for L1,000bn (Dollars 611m) of new
funding aimed partly at a relaunch of its core products on international
markets.
The holding company is to raise the money through a debenture loan for 1994
to 1998, convertible into ordinary shares, at a price between L2,000 and
L3,000. It will use the proceeds to expand activities and finance new
products.
The funding will also allow it to participate in the recapitalisation of its
Amsterdam-based offshoot, the quoted Pirelli Tyre Holding (PTH).
PTH plans a share capital increase through the issue of slightly over 31m
new shares valued at Fl 10 each. Shareholders will be offered one new share
for every three owned, at a discount to be determined at the general meeting
in May. The issue is expected to raise Fl 500m, with a further Fl 150m
coming from warrants reserved for minority shareholders.
The holding company's board will also recommend, for the sake of operating
flexibility, that authorisation should be given for further capital
increases up to L500bn as necessary.
Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, managing director, said the group expected to
return to net profit in 1994.
The 1993 net loss, which springs from restructuring costs and will be
revealed next month, will be below the L154bn deficit posted in 1992.
Consolidated sales rose 12 per cent in 1993 to L9,210bn while the group's
net profits before extraordinary items is estimated at tens of billions of
lire, compared with a L93bn loss in 1992. Net debt diminished by about 20
per cent to L2,128bn.

Moscow Narodny, the London-based trade and project finance bank, made a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 43.6m (Dollars 63.65m) in 1993 after two years of

Moscow Narodny is owned by Russian institutions, principally the Central
Bank of Russia, but is licensed and supervised by the Bank of England. Its
annual meeting is today.
Mr Derek Farmer, general manager, said the results showed a return to
stability, and that the bank was well-placed to move forward after the
consolidation of the last couple of years.
Last year also saw the first significant growth in total assets - to Pounds
952.4m from Pounds 884.9m - after a period in which MNB had had to be
prudent and reduce its exposure to the former Soviet Union.
Mr Farmer said the bank saw opportunities to take advantage of the market in
Asia and the Pacific Rim from its branch in Singapore.
Mr A. Semikoz, the bank's chairman, said in the annual report the bank would
make it a priority in 1994 to use its skills and experience to assist banks
throughout the Russian federation to widen their international banking
ability.
Moscow Narodny has correspondent relationships with 173 banks in the former
Soviet Union, most of them in Russia.

Strong performances in banking and life insurance helped Internationale
Nederlanden Group, the Dutch financial services group, to lift 1993 net
profit by 10.9 per cent to Fl 2.03bn (Dollars 1.07bn)
Pre-tax profits showed an even sharper rise of 18 per cent to Fl 2.82bn. But
a 39 per cent increase in ING's tax bill - reflecting increased earnings in
Japan and the US and the absence of the previous year's tax windfalls in
Canada and Australia - accounted for the slower rate of increase in net
profit.
ING is to raise its dividend to Fl 3.50 from Fl 3.19 in 1992.
ING also announced it was launching a Fl 1bn bond issue. Mr Aad Jacobs,
chairman, said Fl 700m of the proceeds would be used to strengthen the
shareholders' equity of its banking subsidiary, ING Bank, and fuel its
growth. The bank has expanded rapidly in eastern Europe and Asia Pacific.
The rest of the proceeds would be held in reserve.
Banking results showed a strong improvement virtually across the board last
year, with pre-tax profits up 27.3 per cent at Fl 1.34bn. ING cited the
favourable development of interest rates and its continued successes in
emerging markets.
In insurance, ING profited from the deconsolidation its Orion non-life
subsidiary in the UK, which had been a drag on the sector. Overall, pre-tax
results in insurance rose by 11 per cent to Fl 1.53bn.

sale by end of 1995

<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French banking group, could be ready for
privatisation by the end of next year, according to Mr Jean Peyrelevade,
chairman.
'We should be able to think about privatisation towards the end of 1995, but
first the bank needs to be put on a profitable footing,' said Mr
Peyrelevade, who last week announced details of an emergency FFr44.9bn
(Dollars 7.8bn) financial rescue package for Credit Lyonnais and also
disclosed that the group last year made a FFr6.9bn net loss.
The French government's rationale for backing the rescue, which includes a
FFr4.9bn cash injection from the state and other shareholders together with
the transfer of FFr40bn of property loans to a new company, was to prepare
Credit Lyonnais for privatisation. But the scale of the restructuring has
sparked a political row.
A number of politicians have already called for an official inquiry into the
management of Credit Lyonnais, including Mr Francois d'Aube, a conservative
who wrote a controversial book on the bank entitled Argent Sale, or Dirty
Money.
The French government last night declined to comment on speculation that Mr
Jean-Yves Haberer, who chaired Credit Lyonnais from 1988 to last November,
was to be dismissed from his new post as chairman of Credit National, a
smaller state-controlled banking group.
Mr Haberer, who orchestrated an aggressive policy of international expansion
and lending at Credit Lyonnais, has been widely blamed for the bank's
problems.
He issued a statement yesterday calling for an inquiry into the management
of Credit Lyonnais and claimed that he had been subjected to 'a real media
lynching' over his role.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Munk puts his faith in a
property revival at Trizec - The background to Horsham's CDollars 600m
investment in the Canadian group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Munk makes a habit of doing business with panache. The
Hungarian-born Canadian runs his companies from a stylish townhouse in a
Toronto neighbourhood better known for expensive shops and restaurants than
corporate head offices.
Each winter, however, he manages to mix business with pleasure by setting up
an office in the Swiss ski resort of Klosters.
Munk's eye for the unorthodox was again in evidence this week with a
conditional offer by Horsham, his main holding company, to invest CDollars
600m (USDollars 447.7m) in Trizec, one of North America's biggest office and
shopping-mall developers. Horsham would end up with a 43 per cent
controlling stake.
Trizec is by no means an obvious takeover candidate. Crippled by the long
slump in North American property, the Calgary-based company is conducting
tough negotiations to restructure part of its CDollars 4.8bn debt.
Even as the agreement with Horsham was announced on Monday, a group of
unpaid senior debenture holders reaffirmed their determination to seize
their security. A court hearing is scheduled for tomorrow.
The threat posed by the disgruntled creditors to Trizec's survival appears
to have motivated the developer's approach to Horsham last January.
According to Ms Leanne Baker, analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York,
Horsham's investment is 'not simply a positive call on a sector, but
represents an opportunistic acquisition made possible by a singularly
distressed company'.
A similar description might apply to several of Mr Munk's deals over the
past two decades. A few have soured, but enough have succeeded to make Peter
Munk and his companies a force to be reckoned with.
It was only a decade ago that prominent Canadian securities dealers shied
away from helping Mr Munk raise money for an ailing gold and energy producer
he had recently acquired. That company, American Barrick Resources, now has
a market capitalisation of CDollars 10.2bn, making it the third most
valuable company listed on the Toronto stock exchange.
Horsham has a 20 per cent stake in Barrick, whose fast-rising earnings from
the Goldstrike mine in Nevada have made it the jewel in Mr Munk's crown.
Barrick contributed USDollars 41.5m to Horsham last year, which was more
than the parent company's total earnings of Dollars 40.1m.
Horsham's other significant investment is a 100 per cent interest in Clark
Refining and Marketing, an oil refiner and distributor based in St Louis,
Missouri.
Clark has had an up-and-down history since Horsham bought control in 1988.
It posted a small profit last year, with slim refining margins offset by a
management shake-up and tight cost controls.
Clark is on the verge of an expansion. It is in talks to buy a 177,000
barrels per day refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, from Chevron. The refinery,
expected to cost USDollars 150m-Dollars 200m, will more than double Clark's
capacity and substantially extend its operating area.
Mr Todd Bergman, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said recently the refinery 'will
increase Clark's refining exposure at a very low incremental cost.' He
predicts that Horsham's earnings will jump to 70 cents a share this year
from 42 cents in 1993, due partly to higher refining margins and
productivity improvements at Clark.
An attempt by Horsham to spin off part of its stake in Clark to the public
was aborted last year when market conditions suddenly deteriorated. But a
public offering is still in the wings, and could be imminent.
The planned investment in Trizec would not be Mr Munk's first foray into
property. During the 1970s, he invested in a chain of South Pacific hotels,
and came close to building a resort in the shadow of the Pyramids in Egypt.
Horsham recently bought 600 acres of farmland on the outskirts of Berlin
which it is developing into a business park. The project is now
self-financing, but the downturn in the German economy has been a
disappointment.
Like many of his other deals, the proposed stake in Trizec is a long-term
bet. Property markets in several North American cities have shown signs of
life recently. If Trizec can stave off its creditors, it would be an obvious
beneficiary of any sustained improvement.
Should the investment in Trizec prove to be a dud, Mr Munk will at least
have the excuse that some high-powered names backed his instincts.
Horsham has an unusually star-studded board of directors, including Mr
Karl-Otto Pohl, former president of the German Bundesbank, and Mr Brian
Mulroney, the former Canadian prime minister.
They appear to share Mr Munk's confidence that a full recovery in North
American real estate, and in Trizec's fortunes, is just a matter of time.
