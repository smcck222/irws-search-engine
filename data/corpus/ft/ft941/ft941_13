Pharmacia yesterday reported pro-forma operating income of SKr3.66bn
(Dollars 463m) for 1993, the group's first full-year figures since being
demerged from the Procordia group and acquiring Italian pharmaceuticals
concern Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Fice).
The Swedish pharmaceuticals and biotechnology company, one of the world's
top 20 drugs companies, said the result was a 43 per cent improvement on
operating income of SKr2.55bn in 1992. Pro-forma sales expanded to
SKr27.4bn, up 22 per cent from SKr22.4bn.
The group said the upturn was due almost entirely to currency movements.
Volumes grew only a 'modest 1 per cent or 2 per cent,' according to Mr Jan
Blomberg, executive vice-president, because of difficult conditions in
important markets.
The group's B shares fell SKr4 to close at SKr129.
The state is planning to sell its 45 per cent stake in Pharmacia in May or
June in a move which would raise some SKr16bn at current values. Exact
timing of the offer will depend on whether Sweden decides to hold a
referendum on membership of the European Union in June.
In local currency terms, sales were 18 per cent higher in Japan, the group's
largest market, and there were small increases in Italy, France and the UK.
However, the group suffered a setback in the US, its second largest market,
where local currency sales were down 10 per cent and in Spain and Germany,
where they were 9 per cent lower.
Pharmacia said the contribution from Fice was better than it expected when
it acquired the company last May.
The Italian unit's pro-forma operating income in 1993 rose to SKr1.07bn from
SKr580m on revenues which were 23 per cent higher at SKr8.63bn.
The company is proposing a SKr2.20 per share dividend. It believes
conditions in many markets will continue to be difficult this year because
of government clampdowns on healthcare spending. But it expects profits to
improve due to cost cutting.

<TEXT>
Paribas, the French banking group, plans to raise FFr4.1bn (Dollars 695m)
through a one-for-nine rights issue at FFr400 a share, Reuter reports from
Paris.
The group is to pay an unchanged net dividend of FFr12 per share for 1993
and will grant one bonus share for every 10 shares held. New shares acquired
in its rights issue will qualify for the bonus share, Paribas said.
Last month, Paribas said estimated net profits for 1993 had increased by 58
per cent to FFr1.4bn.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, said the group had benefited from a very good
performance in market trading, where it made strong gains during this
summer's European currency crisis. It fared well in its North American and
Asian banking activities.
He forecast a further profit increase for this year saying Paribas should
continue the improvement during 1994.
Paribas estimated total operating income at FFr33.3bn, against FFr29bn in
1992 with gross operating income rising to FFr13.5bn from FFr11.3bn.
However, it was forced to make FFr9.2bn of new net provisions - against
FFr7.7bn in 1992 - partly due to the problems of the French property market.

<TEXT>
Anheuser-Busch and Kirin, respectively the biggest beer makers in the US and
Japan, have reached a deal that will bring Anheuser-Busch's new iced beer to
Japan under the name of Kirin Ice Beer.
The move marks a strengthening of the relationship between the two companies
following their decision last year to create a joint venture called
Budweiser Japan.
Anheuser-Busch's ice-brewing process involves passing the beer through a
special ice chamber where ice crystals are formed and keeping it in
ultra-cold storage for several days.
Kirin Ice Beer will be brewed at Anheuser-Busch's Los Angeles brewery using
a recipe adjusted to Japanese tastes, and will be packed in cans made by
Anheuser-Busch's Metal Container subsidiary in Windsor, Colorado. It will be
launched at the end of May.
Anheuser-Busch and Kirin, which recently exchanged token equity stakes of
about Y500m (Dollars 4.6m) are planning further co-operation in beer
production and material procurement.
Kirin aims to lower its production costs by gradually shifting beer
production and beer can supply to Anheuser in the US. The two companies plan
to co-operate in procuring wheat and other materials, and in looking for new
business opportunities in Asia.
Other Japanese beer companies, faced with high production costs and
competition from cheaper imports, are expected to reach similar deals with
foreign beer makers.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Heineken shrugs off European
sales drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Heineken, the Dutch brewer, shrugged off declining beer consumption in
Europe, its most important market, to post a 12 per cent increase in net
profit before extraordinary items in 1993.
Net profit rose to Fl 519m (Dollars 270m) before extraordinaries from Fl
463m in 1992, on turnover up 1.2 per cent at Fl 9.05bn.
If extraordinary items are included, total net profit fell because Heineken
booked a one-off extraordinary gain of Fl 101m on a Singapore land sale in
1992 but it showed no extraordinary gains in 1993.
Although the world beer market stagnated last year and Europe suffered a 5
per cent decline in consumption, the Dutch brewer managed to post higher
profits on normal business operations because of the relatively stronger
performance of its higher-margin premium beers and the effects of its
continuing cost-cutting measures.
Another factor in the rise was the drop in interest charges to Fl 2m from Fl
34m a year earlier, reflecting the company's high net cash flow.
In Europe, which accounts for about 75 per cent of Heineken's sales,
turnover fell by an unspecified amount but the rate of decline was below the
market's 5 per cent contraction, enabling the company to bolster its overall
market share. European beer consumption was hit by bad summer weather and by
the adverse economic climate.
The company, whose flagship Heineken brand is the best-selling imported beer
in the US, said exports to the US rose 'significantly' last year, as did
sales in China, Hong Kong and Vietnam.
Heineken, which is to pay an unchanged 1993 dividend of Fl 3.50, forecast a
further increase in net profit in 1994. It said it expected an extraordinary
net gain of Fl 58m this year on the sale of its 50 per cent stake in a
distilled spirits joint venture, Bols Benelux, to Bols Wessanen.

<TEXT>
Aker, the Norwegian cement and building materials and oil and technology
group, yesterday reported a steep rise in pre-tax profits for 1993 in the
face of of weak construction markets at home and abroad.
Turnover improved 5 per cent to NKr18.1bn (Dollars 2.4bn) but operating
profit advanced strongly to NKr750m from NKr72m in 1992. Pre-tax profits,
after financial items, advanced to NKr851m from NKr386m.
Aker is stepping up its dividend to NK3.50 a share from the NKr2.60 paid for
1992.
Mr Tom Ruud, chief executive, said the group had completed an extensive
five-year restructuring which had transformed Aker into a strong financial
industrial company with considerable investment capacity for the future.
The cement and building materials division lifted pre-tax profit to NKr295m
from NKr18m on sales little changed at NKr5.9bn, against NKr5.8bn.
'The improvement is due primarily to increased earnings by the international
cement business and reduced financial expenses,' Aker said.
The oil and gas technology division moved back into profit with a pre-tax
return of NKr515m, against a loss of NKr77m. Sales rose to NKr11.5bn from
NKr10.6bn.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bavaria nets DM2.3bn from sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Bavarian government is to pocket DM2.3bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in cash - about
double the figure expected - from the sale of its stake in the Bayernwerk
electricity utility to Viag, the energy-based conglomerate.
The cash settlement, announced yesterday, is in addition to a
previously-agreed 25.1 per cent stake in the enlarged Viag group, which will
become one of Germany's top 10 companies in terms of sales. Combined
turnover of the two businesses is about DM40bn.
The deal, billed as the biggest German privatisation project to date, was
unveiled yesterday in a flurry of electioneering propaganda and upbeat
forecasts from the buyer.
Mr Edmund Stoiber, a prominent member of the Christian Social Union party,
one of the three coalition partners in Bonn, pledged the cash proceeds would
be used to build universities and fund research and not 'to fill gaps in the
budget'.
The Bavarian government's 25.1 per cent stake in the new-look Viag would be
sold within the next five years, so no-one could accuse him of
re-nationalisation, he said.
The group needed a stable shareholder structure while it went about its
restructuring programme, Mr Stoiber added.
Viag predicted respectable profits for 1993 and an unchanged dividend of
DM9. It promised a shake-out of the group's industrial holdings, and an
increase in earnings per share of at least 10 per cent by 1995.
According to Mr Georg Obermeier, finance director, the company could have
raised the dividend for 1993, but had decided an increase was not
appropriate at a time of rising unemployment and depression.
The group had neither 'a shopping list nor a selling list', according to Mr
Alfred Pfeiffer, chairman. But executives said future core industrial
businesses - apart from energy, accounting for 20 per cent of sales in the
enlarged group and 55 per cent of profits - would be packaging, chemicals,
logistics and corporate telecommunications.
Five firms of independent auditors had valued Bayernwerk at DM8.9bn and Viag
at DM10.2bn, he said. These figures justified a financial consideration of
DM1.85bn in return for the government's 58.3 per cent stake in the utility,
but the quality of Bayernwerk was deemed to be worth another DM450m.
Under present arrangements Viag owns 38.8 per cent in Bayernwerk, which in
turn has 24.9 per cent of Viag.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sumitomo Cement plans merger
with smaller rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A government-inspired restructuring of Japan's overcrowded cement industry
took a step forward yesterday when the fourth and eighth largest producers
announced merger plans.
Sumitomo Cement and its smaller competitor Osaka Cement are to join forces
from October, to form Japan's second largest cement maker, with 18.3 per
cent of the market and combined annual sales of Y211.1bn (Dollars 1.9bn).
Their marriage is driven by the forces behind last November's merger of
Onoda Cement, Japan's largest producer, with Chichubu Cement, the number
six, to consolidate Onoda's market leadership, with nearly a quarter of the
country's annual cement demand.
Both mergers are designed to seek economies of scale in an overcrowded
market worsened by the collapse in construction orders during this
recession. 'The cement industry in our nation is facing sluggish demand and
harsh cost competition. So we have decided to merge in order to better grow
in such an international era,' said a joint statement.
Before announcing the deal, the pair consulted the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry which was informally encouraging alliances among Japan's
22 cement makers, said the ministry The final decision to merge was made by
the companies themselves, it emphasised. Sumitomo Cement made the first
move.
Between 2 per cent and 3 per cent of Japan's 90m tonne cement production
capacity was surplus to requirements, the ministry estimated: 'In the long
term, cement makers must restructure because the market is receding.'
Some private sector forecasters argue the cement industry needs more
slimming than suggested by the ministry. Less than 10 producers would
suffice to meet domestic demand, believes Nomura Research Institute.
Osaka Cement will be dissolved after the merger and its president, Mr
Tetsunosuke Hamada, will become chairman of the new group. He forecast large
savings on production, distribution, capital investment and research and
development.
The new group expects a Y5.2bn pre-tax profit in the year to March 1996, its
first full trading year, rising to Y7.5bn in the following year, said Mr
Shoichi Tatemoto, president of Sumitomo Cement, who will be president of the
new company. It will be named Sumitomo Osaka Cement.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Kymmene cuts loss to FM256m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses fell sharply at Kymmene, the Finnish forestry group, last year as the
group reaped the benefits of cost-cutting and a weaker Finnish markka.
The deficit after financial items was FM256m (Dollars 46.5m), compared with
FM1.36bn a year earlier and a FM1.30bn loss in 1991.
In spite of the result, the company restored its dividend, paying FM1 per
share, as it predicted a generally improved market environment for this
year. In the final four months of 1993 the group showed a FM81m profit, its
first profit since 1990.
'The European market for forest products remained weak and prices for pulp
and paper plunged to unprecedented levels,' the group said. However, it said
its volumes rose because of increased exports to markets outside Europe and
reduced imports into Europe.
This helped sales to rise to FM16.3bn from FM13.6bn, although the weaker
markka was the main reason for the increase.
All the group's divisions improved their performance, except chemical pulp,
helping operating profit to rise to FM1.59bn from FM394m.
However, losses from foreign subsidiaries, especially in France and Germany
(both strong currency countries), depressed the group's result, keeping it
in the red at a time when domestic rivals Metsa-Serla, Repola and
Enso-Gutzeit have returned to profit.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Mucklow rises to Pounds 5.28m and sees
improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A&amp;J Mucklow Group, the West Midlands property development and investment
company, announced a marked increase in occupancy rates in the six months to
December 31, along with an 8 per cent increase in pre-tax profit from Pounds
4.87m to Pounds 5.28m.
The company experienced a slight improvement in market conditions, according
to Mr Albert Mucklow, chairman, and succeeded in letting 245,000 sq ft of
its record 1.32m sq ft of vacant property, during the period.
The company is also proceeding with its development programme, and has
completed the 60,000 sq ft second phase of its Wednesbury development, of
which two-thirds has been pre-let to the Post Office.
Mr Mucklow said the pick up in the property market was at an early stage and
'there will be an inevitable time-lag before improving conditions are
reflected in profits'.
Net asset value per share was 145p at December 31, compared with 144p six
months earlier, but this does not include any revaluation of its properties.
Brokers estimate a year-end figure of about 165p.
During the interim period, the company paid Pounds 1.14m for the purchase of
freeholds on two leasehold properties, and raised Pounds 3.15m from the sale
of a Weybridge office block, which represented a surplus over the June 1993
book value of Pounds 340,000.
Operating profit on continuing operations rose from Pounds 7.68m to Pounds
8.64m, because of a marginal increase in rental income, and a fall in
operating expenses.
An interim dividend of 3.0515p (2.9625p) is declared. Earnings per share
amounted to 3.77p, compared with 3.3p.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Skirmishes in battle for Westland - War of
words over order prospects and GKN's reasons for bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for control of Westland turned more hostile yesterday after the
helicopter manufacturer accused GKN of employing shallow arguments and
misleading information in its Pounds 496m takeover bid.
Mr Alan Jones, chairman of the Yeovil-based manufacturer, said the
engineering and industrial services group had tried to cast doubt on its
order prospects, while disguising its own motives for the takeover.
'GKN does not appear to understand the value of Westland's future business.
The real savings arising from the possible acquisition appear to be tax
benefits for GKN,' he said.
His criticism, contained in a letter to shareholders, prompted an angry
response from GKN, which has offered Westland investors 290p per ordinary
share.
Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, said: 'Mr Jones has totally failed to address
the real issue, that is the price. Why should we overpay for his optimism
about future orders?'
He also dismissed Westland's claim that there was no synergy between the
helicopter business and GKN's armoured vehicles division.
GKN believes the two operations could pool their logistical and marketing
operations. It has also pledged additional financial support for the
company.
GKN is in a strong position to win control of Westland - having boosted its
existing holding to 45 per cent.
Mr Jones, said: 'Collaboration with GKN would add no value to Westland's
businesses. Westland has the financial strength to achieve its objectives
and does not need the shelter of a larger group.'
Both companies have started an intensive lobbying campaign to win the
support of institutional shareholders.
M&amp;G and Schroders, the two largest, have indicated they regard the offer as
too low.
Westland shares closed down 2p at 327p, a 13 per cent premium to the offer
price.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Olives Property seeks Pounds 10.3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Olives Property is continuing the restructuring which began last June with a
further acquisition and the raising of Pounds 10.3m through a rights issue.
The company also reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 576,000 for 1993,
against losses last time of Pounds 3.06m.
The company is buying Huby Estates, property investment concern with a
Pounds 6m portfolio mainly of offices in the north of England.
An initial payment of Pounds 3.1m will be satisfied by Pounds 2.95m cash and
the balance in shares.
The payment is adjustable in cash to reflect changes in net current assets
between November 1993 and completion.
A total of 25.8m shares are being issued on a 4-for-3 basis at 40p. The
issue is underwritten.
Yesterday Olives' shares were unchanged at 61p.
The balance of the proceeds will be used for working capital and further
acquisitions.
Olives' turnover for 1993 was Pounds 2.29m (Pounds 2.14m). Earnings per
share were 3.79p, against losses of 33.04p.
Dividends cannot be paid as there is a deficit on the profit and loss
account.
The company is proposing to eliminate this by cancelling the capital
redemption reserve and reducing the share premium account.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Stronger second half gives MTL Pounds 4.33m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATRINA LOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTL Instruments, the USM-quoted maker of electronic measuring devices, got
back on track in the second half buoyed up by a 22 per cent sales rise.
In the first half pre-tax profits declined by Pounds 1.15m to Pounds 2.1m.
But the pre-tax result for the full year at Pounds 4.33m was just 9 per cent
down on last time's Pounds 4.77m (restated) which benefited from a Pounds
1.05m exceptional item caused by the different accounting treatment of a
pension scheme refund under FRS 3.
Sales in 1993 advanced to Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 19.4m) of which acquisitions
contributed Pounds 655,000.
Operating profit from continuing operations came to Pounds 4.04m, but a
Pounds 174,000 deficit incurred by acquisitions reduced this to Pounds 3.86m
(Pounds 4.22m).
Mr Ian Hutcheon, chairman, said the sales rise reflected the start of
economic recovery in some markets, particularly the US and Australia,
greater market penetration in continental Europe and a rise in the number
and quality of new products as well as the acquisition of Transition
Technology.
A final of 2.4p is recommended, making a total of 4.1p (3.6p) payable from
earnings of 15.5p (16.8p).
The shares added 5p to 270p.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: JW Spear jumps to Pounds 4.51m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JW Spear &amp; Sons, maker of Scrabble and other indoor games, is proposing to
lift its full-year dividend by 36 per cent on the back of a substantial
increase in profits for 1993.
The pre-tax figure rose by 22 per cent from Pounds 3.71m to Pounds 4.51m.
Earnings per share increased from 47.3p to 56.55p.
The recommended final dividend of 16p (11.5p) lifts the total pay-out for
the year from 14p to 19p.
Turnover increased by nearly Pounds 6m to Pounds 38.7m. The figure contains
Pounds 4.49m from acquisitions, including a contribution from the games
division of Murfett Regency (Australia) acquired last May for Pounds 1.8m
cash. The purchase brought with it the rights to Scrabble in Australia.
Scrabble is made in more than 20 languages and accounts for about 30 per
cent of turnover. This year sees the introduction of versions in Turkish and
Hungarian.
Mr Michael Bucher, managing director, said 1993 marked the sixth successive
year of increases in turnover and profits 'in spite of generally poor market
conditions for traditional games in comparison with video and computer
games.'
The company has fought back with the introduction of board games linked to
video cassettes and compact discs. Overall, it has introduced 121 new and
revised items this year.
Last year reduced UK sales were offset by strong growth in France and the
addition of the Benelux countries and the Australian markets.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Abtrust launches high yield trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abtrust, the Aberdeen-based fund management group, is launching a High
Income Investment Trust. It will offer an initial yield of about 7 per cent
by investing mainly in the income shares of split capital investment trusts,
or the ordinary shares of other high-yielding investment trusts.
About 80 per cent of the trust will be invested in this way, with the
remainder used to buy shares in other investment trusts with the potential
for capital growth.
The trust aims to raise a total of Pounds 40m; a placing has already raised
Pounds 25m. The public offer opened yesterday, and closes on March 25.
Ordinary shares will be issued at 100p, with no warrants.
Mr Chris Fishwick, manager of the new fund, said: 'We have recently seen
strong dividend growth coming through from some of the larger UK companies.
While many observers have correctly predicted the recent trend for improving
dividends, the size of many of the increases is most encouraging for
investment trust income shares.'

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sheffield Insulations trebled to near
Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sheffield Insulations, the distributor of thermal insulation and related
products, more than tripled pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.95m to Pounds
9.77m for 1993.
Mr Bill Forrester, chief executive, said the company's markets had not been
brilliant, with growth of about 2 per cent, but the company had continued to
weed out costs and improve margins.
Turnover from continuing operations increased from Pounds 133.5m to Pounds
149.1m. A contribution of Pounds 21.6m from WMS Group, a manufacturer of
fittings for plastic windows and doors, took total turnover to Pounds
170.7m. Sheffield acquired WMS Group - which contributed Pounds 3.9m to
pre-tax profits - for Pounds 52.9m last June.
The group's ceilings and partitioning market and the architectural hardware
markets showed volume demand growth of 2 per cent and a 2 per cent price
improvement. Volume demand for insulation and related products fell by 4 per
cent.
However, the outlook was positive for all three markets this year, and the
group was optimistic on the prospects of both Sheffield Insulations and WMS.
Net interest receivable was Pounds 31,000, compared with net interest
payable of Pounds 132,000. Gearing at the year end was 5 per cent (41 per
cent).
Earnings per share doubled from 6.2p to 12.7p. A final dividend of 3.6p is
proposed, making an unchanged total of 5.4p.
Since the end of last year Sheffield has continued on the acquisitions
trail, buying Freeman, the insulation, distribution and fabrication
specialist, for Pounds 18.6m. Freeman has a strong French business, giving
the group a base in continental Europe.
In addition, it has purchased Kessel Isokauf, a German distributor of
insulation and related products and Turton Ventures, a distributor of safety
and workwear clothing products.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: CSC heads for stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capital Shopping Centres, the retail property arm of Mr Donald Gordon's
TransAtlantic group, is to raise at least Pounds 209m from a flotation -
valuing the company at more than Pounds 830m. It will become the sixth
largest listed UK property company.
The flotation will give investors the opportunity of buying into the first
specialist shopping centre company on the stock market, but at the issue
price they will have to pay a 13 per cent premium to its latest asset
valuation.
Following the flotation, CSC will have investments in seven regional
shopping centres valued at Pounds 748.5m, and net debt of only Pounds 11m,
leaving it well placed for further investments.
CSC is offering 91m new shares at 230p through a placement and public offer,
but lead sponsor Robert Fleming has the option of placing a further 9m
shares. This would leave CSC in a net cash position, and boost market
capitalisation to Pounds 850m.
TransAtlantic has been issued 270m CSC shares priced at 200p, representing
between 73 and 75 per cent of the company (and an Pounds 81m paper profit at
the issue price) as part payment for the properties.
TransAtlantic receives Pounds 108.5m of the flotation proceeds through
repayment of an inter-company loan, and Pounds 100m of convertible bonds,
which would represent 11 per cent of CSC's enlarged share capital.
CSC's only wholly owned centre is the Lakeside in Thurrock, the largest
out-of-town centre in southern England, valued at Pounds 420m. Its three
southern centres - including the Harlequin in Watford and The Glades in
Bromley - account for 85 per cent of CSC's assets and 80 per cent of current
rental income.
CSC made profits before interest and tax of Pounds 24.4m in 1993. It doesn't
give a profits forecast, but it has undertaken to pay a final 1994 dividend
of 5p. Had it been listed for the full year a dividend of 6.5p would have
been paid, representing a yield of 3.5 per cent. The offer closes on March
23, and dealings will begin on March 30.
COMMENT
There is no denying the attractions of the only pure UK retail property
play, but Mr Donald Gordon, the canny South African entrepreneur, appears to
have left little in the CSC price for the stags. With the government set to
limit new out-of-town centres, CSC's portfolio is defensive. It offers
upside from a pick-up in retailing, through turnover-linked leases, which
accounted for 11 per cent of gross rent last year. These attractions should
see the issue fully subscribed, but given the premium to NAV, stagging
profits could be limited.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Falling sales to British Gas cut Victaulic
to Pounds 11.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Falling sales to British Gas helped to depress 1993 pre-tax profits at
Victaulic, maker of pipeline products for the gas, water, and construction
industries.
Profits fell by 12.5 per cent from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 11.8m. Total
turnover edged ahead from Pounds 101.2m to Pounds 101.4m, although the
latest figure included Pounds 900,000 from Action Hose Couplings, acquired
in August.
The group said that since 1991 its sales to the UK gas industry had fallen
by 47 per cent. Last year sales to British Gas declined by about Pounds 8.5m
to Pounds 22m.
Mr David Stewart, managing director, said yesterday that although it was now
clear that British Gas would keep its pipeline distribution system, it would
not be clear until autumn how much it would be able to charge independent
producers to use it. 'It is difficult for British Gas to review their
investment programme, and we expect no great recovery in sales to British
Gas this year', he said.
The group has reacted by pushing to open up new markets, and increased
export sales from Pounds 9m to Pounds 15m. Exports accounted for 23 per cent
of group turnover last year.
Lindapter, a specialist fixings maker acquired late in 1992, contributed
Pounds 4.5m to turnover, and Action Hose Couplings a further Pounds 1m.
Net cash at the end of the year was up from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 14.3m, and
the group is looking for further acquisitions in order to diversify from the
UK water and gas sectors.
Earnings per share eased from 20.3p to 18.4p. The group is proposing to lift
the final dividend from 5.3p to 5.5p, making the total pay-out 8p (7.8p). Mr
Stewart said the dividend rise was justifiable, given the strong balance
sheet, high cover and cash generative nature of the group.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: US operations help lift Telemetrix 64% to
Pounds 16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A particularly strong performance in the US helped Telemetrix, the supplier
of specialised electronic components, test equipment and services for the
telecommunications and networking industries, to report a 64 per cent
profits increase in 1993.
Pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 9.85m to Pounds 16.1m on turnover ahead
by 23 per cent to Pounds 123.3m (Pounds 100.6m).
Earnings per share increased by 70 per cent to 8.5p (5p), partly reflecting
a lower tax charge and minority interest.
The annual dividend is being raised to 1p (0.8p), and the shares closed up
8p at 137p.
After a Pounds 182,000 (Pounds 356,000) loss on discontinued operations,
operating profits grew by 55.5 per cent to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 10.3m),
representing an improvement in operating margins to 13 per cent against 10
per cent.
Overall the group generated Pounds 6.68m (Pounds 2.46m) of profits in the US
on sales markedly up at Pounds 86.5m (Pounds 60.9m). Sales to the Asia
Pacific region also grew strongly, while UK turnover was little changed at
Pounds 31.2m.
GTI, the group's 58 per cent owned US subsidiary which is also quoted on
Nasdaq, increased operating profits by 57 per cent to Pounds 12.9m on sales
up 40 per cent to Pounds 85.5m.
The improved margin - up from 13 per cent to 15 per cent - came from
increased volumes of Valor networking products. However, Mr Tim Curtis,
chief executive, cautioned that beginning in the second half, Valor sales
and profits had been hit by customer inventory corrections and competitive
pricing pressures.
Zetex, the group's UK-based specialist semi-conductor manufacturer, reported
broadly unchanged operating profits at Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 2.19m) on sales
up by 23 per cent to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 15.9m).
Trend, the UK-based manufacturer of telecommunications test equipment,
increased its operating profit by 18 per cent to Pounds 1.3m, although
turnover fell from Pounds 16.7m to Pounds 13.7m, reflecting the run-down of
the defence activities.
The group's strong cash flow enabled it to eliminate debt and end the year
with cash balances of Pounds 11.3m.
COMMENT
The 1994 first half is likely to be tough for Telemetrix, but the group is
well positioned as a quality supplier to the high growth data communications
and telecommunications equipment markets. Re-engineering established
products and new automated production facilities should help GTI restore
gross margins later in the year, when the US company should also benefit
from volume shipments of products based on new Fast Ethernet standards.
Investments in additional capacity are already helping margins at Zetex.
Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 18.5m are expected this year, producing
earnings of 9.8p. The shares are trading on a forward multiple of 14.2 and
could go higher.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Beazer Homes gets Pounds 463m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson yesterday finalised its sale of Beazer Homes, the fourth largest UK
housebuilder, through a flotation at 165p a share to give the group a market
value of Pounds 463.4m.
Of that, Pounds 50m is new money going to Beazer Homes and the rest will go
to Hanson, which is selling its entire interest, generating an exceptional
profit of about Pounds 200m.
Hanson said the pricing struck a balance between ensuring the issue was a
success and an appropriate price for Hanson shareholders. Mr Dennis Webb,
chief executive of Beazer Homes, said it was a fair price.
Of the 280.8m shares being sold, three-quarters were being placed with
institutions with the balance available through a public offer.
Beazer said if it had been quoted last year it would have paid a 5p
dividend, giving a yield at the issue price of 3.8 per cent, covered 2.3
times by earnings per share of 11.4p assuming a 25 per cent tax charge. The
yield is towards the top end of the range for housebuilders.
It planned a 1.8p final dividend for the nine months to end-June 1994, and
suggested it would have paid 5.4p in the 12 months to June had it been
quoted for the full year, an 8 per cent rise over 1993.
Although completions are running 28 per cent ahead so far this financial
period, margins are expected to weaken by contrast to most other
housebuilders. Beazer is working through its higher cost sites, and has to
take on the Pounds 800,000 annual pension cost and Pounds 1m annual cost of
being a separate, quoted company.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Refuge makes Pounds 12m provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Refuge Group, the life insurer, has made provisions totalling Pounds 11.6m
in its 1993 results in respect of possible compensation for the personal
pensions sold to people transferring out of occupational pension schemes.
The total comprises exceptional provisions of Pounds 5.7m in respect of the
business carried out by Refuge Investments, and a further Pounds 5.9m
provision in the ordinary long-term fund of Refuge Assurance, both wholly
owned life assurance subsidiaries.
Mr Tom Booth, chairman, would not specify the number of pension transfers
sold, but said the group was making the sort of prudent provisioning that
larger companies had done.
Pre-tax profits in 1993 totalled Pounds 24.3m (Pounds 16.2m).
A further Pounds 1m of provisions were made for compensation in about 1,000
cases where people contracted out of the state earnings related pension
scheme, but documentation was not received by the Department of Social
Security.
A Pounds 1.2m surplus accrued from the sale of the remaining part of the
portfolio of the personal loan subsidiary, which was closed during the year.
The proposed final dividend of 7.9p (7.3p), makes a total of 11.35p (10.5p).
The shares fell 21p to 359p.
Gross premium income in Refuge Assurance and Refuge Investments rose by 4.4
per cent to Pounds 239m. Within that total, there was a clear switch from
unit-linked pensions, where gross premium income was Pounds 35m (Pounds
61.1m), to with-profits pension policies, where gross premium income was
Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 13.5m).
General insurance broke even compared with losses of Pounds 250,000 in 1992.
Combined net income rose to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.7m).

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: F&amp;C lifts net assets to Pounds 1.56bn -
Successful investments during the year included emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, founded 125 years ago and now the
largest UK investment trust, increased its net assets by 31 per cent in
1993, from Pounds 1.19bn to Pounds 1.56bn.
On a per share basis the rise was from 225.5p to 296.1p.
The trust's share price advanced by 40 per cent over the period, compared
with a 23 per cent rise in the FT-SE-A All-Share index. Its performance was
2 per cent better than the average general investment trust over the year.
A final dividend of 2.37p brings the total to 3.52p (3.35p), the 23rd
consecutive increase.
F&amp;C adopted a cautious approach to the enhanced scrip dividends paid by some
companies last year, out of concern that distributing the proceeds could
endanger its tax status. Scrip dividends were therefore excluded from the
F&amp;C pay-out, but income from other sources, including bonds, was enough to
offset this.
Investment successes of the year included UK stock selection, emerging
markets, and a policy of switching debt out of sterling into yen. Less
successful was the fund's exposure to Japan, US growth stocks and
pharmaceuticals.
Mr John Sclater, chairman, said that progress at the same rate, which has
almost doubled the trust's assets over three years, was unlikely. But he
predicted a 'generally benign climate' for future equity investment.
Assets at the year-end were distributed between the UK (44 per cent), North
America (22 per cent), Europe (13.5 per cent), Japan (9.7 per cent), the Far
East (7.5 per cent) and elsewhere (2.8 per cent).
'Prospects for revenue are better than they were a year ago,' said Mr
Sclater. 'Dividends are rising in the UK and elsewhere and borrowing costs
are low.'
F&amp;C was the first trust to introduce a savings scheme 10 years ago, allowing
small investors to invest a fixed amount a month.
This factor has contributed to the increasing proportion of the trust's
shares held by individuals - 46 per cent at the end of 1993, compared with
39 per cent at end-1992.
F&amp;C had 74,911 shareholders at the end of 1993, a 32 per cent increase.
Steady demand from the savings scheme also helped to narrow the discount to
net asset value to about 1 per cent.
The trust is planning a 1-for-1 scrip issue to bring the share price down
from its current level of about Pounds 2.90 and to increase marketability.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rates rebate helps John Lewis reverse
recent decline with 31% rise to Pounds 93.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Lewis Partnership, the employee-owned department store and supermarket
group, revealed a change in its fortunes yesterday with a 31 per cent
increase from Pounds 71.4m to Pounds 93.3m in pre-tax profits for the year
to January 29.
The figure was boosted by a Pounds 10m business rates rebate, Pounds 7m of
which related to earlier years, after revaluation of the group's properties
for rating purposes. Adjusting for this gain, the pre-tax profit was up 16
per cent on a like-for-like basis.
'This is perhaps a truer reflection of last year's performance,' said Mr
Stuart Hampson, chairman.
The increase ended four successive years of declining profits, and came in
spite of a warning last year from Mr Hampson that the partnership faced
another year 'perhaps even of sharply falling profit'.
He said yesterday: 'I am delighted to have been proved wrong by the sharp
turnround in our performance,' adding that the the improvement resulted from
beating sales estimates while keeping costs under control.
Turnover increased 2.6 per cent to Pounds 2.42bn (Pounds 2.36bn) with sales
at the 22 department stores up 5.5 per cent at Pounds 1.23bn, representing a
7 per cent increase on a 52-week basis (the year 1992-93 was 53 weeks).
Sales at the 107 Waitrose supermarkets were static at Pounds 1.15bn. Mr
Hampson described this as 'no mean achievement' given the increasing
competition in the food market, and the refusal of Waitrose to break the law
by trading on Sundays.
John Lewis's central council has now approved the principle of Sunday
trading and some Waitrose stores are likely to open on Sundays once the
government's Sunday Trading Bill becomes law.
However, trading profits at Waitrose, not disclosed until May, were hit by
the cost of investment in new technology and distribution arrangements.
Sales in the wholesale and manufacturing business slipped from Pounds 40.8m
to Pounds 40.2m.
John Lewis's 33,500 employee-partners will receive annual bonuses of 10 per
cent of salary, worth a total of Pounds 34.6m. Mr Hampson said he was
pleased the bonus percentage had returned to double figures after falling to
8 per cent last year, the lowest since 1958-59.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Fife Indmar continues progress with Pounds
0.9m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fife Indmar, which returned to the black at the interim stage, continued to
progress through the second six months and for the full 1993 year swung from
losses of Pounds 1.66m to profits of Pounds 903,000 pre-tax.
The dividend is being lifted from 0.5p to 2.75p via a final of 2p - in line
with the December forecast. Earnings per share emerged at 7.13p (losses
14.38p).
The news prompted a 16p rise in the share price to 76p.
Along with its preliminary results, the Edinburgh-based engineer announced
the acquisition of Glegg &amp; Thomson, an independent ironmongery business
based in Aberdeen.
The consideration of Pounds 780,000 will be satisfied by the issue of 1.3m
new ordinary shares, of which 116,667 will be retained by the vendors.
The remaining 1.18m shares, together with 500,000 new ordinaries to be
issued for cash, have been underwritten by Quayle Munro at 60p and
conditionally placed with institutions.
Group turnover for 1993 was little changed at Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 31.7m).
Interest charges dropped to Pounds 616,000 (Pounds 1.02m).
Mr Gavin Hepburn, chairman, said the streamlining and rationalisation
undertaken last year had provided the group with the appropriate base from
which to make progress overall during 1994.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise Oil hits Pounds 95m despite
falling prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil, the largest UK exploration and production company, yesterday
reported an 8.9 per cent rise in 1993 net profits to Pounds 94.7m despite
the sharp slide in crude oil prices.
Record production of 158,914 barrels of oil equivalent a day (including
natural gas) boosted turnover to Pounds 546.1m, compared with Pounds 524.4m
last time.
The company also benefited from a sharp fall in tax from Pounds 57.9m to
Pounds 5.1m. That was because of changes in the petroleum revenue tax regime
in the UK and lower Norwegian taxes.
Earnings per share fell by 1.5p to 17p but a final dividend of 6.5p holds
the total at 16p. The enhanced scrip dividend alternative to the interim
dividend was taken up by 98 per cent of shareholders, saving the company
Pounds 44.3m in cash. It also reduced advance corporation tax liabilities by
Pounds 12.9m.
Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive, said Enterprise was better
placed than most exploration and production companies to weather low oil
prices because of its 'rising production and cash flows.' These were boosted
last month by the start-up of the Pounds 1.1bn Nelson field, the first field
of which Enterprise is the operator.
Analysts generally welcomed the results and Enterprise shares closed at
421p, up a penny. But there were warnings that future performance could
suffer if oil prices stay low.
Mr David Basham, at brokers Kleinwort Benson, noted that the 1993 results
were boosted by a high sterling oil price in the first half of the year of
Pounds 12.39 a barrel. This fell to an average of Pounds 11.58 for the whole
year, and is down to Pounds 9.40 for the first two months of 1994.
The company is responding by cutting costs and curtailing exploration.
Capital expenditure last year fell to Pounds 329.4m (Pounds 450.4m), while
spending on exploration and appraisal was down to Pounds 67m (Pounds 89.9m).
But the company added 60.3m barrels to its reserves, equivalent to 104 per
cent of total production last year.
COMMENT
The fact that Enterprise managed to maintain its dividend in the face of
real oil prices at the lowest level in 20 years showed its financial
strength. But even the strongest independent must tremble at the prospect
that prices will continue to hover around Dollars 13-Dollars 14 a barrel.
For an exploration and production company there are only a few ways to find
relief from low prices. In Enterprise's case diversification appears to have
been ruled out. Cutting costs helps, but the quickest way is to curtail
exploration, and the critical test for such companies remains their ability
to replace reserves over time. The remaining alternative is one which must
be looking increasingly attractive - the acquisition of low-cost assets with
future potential at knockdown prices.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ferry Pickering Pounds 2.55m in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ferry Pickering, the printing and packaging group, incurred a pre-tax
deficit of Pounds 2.55m for the year to end-December on a turnover of Pounds
25.94m.
The loss, which took account of exceptional charges of Pounds 3.39m for
reorganisation costs and goodwill written off, compared with previous
profits of Pounds 1.53m and turnover of Pounds 38.94m for the 16 months to
December 31 1992.
To enable a better comparison of the results to be made figures of the
existing operations show turnover for the 1993 year at Pounds 23.24m against
Pounds 23.72m for 1992 and operating profits at Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 1.92m).
Net borrowings over the 12 months were cut from Pounds 2.63m to Pounds
456,000.
A final dividend of 3.525p makes a 5.625p total, representing a maintained
payment on an annualised basis. Losses per share were 21.02p (earnings 9.77p
for 16 months).
Mr Graham Nixon, chairman and chief executive, has previously stated his
intention of splitting his roles. Following the annual meeting on April 25,
Mr Robert Campbell, chief executive of Platignum, will become chairman. He
will join the board as a non-executive director on April 1.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Restructure costs cut Logica 22% to Pounds
3.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Logica, the computing services company, reported pre-tax profits 22 per cent
lower at Pounds 3.21m for the first half of 1993 after restructuring charges
of Pounds 2.1m.
Turnover was flat at Pounds 106.5m (Pounds 104.2m).
Earnings per share were 3.3p (3.7p) and the interim dividend is raised by 12
per cent to 1.4p (1.25p). The shares gained 4p to 310p.
The results suggest that Logica is coming to terms with the geographic and
managerial difficulties which have depressed profitability although growth
remains difficult and there are some problem areas.
There was no net growth in the UK and sales in continental Europe slipped 3
per cent. Sales in North America rose 10 per cent; the company made a loss
of Pounds 700,000 there in the first half compared with Pounds 1.4m last
time.
The problem lies with expenditures needed to support and develop a funds
transfer software package. Speedwing Logica, a joint venture with British
Airways, is performing below expectations.
Mr Martin Read, chief executive, said that operating profits of Pounds 5.3m
illustrated the underlying strength of the business.
He believes that the restructuring expenses would be recovered in the second
half and expected to see an improvement in performance.
There have been some 100 redundancies, chiefly in administration, but the
company this year took on 170 graduates. Net cash stands at Pounds 12.7m and
Mr Read said it was likely Logica would be making strategic acquisitions
this year.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon 79% ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strength of the US dollar, a cut in underwriting losses and underlying
business growth helped Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, increase
pre-tax profits by 79 per cent from Pounds 42.5m to Pounds 76.2m in the year
to December 31 1993.
The markets reacted positively to the higher than expected profit figure,
marking the shares up 16p to close at 223p.
Income from broking increased to Pounds 664.3m (Pounds 575.6m) against a
rise in operating expenses to Pounds 626.9m (Pounds 562.3m), while on an
underlying basis brokerage and fees increased by 4 per cent with expenses
unchanged.
More than half of Willis's revenue comes from the US, so the group benefited
from a positive movement in exchange rates to the tune of Pounds 9.4m.
Operating profit (premiums less claims and expenses) from Willis's
underwriting operat-ions increased to Pounds 800,000 against a loss of
Pounds 14.1m last year. This mainly reflected an improvement at Sovereign,
the London operation which specialises in marine and North American casualty
business and which withdrew from the market in 1991. Pre-tax losses from UK
underwriting operations fell to Pounds 9.4m, against Pounds 25.7m in 1992.
Interest and investment income amounted to Pounds 55.6m (Pounds 57.3m).
Losses on disposal of fixed assets amounted to Pounds 1.2m (against a profit
of Pounds 300,000). Profits from the sale of underwriting businesses
amounted to Pounds 1.4m, reflecting the sale of a 64 per cent holding in
Gryphon Holdings, the North American insurance operation.
The share of profit of associated undertakings amounted to Pounds 5.5m
(Pounds 4.4m). Interest payable amounted to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 5.5m).
The reduction in the dividend for 1993, which was cut to 6.6p compared with
13.2p in 1992, was announced last November. Willis said it intended to
maintain the pay-out at the same level for the first quarter of 1994.
COMMENT
The strength of the US dollar, continued economic recovery and higher
interest rates in the US are all positive trends for Willis, which is on
course to produce profits of at least Pounds 95m in 1994 and earnings of
more than 14p. On that basis the shares - on a prospective multiple of 16 -
look reasonably good value. This is especially the case given yesterday's
indications that Sovereign appears to be over the worst of its problems.
Nevertheless, although all these trends look positive, in the longer term
the group will do well to maintain its margins in the highly competitive
North American market, where there still appears to be no immediate prospect
of any significant increase in rates.

Shares in Applied Distribution were priced yesterday at 135p, valuing the
contract distribution group, which was formed five years ago under a Pounds
16.5m management buy-out from Geest, at Pounds 40.9m.
The placing of 17.25m shares, representing 57 per cent of the enlarged
capital, was completed yesterday by NatWest Wood Mackenzie, broker to the
issue. The sponsor is Baring Brothers.
Some 11.35m new shares are being issued, valued at Pounds 15.3m, and the
balance consists of 5.9m shares being sold by existing shareholders.
Part of the Pounds 14.5m net proceeds will be used to repay bank and other
borrowings totalling about Pounds 11m. The rest will be used for working
capital and investment.
Since the buy-out, the group has achieved compound annual growth in turnover
of about 20 per cent and operating profits have grown at a compound average
annual rate of 7 per cent.
Last month the group reported operating profits of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.4m)
on turnover of Pounds 26.4 (Pounds 21.4m) for 1993. Pre-tax profits
increased by 27 per cent to Pounds 2.23m.
Applied Distribution has benefited from the growing trend among UK retailers
and manufacturers to switch from in-house warehousing and distribution
arrangements to third party contracts.
Customers, including J Sainsbury, Somerfield/Gateway and Esso, are served
from five national depots.
Dealings in the new shares are expected to begin on March 17.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Smith &amp; Nephew up at Pounds 171m - Rapidly
changing markets provide more acquisition opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith &amp; Nephew, the surgical implants and bandages group, recorded a 10 per
cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 170.6m, against Pounds
154.6m, despite the impact of healthcare reforms in the US.
Excluding exceptional items and beneficial exchange rate movements profits
rose by 8 per cent. Profits included a net gain of Pounds 7.3m (Pounds
13.3m) on disposals.
Turnover was Pounds 948.7m (Pounds 857.7m) including Pounds 17.5m (Pounds
48.7m) from discontinued items. Underlying sales from continuing operations
rose 7 per cent.
Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said: 'We are very pleased with these
results in a healthcare market that is changing rapidly around the world.'
He added that some of the changes were benefiting Smith &amp; Nephew and were
creating many more acquisition opportunities. The company has brought in
consultants to identify targets which would strengthen its product range or
geographical cover.
The company has not made a significant purchase since the Dollars 236m
(Pounds 162m) acquisition of Ioptex, the US eye lens maker in 1988 and,
helped by a series of disposals, now has a strong balance sheet. Gearing
fell from 12 per cent to 9 per cent over the year with shareholders' funds
rising to Pounds 452m (Pounds 405m).
US sales, 45 per cent of the total, suffered from a slowdown in
non-emergency surgery which hit demand for its artificial hip and knee
joints. Sales of such 'elective' surgery products rose by just 1 per cent.
But other products, including wound management and bone fracture pins,
continued to grow strongly leaving total US sales up 7 per cent.
On the continent strong sales in northern Europe, including the difficult
German market, offset weakness in Spain and France. Sales by its Japanese
subsidiary jumped by more than 50 per cent to Pounds 13m and Mr Robinson
predicted 'growth of 50 per cent or more for the next few years'.
Earnings per share rose only 0.4p to 10.6p, after the tax rate increased
from 29 per cent to 33 per cent. A final dividend of 3.02p is proposed for a
total of 4.91p (4.62p).
COMMENT
For a decade until the mid- 1980s Smith &amp; Nephew turned in annual earnings
growth of 20 per cent. Since 1989 that has sunk to a little more than 2 per
cent. In the depths of the recession such dullness had its appeal, now it
looks, well, dull. Nor will acquisitions necessarily return the sparkle. In
its last large deal in 1988 the company paid Dollars 236m for a business
which is now breaking even on sales of Dollars 30m. Prospects for the core
businesses look healthy enough, particularly in south east Asia, though
sales slowed in the second half. Earnings growth will be blunted by a rising
tax charge again this year but on forecasts of Pounds 175m the multiple is
just 13.5.
Safe, if unexciting.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Grasping the challenge of a new culture -
Barclays intends to eliminate its defensiveness to outsiders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surrounded by office furniture that he does not like, in a bank that he says
can sometimes be 'stuffy, pompous and snobbish', the chief executive of
Barclays warms to his theme. 'I think banks have been misreporting profits
for years, and what happened in the late 1980s was grotesquely imprudent.'
Mr Martin Taylor pauses a split second to reflect, before continuing
defiantly with his rapid flow of words. 'You can quote me on that, although
the auditors will probably sue me,' he says, looking pleased at the
prospect. A new broom has arrived with a flourish at the UK's largest bank.
Mr Taylor, who yesterday set out his thoughts at the clearer's results
conferences with the media and analysts, left no doubt that he intends to
eliminate its caution and defensiveness when dealing with outsiders. He even
broke into French when replying to a journalist from a Parisian newspaper.
Harder analysis, and better communication of ideas lie at the heart of Mr
Taylor's salvo. There were few clear answers to the problems he set out, but
he reiterated constantly that the bank had to understand its own policies
better, and then make sure that the outside world understood them as well.
He also has a few brisk thoughts about flaws in the bank's structure. One is
that it has no strong group identity, but is dominated by the high street
bank. 'I think my colleagues from BZW (the investment bank) when they come
for group meetings feel they are coming to the clearing bank,' he says.
The group is not organised simply enough to allow him to 'get closer to'
each business. 'I think at the moment we are very inappropriately organised.
The problem is that what people are supposed to be doing and what they
actually do is not the same thing.'
Changing the culture is a longer-term task, although Mr Taylor insists that
it is his central challenge. 'That is what management is about: changing the
way that people behave over a long period of time. Surgery is not always
needed. You may sometimes just want a properly-balanced diet.'
Barclays has been accused of being less meritocratic than other banks,
because some senior managers are still drawn from the families whose banks
formed it in the last century. Mr Taylor says this is a myth, but that it is
still 'encrusted' with a bureaucratic management structure.
'There are traditions that are already being abandoned, the stuffy, pompous
and snobbish things. The banking side of this business is far too status
conscious for my taste,' he says. But unifying the bank's 'old-fashioned
military' traditions with the more free-wheeling BZW will be a hard task.
Apart from changing its structure, the most concrete idea that Mr Taylor
discussed was Barclays' move towards taking a small general provision
against each loan. He hopes this would encourage managers to price loans
better.
Mr Taylor argues that default provisions would link the pricing of loans
with credit risk. 'There is a habit here I was not aware of before I came
into backing of thinking of the two things with absolutely different parts
of the mind. To me they are two sides of the same coin,' he says.
This ties in with a scepticism about the value of taking on loans to support
the cost base. 'One thing that I have learned from my industrial background
is that marginal business is not always profitable, and sometimes the
marginal business in the book is not just the last 5 per cent,' he says.
Instead of raising new capital to expand lending, Mr Taylor thinks he can
recycle existing capital attached to poor assets. 'I think the bank has a
lot of capital poorly employed, and there is value to be added over the next
10 years by working it more intelligently.'
Mr Taylor says this would be a more precise process than simply shifting
capital among categories of lending such as to large companies. 'If you
actually go through the book and say where are we getting good returns, and
where not, you can make a very considerable value difference' he says.
Indeed, Mr Taylor is preoccupied by the issue of how much capital the bank
should hold - as well as what it should do with it. He emphasised that it
needed to cover its dividend twice over the economic cycle in order to live
on its own resources, and not be driven into rights issues.
The bank has already achieved a target of 6 per cent ratio of core capital
to risk-weighted assets set last year by Mr Andrew Buxton, its chairman. Mr
Taylor says he is re-examining this target. 'Six per cent might well be
right, but if it is right, you have to understand why it is.'
Mr Taylor says he will explain his conclusion carefully to avoid any
misunderstanding. Otherwise, 'They may say 'Ah, they want to have a cushion
because there is some disaster around the corner' or 'Oh, gosh, they are
looking for an adventure and they are building up firepower',' he says.
Part of his challenge is not only to identify the things that are wrong with
Barclays, but the traditions that are valuable. He talks admiringly of the
ability of Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer, to retain the best of its
traditions without becoming bogged down by the past.
'They hang on to the golden thread going back through time that does not
change. I am sure that in banking there are also golden threads running back
through time,' he says.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BM losses continue to mount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BM Group, the engineering company which fell heavily into the red after
provisions of Pounds 119.5m last year, yesterday said it had raised Pounds
80m in 12 months through the disposal programme which was launched in 1993
to reduce debt.
The company sought to reassure investors as it revealed further write-downs
and losses of Pounds 14.2m pre-tax for the first half, against profits of
Pounds 8.6m last time. Sales were 12 per cent lower at Pounds 232.3m for the
six months to December 31.
Mr Moger Woolley, chairman, said the group was confident it would meet its
targets on debt and disposals by the summer. Then BM would have to
renegotiate banking facilities to replace the short-term support which
expires in December.
BM almost collapsed last year when it breached covenants on interest cover
and net assets. The group had built up substantial debt following a series
of acquisitions.
Most of the Blackwood Hodge businesses had been sold, leaving BM with a
group of process engineering operations and a product manufacturing
division. The operating profit from these continuing operations fell from
Pounds 12.44m to Pounds 1.86m. However, about Pounds 10m of the operating
profit in the previous year had been due to the release of provisions and a
pension credit.
Mr Woolley said he expected debt to represent less than 90 per cent of the
Pounds 58m (Pounds 60.2m) in shareholders' funds by the end of the year. BM
would net a further Pounds 35m from the last of the significant asset
disposals, he said, and about Pounds 14m in stock financing debt would be
eliminated. This would bring borrowings - reported as Pounds 98m at the
interim stage, against Pounds 114m at the year end - down to about Pounds
50m. BM took a Pounds 6m charge to rationalise the remaining Canadian
business, bringing the total provisions arising from the lossmaking Canadian
operations to Pounds 23m.
BM is expected to remain substantially lossmaking this year. There are a
further Pounds 42m in goodwill provisions expected as a result of disposals.
Losses per share emerged at 13.6p (44.2p earnings) and the interim dividend
is being omitted - 0.5p was paid previously.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Maple Leaf Foods pushes up fourth-quarter
earnings
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Maple Leaf Foods, Canada's biggest food processor which is 56 per cent owned
by Hillsdown Holdings overcame a slump in its grocery and food-service
businesses to report a 25 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings.
The improvement reflected a three-year shake-up in Maple Leaf's poultry,
pork and other agri-food businesses, where operating profits jumped by 44
per cent for 1993.
Aggregate fourth-quarter earnings rose to CDollars 22.4m (Pounds 11m), or 28
cents a share, from CDollars 17.8m, or 22 cents a share. Sales climbed to
CDollars 881.6m (Pounds 433m) from CDollars 739.5m. Earnings from continuing
operations for the year were virtually unchanged at CDollars 70.1m (CDollars
69.2m), or 87 cents a share (86 cents).
Bakery operations produced 'excellent' results last year, partly offset by a
disappointing flour-milling performance. Operating earnings of the
consumer-foods side fell to CDollars 11.4m from CDollars 32.4m. The prepared
meats and grocery businesses were hit by lower volumes and tighter margins
in an intensely competitive market. The sale of the lossmaking food-service
side should contribute to an improvement in the division's results.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hillsdown 'achieves all goals' with Pounds
162.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hillsdown Holdings' profits bounced back in 1993 from the provision-hit
Pounds 63.7m recorded in 1992 to Pounds 162.3m. The group used most of the
Pounds 70.9m provision made in 1992 to cover its exit from abattoirs and
property trading.
Sir John Nott, chairman, said the group had achieved all its goals in 1993,
although trading conditions had been increasingly competitive. He said there
was no improvement in markets so far in the present year.
The proposed final dividend is maintained at 6.6p for an unchanged total of
8.8p.
Group sales were Pounds 4.6bn (Pounds 4.41bn), with those from continuing
operations up 14 per cent to Pounds 4.18bn. Operating profits rose 20 per
cent to Pounds 199m (Pounds 165.4m), before a net interest charge of Pounds
36.6m (Pounds 30.8m).
Earnings per share were 13.6p (losses 0.3p) or 12.5p (10.7p) before
exceptionals.
Five of the group's six divisions increased profits. The odd one out was
beverages and biscuits, where a sharp drop in the first half was partly made
up in the second to give operating profits of Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 21.4m).
Ambient and chilled foods made Pounds 37m (Pounds 36.4m) while meat and
produce contributed Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 18.5m). Poultry profits jumped from
Pounds 17m to Pounds 28.5m as rationalisation benefits came through.
In Canada, Maple Leaf Foods made Pounds 62m (Pounds 53.4m) in spite of
suffering meat imports from the US which will necessitate the closure of the
Toronto plant at a cost of CDollars 50m (Pounds 25.5m) covered by a
provision made when Hillsdown bought Canada Packers.
Non-foods, furniture and housebuilding, made Pounds 32.2m (Pounds 25.8m).
Capital expenditure was Pounds 98.8m, while Pounds 74.9m was spent on
acquisitions, with Pounds 35.1m raised from disposals. Borrowings fell over
the year from Pounds 313.5m to Pounds 291.7m, giving gearing of 34.5 per
cent.
COMMENT
Hillsdown's shares fell 8p to 166p amid some criticism about the use of
provisions. This was somewhat strange since provisions are made to be used,
but Hillsdown must feel it can never get it right with the City. On an
unchanged dividend for 1994, the yield is 6.6 per cent, which is a measure
of the Hillsdown credibility gap. Much has already been done which deserves
credit. Some almost intractable problems, like slaughtering, have been
tackled, admittedly at considerable cost. And new financial controls are
cutting into the working capital and overhead fat. In a sense, though,
putting the business straight is the easy part of the job. The harder part
will be to make Hillsdown grow, though that can be left for a couple of
years yet. Profits in 1994 are likely to rise about Pounds 10m, to give a
p/e of about 12. The yield should hold the shares up, even if it is a little
early to hope for outperformance.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A boardroom battle for control of Dunne's Stores, Ireland's biggest
retailing and supermarket chain, is expected to come to a head within the
next two months, following the latest moves by Mr Ben Dunne, the ousted
chief executive, to regain control of the family-run business.
If he succeeds, the group will be floated on the stock market 'within the
next two to five years'.
Mr Dunne, who was removed from his position in February 1993 in a boardroom
coup by three of his four siblings and fellow-directors, has contracted a
team of lawyers and financial consultants to raise an estimated IPounds 320m
(Pounds 308m) to buy out his family partners, or alternatively to force them
to buy out his own 20 per cent share in the business for IPounds 80m.
According to one of the consultants involved, the money is being raised
through leading financial institutions in London, and would create an
institutional shareholding in the group of up to 40 per cent. One of the
conditions attached to the deal by the institutional backers is that the
group would be floated 'within two to five years'.
Under the present ownership agreement, none of the family partners can sell
their holding without the permission of the others.
Mr Dunne is to challenge that through the High Court, seeking a ruling that
either his partners must sell out to him, or alternatively that they must
buy out his own shareholding. A ruling is expected before the summer.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: TI Group disappoints City with 43% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI Group, the specialist engineering group, yesterday reported a 43 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 125.2m following strong growth in its
core businesses and a full year's contribution from Dowty, its enlarged
aerospace subsidiary.
Shares in the group, however, fell 25p to 409p after the pre-tax figure
failed to meet market expectations of up to Pounds 130m.
Sir Christopher Lewinton, chairman and chief executive, said profits had
been held back by sharply increased redundancy costs of Pounds 6.2m (Pounds
1.9m), due mainly to a 25 per cent cut in the Dowty workforce to 4,200. The
gain was also dented by a Pounds 9m increase in interest charges to Pounds
13.1m following TI Group's assumption of Dowty's debts and unfavourable
currency conversions on the group's US borrowings.
At the operating level, however, profits outstripped market expectations -
increasing 25 per cent to Pounds 138.6m (Pounds 111.3m). The improvement was
underpinned by a 16 per cent increase in profits at John Crane - the seals
and polymer division - which defied weak demand in its key markets with a
gain to Pounds 61.6m (Pounds 53.1m).
Sir Christopher also hailed a Pounds 46.1m (Pounds 39.4m) contribution from
Bundy, the specialist tubes and engineering business, which managed to
offset the downturn in the European motor components business by making its
first deliveries to manufacturers such as Honda, Toyota and Mazda in Japan.
Dowty, meanwhile, benefited from a major restructuring to report full-year
profits of Pounds 25.8m, against a six month contribution of Pounds 14.6m in
1992.
Mr Tony Edwards, the division's chief executive, said the group had reduced
working capital levels and had enjoyed improved demand since.
Together the divisions pushed group turnover ahead 21 per cent to Pounds
1.39bn (Pounds 1.15bn).
Earnings came out at 18.1p (15.4p), although headline earnings fell to 18.1p
(18.3p). A final dividend of 7.4p makes an 11.25p (10.7p) total.
COMMENT
Almost 5m TI Group shares were traded yesterday and the price showed the
sharpest fall on the FT-SE 100 after the company announced yet another asset
reshuffle. The polymer business has been transferred from Dowty to John
Crane, the specialised engineering companies have been spun off into Bundy
and Dowty has inherited the rings and machining operation. Some analysts
complained that trading comparisons were no longer possible and wondered why
TI Group's figures appeared so foggy. Yet they admit the underlying business
has performed well in extremely difficult markets, and profits have risen
sharply at a time when competitors have reported flat or falling returns.
Profits of up to Pounds 140m are expected next year which, on a forward
multiple of 20.8, makes TI Group a solid if costly buy.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Go-Ahead sets out on the road to market
with Pounds 40m valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Go-Ahead Group, a bus service operator based in Gateshead, will be
floated by the summer with a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 40m.
Like buses everywhere, it comes hard on the heels of two other operators -
Stagecoach, the Perth-based group which came to the market last April, and
Badgerline, the Avon-based operator which was floated in November.
Go-Ahead plans to focus on urban transport and has recently acquired the
Brighton &amp; Hove Bus and Coach Company and the Oxford Bus Company. The group
operates more than 1,000 buses, with an annualised turnover of more than
Pounds 75m. The proceeds of the placing will be used to repay Pounds 12m of
debt.
Mr Martin Ballinger, managing director, said: 'We aim to continue our
expansion as a leading provider of urban transport throughout the UK.'
Go-Ahead was formed in 1987 by a management buy-out of Northern General
Transport Company from the National Bus Company. The flotation is being
sponsored by Hill Samuel, with Panmure Gordon as broker to the issue.
Badgerline has been informed by the Office of Fair Trading that its Pounds
23m purchase last month of PMT Group did not appear to qualify for
investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Better margins boost Christies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christies International, the auctioneers, benefited from growing confidence
among art buyers and higher profit margins to triple pre-tax profit Pounds
6.65m to Pounds 18.9m in 1993, including an exceptional gain of Pounds 2.65m
from a property sale.
The company said that prospects for sales in the current year were
encouraging. Mr David Tyler, finance director, said: 'There are an
increasing number of buyers in the market, particularly in the US and Asia.'
Christies has been through two years of sharply reduced profits, after a
peak of Pounds 67m in 1989, and Mr Tyler said 1993 had been a 'significant
move in the right direction'.
Turnover increased by 34 per cent from Pounds 109m to Pounds 146.8m,
including Pounds 15.4m from acquisitions. About Pounds 12m of increased
revenues came from a 5 per cent increase last March in the buyers premium, a
commission charged on purchases and there was a Pounds 7m gain from
favourable currency movements.
Spink and Son, the fine art dealer acquired last April, contributed Pounds
15.3m in revenues and Pounds 400,000 in profit.
Auction sales increased by 15 per cent 1993, and were 22 per cent higher in
the second half than at the interim stage. There was substantial growth in
sales of 19th and 20th century paintings, furniture and jewellery.
Sales of Old Masters and Oriental Art, however, declined from 1992 levels,
with the latter falling as a result of reduced activity from Japan.
Despite the benefits of the buyers' premium, increasing competition put
downward pressure on commissions earned from vendors last year, and this is
expected to continue during 1994.
However, the company said there had been a number of successful sales during
the first two months of the year, including the Barbara Streisand
Collection. In May, a substantial collection of Impressionist and Modern
paintings will go on sale in New York.
Christies recommended a final dividend of 1.5p, making a total of 2p,
compared with 1.5p paid from earnings per share of 6.82p (2.21p).
The shares reacted favourably rising 7p to 232p.
COMMENT
Christies' results underline the extent to which the art market has improved
in the past 12 months. The figures were distorted by a property sale, but
pre-tax profits excluding exceptional items still grew by 2 1/2 times.
Profits forecasts range wildly, given the unpredictability of the business,
but with a forecast of Pounds 20m for 1994, the shares are currently trading
on a prospective p/e of 33. Christies is expanding its international network
and is in a dynamic business, but given increasing competition, this market
rating seems too aggressive.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Tiphook, the debt-laden transport leasing group, yesterday
overwhelmingly approved the sale of its container business to Transamerica,
the US financial services group, for a minimum of Pounds 690m.
Tiphook, which has debts of more than Pounds 1bn, had warned that its
survival depended on the successful disposal of the container business, its
largest asset.
Completion of the sale is expected next Tuesday. But it is conditional on
consents by a majority of the group's US bondholders, which must be received
by Monday. Tiphook's shares closed 1p lower at 43p.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Kode 11% ahead at Pounds 1.14m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits of Kode International, the electronics and computer services group,
rose to Pounds 1.14m pre-tax for the year to December 31, an improvement of
11 per cent over the previous year's Pounds 1.03m.
The directors said, however, that the result was 'disappointing' bearing in
mind the considerable increase achieved in the opening half year.
Turnover of continuing operations improved from Pounds 20.92 to Pounds
24.92m - the comparative figure included Pounds 2.58m from acquisitions.
A fall in earnings to 7p (8.6p) reflected the number of shares in issue
following the rights issue in 1992. A final dividend of 4p makes a 6p (5.5p)
total.
With the market for maintenance business remaining 'extremely competitive'
the directors said they were 'very cautious' about the outlook for the
immediate future.

Lower losses on discontinued activities and a lack of exceptional costs
helped Relyon Group report 1993 profits of Pounds 3.15m pre-tax, against
losses of Pounds 1.04m.
The company makes beds, polyurethane foam and surveillance equipment.
Turnover improved to Pounds 41.8m (Pounds 41.3m) including Pounds 459,000

operations showed lower losses of Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 2.6m) and there was
an exceptional credit of Pounds 750,000, against a charge of Pounds 2.61m.
Earnings per share came out at 7.85p (losses 3.49p). A final dividend of

John I Jacobs, the shipowning and shipbroking group, yesterday reported a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 498,000 for 1993, after a provision of Pounds
480,000. This represented a write-off of the group's investment in Queen's
Moat Houses' convertible preference shares.
The comparable figure of Pounds 3.49m for 1992 included a profit of Pounds
3.91m on the disposal of a discontinued operation.
Mr John Jacobs, the group's 74-year-old chairman, yesterday also announced
plans to retire. He said that this would 'definitely be my last report . . .
as chairman.'
Turnover advanced to Pounds 2.84m, compared with Pounds 2.25m. The deficit
came through as 2.3p per share, against earnings of 11.5p last time.
A final dividend of 1.4p has been proposed, making a total of 3.3p for 1993.
This included an interim payment of 1.4p which was in lieu of a final
dividend for 1992, when a total of 0.5p was paid.

reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.44m to Pounds 61,151 on turnover
some Pounds 10m lower at Pounds 58.5m for the year to end-December.
The directors said the results reflected reduced margins, redundancy

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Franklin Resources dealings today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealings in the shares of Franklin Resources, the California-based fund
management group, are due to start on the London Stock Exchange today.
Franklin, one of the largest five US investment groups, bought the
London-listed Templeton fund management group in August 1992 for Dollars
786m. Franklin had Dollars 114.2bn (Pounds 78.2bn) of funds under management
at December 31 1993, in 146 funds under the Franklin and Templeton names, as
well as managed accounts. The London listing adds to existing listings on
the New York and Pacific exchanges.
Franklin's speciality is fixed-interest securities, which accounted for
about 84 per cent of its assets at the time of the acquisition, while 80 per
cent of Templeton's assets were in equities. Areas of overlap have been
reduced since the takeover, to allow each side of the group to focus on its
area of expertise.
Mr Charles Johnson, president of Franklin, said that some areas of operation
were still being integrated. Templeton is best known in the UK for its
emerging markets investment trust, but the group also manages a range of
unit trusts. Templeton is currently launching a new Latin American
investment trust, and has appointed Mr Nicholas Brady, the former secretary
to the US Treasury, as chairman of the trust.
As yet there are no Franklin-branded retail investment funds in the UK, as
investors here tend to buy more equity than fixed-interest funds.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lilleshall makes agreed Pounds 2m bid for
Historic City Devs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lilleshall, the industrial distribution and building products group,
yesterday launched a recommended bid for Historic City Developments, a
property company, in an offer which values the target at about Pounds 2.1m.
HCD specialises in the development and restoration of offices and shops,
particularly on schemes in historic towns and cities in southern England. It
owns one property, which comprises three shops - two of which are let - in
Salisbury.
In the year to April 30 1993 HCD made pre-tax profits of Pounds 132,791 on
turnover of Pounds 2.06m. At the year-end net assets stood at Pounds 1.88m,
of which Pounds 153,745 was cash. One of the two developments then held has
since been sold, boosting HCD's cash to about Pounds 1.34m. The other has
been revalued at Pounds 830,000.
The offer is made on the basis of 221 new Lilleshall shares of 10p for every
500 HCD shares of 25p held, valuing each HCD ordinary at 70.1p. This,
Lilleshall said, represented a small premium over the unaudited attributable
net assets as at February 28 last.
Lilleshall added that during the 12 months preceding the offer, there had
been five recorded dealings in HCD ordinary shares at prices between 18p and
21p.
In the five years to December 31 1993, Lilleshall has lifted profits from
Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 3.91m on turnover which has grown from Pounds 30.5m to
Pounds 69.5m.

After a return to the black at midway, Cussins Property Group, the

Comparative figures, which have been restated, reveal losses of Pounds 3.26m

Earnings per share were 8.9p, compared with 14.2p losses. The directors
stated that the positive results coupled with the group's 'sound prospects

The total sales value of properties reserved to March 6 was Pounds 8.2m

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Reorganised Manders up 45% to more than
Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manders, the Wolverhampton-based specialty chemicals group which is in the
middle of a substantial reoganisation, yesterday reported a 45 per cent
increase in 1993 profits.
The pre-tax figure was Pounds 10.3m compared with the Pounds 7.11m reported
in 1992 after charging defence costs of Pounds 1.87m incurred in the hostile
Pounds 106.1m bid repelled from Kalon.
Turnover grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 112.3m (Pounds 110.3m.)
Since the end of the year the decorative paints division was sold for Pounds
55m and the group announced the sale to Prudential of the Mander Centre, its
Wolverhampton shopping centre and sole investment property interest, for
Pounds 82m.
At the same time the group has augmented its remaining inks business with
the Pounds 27m acquisition of certain coatings and printing inks operations
of Croda International for Pounds 27m. The moves mean that Manders is left
with a focused business with turnover of about Pounds 85m a year.
Mr Roy Amos, chairman, explaining the group's new strategy, described 1994
as a 'transition' year. He said the group planned to use the proceeds of its
property sale, which will be completed in June, to build a worldwide
specialty chemicals business emphasising coatings and printing inks.
Turnover in existing coatings and inks division rose by 9 per cent to Pounds
45.6m (Pounds 41.7m) last year while turnover in the discontinued operations
fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 61.1m (Pounds 63.3m).
Overall operating profits from continuing operations increased to Pounds
9.05m (Pounds 8.42m) with coatings and inks contributing Pounds 3.89m
(Pounds 3.61m) and further growth in rental income at the Mander Centre
generating property profits of Pounds 5.16m (Pounds 4.81m). The discontinued
decorative operations generated profits of Pounds 3.11m (Pounds 3.39m).
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 1.86m (Pounds 3.37m) mainly reflecting
lower interest rates. Earnings per share increased by 64 per cent to 18.99p
(11.56p) and the board is recommending a final dividend of 7.1p (6.4) making
a total for the year up 11 per cent to 10p (9p).

FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pentland declines sharply to Pounds 21.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower interest rates hit annual pre-tax profits at the cash-rich Pentland
Group, owner of the Speedo and Berghaus clothing brands, which yesterday
announced a 22 per cent decline to Pounds 28.3m before exceptional items.
After exceptional items, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 83.6m to Pounds
21.6m. The previous year had been boosted by the Pounds 47.3m gain on the
sale of the group's stake in Adidas, the sports shoe group.
Interest gains fell by Pounds 10m to Pounds 16.1m, resulting from the
decline in interest rates over the past year and a reduction in net cash
balances from Pounds 337.3m to Pounds 185.3m.
The cash decline arose in part from the payment of a special 12p dividend in
April, reflecting the profit from the Adidas sale.
Mr Frank Farrant, finance director, said Pentland was taking its time
finding the right acquisition following its disappointment over Adidas in
1992.
The group pulled out of its agreed Pounds 215m bid in October that year
after preliminary investigations. 'It is easy to acquire something which is
earnings enhancing in the first year,' Mr Farrant said, 'but we have got to
have something with growth potential.'
In the absence of 'the big one', Mr Farrant said, Pentland expected to spend
up to Pounds 75m on smaller acquisitions this year. Some Pounds 60m had been
spent in 1993, including assumed debt.
Acquisitions such as the electrical cablemaker, Woods Wire, and the outdoor
clothing company, Berghaus, helped to fuel the 45 per cent increase in sales
to Pounds 471.8m for the year to December 31. Stripping out purchases, sales
were 13 per cent higher at Pounds 366m. Operating profits in continuing
businesses were 10 per cent lower, however, at Pounds 8.8m.
This was because of heavy losses in the US footwear business and at Pony,
the sports shoe operation.
The group also withdrew from trade finance, which incurred losses of Pounds
2.8m at the operating level. Pentland took an exceptional charge of Pounds
6.7m to wind up the division.
Total operating profits for the group were Pounds 9.2m, including Pounds
3.2m from acquisitions.
The dividend was increased by 12 per cent with a proposed final of 1.64p
making a total of 2.8p. The Pounds 54.3m in dividend pay-outs and a Pounds
58m write off of goodwill on acquisitions, depressed shareholders' funds by
a net Pounds 93m to Pounds 310.1m. Earnings per share fell from 15.79p to
2.74p.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Barclays back in the black with Pounds 664m: New chief
executive Martin Taylor intends to reform bank's culture and structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' newly-appointed chief executive, declared
yesterday that he intended to reform the culture and structure of the UK's
largest bank as it disclosed a strong return to profit last year following
its 1992 loss of Pounds 242m.
Mr Taylor said that Barclays would use its capital better and not seek fresh
equity except in an 'extraordinary and unforeseeable' circumstance.
'The game of over-distributing capital and then asking for it back is over,'
he said.
Barclays disclosed pre-tax profits of Pounds 664m, increasing earnings per
share to 19.4p, compared with a 21.4p loss. It maintained its dividend at
15.15p, the level to which it was cut last year to prevent a further loss of
capital.
The banking division and BZW investment bank both performed well, the former
making an Pounds 879m profit compared with a Pounds 195m loss (restated).
However, profits were hit by a Pounds 675m loss in troubled US businesses
which are being managed down.
Mr Taylor defended Barclays' plan to cut costs by shedding 5,000 jobs within
two years. 'I am absolutely astonished that what seem to me to be ordinary
management principles are not yet established in this industry.'
Mr Andrew Buxton, who was both chairman and chief executive until Mr Taylor
was recruited from Courtaulds Textiles to take the latter role, said Mr
Taylor's appointment had been among several 'stimulating changes' last year.
The BZW division made a profit of Pounds 501m helped by a strong year in
capital markets and derivatives trading and equity origination. Mr Buxton
said BZW had concentrated on customer business, rather than proprietary
trading.
Dealing income rose to Pounds 781m, against Pounds 491m, helped by market
volatility. The bank said that most of a Pounds 137m rise in staff salaries
was attributable to salaries and bonuses at BZW, although it did not give a
figure for bonuses.
The bonuses were condemned by Bifu, the banking union. 'There can be no
justification for sacking one group of staff and giving huge bonuses to
another,' it said.
The Pounds 675m loss in the 'United States transition' business included a
Pounds 236m loss due to the writedown of mortgage servicing rights at the
BarclaysAmerican/Mortgage business, and a Pounds 346m loss on poor loans.
Operating profit before provisions rose 9 per cent to Pounds 2.56bn, against
Pounds 2.34bn, and provisions fell 24 per cent from Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds
1.9bn. Operating profits on business with big companies in the UK rose 25
per cent. There was a Pounds 135m loss on continental European operations.
The tier one ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets rose to the bank's
target figure of 6 per cent, against 5.5 per cent, after it retained
earnings of Pounds 67m (against a Pounds 586m loss). These were the first
retained earnings for three years.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Volvo pays the cost of failed merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The cost to Volvo of rupturing plans to merge with France's Renault became
clear yesterday as the Swedish group - the country's biggest manufacturer -
announced a pre-tax loss in 1993 of SKr2.64bn (Pounds 222m), the second
successive year of losses.
The result was a sharp improvement on the 1992 pre-tax deficit of SKr4.8bn.
But the company would have been comfortably back in profit had it not been
for charges totalling SKr5.2bn associated with the unwinding of the
three-year-old strategic alliance with Renault.
This unwinding followed Volvo's decision last December to scrap plans for a
full merger of its car and truck operations with the state-owned French
group.
Volvo was at pains to stress that it had staged a strong recovery at the
operating level in 1993, with unit sales of cars and trucks rising for the
first time in years.
The group surged to an operating profit of SKr1.55bn from a loss in 1992 of
SKr2.25bn, boosted by last year's sharp fall in the value of the Swedish
krona, rationalisation programmes that have eliminated 14,000 jobs in four
years, low product development costs and a change in the accounting of some
tool costs.
However, investors, who have long discounted Volvo's turnround, were
unimpressed by the results and an unchanged dividend of SKr7.75 per share.
Volvo's most-traded B share fell SKr7.00 to close at SKr683.
Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, said 1994 had started well, although he
declined to comment on prospects for the whole year. He also refused to
comment until a shareholders' meeting in April on what moves the group might
make to seek a new long-term partner in carmaking.
Group sales in 1993 reached SKr111.15bn compared with SKr83bn in 1992, but
were up only 8 per cent adjusted for exchange rate changes. Unit car sales
were 311,800, up from 303,800, thanks mainly to a 9 per cent increase in the
US, Volvo's biggest market. The car group returned to an operating profit of
SKr502m (SKr1.83bn loss).
Unit truck sales rose to 51,300 from 48,100, with the truck group reporting
an operating profit of SKr765m after a loss of SKr641.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Profitable Rolls-Royce cuts costs and lifts market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group, yesterday
returned to the black after making strong progress in its restructuring
programme and increasing its share of the world civil aircraft engine
market.
Pre-tax profits totalled Pounds 76m last year, against a loss of Pounds 184m
in 1992 after exceptional charges of Pounds 268m.
Sir Ralph Robins, chairman, said the group had managed to make 'substantial
progress' with its restructuring.
'At the same time, we have improved our share of world markets, particularly
in the civil aviation sector,' he added.
The restructuring led to 6,000 job cuts including 3,600 in the company's
aerospace activities and 2,400 in the industrial power business. The
workforce is expected to fall by 3,600 this year to 42,200.
The company closed three plants and will close a further three in 1994 to
match the cost-cutting of its two bigger US aero-engine rivals, General
Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, and the decline in defence business.
Although sales fell 1 per cent to Pounds 3.52bn and company funded research
and development spending rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 253m, operating
profits were marginally higher at Pounds 329m reflecting benefits of the
cost-cutting programme and the favourable dollar exchange rate.
The company continued to have a strong order backlog of Pounds 6.2bn. This
did not include an additional Pounds 937m worth of orders announced but not
yet signed, said Mr Terry Harrison, chief executive.
Despite difficult market conditions, Rolls-Royce said it had increased its
market share to 25 per cent of new commercial engine orders last year
compared with 22 per cent in 1992.
Profits before interest and exceptional charges in the company's aero-engine
division rose to Pounds 20m last year from Pounds 17m on a small decline in
sales to Pounds 2.14bn from Pounds 2.143bn.
In the industrial power sector, profits fell to Pounds 68m from Pounds 85m
with sales declining to Pounds 1.38bn from Pounds 1.41bn.
The company reported a significant improvement in its positive net cash
position totalling Pounds 473m last year compared with Pounds 84m a year
earlier. This included a cash inflow of Pounds 82m in addition to the Pounds
307m proceeds from last year's rights issue.
As expected, the dividend was maintained at 5p per share. Earnings per share
were 5.95p, up from a loss of 20.39p.

FT  11 MAR 94 / ABB takes Dollars 596m charge to restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, yesterday
announced a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits after financial items to
Dollars 1.19bn (Pounds 793m) for 1993, on turnover 4 per cent higher at
Dollars 28.3bn.
The improvement was better than expected, but comes before a net
non-recurring charge of Dollars 596m, mainly for restructuring in the second
half of the year. This left net profits at Dollars 68m, down from Dollars
505m.
Mr Percy Barnevik, president and chief executive, said that after a period
of consolidation, 'the key message to our managers is to go for growth'.
Mr Barnevik said profits in dollar terms reflected a year of turbulence in
currency markets. Expressed in local currencies, profits rose an average 25
per cent, despite a recessionary environment.
Productivity increased by an average 6 per cent and net cash improved by
about Dollars 250m, mainly because of a reduction in stocks. ABB's operating
margin rose from 6.1 per cent to 7.7 per cent. Research and development
spending, at Dollars 2.27bn last year, was some 20-25 per cent higher than
in 1990.
The best performer continued to be power plants, where operating earnings
rose 66 per cent to Dollars 739m.
Profits fell from Dollars 642m to Dollars 520m in power transmission and
distribution because of poor demand while industrial and building systems
lifted profits from Dollars 606m to Dollars 649m. The restructured
transportation division bounced back to profits of Dollars 84m from a
Dollars 40m loss.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Whitbread sells holdings in regional brewers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitbread, the UK brewer, yesterday unloaded the bulk of its portfolio of
regional brewing shares in a deal worth Pounds 225m. The stakes, ranging as
high as 21 per cent in a total of eight companies, were sold almost entirely
to institutional investors.
The move is partly in compliance with government orders requiring Whitbread
to reduce its holdings to a maximum of 15 per cent on competition grounds.
However, Whitbread's decision to sell almost all its holdings came as a
surprise to the market.
Mr Alan Perelman, finance director, said 'the sale has released capital for
use in funding the organic expansion of Whitbread's business'. Including
share stakes in larger companies sold earlier this year, Whitbread has now
raised a total of Pounds 300m, bringing its net borrowings almost to zero.
Through BZW, the stockbroker, Whitbread has sold its entire holdings in
Boddington (20 per cent), Greene King (10 per cent), Marston (21 per cent),
Morland (11 per cent), Vaux (7 per cent) and Greenalls (3 per cent). It has
also reduced its holding in Fullers from 18 per cent to 8 per cent, and has
reduced its holding in Breakspear to just below 15 per cent, with Breakspear
the purchaser.
Besides the remaining Fuller and Breakspear shares, Whitbread's holdings in
other drinks companies now comprise 4 per cent of Joseph Holt, 5 per cent of
Hardys and Hanson, 3 per cent of George Gale and 5 per cent of the
cidermaker Bulmer.
The sale marks the final demise of the so-called 'Whitbread umbrella', a
historic arrangement by which Whitbread took shares in regional brewers to
protect them against takeover. However, some companies covered by the
umbrella ended up as part of the Whitbread empire.
By the close of trading yesterday, nearly all the stock was thought to have
been successfully sold. Drinks analysts, who moved quickly to upgrade profit
forecasts for the group yesterday, were unanimous in approving the Whitbread
move. 'This puts the group in a very strong position,' said Mr Geoff Collyer
at NatWest Securities. 'Whitbread can now hit the acquisition trail and we
would expect them to use their ungeared financial position to move further
away from brewing.'
There was widespread agreement that Whitbread's action removes one of the
biggest uncertainties hanging over the domestic drinks sector. With such
large stakes known to be up for sale, speculation had been rife over the
possibility of predators moving in.

FT  11 MAR 94 / BTR shares rise on higher payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in BTR rose 10p to 387p after the UK-based industrial conglomerate
sought to allay market concern by lifting its dividend 13 per cent and
giving an upbeat assessment of recovery prospects.
Pre-tax profits rose 19 per cent to Pounds 1.28bn last year while sales rose
10.5 per cent to Pounds 9.77bn.
Mr Norman Ireland, chairman, said: 'The improvements seen in the US and
Australia in the last quarter of 1993 have been maintained.'
In the UK and continental Europe, with the exception of Germany, recovery
was beginning to emerge, albeit slowly and the expected beneficial impact
had not yet shown through. 'BTR enters 1994 with a confident view,' he said.
Mr Bob Faircloth, chief operating officer, said: 'A little bit of volume
increase will certainly have a larger drop-through to the bottom line in
1994.'
Analysts were pleased that BTR made a fairly modest provision of Pounds 54m
regarding Rexnord, the US industrial manufacturer it bought for Dollars 820m
just before the year-end.
Renewed questions about BTR's use of acquisition accounting was one reason
cited for the relative weakness of the shares last autumn, when a high
conversion rate of warrants increased the stock's liquidity.
Ms Kathleen O'Donovan, finance director, said the group had now used all but
Pounds 30m of the provisions it made against Hawker Siddeley, which it
bought for Pounds 1.55bn in 1991.
The group was carrying forward unutilised provisions of only Pounds 128m,
including the Rexnord figure. Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive, said
criticism that the group had overpaid for Rexnord was also misplaced.
Although most of the US group's business enjoyed a relatively high profit
margin, about a third of its sales made virtually no profit, so there was
plenty of scope for improvement.
Gearing fell from 74 to 63 per cent, after reclassifying convertible notes
as debt, in line with the latest accountancy standard, FRS4. Without Rexnord
and FRS4, gearing would have been 41 per cent, down from 69 per cent.
Earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 22.4p (19.7p). A final dividend of
7.3p gives a total of 12.25p (10.8p).

FT  11 MAR 94 / Review of tax departments threatens thousands of jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sweeping reorganisation of the Treasury's two main tax collecting
departments is being considered by the government in a move which could put
thousands of civil servants' jobs on the line.
Ministers are examining the integration of a number of the functions of the
Inland Revenue and HM Customs &amp; Excise in a bid to cut costs as part of a
wide-ranging review of expenditure. They are also considering any overlap
between the two departments and the Contributions Agency of the Department
of Social Security.
One senior Revenue official said yesterday: 'We don't rule anything in and
we don't rule anything out.' A senior Customs official said: 'Absolutely
anything will be considered.' The exercise - known as the Fundamental
Expenditure Review - is being conducted as part of the government's
long-term spending review co-ordinated by Mr Michael Portillo, chief
Treasury secretary.
Outline details were announced at the time of the Budget last November and
the instructions from ministers to the heads of the Revenue and Customs were
to consider 'radical' proposals.
Interim findings from working groups within the two agencies will be
submitted to ministers over the summer, although any fundamental changes may
take several years to implement.
The examination will include consideration of whether there is needless
duplication in the separate tax investigation roles performed by the
agencies when they are visiting companies.
At Customs, civil servants are examining topics including the way in which
value added tax and excise duties are administered, the operation of its
anti-smuggling activities, and how trade statistics are run.
Opponents of a merger of the central functions of the two departments argue
that it would run contrary to the substantial efforts to decentralise and
delegate power in Customs and the Revenue.
The Treasury wants to show it is not exempt from its own spending
strictures, in order to strengthen its hand in negotiations with other
departments.

FT  11 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Beazer Homes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Hanson has built a small Yorkshire haulier into the ninth most valuable
UK company by timing business cycles near to perfection. Investors should
therefore question the wisdom of buying anything he wants to sell. Those US
investors who subscribed for the Smith Corona flotation would readily
testify that a Hanson cast-off is unlikely to contain much hidden value.
That said, Hanson has done its best to allay such fears about Beazer Homes.
The decision to sell may simply reflect the debt-laden Hanson's aversion to
cash consumptive businesses. Beazer Homes certainly has its attractions. As
the fourth-biggest UK housebuilder, it provides a pure and liquid exposure
to the housing recovery. The price - at 14.5 times historic earnings - is
decidedly modest when set against the sector. But that is for a reason. In
swiftly writing down the value of Beazer's land by Pounds 75m, Hanson has
ensured Beazer boasts fat margins today but leaves little scope for widening
tomorrow.
As has become the irritating modern practice, the maximum allocation of 75
per cent of the shares is going to institutional investors. That makes it
highly unlikely that the issue will flop. Yet Beazer Homes is hardly
screaming to be bought. Much of the sector's rating is predicated on a
return of inflation. Multiples have a long way to unwind if that beast
remains tamed.

FT  11 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The entire aerospace industry is whistling to keep its spirits up in the
long dark night of recession, so it is hardly surprising that Rolls-Royce is
having a hard time. Rolls' tale of stalled civil engines and military orders
in a tail spin has a grim familiarity about it. There is also a sense of
deja vu about its expectation that spares orders must pick up eventually. At
least the management is now realistically cautioning that civil aircraft are
not about to take off. Rolls has also cut its cost base according to its
business, and there was a commendable improvement in stock turn and lowering
of working capital over the past year.
Still, for all Rolls' self-help, others are cutting just as hard, and
savings may simply be lost to the market in lower prices. Shareholders may
also wonder why the rights issue was needed given that average daily
borrowings were less than Pounds 100m last year. Perhaps a combination of
Trent engine development costs, corrosive restructuring provisions, and the
need to help finance industrial power projects demanded a strengthened
balance sheet. If so, extension of the logic suggests that the company might
do better as part of a much larger whole. Certainly the low returns to
shareholders since flotation argues that there is a need for alternative
methods to finance the needs of such long-term capital intensive industries.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's results from BTR should lay a few ghosts to rest. The Pounds 54m
pre-acquisition provision taken against Rexnord, bought in December, looks
moderate when measured against the Dollars 820m purchase price. Since
provisions against Hawker Siddeley are also virtually used up, quality of
earnings should be less of a concern. Neither is it easy to maintain the
argument that BTR is hamstrung by excessive short-term debt following the
Rexnord deal. With at least Pounds 300m a year flowing into the coffers as
investors exercise their warrants, and a creditable record of cash
generation being maintained, BTR could quickly de-gear.
In that case the group deserves to be judged on its ability to increase
sales and rebuild margins. On paper the prospects are promising. Group
margins peaked at 17.5 per cent in 1989, against 15.6 per cent last year.
Since that peak BTR has shed turnover in distribution and reinvested in
potentially higher-margin areas. The Pounds 44m rationalisation costs
included in yesterday's figures show that overheads have been whittled away.
If the previous margin peak can be exceeded this time around the cycle,
there is plenty of profits growth to come. The worry is that organic growth
has so far proved elusive despite improving conditions in North America and
Australasia, which account for almost half of turnover. While the 13 per
cent rise in the dividend signals confidence, BTR will have to prove that it
has lost none of the old line management skills if it is to regain a premium
rating.

FT  11 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Taylor tinkers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays new chief executive, deserves a round of applause
for setting his sights firmly against rights issues. The old tendency to
distribute too much by way of dividends and then go cap in hand to
shareholders when more capital is needed is discredited. The corollary is
that dividend cover must be high enough to permit a decent level of retained
earnings. At first sight Mr Taylor's suggestion that dividends should be at
least twice covered looks pretty tough. Barclays has not managed that since
1988, and its latest dividend is only 1.3 times covered. Look again, though,
and the target may actually be rather lax.
With only minimal effort Barclays should be able to pay large dividend
increases as bad-debt provisions come down. Provisions could fall by half
and still be around 1 per cent of weighted risk assets. But Barclays would
have another Pounds 950m of profits which equates to almost 40p of earnings.
Its 15.15p dividend could then double before the target was breached. The
assumption that Mr Taylor was implicitly promising large dividend increases
helped push the shares higher yesterday.
The worry is whether Barclays would be retaining enough earnings to finance
growth over the longer term. Barclays may think this does not matter while
inflation stays low. It could also improve the mix of its business rather
than expand its balance sheet. That might bring higher operating profits for
a while, but it is a tough challenge when all banks are scrambling for
high-return, low-risk business. Poor prospects for operating revenue have
hurt Lloyds' share price despite its eye-catching returns. It has
underperformed the sector by 40 per cent over the past couple of years.
Barclays must hope that BZW's dynamism will help it escape a similar fate.

FT  11 MAR 94 / US pension funds increase foreign investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US pension funds dramatically increased their overseas investment last year,
with most new cash used to purchase foreign equities, figures released
yesterday confirm.
The value of US pension funds' assets abroad rose by 69 per cent to Dollars
260bn (Pounds 174bn) by the end of 1993, from Dollars 156bn the year before,
according to data from InterSec Research Corp, a US-based investment
consulting firm.
While much of that reflects a rise in stock and bond prices, net new cash
sent abroad by US pension schemes was Dollars 46bn, twice the figure for
1992.
'We are past the time when international assets are an alternative asset
class. Now they are mainstream,' said Mr Jim Waterman, research analyst at
InterSec.
Moreover, US pension schemes are increasingly investing in foreign equities.
Of the new money last year, Dollars 35bn was invested in stocks, more than
four times the Dollars 8bn which went into fixed interest securities. In
1992, Dollars 16bn was invested in equities, just over twice that invested
in bonds.
More than half of the new cash was invested in diversified portfolios in
Europe, Australia and the Far East. Emerging markets received about 7 per
cent of the new cash.
'Our prediction is that the value of US pension assets abroad will grow to
Dollars 700bn by the end of 1998,' Mr Waterman said. The percentage of
assets invested abroad should be 11 to 12 per cent, up from 7 per cent at
the end of 1993. US pension funds have total assets of about Dollars
3,500bn.
US pension funds historically have been reluctant to invest outside the
country. Five years ago, only 3 per cent of their assets were non-US.
Moreover, some of the larger corporate US pension funds have far heavier
than average weightings of international securities, Mr Waterman said.
Mr Robert Angelica, president of AT&amp;T Investment Management, which invests
over Dollars 40bn of pension assets on behalf of the telecommunications
group's employees, said his scheme now had 10 per cent of its assets abroad.
It is now considering raising that to 15 per cent, and may eventually go as
high as 20 per cent. Ten years ago, the AT&amp;T scheme had almost none of its
assets outside the US.
InterSec warned that year-on-year increases in non-domestic US pension fund
investments are unlikely to continue at the current pace. 'This rate of
increase is not sustainable,' Mr Waterman said.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Fimbra chief loses key role in watchdog regime: PIA head to
run admissions process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Godfrey Jillings, chief executive of Fimbra, the self-regulatory
organisation for independent financial advisers, is no longer to manage the
process of deciding who should be authorised by the new watchdog for retail
financial services.
Instead, Ms Colette Bowe, chief executive of the Personal Investment
Authority, will run the admissions process herself. 'This is the most
important aspect of our work at this time, and I've decided to take personal
charge of it,' Ms Bowe said yesterday.
She made the decision last week, after the first meeting of the group
intended to run the PIA's admissions procedure.
Mr Jillings' role in the process had been seen as reassuring independent
financial advisers, many of whom will be among the new body's smaller
members, that their interests would not be ignored.
Many financial advisers have been among the PIA's critics. Mr Jillings'
removal is likely to fuel the campaign already being run by the National
Federation of Independent Financial Advisers against the impending demise of
Fimbra.
'Godfrey is the hero of the IFAs,' one regulator said yesterday. Mr Jillings
himself was unavailable for comment.
The change in the management of the process comes just three weeks or so
after Mr Jillings' role in the admissions project was announced. Work on
admissions will still be carried out by staff drawn from Fimbra and Lautro,
the self-regulatory organisation for the life insurance industry, but
trained to standards set by the PIA.
The admissions process will be central in setting the tone of the new
regulator, which is intended to bring about a 'step change' in investor
protection.
The PIA has already warned that firms and individuals approved by existing
regulators are not guaranteed acceptance in the new regime.
Both Ms Bowe and Mr Joe Palmer, the PIA chairman, faced deeply sceptical
questioning from MPs about the admissions arrangements, when they gave
evidence to the cross-party treasury committee at the House of Commons last
week.
MPs expressed grave doubts that applications to join the new regulator could
be properly handled, given the likely numbers of candidates and the time
available.
The PIA expects to have about 6,000 potential members. Application forms are
due to be returned by early April.

Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the iconoclastic Russian politician, has at last found
a country where, if the red carpets are not exactly unrolling, at least
there's no chance of an official ban - Poland.
Russians don't need visas to visit Poland, so long as they can produce a
valid invitation from a Pole.
Curiously enough, Zhirinovksy has his from something called the Front of
National Self-Defence, a militant nationalist organisation, which regards
mainstream Polish political parties as - how can we put it? - somewhat
lacking in patriotic fervour.
Oddly enough the Front sees no contradiction in inviting a figure who has
publicly advocated a 'common border between Russia and Germany'. Gulp.

Do the problems of dual technology extend to stock exchanges? That is one
for Milan's chamber of commerce, which wants to donate a temporary building
to the Palestinians - on condition that the thing is used as a bourse.
The 'little cage', as it is known to the Italian brokers who have occupied
it since 1987, is to be vacated shortly when rebuilding is complete on the
grand Palazzo Mezzanotte (Midnight) where the market has its permanent home.
Portable stock markets are obviously much sought after by certain sorts of
country; a Baltic republic has already expressed interest in the edifice.
But the authorities would prefer to dispatch all four walls in the direction
of Gaza - 'in the cause of peace'.
Amid these heart-warming sentiments, the Milanese retain a certain
pragmatism, however. If a Palestinian authority is not forthcoming 'within a
non-biblical period of time', they will regretfully have to seek a buyer,
they say.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jeffrey Nichols, managing director of the American Metals Advisors
consultancy group, has been digging into the pitfalls of speaking at
conferences. He revealed yesterday - at the Kalgoorlie Gold Conference  -
what he felt was a key piece of market research on the matter.
Apparently the first speaker at any conference has the full attention of 98
per cent of the audience but by midday that drops to between 60 and 70 per
cent.
By the time the last speaker of the afternoon addresses the audience, no
more than 20 per cent are paying attention; the other 80 per cent are by
that stage deeply engrossed in their own personal sexual fantasies.
So that's why all their eyes are closed.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Observer: Holed up in the bunkers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Diane Graham, owner of a US engineering company, has caused a minor
explosion in the male-dominated recesses of the US golfing establishment.
She has dared question one of the great traditions of golf clubs -
restricted teeing-off times for lady golfers.
Lawyers have been briefed to fight at least a dozen lawsuits which challenge
a practice common at some exclusive golf clubs. The argument for restricting
the ladies' rights to tee off when they want is based on a belief that women
play more slowly. Off the record, old boy, they also occupy the greens for
too long during the so-called 'power hours' when big business does its
deals.
Diane Graham, of Halbrook Country Club, is not amused. 'If you went out to
the club and saw a sign that said blacks and Jewish people can't play until
2 in the afternoon, people would be outraged.' She obviously hasn't tried
out the bunkers in some of the darker corners of Britain's home counties.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Turkish terror
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey is floundering. The currency has collapsed. Inflation has only been
held at about 70 per cent by control of public sector prices, and is
expected to hit triple figures before the end of the year. The government
has financed a consumer boom by reckless borrowing, ahead of local elections
to be held on March 27. Even so, the True Path party of prime minister Tansu
Ciller is running third in the opinion polls, behind the Refah (or
'welfare') party which advocates, as openly as it can get away with, a
reversal of Turkey's 70-year-old secular revolution.
Worst of all, a vicious civil war is raging in the south-east which shows
signs of spreading to the rest of the country, and could even destroy
Turkey's still fragile democracy. More than 10,000 people have died since it
began in 1984. In their increasingly desperate attempts to counter the
terrorism of the Kurdish Workers' party (PKK), Turkey's security forces have
resorted to counter-terror. A month ago the English-language Turkish Daily
News published a list of 874 villages and hamlets in the south-east which
have been forcibly evacuated, some being burnt to the ground to prevent
their inhabitants returning.
Last month five army cadets were killed by a bomb at Tuzla railway station,
near Istanbul. In apparent revenge, the Ankara headquarters of the Democracy
party (DEP) - seen by some Turks as playing Sinn Fein to the PKK's IRA -
were bombed. One person was killed. Mr Hatip Dicle, the DEP leader, refused
to condemn the Tuzla bombing: it was an act of war, he said. This outraged
many Turks, and in particular the armed forces chief of staff, General Dogan
Gures, who de-scribed the DEP's 17 deputies as 'outlaws in parliament' and
'traitors'.
Apparently taking her cue from the chief of staff, Mrs Ciller called for a
vote on long-standing demands for the lifting of the parliamentary immunity
of Mr Dicle and seven other deputies. Last week this was adopted; the
deputies were seized by security forces as they left the parliament
building, and are now in detention. Seven of them face charges of separatism
which potentially carry the death penalty, though in all but one case these
relate to things they have said rather than anything they are alleged to
have done.
Turkey will not solve its Kurdish problem by such methods. It can do so only
if the state addresses the grievances which the PKK exploits. Kurds should
be given the right to education and broadcasting in their own language. They
should be allowed to form their own political parties, choosing their own
programmes, as an alternative to violence. And they must be freed from the
terror of the security forces.
Unhappily, since the death of President Turgut Ozal last April, there seems
to be no Turkish leader with the strength or the courage to propose a
solution on these lines.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Leading Article: French disgrace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government has caved in to pressure from Air France's unions. Its
agreement to provide FFr20bn or more in fresh capital for a company which
lost FFr7.5bn last year cannot be understood from a commercial perspective.
A rational private investor would provide such sums only if there was a plan
to stop the financial haemorrhaging fast. The flag-carrier's softly-softly
approach does not constitute such a plan.
The explanation for the hand-out is political. Mr Edouard Balladur is
reaping the bitter rewards for appeasing the unions last November, when they
brought France's airports to a halt in protest at an earlier restructuring
plan. He followed a similar approach in dealing with rioting French
fishermen.
But it is not just French taxpayers who will pay the price of aid to Air
France. The subsidies distort competition in the European Union's newly
liberalised aviation market. The question is whether the European Commission
will also cave in to political pressure and approve the hand-outs.
The Commission's overall intention is clear: it would like to stop state
aid. Brussels is battling against strong political interests at a time when
its authority is weak. Although Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark are
expected to urge it to be tough, other countries which plan to bail out
their own financially stricken airlines could side with France.
Moreover, the Commission may find itself impaled on its own doctrine that
subsidies can be provided on a 'one time, last time' basis. In Air France's
case, this is something of a misnomer. It has already received FFr7.3bn in
four tranches since 1991 and the new hand-outs will be provided in three
tranches. According to some calculations, that makes seven dollops of aid,
not one.
But Brussels may not see it that way. It mistakenly viewed the first set of
tranches as normal financial transactions rather than subsidies and so,
under the doctrine, Air France still has one last chance. It may be that the
French government has decided to make the most of this last chance by
agreeing to such a large capital injection.
While it is probably unrealistic to expect the Commission to block all aid
to Air France, it should reject the current plan. The carrier should be
required to make deeper cuts, if necessary softening the blow with generous
redundancy payments. Some way must also be found to limit the damage to Air
France's rivals, for example by preventing the carrier from dumping
subsidised seats on highly contested routes.
The Commission may not have the stomach for a fight. But a failure to tackle
the issue forcefully would badly undermine its overall state aid policy.
While a hard line would provoke a war of words, in the end Mr Balladur might
thank Brussels. The faster Air France is returned to viability, the sooner
he can press ahead with plans to privatise the carrier.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Leading Article: The attack on Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish Republican Army's attack on Heathrow airport was not its bloodiest
since the Anglo-Irish Downing Street declaration in December, but it was
certainly its boldest. Heathrow ranks alongside the City of London, itself
devasted by an IRA bomb last year, as a prime and heavily defended target.
The assault does not prove that the republican movement will never respond
favourably to the carefully crafted words of the declaration, but it appears
to confirm that it is unlikely to do so soon. For the IRA, the war goes on.
The British government thus finds itself under increasing pressure to
abandon the terms of a declaration seen by its opponents as an act of
appeasement calculated only to encourage terrorists to increase the
deadliness of their bargaining tactics.
Mr John Major was wise to rule out any such course of action yesterday. The
declaration may or may not be capable of ending Ulster's troubles one day,
but it has already yielded benefits which should not be lightly set aside.
It has accelerated the convergence of view between London and Dublin that
coercion has no part to play in shaping Ireland's future. It has provided a
basis upon which all but the most extreme of the north's constitutional
parties have felt, at least briefly, able to imagine political progress.
Against this background, it is encouraging that a series of recent opinion
polls north and south of the border has shown a large majority in favour of
a settlement based upon the Downing Street principles.
The unpleasant truth facing Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish
counterpart, is that in spite of these advances, peace may not be in sight.
The IRA's political position is weaker than it was in December, but it is by
no means defeated.
A future thus offers itself of yet more agonisingly slow progress,
punctuated by atrocities which create a sense of reeling backwards. The
agenda for progress should include further efforts, in consultation with the
province's constitutional parties, to devolve government functions from
Westminster to Belfast. A more harmonious political relationship between
London and Dublin should also yield more effective security co-operation
between north and south.
The agenda also needs to involve deepening the political consensus about
Ulster's future at Westminster. The only false political step made by the
government this week has been its handling of an approach from the
leadership of the Labour party to try to forge agreement upon the future of
the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The party political crowing of Mr Michael
Howard, the home secretary, during the debate on this act, which was itself
interrupted by the news from Heathrow, lacked statesmanship.
The political tide is moving, however slowly, against the IRA. This is not a
time either for cheap shots, or for lurches in approach.

FT  11 MAR 94 / In a flap at feeding time: Plans to inject capital into Air
France highlight Europe's problems over state aid to the public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government's plan to inject capital of at least FFr20bn into Air
France, its financially stricken flag-carrier, may bring to the boil a row
that has been simmering over the past year.
At the heart of the dispute about state hand-outs to public sector companies
are fears that some governments are distorting the single European market by
unfair subsidies.
That is the charge made by British Airways, one of Air France's fiercest
rivals: 'State hand-outs are unfair and distort the air transport industry.'
Other non-aided airlines, such as Holland's KLM and Germany's Lufthansa, are
also expected to be furious.
The proposed capital injection for Air France is an important test for the
European Commission, which is struggling to bring state aid to industry
under control. Under the Treaty of Rome and Treaty of Paris, Brussels has
responsibility for policing subsidies.
It is hard to see how the Commission could allow the Air France plan through
in its current form without a loss of credibility. But the French government
is not in a mood to compromise either. Mr Bernard Bosson, the French
transport minister, said he would be prepared to 'battle with Brussels to
get a green light' to proceed with the plan. A long drawn-out dispute is in
prospect.
Air France is just the largest in a series of troubled flag-carriers that
have recently received subsidies from their governments or are shortly
expected to seek them. Others include Spain's Iberia, Ireland's Aer Lingus,
Portugal's TAP and Greece's Olympic.
Nor are hand-outs confined to the airline industry. Before this week's Air
France announcement, the controversy had been most bitter in the steel
industry, which has been badly hit by the recession. Non-aided steel groups
are so enraged at the European Union's decision last December to sanction
Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.3bn) in subsidies to their public sector rivals that they
have pulled out of an industry-wide restructuring scheme.
Mr Karel Van Miert, European competition commissioner, and Mr Martin
Bangemann, industry commissioner, are scheduled to meet European steel
chiefs on March 23 in an attempt to resolve the crisis. But Mr Brian Moffat,
British Steel's chairman, has threatened to boycott the meeting unless there
is an end to subsidies.
The Commission is also investigating scores of other state aid cases. The
most prominent is Groupe Bull, the French public sector computer group,
which is about to ask Mr Van Miert to approve a new restructuring plan
involving state subsidies.
UK companies feel particularly cheated by such subsidies. Companies such as
British Steel and British Airways were privatised in the 1980s and had to
cut costs savagely. They feel their rivals in other countries should do
likewise.
Many companies are angry because this is not the first time their aided
rivals have received state cash. For example:
Air France received FFr5.8bn (Pounds 670m) in three tranches in 1991 and
1992 from the French government, the then state-owned Banque Nationale de
Paris and an international banking consortium. Last year there was a
FFr1.5bn bond issue taken up by the state-owned Caisse des Depots, which is
being investigated by the Commission. The airline still lost FFr7.5bn last
year and has debts of FFr37bn.
Ilva, the Italian steel group, and Finsider, the bankrupt group from which
Ilva was formed in 1988, received Ecu11.3bn in state aid during the 1980s.
The Commission sanctioned another Ecu2.6bn last December.
In Bull's case, the Commission authorised a FFr6.68bn capital injection in
1992. The French government provided another FFr2.5bn last February and its
current plan involves the injection of a further FFr8.6bn.
The non-aided companies believe this flow of subsidies is damaging their
interests. In the steel industry, aid has kept inefficient public sector
groups in business and so depressed prices, says Mr Brian Moffat. 'We have
had an unnecessarily long price war, which has been maintained by subsidised
losses.'
One consequence of propping up state companies could be the closure of more
efficient, private-sector plants. Private enterprises are being asked by the
Commission to cut up to 25m tonnes of capacity, while the aided groups have
agreed to cut only 5m tonnes.
Similarly, British Airways argues that subsidies to Air France are
undermining its ability to expand in the French market through its
associate, TAT. 'It is pretty clear that Air France is trying to eliminate
competition in the domestic market,' says Mr David Holmes, BA's government
relations director.
Competitors of aided companies are not the only ones who are worried.
Economists fret that state aid is delaying the necessary restructuring of
European industry, and so harming the region's overall competitiveness.
Scarce resources are being wasted on bailing out lame ducks instead of being
invested in companies with brighter futures, they say.
Many governments accept this analysis, but have to tailor their policies to
take account of political realities. Ending subsidies overnight would often
lead to bankruptcies and job cuts. Most national politicians prefer to
minimise opposition by phasing aid out gradually. The pressure to compromise
is particularly strong in sectors such as airlines, steel and coal, which
are often seen as strategically important.
The French government, for example, had to abandon its original
restructuring plan for Air France last autumn after workers went on strike.
The new plan is a softer version, which involves only 5,000 redundancies out
of a total workforce of 42,000 - all of them voluntary.
Even the UK, which has taken the toughest line against state aid, was forced
last year to offer subsidies to its coal industry, after a revolt by members
of parliament over plans to close most of the country's pits.
In the steel sector, Spain decided to provide Ecu2.8bn in subsidies to
state-owned CSI in order to save jobs in the politically explosive Basque
region. Similarly, Germany gave Ecu428m in aid to Ekostahl rather than close
eastern Germany's only large steel mill.
Although the Commission has the power to order governments to stop
subsidies, it too has to take account of political considerations. Officials
fear that an uncompromising crackdown could provoke a public backlash, with
Brussels being blamed for bankruptcies and job losses. Some believe too
harsh a line could also destabilise member states. 'Can you say that
fairness must be considered more important than public order, terrorism and
the stability of institutions?' asks one official.
Mr Robert Coleman, head of the Commission's transport directorate, points
out that the Treaty of Rome does not ban aid totally. Subsidies may be
sanctioned so long as they are in the Union's 'common interest', something
the Commission has discretion in defining. 'The Commission has a
juridico-political judgment to make. It is not a mathematical exercise,' he
says.
Nevertheless, the Commission's overall aim is to curb state aid. Since the
mid-1980s, a succession of competition commissioners - first Mr Peter
Sutherland, then Sir Leon Brittan and now Mr Van Miert - has progressively
tightened policy.
They have put a greater emphasis on monitoring aid flows. The Commission
produced its first catalogue of subsidies in 1989. It has also established
special task forces to monitor aid in Italy and eastern Germany, because of
the size of the problem in both areas.
In addition, the Commission last year passed rules requiring all governments
to file annual returns about the finances of their public sector companies.
This is to make sure that subsidies do not sneak through without the
Commission finding out. 'We are learning a lot in this way,' says Mr Van
Miert.
The Commission has also become more insistent that aid can be approved only
if it is part of a viable restructuring plan. This accounts for much of the
horse-trading between the Commission and national governments.
In steel, for example, the Commission initially rejected restructuring plans
for Ilva, Ekostahl and CSI. It finally agreed only after the companies
promised capacity cuts to reduce their financial outlays and so increased
their chances of becoming profitable in the long run.
A similar process is under way with Air France and Bull. The Commission will
probably approve subsidies in the end, but only if there are commitments to
more radical cost-cutting than was contained in their original plans.
Linked to this tougher line is a policy that groups should receive no second
helpings of aid. Companies can receive one last hand-out to return them to
viability but, after that, they are on their own.
The doctrine, which is known as 'one time, last time', was first applied in
the airline industry, when Mr Van Miert was transport commissioner. It also
featured in December's steel deal, and Mr Van Miert would like to see it
spread to other industries.
But the policy applies only to companies which have been explicitly warned
that they are receiving aid for the last time. So Sabena and Aer Lingus are
covered, but not Air France. Although the French airline received capital
injections from its government after the policy began, the Commission did
not judge them to be subsidies at the time. It considered them normal
financial transactions.
This does not mean the Commission will necessarily approve the new Air
France capital injection. It could object either on the grounds that the
restructuring is insufficient to create a viable enterprise or that the
subsidy is so large that the consequent distortion of competition is against
the Union's common interest.
Non-aided companies argue that the 'one time, last time' doctrine is not
tough enough. BA's Mr Holmes asks: 'Why shouldn't the presumption be that
Air France can cut its networks, reduce its staff and sell its hotel chain
as British Airways did?'
Meanwhile, British Steel wants European industry ministers to make a solemn
pledge that there will be no further steel subsidies when they meet next
month. This would apply not just to those companies receiving aid as part of
December's deal, but the whole sector. 'The steel industry has had enough,'
says Mr Moffat.
Another idea is that aid should be contingent on a company being privatised.
This proposal was contained in a recent report on the airline industry by a
committee of 'wise men' set up to advise the Commission.
Commission officials argue that they cannot formally tie aid to
privatisation, since the Treaty of Rome does not allow them to discriminate
between public and private ownership. But they can apply a 'premium to
privatisation', because the fact that a company is being prepared for
privatisation enhances the credibility of its restructuring plan. It is also
the best guarantee that subsidies are being provided for the last time.
Privatisation plans were taken into consideration in the steel subsidy deal.
Italy pledged to privatise Ilva, while Germany and Spain promised that new
investment in Ekostahl and CSI would be financed in partnership with the
private sector. Similarly, the French government intends to privatise both
Air France and Bull.
'The pace of privatisation is speeding up. A whole new raft of countries and
industries is being prepared for privatisation,' explains Mr Oliver Letwin,
a director at merchant bankers N M Rothschild. This trend suggests that
state aid to public sector enterprises will eventually be brought under
control.
For non-aided airline and steel groups facing unfair competition from their
state-owned rivals, however, that is not the way things look. But the
long-run prognosis is more optimistic. Europe may be witnessing the death
throes of a practice that many believe has debilitated its industry for
decades.

FT  11 MAR 94 / The FT Interview: Steadily doing it his own way - P V
Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT and STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister who is visiting the UK next
week, says India's economy is changing faster than at any time since he
entered politics 25 years ago.
But he believes the pro-market reforms he launched in mid-1991 should not be
rushed, for fear of provoking potential enemies of liberalisation. The
government must consider those who might be hurt by over-rapid change -
workers in state-enterprises, bureaucrats and the poor.
Sitting in his teak-panelled office dominated by a gold icon-like painting
of Mahatma Gandhi, Mr Narasimha Rao speaks confidently and without notes. He
emphasises his commitment to bringing the benefits of modernisation to the
country's many villages, and argues there is now a consensus for change. For
instance, 'the inhibition which some people had in accepting foreign
investment has been reduced to a very considerable extent'.
India needs a balanced approach to reform - what he has sometimes called
'the middle way'. Private investment, including foreign capital, is welcome
but the large public sector also has a continuing role; workers at
loss-making, overmanned plants might be made redundant but there should be
no large-scale dismissals.
The aim is to find a happy medium - and avoid political upsets. The prime
minister's approach reflects the deep-rooted caution of a 72-year-old
politician who has spent decades climbing the greasy pole and is now
determined to keep his grip. He has recent experience of the fickleness of
political fortune.
Last summer, his government seemed on its last legs. Buffeted by the unrest
which followed the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque, by internal wrangling in
the ruling Congress (I) party and by financial scandal, Mr Narasimha Rao
survived a parliamentary vote of no confidence by the narrowest of margins.
But in the autumn, electoral success in state-level polls in northern India
restored his authority.
Seen as a stop-gap when he took over from the assassinated Rajiv Gandhi in
1991, he is now expected to lead his party at least until the next general
election due by mid-1996. Already he has lasted longer than any other prime
minister outside the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. As Mr Narasimha Rao himself says:
'(Now) nobody is asking me political questions whether my government is
going to last or not.'
Despite his support for pro-market reforms, Mr Narasimha Rao still carries
with him a fondness for the Nehruvian socialism with which he grew up. At
one point in the interview, he says India needs 'massive doses of
investment', including foreign investment. In a revealing flourish, he says:
'When I talk of foreign investment I don't necessarily mean foreign in the
sense of a foreign country. What is outside the government is foreign.'
Like Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, and his daughter,
Indira Gandhi, Mr Narasimha Rao believes strongly in India's right to
determine its own future. Even though the country is opening up to
international influence, India must be free to choose where it admits
foreigners and where it does not. Foreigners are welcome to invest,
especially in infrastructure, but not to involve themselves in culturally
sensitive fields such as education. 'The World Bank is not going to build my
schools for me. No foreign country is going to run my schools. I won't allow
it.'
The highest priority goes to developing infrastructure, otherwise
bottlenecks will block growth. 'We want power. We want roads. We want
massive expansion of ports,' says the prime minister. By attracting private
investment into infrastructure, the government will be able to channel more
of its own funds into health, education and rural projects. 'This is
happening. In the next two or three years, people will actually see the
change.'
Mr Narasimha Rao says he has induced a sense of urgency into the bureaucracy
to speed the implementation of reforms. But he warns potential investors
that the administration has a pace of its own which cannot be rushed too
much for fear of 'causing breakdowns' which would take time to put right.
And few investors appreciate that India is a federation in which the central
government has limited authority over the constituent states. 'I can only
bless an investor with a cup of tea and say go ahead. Beyond that I cannot
(act).'
Mr Narasimha Rao says the recent annual budget fits squarely into the
government's strategy. Ever the politician, he singles out for comment not
the tax and customs duty cuts or the rise in public borrowing which grabbed
the headlines in India's English-language press. Instead, he talks of what
matters most in village India - large increases in rural public works
spending.
The fiscal deficit has jumped to an estimated 7.3 per cent of gross domestic
product for the year ending this month, compared with a 4.7 per cent target.
He admits his government is taking a risk to promote growth. 'We have had a
long series of sittings on this. Whether we should take the risk. Finally we
said yes.'
However, labour market reforms and the management of India's bloated public
sector are a rather different matter. The prime minister says that 'balance'
is important in assessing the labour laws, which have been criticised by
economists for the strict controls placed on employers' rights to dismiss
workers.
He believes the labour laws have not come in the way of investment. But the
government must 'restructure the entire gamut of labour legislation' and
this will 'take a little time'. Meanwhile, loss-making enterprises will be
wound up where necessary and other jobs will be sought for the workers. 'So
you find on both fronts - on the industrialists' side as well as the labour
side - there is no complaint.'
Radical change is unlikely. 'How can we hire and fire? Where does (the
worker) go? This is not America. Another job is waiting for him. I just
cannot do that. I have to see that he's re-employed . . . Those who are
asking me these questions should also go into what kind of industrial
climate I have here.'
Mr Narasimha Rao also believes critics are paying 'disproportionate
attention' to public sector reform. After all, there is already a large
private sector in the Indian economy. 'Please exploit that first. Don't
bother about what I do with my public sector . . . If it is sick, send it to
the hospital. If it dies, it dies.'
The prime minister suggests he might extend the present divestment programme
under which up to 49 per cent of an enterprise can be sold off. 'In the
course of time' this figure might rise, he says. But he also indicates his
suspicion of large-scale privatisation. 'If some public sector unit is doing
well, I don't see any reason why I should sell it . . . If I do it
(disinvestment) immediately, I get into trouble. I get trouble from the
workers. I get trouble from the political parties. I get trouble from the
general public. Please understand that in this country the public sector has
come to occupy a respectable place and I cannot afford to go against it.'
Mr Narasimha Rao is optimistic about India's future, in part because of its
huge reservoir of well-educated people. 'Our population may be large but the
level of technological training is rich. So I don't see any difficulty in
the rapid industrialisation of India.'
He also talks enthusiastically about improving relations with Britain,
including strengthening trade and investment links. He says: 'Relations
between these two countries could have become bitter given the history . . .
Some people used to ask me: 'How can you have any relations with those who
were your masters, who exploited you?' I said history is something which we
have to make. You can't avenge history. History is there. Making history.
That's the only way.'

FT  11 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Abbey questions takeover anomaly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER G BIRCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Lex Column ('Abbey National', March 5) raises some important issues
about takeovers of building societies by public companies, and the benefits
which these could produce for the members, as owners of the society.
However, there is a serious obstacle to such acquisitions under the law as
it stands.
The directors of a building society may reject an approach from a third
party without even referring it to their members. Unlike a bid for a public
company, where control over whether to accept an offer for their shares lies
with shareholders, that third party is not able to gain access to the
individual members.
Consequently, the members may never know that they could have unlocked the
value of their ownership - either at the price originally suggested by the
third party or at a higher one subsequently required to win the members'
approval. This seems to be an anomaly which sits oddly with current concern
that boards should be accountable to the owners of the business.
The government is currently considering deregulation proposals which would
give building societies additional freedom of action. It should at the same
time also consider building society corporate governance issues.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: A narrowness of vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr V N U WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Given your evidence ('PM denies unions a voice on Bank's governing
body', March 5) of Mr Gavin Laird's competence as a director of the Bank of
England, the prime minister's refusal to reappoint him reveals a mean
conception of government's role as guardian of our public institutions.
To state that directors of the Bank are appointed because of their
'individual expertise' suggests, if it means anything, that only
money-changers need apply.
Expertise in the field of industrial relations can presumably be ignored.
Furthermore the notion of Mr Laird 'representing other institutions'
supposes a paper tiger which the TUC would itself be wise to shred. Mr Laird
would be representing nothing but a widely held, and sadly ignored, desire
for the sort of co-operation across commercial boundaries which the UK
economy so badly needs.
Functionality may be necessary, but is not a sufficient guideline for the
running of public institutions like the Bank.
This appointment may be a trifle in itself but it in fact points to an all
too familiar narrowness of vision, the chief result of which has been the
separation of the enterprise culture from many of those whom it was intended
to serve.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not so much funny as wrong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOSEPH ROSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was disappointed by last week's Observer ('We like sheep', March 3)
which labelled IT people as 'only glorified electricians' and further
likened them to cleaners and tea ladies.
While your special brand of sardonic wit is usually quite well received,
even on this side of the Atlantic, in this case the humour escapes me.
Aside from the smug and elitist slap at people who roll their sleeves up at
work, the point is that you are dead wrong. The leading securities and
investments companies would no doubt agree there is no function more
critical for their continued success than IT as an integral part of the
company's overall business strategy.
Firms that ignore this do so at their peril, and risk going out of business
like many before.
Perhaps it is such antiquated attitudes that helped lead to the Taurus
debacle. I submit your loyal readers do not find having flushed some Dollars
600m down the tubes over the past decade very funny.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Corporate users in - hackers out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER DAWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As managing director of a commercial Internet access provider, I was
interested and concerned by Louise Kehoe's piece on Internet security
(Technology: 'Crime on the line', March 3).
It is time people heard a commercial Internet provider's view of security,
as there has been no small measure of ambulance-chasing since the advisory
on Internet security was issued on February 4 by the Computer Emergency
Response Team, the US government-sponsored group responsible for Internet
security.
The 'Trojan Horse' program described in that advisory is nothing new. It is
one of the oldest hacker tricks in the book, and has happened at many other
non-Internet sites. Existing measures and technology for implementing
security on the Internet are sufficient and economic: all that is needed is
education, and careful and thorough deployment.
The 'tens of thousands' of Internet accounts that have been broken -
academic or otherwise - would constitute just a tiny fraction of the
millions of Internet users, and the CERT action will meet their problems.
The message to emerge from all this is simple: the majority of Internet
providers are responsible and take adequate security measures. Such
providers are as responsible as phone companies in dealing with security
issues, and security practices at commercial sites are in general much more
rigorous than at academic or hobbyist sites. These commercial-quality
systems have not, to our knowledge, been affected in the recent scare.
To liken these security measures to burglar alarms is not analogous. Alarms
go off after burglary has been committed - Internet gateways are intended to
keep unwanted access out, as much as for facilitating data exchange with
other networks, and IBM and other leading corporate users of the commercial
Internet appreciate this fact.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Tally-ho for a cruel but therapeutic hunt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Touch down in Washington and the first thing you hear is the baying of
hounds, the clip-clop of horses in the early morning mist. The great
American game of hunt-the-president is on again. It destroyed Richard Nixon,
rattled Ronald Reagan, and badly damaged George Bush. Nothing about this
cruel sport is certain, but it is possible that President Bill Clinton may
turn out to be a more elusive quarry than his predecessors. Nearly cornered
a week ago, he has started to deploy the only defensive mechanism available
to him: an intense effort to behave in an honest, open manner or, to be
precise, to appear to do so. It might save him from the worst, if he or his
wife Hillary really have little or nothing to hide. The trouble is, you
never can tell.
To the visitor returning to what was once home ground, it is all slightly
baffling. The original charge against the Clintons was that, when he was
governor of Arkansas and Hillary was a prominent lawyer in the state's most
favoured law firm, they benefited, or may have benefited, from using their
powerful names and consequent influence in arranging a land deal that lost
money.
This account will spare you any further unravelling of what has come to be
known as Whitewater, after the name of the acreage involved. The central
point is that, if the governor of an insignificant southern state and his
wife did use their connections to engage in some fiddle-faddle or other, few
Americans would be surprised. It would be wrong, but it would not
necessarily constitute a federal case against a married couple that became
president 15 years later. This, certainly, was the view of fund managers I
consulted at a conference in Phoenix, Arizona, earlier this week.
At the next level of iniquity, and potential danger for the Clintons, stands
the 'good ol' boy' question. To what extent was the mentality of Little
Rock, in which everyone knows everyone else, imported into the White House,
along with the cronies with whom Mr Clinton surrounded himself? The Arkansas
instinct may well have been to square departments, to fix matters so that
the governor would always be in the clear, perhaps do favours for Hillary.
Was this transferred to Washington?
An independent special prosecutor, Robert Fiske, has begun to question White
House officials. He has promised to report on their behaviour within a
couple of months. Mr Fiske seems to be as determined to establish the truth
as is Lord Justice Scott in his inquiry into the probity of UK politicians
and officials who changed the rules on selling arms to Iraq. The difference
is that Mr Fiske is a Republican, while Lord Scott is a judge.
That leaves the many and varied theories of deeper and darker doings. If any
of these turns out to be true, the analogy with Watergate and Nixon, at
present far-fetched, will become worth drawing. It is whispered that Dollars
250,000 may have been illegally contributed by an Arkansas institution to Mr
Clinton's 1992 presidential election campaign. No evidence accompanied that
particular charge. Other whispers, equally free-floating, surround the
suicide of the deputy counsel at the White House, Mr Vincent Foster. He was
a Little Rock colleague and friend of Hillary. Mr Fiske expects to take much
longer - perhaps a year or two - before he can report on such accusations.
So far Mr Clinton and his wife have been only slightly damaged. Some of this
is self-inflicted, arising from their reluctance to come clean at the very
beginning. The appointment of Mr Fiske was forced on the president. This,
say Democrats and Republicans alike, was 'dumb'.
Against that, most Americans find the Whitewater affair impossible to
understand. They respond to words like 'cover up' and 'shredder' because
they have been trained to do so over the past 20 years. Yet one of this
week's opinion polls suggests that very few of them believe that Mr Clinton
is guilty of financial impropriety. Another indicates that Hillary is still
held in high regard ('honest', 'trustworthy'), while her husband is almost
as well thought of. The couple's ratings are falling, but they have not
descended anywhere near to the depths plumbed by heads of government across
the Atlantic.
The Republicans, understandably, cannot believe their luck. The visible,
smirking insincerity of senators Alfonse D'Amato and Robert Dole, as they
press for juicy congressional hearings into the whole mess, brings a tear of
recognition to the eye. These are the hounds of revenge - revenge for
Watergate, revenge for Iran-Contra, revenge for the insult of having a
Democrat in the White House. The degree to which they damage the Clintons
depends in the end on how culpable the dual presidency is in reality. What
all the false posturing of the senators may achieve, however, is a delay or
even cancellation of the Clinton legislative programme, including Hillary's
proposals on healthcare, now widely believed to be dead in the water, and
welfare reform.
None of this should diminish our admiration for the American system.
Hunt-the-president is painful, but ultimately healthy. It culled Mr Nixon,
the worst offender since the US media institutionalised the game. An
unwritten amendment to the constitution stipulates that being caught
concealing the truth can seriously - perhaps fatally - injure a presidency.
This is hugely superior to the British way in which the truth is measured in
droplets, and liars do not necessarily resign even if they are found out.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Folly of wind power policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN S L EDWARDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Future generations will look back on hilltop wind power stations as one
of the tragic follies of the 1990s.
Tragic because, on this crowded island, hills are the last of our extensive,
undeveloped places. Millions of us love and use the hills because they
restore our spirits and our vitality.
A folly because even the latest, 350ft high turbines only generate
electricity equivalent to that used by 170 people.
Yet the unreliable nature of the wind means that not one existing power
station can be demolished, or even switched off, because instant back-up has
to be maintained.
Parliament in its now typical rush into new, half-cocked, ill-considered
regulations has distorted the market and produced a situation where
speculators can make a fortune while hypocritically wearing the mask of
environmental rectitude.
Each turbine costs about Pounds 150,000 and will go on to earn its developer
Pounds 170,000 a year. Of this income nearly Pounds 120,000 is clear profit
and is enabled by a compulsory levy on all our electricity bills - from rich
and poor alike.
Are there any MPs with the influence and foresight to lead a change in this
misguided policy?

FT  11 MAR 94 / Arts: The Maid of Orleans - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The enterprising Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester launched its
spring opera season on Tuesday with a Tchaikovsky rarity, The Maid of
Orleans.
It is a brave project, boldly realised, with no expense spared. Since the
strange decision was made to give the opera in Russian, even surtitles were
specially provided. There could have been no question of borrowing them: no
Western company has ventured the opera in recent years.
At present, Tchaikovsky's historical drama survives only in the Bolshoy's
repertory - ironic, since in writing it, the composer was making a conscious
bid for popularity. His attempt to copy the conventions of French grand
opera won acclaim at the St Petersburg premiere in 1881, but the
assassination shortly afterwards of Alexander II led to the curtailment of
the theatre season, and The Maid of Orleans was not revived again in Russia
during Tchaikovsky's lifetime.
Its neglect is not hard to fathom. But even if, as many believe, The Maid is
Tchaikovsky's dullest opera, this performance showed it to be more than a
mere curiosity, and worthy of the occasional revival. The music is not
vintage Tchaikovsky - some episodes bear his distinctive stamp, but too
often he falls back on overblown gesture - yet the real weaknesses are
dramatic: the opera's chief source, Schiller's tragedy, is diluted by
interpolations and the simplified, sentimentalised treatment of Jeanne d'Arc
herself.
The production by Stefan Janski, the RNCM's director of opera studies, is
solid and straightforward, probably the best way of tackling such a
sprawling piece. Most of the public scenes are splendid, and only the royal
entertainments in Act Two seemed tedious (and the anachronistic acrobats
tasteless). Charles Cusick Smith's versatile sets allow for Jeanne's
striking angelic visions, and colourful costumes complete the spectacle.
In Russia, The Maid of Orleans is reserved as a vehicle for star mezzos, and
without Jane Irwin's vocal strengths, the RNCM could not have contemplated
staging it. Her performance in the taxing title role was as affecting as the
superficial characterisation allows; her rich, lustrous tone which extends
to a powerful top makes her a mezzo to watch.
With the exception of the tenor roles, the opera was strongly cast, and
three other singers stood out: Martin Snell (Thibault), Ashley Holland
(Dunois), and the Ukrainian soprano Nataliya Kompaniyets (Agnes), who
brought Slavonic authenticity to Tchaikovsky's music.
Paul McGrath welded his vast forces - large orchestra, off-stage band,
organ, and an excellent chorus - with flair.
Sponsor: The Royal Bank of Scotland. Further performances: March 12,16,22,
and 25 (061-273 4504).

FT  11 MAR 94 / Arts: Not quite cricket - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sometimes a note of translation may be in order. The word 'yaar', as in
Wicked Yaar, Garry Lyons's sprightly new play at the Cottesloe, is roughly
the Punjabi equivalent of the English 'mate', as in 'matey' rather than
'mating'. It is thus a term of affection. 'Wicked' in modern English is a
term of approbation.
The play is about the difficulty of bringing English and Asians together.
Wicked Yaar is a mix of Asian fairy tale, Yorkshire comedy and racial
prejudice. There is also an injection of cricket, on the assumption that
this is the game that brings all good people together. On the whole, the
cricket comes out on top.
Malik Mir, played by Ravik Aujla like an aspiring Pakistani all-rounder,
wants to be the first Asian to be picked by his county. The trouble is that
the local English youth are more interested in being bovver boys (and girls)
for Leeds United. They declare the short cut to the cricket ground a no-go
area for blacks and attempt to intimidate Malik.
Then the spirits come to the rescue. Malik finds a medallion which, when
rubbed, brings a genie to his side who sees off the thugs, helps the family
finances by cheating the inland revenue through computer hacking, and
improves the cricket. The reason why Malik scores a match-winning 20 off
three balls in the final of the schools trophy is that he has hit the third
for only two, but the invisible genie flings it on for six overthrows.
Directed by John Turner, the cricket scenes are very engagingly done. Even
here there is a twist in the plot. The captain of the rival team is a smart
white girl who knows that, however good she is, she can never play for the
county 'because it's a man's club'. Malik consoles her with the line that at
least England win at the women's game. A decent Asian boy and a decent
English girl unite in their dislike of bigotry: fairy tale stuff all round.
There are other pleasures. The amiable genie, or ghul, takes to chewing gum
as if it were nectar and regards the local ASDA supermarket as a veritable
palace of delights. There is a lot of rap, especially in the cricket
commentary, and some prolonged bhangra dancing. The design by Nigel
Prabhavalkar is excellent.
Whether it all hangs together is probably a subjective judgment. The piece
runs out of ideas towards the end: it struck me as feeble to conclude that
it was all a dream, and while there may be a case for reverse
discrimination, the treatment of white working class youth in Wicked Yaar
carries it beyond the plausible. Can it really be that all poor inner-city
whites are so awful and all Asian immigrants so virtuous? Perhaps a little
too much preaching.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Arts: Davidson's 'Sinderella' - Pantomime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sinderella, Jim Davidson's adult pantomime, does not mess about. Within the
first minute happy panto words like 'fairy' and 'ball' are given the
broadest possible meaning. Anyone looking for subtlety and wit is in for a
bumpy ride.
There is a good argument for taking the soppiness out of panto, standing
what has become a sanitised, politically correct, institution, on its head.
Unfortunately this is not a good argument, but a perverse rant, a dive
behind the infant school lavatory rather than a voyage of sophisticated
innuendo: 'innuendo' being an Italian suppository in Jim-speak.
But if you stick it out there are some glimmers of gold in the vulgarity.
Roger Kitter and Dave Lee give some meat to the Ugly Sisters, who in most
pantos these days are reduced to ridiculous clothes horses. Occasionally
they get high on ad libs, building up to ever more barbed insults, mainly
directed at 1960s heart throb Jess Conrad's Prince Charming, who is cruelly
asked to sing a 'medley of your hit'.
There is also simple pleasure to be had in adding up the ages of the cast.
Jim Davidson must be running a charity for indigent actors. As well as
Conrad, who manages to keep his smile in place despite the inconvenience of
a giant dildo in his tights, there is Dianne Lee, relict of Peters and Lee,
who simpers gamely as Cinders, even when Davidson reminisces about being
taken by his mother to see her sing.
Most remarkable of all, Charlie Drake has been wheeled out of obscurity as
Baron Hardon. 'A test pilot for Johnny Walker' according to Jim, Charlie is
supposed to be in a state of senile bewilderment, mixing his 'Chippendales'
with his 'Chipperfields', and the object of easy laughter. I fear many of
the gags are planted and Drake's detached sneer was often an apt comment on
the shenanigans.
The sets and costumes are lavish; the plot faithfully followed, down to a
terminally unfunny haunted house sketch and the flattest ballet scene in
pantomime history. And if you want your mind stretched by watching three
naked men hide their embarrassment behind leaky balloons this is your show.
There was no free press access. Perhaps it only seemed so sad and brutal
because the tickets are expensive. The audience, including many theatrical
virgins, were shocked into submission. They probably thought it was a normal
night in the West End rather than one man's curious ego trip.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Arts: Crisis in the Commonwealth - The Institute, cultural
showcase for the nations of the former British Empire, seems set to go the
way of the Empire itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monday is Commonwealth Day but at the concrete pavilion of the Commonwealth
Institute in Kensington, celebrations will be muted. Commonwealth
secretary-general, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, will host a reception for a host of
sporting celebrities, but their hearts will not be in it.
For the Institute, set up in 1958 as the cultural showcase for the nations
of the former British Empire, seems set to go the way of the Empire itself.
The arts and educational centre, which houses 12,000 artifacts from more
than 50 nations, is to lose its entire Pounds 2.7 million subsidy from the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
'The news came nine days after our development report was published, which
we were feeling very pleased with, so the effect was devastating,' says
Stephen Cox, director-general of the Institute. 'It's been a very miserable
time.'
Cox has prepared an 11th-hour proposal for the venue's survival and made
half his staff of 90 redundant, including his deputy, in an attempt to wring
a reprieve from the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd. If the FCO comes up
with Pounds 1m a year, says Cox, he will earn the rest: 'We have got, and
are developing very rapidly, a good conference and events centre here which
is beginning to make money in quite substantial amounts'.
The Institute has always had its detractors, who question the value of wood
carvings and masks of dubious historic or aesthetic interest or permanent
exhibits depicting New Zealand cheesemaking. 'The building itself is
unforgiveably ugly and inside, it is designed to confuse,' says the art
critic Brian Sewell. 'The temporary exhibitions have been unmitigated drivel
for the last 20 years. The work is often by really wretched people who
wouldn't have even got into art school in this country. The artifacts are
just tourist trade rubbish. It is a slave of and monument to political
correctitude.'
Supporters, however, point to the record of the institute's main gallery,
which has housed exhibitions by significant artists including the Guyanese
painter, the late Aubrey Williams, and to a series of much-praised readings
by Caribbean poets. Last year, more than 50,000 British schoolchildren
visited and Cox asserts that behind the music, dance, paintings and tableaux
of 'life in many lands' the Institute has a serious role: 'Britain is a
multi-cultural society and the context and reason for that is predominantly
a Commonwealth one. If we fail to ensure that context is maintained so that
people understand it, then I think we are left with the problems of the East
End of London and the British National Party washing over us. The
Commonwealth is essentially an organisation working towards eliminating
racial prejudice.'
He is seeking private sector partners for a Pounds 5m proposal to transform
the interior of the building to become a tourism draw with an underlying
ecological message. On the ground level would go World of Wonders, a
dramatic virtual reality presentation of natural phenomena like tropical
storms, volcanic eruptions and Arctic chill; on the second level would be a
computer-driven information complex on the 50 Commonwealth states; and on
the third a temporary exhibition area.
Under-funding over the years means the listed building - designed by the
architects of the Royal Festival Hall - has been badly neglected and Cox
acknowledges that a rethink of the displays is long overdue. 'One thing I've
never doubted is that the Commonwealth and the Institute have an important
job to do.' Generally, he says, 'we have attracted very little criticism
though we're working in some sensitive areas - the projection of
international understanding, of Commonwealth values, the development of the
multi-cultural society in Britain. These areas can become very difficult.'
But surely, with ex-dominions like Canada and Australia now globally equal
with Britain, and at least one of them going briskly towards renouncing the
monarchy, the association of these former Empire states is an anachronism.
Not to Cox. 'The Commonwealth is the only multilateral organisation,other
than the UN, covering a quarter of the world's land surface and a quarter of
the world's population. It's the only other organisation which combines rich
and poor, developed and developing, the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian
Oceans.'
Australia may be going republican, but it is pro-Commonwealth; Hong Kong may
leave, but South Africa would like to rejoin. And London is the headquarters
of the Commonwealth, with the Institute its vital cultural showcase.
Brian Sewell, however, remains unconvinced. 'It has been the most fatuous
exercise since it began. And as the Commonwealth nations are pulling away,
what is the point of keeping the Commonwealth Institute open?'

Starting remarkably early at 6.30 (though admittedly it goes on until 10.30)
Radio 3 relays a live concert performance of Lulu, from the Royal Festival
Hall, London. This last opera of Berg's was unfinished at his death and
completed by Friedrich Cerha. Lulu is a femme fatale who eventually comes to
London as a prostitute and is killed by Jack The Ripper. Andrew Davis
conducts the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Patricia Wise is Lulu, and Wolfgang
Schone plays the two roles of Doctor Schon and Jack The Ripper.
BBC2 mounts a 50-minute documentary which agonises over the way that people
have traditionally told jokes about mothers-in-law. Should we expect
companion prog rammes about Irishmen, Newfoundlanders, and golfers? Take My
Mother-In-Law starts at 9.30.
Three old movies start at around midnight, the best being Elia Kazan's 1951
version of the Tennessee Williams play, A Streetcar Named Desire. Marlon
Brando gives his famous 'method' performance as the boorish Stanley who
rapes his sister-in-law (12.15 BBC2).

Francis Mackay, chief executive of the health care and catering company
Compass Group, once remarked that a typical non-executive director takes up
the job 'to create maximum embarrassment with the least amount of effort'.
The grain of truth concealed in that quip is unlikely to be much felt with
his latest recruit, John Thomson (left), 65. Thomson's appointment as
chairman follows the retirement of Ingram Lenton on grounds of ill-health,
in January. Lenton had been with Compass since 1987.
Thomson's cv demonstrates a breadth of financial and corporate experience.
Having taken degrees in classics and law, he started his professional career
as a banker with Lazard Brothers, moving on to Manufacturers Hanover.
From thence he joined the Brooke Bond group, spending 18 years with a
company which in the UK is probably most famous for a particular brand of a
caterer's essential ingredient - tea. He became deputy chief executive
there.
Thomson's other corporate interests have included a directorship with the
brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle and, in June 1985, the chairmanship of the
insurance group London and Manchester. He is now a director of Thames Water
and also chairman of food flavourings manufacturer, Borthwicks.

FT  11 MAR 94 / People: Douglas Lee takes on Microgen UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Douglas Lee, executive chairman of Microgen Holdings, the computer services
group based in the UK but with operations in six other west European
countries, is taking over at the helm of the UK operating subsidiary,
Microgen UK. That follows the resignation - after two years with the company
 -of its managing director, Michael Lee, who is no relation to Douglas Lee.
The parting of the ways follows a 1993 profit reduction of 37 per cent, and
turnover down by 1 per cent, in the UK and Irish operations.
For Microgen as a whole, but particularly in the UK, the group's traditional
core business - the production of computer output microfilm (COM) - is
facing a structural change, with greater challenges being posed by
electronic means of generating, storing and distributing data.
Douglas Lee acknowledges that the COM business, which represents 60 per cent
of UK turnover (Pounds 25.6m last year), is not only a vital element of
Microgen's future, but it is also one which is undergoing an important
change of rhythm.
The need for 24-hour, geographically widespread microfilm production is
waning; those interested in using microfiche generally no longer require the
speed of turnround that Microgen is geared up for. The tendency - and future
 -of demand for microfiche services is much more as a long-term archival
resource; and Lee is confident that that business has a healthy future,
despite the threats from other means of data storage, such as CD-ROM.
The consequence is that Douglas Lee - who will be running the UK operation
until further notice - is faced with the difficult task of implementing an
already developed plan to address the UK subsidiary's costs. Michael Lee's
departure is, to some extent, a reflection of the tricky nature of that
task.
Still, Douglas Lee feels that the group's other key businesses - electronic
printing and demand publishing - are set fair to face future competition. In
any case, having been with the company since 1974 - when it was incorporated
 -he is determined that both Microgen and he will 'be around for a long time
yet'.

Notebook computers have rapidly become part of the accoutrements of business
travel, writes Louise Kehoe. Yet for users involved in heavy-duty number
crunching, the standard notebook PC is inadequate. Two offerings may provide
solutions.
IBM has introduced a portable version of the Unix workstation. The N40 is
based on the PowerPC microprocessor jointly developed by IBM, Apple Computer
and Motorola. Priced at Dollars 12,000, the N40 incorporates an active
matrix colour display.
Taking a different tack, Compaq Computer has introduced a family of
notebooks based on Intel's latest 486 DX2 and DX4 microprocessors. Compaq
has eliminated the cumbersome AC adapter and cables by building the adapter
into the computer, which still weighs less than 7lb. Prices range from
Dollars 3,300 to Dollars 6,500. Compaq: US, 713 370 0670. IBM: US, 914 945

An energy-saving box of electronics, that could cut electricity bills for

engineering company SML. For manufacturing companies the biggest problem is
the high levels of inductive currents needed by motors and heaters. The PFC

reduces overall demand. SML: UK, 081 349 1770.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Technology: Chicken and egg vaccine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An automatic system for injecting eggs is rapidly replacing the traditional
practice of vaccinating chicks by hand in the US poultry industry. Its
commercial introduction in Europe is expected next year.
Embrex - a company based at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina -
launched its Inovoject system in the US last year. Fifty machines are
already in operation, each capable of injecting 20,000 eggs per hour.
The Inovoject machines are currently vaccinating about 20 per cent of the
100m eggs produced every week by the US broiler chicken industry. Analysts
expect the level to reach 50 per cent next year.
The machine first punches a tiny hole in the shell at the large end of the
egg and then injects vaccine through the hole into the chick embryo.
Injecting the eggs by machine is much cheaper and easier than employing
people to grab newly hatched chicks and vaccinate them by hand. Embrex says
the process also leads to healthier chicks because immunity can start to
develop earlier.
David Baines, managing director of Embrex Europe, says net savings are at
least 1 cent per chick - a significant amount in the broiler industry, where
margins are wafer thin.
The system is being used first in the US to vaccinate against Marek's
disease, which causes nervous system tumours in the birds. In Europe, the
poultry industry is most interested in a novel vaccine against Gumboro
disease, which destroys the birds' immune system.
The Gumboro vaccine could not normally be administered so early in the
chick's life because it is too virulent. But Embrex combines it with Viral
Neutralising Factor, an antibody which binds to the virus in the vaccine and
then releases it gradually into the chick.
Embrex scientists say VNF technology could possibly be applied to make
virulent vaccines safe for early use in other animals - even humans.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Technology: No frills approach - Andrew Fisher on how
Siemens has achieved productivity and cost gains in the medical equipment
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tradition is being overturned at Siemens' new medical equipment plant near
Nuremberg in southern Germany. Designers and marketing staff sit next to the
production floor, their offices separated from the final assembly line only
by a glass partition.
Before, they would not even have been in the same building as the production
workers, let alone be able to see the manufacturing process. They have been
put side-by-side to help speed up the whole chain of operations from design
to delivery.
The move shows Siemens' determination to maintain the productivity and cost
gains it has achieved in the highly competitive medical equipment market
since it was confronted in the early 1980s with an onslaught from Japanese
rivals and falling prices.
At that time, Siemens found that what had previously been regarded as a
strength of German industry - engineering perfectionism - was now turning
out to be the opposite.
It became increasingly, and derogatorily, termed 'over-engineering'.
According to Werner Maly, head of Siemens' medical division: 'The entry of
the Japanese and slower growth (in the market) meant that our strength was
no longer our strength but our weakness.'
After two decades of operating in a sellers' market, with medical equipment
expensively customised for hospitals and other users, soaring costs were
making public health authorities more price-conscious. 'Customers were no
longer prepared to pay for special features,' says Maly.
Japanese companies, on the other hand - led by Toshiba - offered products
that met users' needs without being too sophisticated. Other manufacturers,
like General Electric of the US, were also competing aggressively.
Initially, says Maly, Siemens, whose medical division has a turnover of
DM8bn (Pounds 3.1bn), or 10 per cent of the group total, met these
challenges through strong marketing and highly efficient service. But the
falls in the dollar and yen exacerbated its problems - 'our profits were
under strong pressure'.
So five years ago, it embarked on a radical programme to cut costs by
streamlining its manufacturing operations, shortening development times and
paring away unnecessary frills on its products. This shocked the Siemens
engineers. 'German engineers are educated very differently from those in the
US and Japan. They are trained to make products which are the best
technically, while in the US and Japan 'design-to-cost' is stressed from the
start.'
A demand for costs to be cut by 40 per cent, and not by the usual 5 per cent
or so a year, in computed tomography equipment was met with incredulity. CT
machines, which produce slice-by-slice body images from X-rays, faced the
strongest Japanese threat and sharpest fall in prices.
'Our engineers laughed. They said they couldn't do it. They went away and
said 'we've done 15 per cent' and we said 'go back'. They managed 25 per
cent and we kept sending them back.' Eventually, Siemens succeeded in
cutting CT manufacturing costs by 50 per cent. Significant cost reductions
were also achieved for other products.
The division also did some 'reverse engineering' by taking apart a Japanese
CT product. 'This was almost unheard of for our engineers,' Maly says. They
were astonished to learn that not only was the Japanese equipment cheaper
than the German, it was also better built. So Siemens added manufacturing
quality to the list of sought-after improvements.
Its cost-cutting efforts mainly comprised: cutting the number of extra
features and controls on its products; purchasing more components from
outside; building to order and not for stock; speeding up the time from
design to production from five to three years (with help from McKinsey
management consultants); and the cutting of central overheads by 40 per
cent, a process which is still under way.
As a result, the division cut its inventories by a fifth. It also lowered
the time taken from receiving an order to installing the completed product.
In the case of angiography equipment (for blood vessel X-rays), the advance
was from 36 to 15 weeks, with a further reduction planned. This was at the
new DM85m plant for CT and angiography products, still being completed near
Nuremberg, not far from its headquarters at Erlangen. But the division has
also expanded its operations outside Germany to keep down costs and help
insulate it from currency fluctuations.
Germany accounts for nearly 60 per cent of production (against 80 per cent
in 1980), the US for more than 25 per cent, Sweden and the UK for more than
10 per cent, and China, India, Indonesia and Singapore and Spain for the
rest. Five of the 14 medical product sectors, including nuclear medicine,
ultrasound diagnostic systems and cardiac pacemakers, run their
international activities from the US, which also accounts for nearly a third
of turnover.
In the UK, Siemens' joint venture with Oxford Instruments, Oxford Magnet
Technology, resulted in a recent breakthrough, enabling its latest magnetic
resonance imaging system - the Magnetom Open - to carry out body scans
without patients having to go into a narrow, claustrophobia-inducing
cylinder. The special magnet for the C-shaped scanner is made in Oxford and
sent to Siemens plants in Germany and the US.
Maly says that the exertions of the Siemens medical division over the past
few years - including a rise in R&amp;D spending from DM590m to DM750m since
1990 - are starting to pay off. Cash flow is now above the group average.
Its profit return after tax would also exceed the average but for the costs
of shedding 2,200 jobs, with more to go this year; in 1992, the return was
well below average.
'It was the world market that forced us to improve,' states Maly. As well as
the fast-moving Japanese and US companies, including Picker which is owned
by Britain's GEC, Siemens also has to contend with Philips of the
Netherlands which has revitalised its medical business. 'This is one of the
few industries where Europe is a high-tech leader,' he asserts.

FT  11 MAR 94 / People: Promotions at Barings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A younger generation is stepping into power at Barings, parent of London's
oldest merchant bank. Peter Norris, 39, has been made chief executive of the
newly formed investment banking group which has been created by the
combination of Baring Brothers, the traditional merchant bank, with the
group's fast growing broking operation, Baring Securities.
Peter is the younger brother of Andrew Norris, 41, who has recently been
appointed joint head of equity capital markets in New York. He joined
Barings in 1976 and is unusual in that he left the firm in 1984 to spend
three years as a vice president of Goldman Sachs International.
He was rehired by Barings in 1987 and worked in Hong Kong for five years
before being put in charge of Barings Securities in the wake of last year's
problems.
Baring Securities profits have recovered strongly and investment banking
accounted for more than two thirds of Barings' total profits.
Following last year's sudden departure of Baring Securities' chairman
Christopher Heath, who was once Britain's highest paid employee, Barings has
made several management changes and it's clear that Peter Norris, who
recently joined the main board, has been rewarded for turning round the
fortunes of Baring Securities.
Andrew Tuckey, 50, deputy chairman of Barings plc, the group holding
company, has been appointed chairman of the new investment banking group.
Barings has also reorganised the management of Baring Asset Management whose
funds under management rose 42 per cent to Pounds 31.5bn last year.
John Bolsover, 46, remains chief executive, but Martin Shaw, 52, has been
made managing director of the institutional side of the business and Peter
Walsh, 48, has been given charge of the non-institutional sub-group.
Meanwhile, John Ashburton and Nicholas Baring, two former executive
directors, are retiring from the board after the annual general meeting.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Property: Learn from the past, or pay in the future - Will
history repeat itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD BARRAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago the UK property market was in the depths of its worst postwar
depression. Yet there has been a remarkable turnround in market sentiment
over the past 12 months. For the investment market is now gripped by a
euphoria more intense than at any time during the late-1980s heyday.
Investment by UK institutions is much increased, and this domestic weight of
money is combining with a big inflow of overseas capital to force yields
down at an accelerating rate. Yet rents are still falling, and vacancy rates
remain at record levels. Can history help us to understand what is going on,
and in which direction we are heading.
The answer is yes. For some parallels are emerging between current events
and those which followed the mid-1970s crash. In each case, the crash saw
property yields move to a record high. But in each case investor sentiment
then reversed, because the correction in yields had gone too far, making
property historically cheap
Crucial to current investor enthusiasm for property is the expectation that
inflation, and therefore gilts yields, will stay low for several years. In
this belief, investors will push yields down further than they have moved so
far. Property Market Analysis, a research consultancy, forecasts that the
average all-property yield could fall as low as 6 per cent by 1995, close to
the record low attained in the late 1970s. But they are unlikely to stay at
such a level for long.
Optimistic voices today argue that 'inflation is dead'. The assumption is
that the economy can be kept on a 'slow but steady' growth path for the next
few years, and the deflationary Budgets of 1993 will certainly help this
aim. However, the government will face an almost irresistible temptation to
indulge in another tax-cutting Budget in 1995, ahead of the next general
election. Once more inflationary forces will be unleashed, just as they were
by the Lawson Budget of 1987 - plus ca change?
When this happens, property yields are likely to adjust back up again
quickly. As always, there will be winners and losers in this investment
casino. However, of more lasting importance to the sector, and to the wider
economy, is the impact of the recovery in the investment market on
development.
As values rise, developers are dusting off the planning permissions which
they had to shelve in the crash. The development appraisals which looked so
negative only a year ago are beginning to stack up again. This year will
therefore see the start of a new wave of development in the UK market -
funded not by the banks but by the institutions.
Again, there is a historical parallel. The decline in yields after the 1974
crash encouraged institutions to engage in direct development for the first
time. And by the early 1960s commercial building starts had risen back close
to their real level at the height of the early 1970s boom. As before, these
buildings reached the market just as the economy was plunging into the
recession of 1980-81. There was no collapse in rents, because they had only
just started to recover from the previous crash. However, real rental growth
was stalled for five years, until the upswing at the start of the
late-1980s.
The lesson of the early-1980s cycle is the risk that a new investor-led wave
of development in the mid 1990s will choke off the very recovery in rents
upon which it is founded. For the worst combination of circumstances would
be excessive development reaching completion just as the economy moves into
another business cycle downturn in the second half of the decade.
The result would be the combination of stagnant rents, rising yields and
falling values with which we are all too familiar.
Equally, if not more, important than the likely volume of building is the
question of whether the next wave of development will produce the right type
of buildings to meet occupier demand.
The industry is of course aware of the importance of responding to
conditions in the occupier market - particularly at a time of substantial
over-supply. However, the industry must also be responsive to the needs of
the investment market, and these two sets of demands do not necessarily
coincide.
The growth of institutional demand tends to produce ever-larger development
schemes, irrespective of the predominant occupier demand for small and
medium units. The search for prime investments is speeding up economic
obsolescence, as each wave of over-supply pushes more secondary buildings
towards vacancy and redevelopment, way before the end of their physical
life. Finally, the criteria of 'institutional acceptability' militate
against innovative developments, yet they tend to produce buildings which
are over-specified for occupier needs, because of the desire for 'trophy
investments' which add prestige to the fund.
The more autonomous these investor demands, the greater the risk that they
will fail to meet the changing patterns of occupier demand. There are four
trends which could produce important changes in occupier requirements for
property over the next 10 years.
First, occupiers may come to favour smaller buildings in more dispersed
locations. Advances in information technology networking will accelerate the
current 'downsizing' of businesses. At the same time, changes in the labour
force, particularly the trend towards more part-time female employment, will
strengthen the demand for workplaces closer to home, to reduce commuting
times.
Second, a desire for more functional, energy-efficient buildings could go
hand-in-hand with the suggested shift in demand towards a smaller-scale,
more dispersed pattern of development. There is evidence that developers are
moving away from some of the excesses of the 1980s, in the design of office
buildings and shopping centres.
Third, there is evidence of demand for more mixed-use developments, giving
greater integration of urban activities. Schemes which mix housing, shops
and offices may be preferred in a society concerned about improving the
quality of life through increased security and reduced congestion.
Fourth, there are signs of a reaction against large-scale out-of-town
development. The most obvious example so far is government resistance to the
further undermining of town-centre retailing by the twin assault of regional
shopping centres and superstores. Similar resistance may emerge to the
development of business parks with inadequate public transport access.
The problem is that such trends would run directly counter to the recent
dynamic of development. However, unless the industry adapts to changing
patterns of occupier demand, it will find itself producing more of the same
in the next development cycle - unwanted buildings of the wrong size and
specification in the wrong place. In this sense, there could be a high price
to pay if history does continue to repeat itself in the market.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Management: Low tech, high yield: Richard Tomkins on how
Rubbermaid became a corporate hero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New Yorkers joke that when the world ends, they want to be in Cleveland,
Ohio. 'Why Cleveland?' you dutifully ask. 'Because everything happens 10
years later in Cleveland,' they reply.
Ohio has the unhappy reputation of being one of the US's less dynamic
states. It is the sort of place you might expect to find a company with a
faintly comical name like Rubbermaid making boring household goods like
plastic buckets, sandwich boxes and washing-up brushes.
And indeed, about an hour's drive from Cleveland in a town called Wooster,
there is a company called Rubbermaid making those very things. But it isn't
behind the times. On the contrary, it is among the most innovative companies
in the US, introducing new products at the rate of more than one a day.
Rubbermaid's reputation for innovation has earned it the respect of
corporate America. For the last nine years, the company has been placed
among the nation's 10 most admired companies in Fortune magazine's annual
survey of 10,000 company directors, senior executives and financial
analysts. In the latest survey, published last month, it clinched the number
one spot.
It is not just the rate of new product development that has attracted
attention to Rubbermaid. Earnings growth averaged 18 per cent a year in the
10 years to 1992, giving shareholders a total return (in dividends and
capital appreciation) of 25 per cent a year over the same period. Last year,
net profits rose by 15 per cent to Dollars 211m (Pounds 144m) on turnover up
9 per cent at Dollars 2bn.
How does Rubbermaid do it? It is hard to imagine a sector with less obvious
potential than Rubbermaid's. Dustpans, brushes, buckets and mops have
changed very little since their invention. Technology does not come much
lower.
Yet, in a way, it is the very dullness of the business that explains
Rubbermaid's success. Access to the industry is so easy, and competition so
fierce, that invention is a do-or-die affair. While Rubbermaid's products
may not be the cheapest on the shelves, consumers have to be convinced that
they offer superior value because they do the job better than anybody
else's.
Rubbermaid's approach is evident in its most basic products. Its plastic
buckets, for example, do not deform and spill their contents when full, and
have sturdy, comfortable handles. Its laundry baskets are contoured so that
they sit on the hip. Its food storage boxes have wide protrusions on the
lids to make them easier to open.
And then there are the totally new products, like the step-stool that saves
space by incorporating a tool box under its lid or the litterless lunch kit
containing a set of re-usable food and drink containers.
According to Wolfgang Schmitt, Rubbermaid's chairman and chief executive,
the main source of its inventiveness is its obsession with trends - whether
fashion-led, sociological, demographic or global. 'We have a philosophical
belief that there is no such thing as a totally negative trend. Given enough
time and effort and inquisitiveness, in every change there is an opportunity
for someone.'
The step-stool and other space-saving products developed out of the trend
towards smaller households; the litterless lunch kit came in response to
growing environmental awareness; and a children's laundry hamper that
encourages youngsters to tidy up after themselves evolved from a study
showing that working mothers no longer had time to do it for them.
But who generates the ideas? The short answer is teams. Rubbermaid has set
up 20 business teams, each of them dedicated to a specific product line.
Each team - typically comprising one person each from marketing,
manufacturing, finance, research and development, and sales - takes
responsibility for every aspect of its product line's performance, including
product development and, ultimately, profitability. This means that every
Rubbermaid product is continually being examined by a business team to see
if it can be improved or replaced with something better.
Although most new products are developed by these teams, other employees are
encouraged to come up with ideas, too. And the teams shamelessly plagiarise
their own and each other's ideas: the step-stool, for example, has evolved
into several other products based on the idea of a container that you can
stand on, such as a children's step-stool that doubles as a toy box.
Suppliers are another good source of ideas. Schmitt gives the example of a
supplier who came up with a new type of plastic for making ice-cube trays.
There was nothing particularly wrong with the old material, but the new
plastic made it easier to get the cubes out of the trays and lasted longer
because it was more flexible. Rubbermaid wrote off Dollars 1m to re-tool
rather than pass up the opportunity to offer a better product.
Then again, says Schmitt, some of Rubbermaid's best ideas are suggested by
customers. Take, for example, mailboxes - the sort that sit on a pole at the
end of the drive. These are notoriously vulnerable to damage from vehicles.
One customer saw an advertisement for a Rubbermaid refuse bin that sprang
back after being crushed by a truck, and called in saying: 'I wish my
mailbox did that.' Result: the indestructible mailbox.
Rubbermaid is ruthless in its pursuit of new ideas. The company demands that
33 per cent of its revenues should come from products introduced in the last
five years, so its business teams are under constant pressure to invent. As
fast as new products come on to the market, old ones - or new ones that
never quite made it - are dropped. Such is the rate of replacement that
maturing products tend to disappear off the shelves long before customer
demand has dried up.
Perhaps it all sounds just too good to last. Indeed, as Rubbermaid gets
bigger, it may find it harder to sustain the same rate of growth -
particularly as it ventures into more troublesome overseas markets, where it
is now trying to expand. Besides, awards for excellence have a nasty habit
of marking the turning point for companies on which they are bestowed.
All Schmitt can do is point to the record. Innovation has been ingrained in
Rubbermaid's culture since it diversified from toy balloons into dust pans
60 years ago, he says. That is one thing that is not going to change.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Management: Now lean enterprise takes a bow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brace yourself. Like Volkswagen, Mercedes and much of western industry, your
company may still be in the early stages of deciding how to introduce
Japanese-style 'lean production'. It has almost certainly not got far yet
with the even more demanding approach of 'business process re-engineering'.
But now it faces a tougher challenge still: how to turn itself into part of
a 'lean enterprise'.
The challenge comes courtesy of James Womack and Dan Jones, two of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology team whose 1991 best-seller, The
Machine that Changed the World, popularised the 'lean production' system
pioneered by Toyota.
In essence, 'lean production' eliminates unnecessary steps in the
development, production and distribution of a product (or a service, for
that matter).
In their book, Womack and Jones showed how companies can more than halve the
effort, time and expense involved - and can become much more responsive to
customer demands - by making three fundamental changes: redesigning every
step so that it is part of a continuous flow; recombining employees into
cross-functional teams dedicated to that activity; and striving continually
for improvement.
The power of this approach has been evident over the past three years, as
companies in Europe and North America have begun the painful process of
converting to it. Only this week one of the worst laggards, Volkswagen,
announced a long-overdue preliminary move: the simplification of its
ridiculously complex and costly range of products and components.
As VW and others are finding, 'lean production' is very ambitious. But it is
also limited, in that it focuses on the redesign of individual activities
within single processes, such as product development, assembly or
distribution.
Under the loose title of 'lean management', it has been extended to other
aspects of a business. But the concept of a 'lean enterprise' is more
specific, and much more far-reaching.
First, it goes beyond re-engineering by embracing not just single
cross-functional processes, but a cluster of them: what Womack and Jones in
the latest Harvard Business Review* call 'the entire set of activities that
add value to a particular family of products' (or services). They dub this
'a continuous value stream'.
Second, this stream includes not just an individual company's activities,
but also those of suppliers, distributors and customers.
To Womack and Jones, this cross-company flow constitutes the extended
'enterprise' of the future. Each company may be part of a different extended
enterprise for each of its product ranges; this distinguishes the lean
enterprise concept slightly from the conventional idea of 'supplier
networks' serving a whole company.
Third, the 'lean enterprise' differs radically from the oversold notion of
the 'virtual corporation', whose members come and go constantly. The two
academics argue, rightly, that there is no way that such an unstable entity
can sustain the intense, seamless collaboration needed to apply 'lean'
techniques across an entire set of cross-company processes.
Fourth, the lean enterprise necessitates a complete redefinition of the role
of separate 'functions' (or disciplines) such as design, engineering,
purchasing, marketing and accounting.
Many companies are considering dumping these functions entirely, and
transferring their specialist members permanently to multi-functional
process teams. This may work in the short term, but Womack and Jones warn
that in the long run it harms specialist skill-building; there are already
signs of this at Chrysler.
Instead, the duo advocates that functions should be turned into 'schools' of
learning and skill-building, and sources of best practice, for the teams to
draw on.
Thus the traditional purchasing department, for example, should define the
principles of purchasing, form links with suppliers, and work to improve
their performance continuously. But its traditional role of actually
purchasing supplies should be done by each product development team.
Fifth, career paths must be altered, so that people can alternate more
systematically between working as multi-functional team members, and periods
of intense knowledge-building within their specific department.
This aspect of the academics' proposal will be criticised heavily by
consultants and internal company experts who have concluded that functional
and team organisations do not mix, and that one or the other must be
paramount in an organisation. But Womack and Jones point out that Honda, the
Japanese carmaker, has used this alternating approach successfully in Japan
and North America.
This is not the only controversial count. The two academics will also come
under fire, especially from advocates of re-engineering and 'partnership
sourcing' (supply networks), for being derivative in some of their ideas, as
well as too far-fetched overall.
The duo's attempt to reconfigure so much of the systems which companies
operate - both internally and externally - is certainly bold, and requires
complex changes in organisational attitudes, structures and procedures.
But, from his home base near Cardiff in Wales, Dan Jones denied this week
that the lean enterprise is pie in the sky. Its various facets are drawn
directly from emerging practice, in the motor industry and elsewhere, he
claimed. As he says, Honda and Chrysler are not alone in implementing
several parts of the concept. In Europe, Nissan and Unipart, a former
offshoot of Rover, are also doing so.
But none of them is having an easy ride. The changes required are far too
dramatic for that.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Election battle starts in Milligan's constituency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday opened his party's
campaign for the Eastleigh by-election in Hampshire caused by the death of
Conservative MP Mr Stephen Milligan last month.
Mr Ashdown pledged to set out an honest and positive alternative to
Conservative policies. He said Eastleigh would give voters a chance to pass
their verdict on the past two years of Tory government.
He said: 'Eastleigh will soon be able to tell John Major that people in
Britain want a fundamental change of approach.'
The normally safe Tory seat, which Mr Milligan won with a majority of nearly
18,000 two years ago, will be fought by Mr David Chidgey, Liberal Democrat
candidate in the last two general elections.
The Conservatives lost a local council seat last night in the constituency
of Eastleigh. Voting was Liberal Democrat, 473; Conservatives 212;
Independent 154; Labour 60.
An inquiry ordered by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Condon,
conducted by up to 15 detectives over about five days, concluded yesterday
that police acted 'correctly and thoroughly' in releasing details of Mr
Milligan's death, Motoko Rich writes.
But Mr Condon said a review of procedures for passing on information to the
media had been started in the wake of the controversy surrounding police
contacts with the press.
Asked whether MPs were to blame for leaks to the press, Mr Condon would only
say the 'bulk of the information came from Westminster' where 'hundreds' of
people had snippets of stories to pass on.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Sizewell computer queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists advising local authorities over the safety of the proposed
Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk are not convinced of the
reliability of an important computer system.
The prototype system is designed to monitor all reactor functions and give
early warning of any fault.
The scientists, led by Professor Tony Goddard of Imperial College, London,
are recommending that an assurance is obtained from the Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate that the system will not be approved until
reliability tests are validated.
The system, developed by Westinghouse of the US, is already being installed
in Sizewell B, Britain's first pressurised water reactor nuclear power
station, although the inspectorate has yet to give it final clearance.
Inspectors have indicated that they may be able to issue a licence within
the next few months.
However, they are still awaiting further submissions from Nuclear Electric,
the state-owned generator which is building the Pounds 2.03bn B station. and
wants to proceed with a Pounds 3.5bn twin-reactor C plant.
Members of the British Computer Society have previously expressed concern
about the complexity of the computer system.
Prof Goddard's team is also recommending that local councils seek
clarification from Nuclear Electric on the amount of spent uranium fuel to
be stored at Sizewell.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Half of country 'is damaged by acid rain'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buildings and wildlife in half of the UK are being damaged by acid rain,
says a government report published yesterday.
Scientists say the contraction of the coal industry will cut the area
affected by nearly nine-tenths early next century.
The estimates, prepared for the Department of the Environment, show that
western and northern parts of the UK, including much of Wales and Scotland,
are particularly affected.
Mr Robert Wilson, chairman of the report's research group, said the soils
and rocks of these areas contained little alkaline material to counteract
the acid.
Last week in Geneva the UK agreed the terms of a UN protocol to curb the
sulphur dioxide emissions which help cause acid rain and come largely from
coal-burning power stations. Under the agreement, likely to be signed later
this year, the UK must cut emissions to 50 per cent of 1980 levels by the
year 2000, and to 30 per cent by 2005 and 20 per cent by 2010.
Ministers have been assured that the power generation industry's switch from
coal to gas means that the UK can meet the new obligations.
Environmentalists such as the pressure group Friends of the Earth have
criticised the UK for refusing to sign an earlier sulphur protocol which
expired last year.
The report employs the 'critical loads approach' that the UK has urged
international conventions to follow. This takes account of the environment's
sensitivity as well as the extent of pollution when assessing the impact of
acid rain.
The report says that some damage to Scottish heather and to salmon and trout
stocks in Wales can be attributed directly to acid rain. However, it adds:
'It is harder to link damage to tree health directly to air pollution - the
causes are complex.'
About 10 per cent of pollution recorded by the study was found to come from
other countries.
Even if sulphur emissions were curbed sharply some areas, such as the
southern Pennines, 'would never recover from layers of deposits since the
Industrial Revolution', the report says.
Negotiations on a protocol to curb nitrogen oxides, which are emitted from
vehicles and other sources, are expected to take several years.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Lottery bidder to seek up to 500 staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Camelot, one of eight bidders for the National Lottery licence, yesterday
became the first of the rival consortia to begin large-scale recruiting of
staff.
The consortium, which brings together Cadbury Schweppes, De La Rue, Gtech,
ICL and Racal, said yesterday that it expects about 300 jobs to be created
in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, and up to 200 on Merseyside.
Jobs are being advertised and the consortium will push ahead with recruiting
even though a decision on the lottery licence winner is unlikely before May.
Although the aim is to make job offers to suitable candidates, the offers
will be conditional on Camelot winning the licence. Successful candidates
will receive no pay until the outcome of the contest is known.
The selection process by the Office of the National Lottery is still at an
early stage and the organisation is a long way from even drawing up a
shortlist.
Camelot, which is widely believed to be one of the leading contenders, hopes
to have a full complement of staff virtually in place in time for a decision
about the winner.
The consortium would aim to launch the lottery, which is in aid of good
causes, within six months of winning the licence.
Meanwhile Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow national heritage secretary, yesterday
published a list of 14 Conservative MPs, including several former ministers,
who are acting as advisers to companies bidding for the lottery licence.
They include Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary who was responsible
for the white paper introducing the lottery to parliament, and Mr David
Mellor, the former national heritage secretary.
Ms Mowlam said: 'This is yet another example of Tory vested interests at
work.'

FT  11 MAR 94 / BCCI litigation 'will net Abu Dhabi Dollars 900m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Abu Dhabi believes it will collect Dollars 900m by suing
regulators, auditors and participants in alleged frauds at the collapsed
Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The figure was revealed as details were released yesterday of the Dollars
1.8bn settlement between the liquidators to BCCI and Abu Dhabi, the majority
shareholder.
Abu Dhabi said yesterday: 'This achieves what we have always wanted to
achieve: to get the money into the hands of creditors as soon as possible.'
It added that the decision was 'mature and statesmanlike'.
Abu Dhabi will pay Dollars 1.55bn to the liquidators as soon as the
agreement is ratified by the courts in London, Luxembourg and the Cayman
Islands.
It will pay a further Dollars 150m in two years and another Dollars 100m one
year later - more quickly if it recovers the money from litigation before
then.
As in the previous agreement negotiated in 1992, Abu Dhabi will waive any
legal action against BCCI in an attempt to recover more than Dollars 2bn of
the government's money that it claims was stolen by the bank.
The liquidators have in exchange agreed to waive litigation they could have
brought against Abu Dhabi.
Abu Dhabi will still count as a creditor to the bank for a claim which it
says is more than Dollars 1.2bn, and receive a proportion in line with the
dividend paid to other creditors.
Of the total Dollars 1.8bn to be paid, Dollars 450m represents a half share
in the proceeds that Abu Dhabi says it will receive in recoveries from
litigation against third parties.
If Abu Dhabi is named as a co-defendant in any actions brought against a
third party by the liquidators, it will first offset any payments against
this Dollars 450m.
Abu Dhabi is believed to be preparing its own legal actions against several
parties including those being sued by the liquidators: the Bank of England,
BCCI's auditors and Sheikh Khalid Bin Mahfouz and the National Commercial
Bank of Saudi Arabia.
Representatives of the liquidators and the government of Abu Dhabi signed
the non-binding 'heads of agreement', or outline terms of the settlement, in
Zurich on March 3.
Lawyers have still to draft the detailed terms and agree to a legally
binding contract. Abu Dhabi has also demanded that as a condition of payment
at least Dollars 4.5bn of creditors by value agree to waive any rights to
sue.
The settlement followed long negotiations between the two sides after the
Luxembourg appeals court rejected the previous agreement last October.
In response to objections raised by the court, the agreement has been
restructured so that Abu Dhabi will no longer receive a share of the
proceeds of any litigation initiated by the liquidators dis-proportionate to
its claims as a creditor.
Under the previous agreement, it would have received a half share of the
proceeds. However, it is still offering the liquidators half of any
settlements it achieves, including a Dollars 9bn civil action against 13
former executives of BCCI on trial in Abu Dhabi.
One lawyer said yesterday that the liquidators only required the agreement
to be ratified by the courts, although in practice they would seek approval
from the elected BCCI creditors' committee, which is due to respond at the
end of next week.
As in the previous agreement, the BCCI branches in the United Arab Emirates,
which include Abu Dhabi, are excluded. They are insolvent and creditors have
received no compensation since the bank was closed in July 1991.
Some of the more difficult aspects of the negotiations were restructuring
the agreement to take into account the objections of the Luxembourg court,
and how Abu Dhabi would deal with claims against it from third parties.

FT  11 MAR 94 / MPs' data network urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A data and video network should be provided for all MPs and their staff at a
cost of some Pounds 5m over four years, the Commons information committee
recommended yesterday.
It would give MPs access to television channels, teletext and the Commons
announcements system as well as the proceedings in the chamber. It would
also enable MPs to have close contact with their constituency offices and
with Commons library information.
The committee said: 'Most large organisations in the public and private
sector now operate a network to enable those working there to do so more
effectively.
'Parliament is obviously different in a multitude of ways from other bodies
and the role and working practices of MPs cannot easily be compared with
those of any other group of people in this country.
'We recommend the phased introduction of a full parliamentary data and video
network. It is a principal function of parliament to oversee the actions of
the executive.'
It added: 'MPs have a responsibility to represent their constituents
effectively. The provision of a full network would increase the efficiency
with which the House operates and the capacity of MPs to cope with
increasing workloads.' ,
The service might also have the ability to receive satellite channels and
news services, and the capacity to receive regional television channels.
There may also be scope for replays-on-demand of video tapes of Commons
debates.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Insurers to crack down on bad debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurers are to assess the creditworthiness of their customers in a move to
tackle a growing problem of bad debts.
About a dozen companies are supporting the development of a credit database
which will be used to assess the ability of an individual or commercial
buyer to maintain instalment payments on policies.
As many as one-in-five customers pays for insurance by monthly or quarterly
instalments and bad debts have risen, partly as a result of steep increases
in premiums. It is also believed that some of these defaults involve fraud.
Default rates on instalment policies are running at nearly double the rate
for other forms of credit offered by banks and building societies which
already use credit information groups.
'The problem is all too apparent,' said Mr George Stratford, chief
accountant at Cornhill Insurance. 'The high payout on claims . . . has long
been exacerbated by a high level of late payments on personal policies.'
Cornhill, which has used credit information for the past six years and is
one of the companies which launched the initiative, noticed a trend 2 1/2
years ago for motor policyholders to pay their initial instalment and then
default, said Mr Stratford. 'With a large proportion of personal lines (home
and motor) business moving from insurer to insurer in search of best rates,
discussions with fellow insurance companies revealed that we were not alone
with this problem,' he said.
Infolink, part of the UK's largest independent credit information
organisation, is providing technical services for the scheme.
Mr Kevin Still, head of insurance services at Infolink, said: 'There is also
an element of fraudulent activity whereby individuals obtain cover and pay
the initial payment, but have no intention to maintain their repayments.'

FT  11 MAR 94 / 700,000 school places face axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten yesterday stepped into a fierce row over the extent of excess
capacity in schools by saying that up to 700,000 surplus places could be
eliminated 'very quickly' at a saving of more than Pounds 200m.
The education secretary's claim - which comes as local elections loom - was
dismissed by the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities.
Mr Patten's figures were meaningless, it said, and seven councils that had
presented the Department for Education with plans to rationalise and remove
surplus places had been thwarted by delays in decisions.
Mr Graham Lane, the AMA's education spokesman, said Mr Patten had 'made a
lot of noise about the need to remove surplus places', but added: 'The
evidence shows that our members are doing their best whilst his own
department is dragging its feet.'
Mr Patten said that from next month, when the new Funding Agency for Schools
starts to operate, he would urge local authorities in England and Wales to
'squeeze surplus school places out of the system'. Any that failed to
respond would find the job done for them by the new agency. Questioned at a
Westminster press conference, Mr Patten said money being spent on 'roofs for
half-used buildings' should be earmarked instead for teachers, the national
curriculum and for books.
The government's aim was to 'concentrate management and teaching effort on
the children, not on the buildings'. He said that 'an awful lot of places'
could be removed by withdrawing parts of buildings from use.
But Mr Patten offered no assurance that the money saved would remain in the
education service and would not be clawed back by the Treasury. His remarks
prompted a call from Labour for surplus places to be used to 'make a start
on providing universal nursery education'.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said: 'Taking powers to produce
a hit-list of schools which are to face closure is not the most productive
way forward.'
The Audit Commission, which monitors local government spending, said it was
concerned by surplus places, but could not provide an authoritative figure.
It told councils to consider amalgamating schools' sixth forms into
sixth-form colleges.
However, Mr Patten is now encouraging schools that teach pupils aged 11 to
16 to open their own sixth forms.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Legal aid curb may hit privacy cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cases brought under the government's proposed law on privacy may be made
ineligible for legal aid. The law would create criminal offences covering
electronic eavesdropping and long-range photography on private property.
Ministers are considering the curb on aid as part of a renewed onslaught
against the legal aid budget, which is set to climb to Pounds 1.4bn in
1994-95 in spite of steps last year to restrict eligibility.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief Treasury secretary, is questioning the extent of
legal aid provision in several areas as part of the review of spending by
the Lord Chancellor's Department.
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, said earlier this year that the government
was proposing to withdraw legal-aid funding for cases which could be
resolved without going to court.
Some ministers are worried that too heavy-handed a clampdown will increase
pressure for a contingency-fee system for lawyers (no win, no fee) to
safeguard access to the courts for the less well-off. They are concerned
that this might lead to an increase in legal actions.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Sex bias law set for only minor changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, last night accepted that some changes
should be made to the Sex Discrimination Act to improve employment
opportunities for women. But he ruled out wholesale recasting of its
provisions.
While promising to have further talks with the Equal Opportunities
Commission, he told the Commons: 'I do not think we should substantially
reshape the legislation.'
Mr Hunt rejected Labour charges that during the past 15 years the government
had exploited the increase in male unemployment by encouraging the use of
part-time women workers to drive down wages.
He said women often wanted to combine work with family commitments, and had
benefited greatly from the creation of more than 2m part-time jobs during
the past 10 years.
A Labour motion calling for the sex discrimination and equal pay acts to be
strengthened and extended was defeated by a government majority of 46
(303-257).
Ms Clare Short, who speaks for Labour on women's issues, said the
overwhelming majority of women were in low-paid jobs with little opportunity
for promotion, and no pension entitlement.
She said the expansion in the number of part-time women workers had followed
the destruction of more and more full-time jobs for men, and had resulted in
the 'dragging down of standards' for everyone.
Ms Short added: 'Women do not want rotten wages, no training and no pensions
 -that is why full-time rights for part-time workers are crucial'.
She called for urgent action to implement the recent Lords' judgment that
the laws on part-time workers' rights over redundancy pay and unfair
dismissal breached European law.
Mr Hunt condemned discrimination against women as inefficient and clearly
wrong and said there was scope for a bi-partisan policy. He stressed that
only 13 per cent of women with part-time jobs would prefer to work
full-time.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Callaghan yesterday wrote to the prime minister asking that Mr William
Waldegrave withdraw his 'false allegation' that he (Lord Callaghan) had lied
to the Commons over devaluation when he was chancellor in 1967.
Mr Waldegrave, the minister for public service and science, refused to back
down from his original comments that Lord Callaghan had given the House a
misleading answer.
But in a letter to the former Labour prime minister he says that the
exceptional circumstances justified the answer.
Lord Callaghan said in a rely to Mr Waldegrave: 'That is simply not good
enough.' He wants the minister to clear his name, and told him: 'You have
allowed the impression to grow that my answers were lies. They were not.
'Under intense questioning in an excited House, my answers show that I
consistently stood my ground, that I would make no statement and give no
information to MPs about sterling.'
Downing Street said the prime minister would consider Lord Callaghan's
correspondence. It was made clear, however, that Mr Major was unlikely to
say anything different from Mr Waldegrave.
The dispute arose when Mr Waldegrave told the Commons Treasury and civil
service committee earlier this week that there were specific occasions -
such as the 1967 devaluation - when ministers could tell untruths to the
Commons.
During prime minister's questions Mr John Smith, Labour leader, used the
issue of whether ministers should always tell the truth to criticise the
government for its 'blatant deception practised at the last election' in
raising taxes after promising to cut them.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Government accepts need to reform treasure laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Valuable antiquities found in England and Wales need more legal protection
than the law on treasure trove affords, the Department of National Heritage
has accepted.
There is concern that the increased use of metal detectors on private land
has led to hundreds of thousands of valuable items not going to the Crown
each year. However, a private member's bill to widen the definition of
treasure trove has been rejected by the department as too complex.
The law specifies that finds made of gold or silver which have been
deliberately buried with the intention of recovery by unknown owners or
heirs belong to the state. Finds which were almost not handed over because
of these strict requirements include the Middleham jewel, an important piece
of jewellery, and the Sutton Hoo ship burial, a find of early Anglo-Saxon
artefacts.
The proposed bill, sponsored by the British Museum, sought to create a new
definition of 'treasure' - in addition to treasure trove - to include items
without high gold or silver content, finds discovered along with official
treasure trove and antiquities found regardless of the owner's identity or
original intention.
Baroness Trumpington, from the government front bench, told the House of
Lords that the government accepted the need for reform, but not in the form
presented by the bill.
She said: 'Because of its long history the law is complicated in ways which
really have nothing to do with the present-day needs of archaeology. Our
view is that the bill would not actually remove these anomalies.
The British Museum is preparing amendments to the bill and hopes to enlist
government support at the committee stage on March 23.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Tunnel start day still a mystery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, is still unable to give a starting
date for its services but expects to be open before the start of the summer
season, Mr Andre Benard, co-chairman said yesterday.
He told a meeting of the French Chamber of Commerce in London that the
company still had to solve a range of problems involving its mechanical,
electrical and computer systems.
Most of the problems involved rolling stock but there were also difficulties
with the fixed systems.
Delays in commissioning the Channel tunnel's operating systems have forced
Eurotunnel to postpone its opening, prompting fears that it could miss the
crucial summer season for passenger journeys.
Freight services were expected to start on March 7 but all that Eurotunnel
has been able to say is that it expects them to start before the official
opening on May 6. Through passenger services between London Waterloo, Paris
and Brussels are expected to start some time in the summer.
Mr Benard said: 'The fixed equipment has been nearly debugged but the
rolling stock has not. We want to be sure we can commission (the trains)
before we go out and give a date. We are making a lot of progress. Problems
are being corrected but it takes time.
'We are confident that the system is sound and it will operate as planned.
There is nothing fundamentally wrong but there are tricky little problems
which need to be solved in a reliable way.'
Mr Benard said Eurotunnel has approached 750 road hauliers in the UK and
more than 1,000 on the Continent of which more than 500 had opened accounts.

FT  11 MAR 94 / London Transport is snubbed over new head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday delivered an unexpected snub to London Transport
when it apparently blocked the promotion of Mr Alan Watkins, LT's deputy
chairman and chief executive, to the post of chairman.
Mr Watkins, who joined LT 18 months ago after 30 years in the private
sector, was widely expected to succeed Sir Wilfred Newton, who steps down
tomorrow.
But London Transport said that Sir Wilfred would stay on temporarily while
Mr Watkins would resign. Sir Wilfred took the unusual step of announcing his
deep regret that Mr Watkins would not be taking over has his successor.
Neither side was prepared to confirm the reasons for the government's
decision although it was believed to be the result of London Transport's
sharply-worded criticisms in recent months of cuts in government spending.
London Underground, of which Mr Watkins is chairman, has been particularly
strong in its condemnation.
The Department of Transport said that it had held talks with a successful
candidate for the chairmanship but that this person had later decided not to
take up the position. Mr Watkins subsequently decided that he would withdraw
from the list of candidates.
Mr Watkins said: 'Any chairman of London Transport needs the unequivocal
support of all those in government with whom he has to do business. Because
in my case this has not been forthcoming, I have reluctantly decided to
withdraw as a possible candidate for chairmanship and am discussing with the
Department of Transport the terms of my departure.'
In his statement expressing regret that Mr Watkins was not to succeed him,
Sir Wilfred said: 'I cannot pay a high enough tribute to the contribution
that he has made as deputy chairman and I am personally sure that his
tireless efforts would have been invaluable to London in the future.'
Sir Wilfred, who became chairman five years ago, is to spend three days a
week on London Transport business.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour transport spokesman, said that Mr Watkins was 'an
intelligent man who says what he thinks rather than what the government
wants to hear and consequently they don't want him'.
Mr Watkins, who is 55, spent 26 years in different parts of the Lucas
electrical and engineering group, finishing as managing director of its
aerospace division. He then went to Hawker Siddeley Group before it was
acquired by BTR.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Clarke pledges relentless pressure on spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday rejected criticism from
rightwing Tory backbenchers that he had been too cautious in cutting public
expenditure.
He said spending restraint was a 'relentless task' which would be central to
all Conservative Budgets.
In an unusually tough speech Mr Clarke gave his first clear backing to the
fundamental reviews of departmental expenditure being carried out by Mr
Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury.
Mr Clarke underlined the importance of the reviews by saying that they were
not a one-off attempt to reduce a big budget deficit.
He said the whole basis of departmental spending - including the issue of
whether the state should withdraw from certain activities - should be
regularly scrutinised in the approach to the annual Budget.
He told industrialists at a conference in Westminster: 'Bearing down on
public spending is a relentless task. My strong view - and that of Michael
Portillo - is that controlling public spending is definitely not something
chancellors and chief secretaries only do once in a while.'
In recent months some Tory backbenchers, including Mr Norman Lamont, the
former chancellor, have warned that tough spending cuts recommended in some
of Mr Portillo's early reviews were not fully implemented in the last
Budget.
They have said that cost-cutting measures announced by Mr Clarke last
November - in areas such as social security and education - were already in
the pipeline, and that Mr Clarke could have been even more stringent.
The chancellor emphasised yesterday, however, that he had reduced spending
plans by Pounds 15bn more than had been envisaged in the March 1993 Budget -
'more than anyone thought possible.'
He said that the first four expenditure reviews - in health, Home Office,
education and social security - had 'contributed to the success of last
November's spending round'.
Treasury officials privately emphasised yesterday that two cost-cutting
reforms announced in the November Budget - the introduction of the job
seekers' allowance and of incapacity benefit - were direct results of Mr
Portillo's review of social security. One official said: 'That was what the
review was after and that was what we delivered.'
Mr Clarke stressed that cuts in taxation before the next election would be
possible only against a background of spending restraint.
'Whenever I am asked 'Will taxes ever come down?' I say: 'Yes, provided we
control public spending,'' he said. 'As a Conservative chancellor,I will
always look first to the spending side of the account when deciding how to
reduce the deficit.'

FT  11 MAR 94 / Former IBA chief leads radio bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Whitney, former director-general of the Independent Broadcasting
Authority, is leading a strong consortium to bid for the UK's third national
commercial radio licence.
The consortium has its funds in place and is backed by two publishing
groups, a television production company and a private individual.
Mr Whitney is chairman of Transworld, a large commercial radio group.
However, Transworld is not believed to be an investor in the bid for the new
licence. Mr Whitney was also founding managing director of Capital Radio,
the London music channel.
The new station is required to be predominantly speech-based and the
consortium appears to be planning a magazine rather than hard news format.
Bids for the licence are due on Tuesday. The highest bidder will win
provided its business plans are credible and proposals fit the criteria.
The Radio Authority plans to publish the names and bids of the applicants on
Tuesday, although it could be up to three months before the licence is
formally awarded.
LBC, which loses its London licence and goes off air in October, will bid
for the new licence. Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, is
also expected to apply.
Independent Television News has been in talks with independent production
company Planet 24 about the possibility of a joint bid, but a decision has
not yet been reached.
GWR, the commercial radio group which has a stake in Classic FM, and Chilton
Radio are also expected to bid.
Separately, talks between LBC and London News Radio, winners of the two
London speech-based station licences, have broken down. LNR had been
interested in acquiring LBC's assets to ensure a 'seamless transition' to
the new operators of the licence but agreement could not be reached in time.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Customs disregarded key reports on Iraq arms sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customs and Excise disregarded key intelligence reports because it did not
consider them 'firm evidence' in the Matrix Churchill prosecution, the Scott
inquiry heard yesterday.
Mr Peter Wiltshire, a senior Customs investigator in the case, told the
inquiry: 'Intelligence is not evidence because evidence has to be provable.
Intelligence is not provable.'
He was explaining why he helped prepare a witness statement for the
prosecution which omitted a reference to Whitehall officials being told by
the intelligence agencies of Matrix Churchill's involvement in building up
Iraq's military capability.
Earlier Mr Wiltshire said he had overlooked an intelligence report prepared
by GCHQ, the government's secret communications centre, on Matrix Churchill
which he admitted had a bearing on the trial.
The report was prepared prior to officials and ministers approving the
export of Matrix Churchill machine tools. The case for the defence was that
executives of Matrix Churchill, who were charged with breaching export laws,
had in fact traded with Iraq with government approval.
A classified document made available to the Scott inquiry shows that the
report was discussed by Mr Wiltshire and representatives of intelligence
agencies within a secret Whitehall committee called the Restricted
Enforcement Unit but was never made available to the defence.
Challenged by Lord Justice Scott to consider his conduct in the Matrix
Churchill affair, Mr Wiltshire accepted that the intelligence document was
'clearly relevant'. He conceded that he may have recommended that the case
be abandoned if the report had been circulated more widely.
The inquiry also heard that Mr Wiltshire chose as one of his key prosecution
witnesses a senior Department of Trade and Industry official in spite of a
warning from more senior colleagues at Customs that the civil servant was a
'weak witness'.
Mr Wiltshire yesterday described the civil servant, Mr Tony Steadman, as an
'honest but nervous' witness, who had suffered from health problems.
But he was challenged by Lord Justice Scott over the apparent
inconsistencies between evidence Mr Steadman gave in the Matrix Churchill
trial, reported conversations between him and Mr Wiltshire, and evidence
contained in Whitehall documents in the possession of the inquiry.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Indigestion drugs gain over-the-counter approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two powerful indigestion remedies have been approved for sale without a
doctor's prescription.
The UK is the first country to license over-the-counter sales of Tagamet and
Pepcid. Together they represent the most important extension of the OTC
market for more than a decade.
The two drugs will be in competition, since both work in the same way by
suppressing acid production in the stomach. They were developed originally
to treat ulcers.
SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet was the world's best-selling prescription
medicine in the 1980s until overtaken by Glaxo's ulcer drug Zantac, which is
not yet available without a prescription. Last year Tagamet sales were worth
Pounds 673m to the UK-US pharmaceutical group.
Pepcid has a more complicated corporate background. It was developed by
Yamanouchi of Japan and licensed to Merck of the US. But Pepcid's OTC sales
in the UK are handled by Centra, a UK joint venture of Merck and Johnson &amp;
Johnson.
Both drugs will be promoted for relief of heartburn, dyspepsia and excess
acid. Centra plans to spend Pounds 5m over the next year advertising Pepcid.
They will be competing against a wide range of traditional antacids, which
give short-term relief by neutralising stomach acids but do not have the
same long-term effect on acid-producing cells as Tagamet and Pepcid.
The UK market for OTC indigestion remedies is worth about Pounds 60m a year,
said Ms Sheila Kelly, executive director of the Proprietary Association of
Great Britain, the trade body for non-prescription medicines.
But the two newcomers are likely to add substantially to the total sales in
this sector, she says. 'At present, one quarter of all indigestion episodes
are not treated at all.'
SmithKline Beecham hopes that the new non-prescription market for Tagamet
will make up for some of the sales lost when the drug loses its main US
patent in May. The Food and Drug Administration is still looking at
SmithKline Beecham's application for OTC Tagamet.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Pilots' union hits out at Heathrow closure delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Balpa, the pilots' union, yesterday demanded a full-scale inquiry into why
there was a 40-minute delay in closing the northern runway of London's
Heathrow airport after Wednesday's mortar-bomb attack.
The IRA yesterday admitted responsibility for the mortars, fired from the
car-park of the Excelsior Hotel, as police and BAA, which owns the airport,
launched a review of security and evacuation procedures.
Mr Chris Darke, general secretary of Balpa, said he was 'alarmed' that 24
aircraft took off during that time. 'It is intolerable that this incident
put the lives of pilots, their flight and cabin crews and their passengers
at risk,' he said.
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Condon and Commander David Tucker,
head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, defended the police decision
to keep the runway open. They refused to discuss the nature and extent of
the investigation into security procedures.
Commander Tucker said the decision to keep the runway open was made in
consultation between the police and BAA, based on an assessment of the
probable direction of the mortar bombs and the fact that at the time of the
car-park fire police had received no reports on impacts of any of the
mortars.
Police heard first reports of a fire in the Excelsior car-park just before
6pm, less than an hour after six coded messages warning of bombs at Heathrow
were received.
Within 10 minutes of the fire, police discovered the Nissan Micra car from
which the devices were fired. After the runway was cleared, police found two
mortars on it and two more nearby.
Police said they did not know why none of the mortars detonated. The
mortars, which travelled 700 yards from the car-park, did not land on the
part of the runway normally used by aircraft. Commander Tucker said 'there
was no danger at any time of an aircraft running over the debris before the
runway was closed'.
Commander Tucker said IRA warning calls tended to be 'dishonest', and there
was a danger that if police had evacuated the runway sooner up to 20,000
people may have been in the Excelsior car-park when the car carrying the
mortars exploded.
The commissioner said: 'We all share the responsibility for risk assessment.
We can minimise risk but we can never totally neutralise it.'
Mr Mike Roberts, managing director of Heathrow airport, supported the
decision not to close the runway immediately.
He said: 'Safety and security are our highest priority, I can assure you.
When entering into the decision-making process we take advice from the
police and take a decision to make sure everything is safe.'
Police said the airport was fully operational by 9.30am yesterday.

FT  11 MAR 94 / MPs urge alternatives to job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers should consider job-share schemes and flexible working as
alternatives to the 'misery' of redundancies, the Commons employment
committee said in a report published yesterday.
Companies, in consultation with unions, should also consider cuts in
overtime and alternative strategies such as early retirement to try to avoid
compulsory job losses, the committee said.
The MPs underlined the urgency of their conclusions by highlighting the
'evil' of mass unemployment and noting that more than 1m people have been
out of work for more than a year.
Mr Greville Janner, Labour chairman of the committee, urged the Department
of Employment to set up a task force to give advice to employers before
redundancies were made. At present employment department officials give
advice after job losses have been announced - 'mopping up the dead on the
battle-field instead of trying to prevent the slaughter,' Mr Janner said.
He suggested that training and enterprise councils, which deliver government
training schemes in England and Wales, and local enterprise companies, the
Scottish development bodies, should co-ordinate local responses to
unemployment and develop the task force approach with local authorities.
Tecs are one of several partners in local economic development, and the
report said some members of the committee did not consider that they or the
Lecs had yet successfully developed this role.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Plan to turn Independent private revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consortium bidding for Newspaper Publishing, which owns The Independent,
wants to turn the company private, shareholder documents show.
The consortium, which includes Mirror Group Newspapers, owner of the Daily
Mirror, plans to call an extraordinary general meeting on winning control of
the newspaper to seek permission to re-register the company as a private
one, adopt new articles of association and appoint Mr Andreas Whittam Smith,
main founder of The Independent, as chairman for three years.
The documents make clear the consortium does not envisage minority
shareholders, and imply that there will be no board representation for
Independent Newspapers of Ireland, the largest individual shareholder in the
company.
The 29.9 per cent stake held by the company chaired by Mr Tony O'Reilly
could make it difficult to carry out many of the changes the consortium is
planning. The stake could be used to block a range of special resolutions,
including plans to take the company private.
Apart from MGN, which will be responsible for running everything at The
Independent apart from editorial, the consortium includes a group of
founders led by Mr Whittam Smith, and two large existing shareholders, El
Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy.
Journalists at The Independent say that in more than 100 pages covering the
agreements between the consortium and its members there are no guarantees
that existing agreements with staff or conditions of service will be
honoured.
The main mention of editorial independence in the agreements says: 'Each of
the parties agrees with the other parties that it would not be in the
commercial interests of itself or the company to alter or attempt to alter
the editorial positioning and stance of political independence developed by
the company.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is expected to
decide early next week on whether to refer the bid to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Labour last night urged the government to attach strict conditions to ensure
the continued editorial freedom of The Independent and the Independent on
Sunday. Mr Robin Corbett, shadow minister for press and broadcasting, wants
Newspaper Publishing to have an uneven number of directors with Mirror Group
Newspapers entitled to only a minority of them.

FT  11 MAR 94 / N Sea costs set to fall by up to 30%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Operating costs of oil companies working in the UK sector of the North Sea
could fall by between 15 per cent and 30 per cent over the next six years,
says a study published yesterday by consultants Arthur Andersen.
The report said cost-cutting undertaken by North Sea operators would cushion
the impact on profits of low oil prices, although gross revenues from North
Sea production would be badly hit if prices were persistently weak.
The report, which looks at the impact of low oil prices on revenues and
profits, is based on an average real price of oil of Dollars 13 a barrel
over the next 32 years. Under those conditions, revenue per barrel of oil
equivalent - which includes natural gas - would drop by 24 per cent compared
with an earlier study based on real oil prices of Dollars 18 a barrel.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Sunderland gives stadium approval
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunderland councillors last night approved proposals by the city's football
club for a new Pounds 70m sports, entertainment and conference centre, in
spite of strong opposition from Nissan, whose Pounds 900m car plant occupies
the adjacent site.
The environment committee decided unanimously not to refuse outline planning
permission. Because the proposal, for green belt land, is a departure from
Sunderland's present development plan the application must be referred to Mr
John Gummer, environment secretary. A public inquiry is expected by autumn.
Nissan fears the centre could block its possible expansion and that traffic
would jeopardise just-in-time delivery and production methods.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Revenue is told to improve tax check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue needs to do more to discover whether it is identifying
most effectively the companies to investigate for underpayment of tax, the
National Audit Office said yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
Its report is generally complimentary towards the Revenue's approach, but
says it needs more information about the extent of non-compliance in
accounts which are not examined to establish whether its activity serves as
an effective deterrent.
The report says that in 1992-93 local tax offices screened the returns and
accounts of 3m self-employed taxpayers and 780,000 companies to identify
additional tax owed of Pounds 2.5bn.
The Revenue gathered a further Pounds 1.6bn in that year from the
examination of cases by head office and from its specialist branches.

FT  11 MAR 94 / London council tax to fall by 3.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty-one of the 32 boroughs in London are to cut their council tax next
month, only a few weeks before local elections. The reduction on a property
in band D will average 3.9 per cent.
The 21 include Conservative and Labour-dominated councils. Eight councils
are to raise their tax while three, including Lambeth, will leave it
unchanged.
The sharpest reductions, announced by the Association of London Authorities,
were achieved by Labour-controlled Greenwich, down Pounds 151.12 to Pounds
632, and Conservative-controlled Brent, which fell by Pounds 112.50 to
Pounds 485.10.
Eleven other boroughs - Bromley, Camden, Ealing, Hackney, Hammersmith,
Haringey, Hounslow, Islington, Southwark, Wandsworth and Westminster -
delivered above-average reductions.
Boroughs which had low levels of the former poll tax, such as Westminster
and Wandsworth, will benefit further from government transitional relief
grants, designed to ensure that households do not suffer sharp increases
from one year to the next.
Liberal Democrat-controlled Richmond registered the highest increase,
raising its council tax by Pounds 53.21 to Pounds 594 for band D, which
covers properties valued between Pounds 68,000 and Pounds 88,000.
Council-tax cuts in Greater London contrast with an average rise across the
country of 2.1 per cent, according to the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance and Accountancy. The Department of the Environment had predicted an
average rise of more than 7 per cent when it unveiled local-authority grants
for England for 1994-95 at the end of last year.
Cipfa said a sharp increase in the tax base had helped London councils
because residents who had avoided poll tax found it more difficult to avoid
paying council tax. Many councils collected far more tax than they had
expected. Some boroughs were also helped by the new formula which
re-allocated local-government grants.
Most authorities claim to have avoided cuts in services. Hounslow has
abandoned the planned 2 per cent cut in its primary school budget announced
before last year's government grant announcement.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Heseltine calls for unity in accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountants should agree to merge their different professional bodies, Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told accountants this week.
In a speech to the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, Mr
Heseltine said: 'The more rationalised and integrated the accountancy
profession becomes the more its voice will be heard.'
There are six chartered accountancy bodies as well as several other
institutes and associations in related subjects, which have failed to merge
in spite of several attempts.
The six primary bodies are engaged in another round of discussions about
possible mergers, and are expected to make an announcement on the subject
later this month.
Mr Heseltine, who failed his accountancy examinations, also described
himself during the speech as 'an unqualified success' since leaving the
profession.
He said accountants had a big contribution to make in fostering a successful
and competitive British economy but would do it much better if they were
integrated.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Price-fixing on books is defended in EU court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Book publishers yesterday began what could be their final fight to defend
the Net Book Agreement, which allows publishers to decide on a book's
minimum price.
The agreement is under investigation by the Office of Fair Trading and was
declared illegal by the European Commission in 1988.
Mr Jeremy Lever, representing the Publishers' Association, told the European
Court of Justice: 'This case raises a fundamental issue concerning the
cultural development not just of the United Kingdom and Ireland, to which it
principally relates, but of all the member states of the European Economic
Area.'
The Publishers' Association and its Irish Republic equivalent, CLE, have
been fighting to defend the agreement - which rules out large price
discounts - since the Commission declared it illegal under its competition
rules. The decision was upheld by the European Court of First Instance in
1992.
The case which began yesterday is the appeal against the 1992 ruling. A
decision is expected by the end of the year.
Mr Lever argued that the the Maastricht treaty had changed the ground rules
and would force the court to consider wider issues.
'This court is now required to take into account the cultural effects of
both the Commission's decision and of the Court of First Instance's judgment
in the exercise of its jurisdiction over this appeal,' he said.
The Publishers' Association and the CLE, battling to protect the Pounds
2.5bn UK book market, fear that rising sales and discounts in supermarkets,
petrol stations and through mail order, will reduce choice and quality for
consumers and could force small bookshops out of business.
But Mr Nicholas Forwood, the lawyer representing the commission, attacked
the agreement as a 'a price cartel' which limited competition.
'It has the effect of making rigid a system which . . . might be able to
evolve in a different manner but for this agreement,' he said, adding that
the publishers had failed to prove that there had been any legal holes in
the Commission's decision or the Court of First Instance's ruling.

FT  11 MAR 94 / N Sea costs set to fall by up to 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Operating costs of oil companies working in the UK sector of the North Sea
could fall by between 15 per cent and 30 per cent over the next six years,
according to a study published yesterday by consultants Arthur Andersen.
The report said cost-cutting initiatives undertaken by North Sea operators
will cushion the impact on profits of low oil prices, although gross
revenues from North Sea production would be badly hit if prices are
persistently weak.
The report, which looks at the impact of low oil prices on revenues and
profits, is based on an average real price of oil of Dollars 13 a barrel
over the next 32 years.
Under those conditions, revenue per barrel of oil equivalent - which
includes natural gas - would drop by 24 per cent compared with an earlier
study based on real oil prices of Dollars 18 a barrel. But net profits per
barrel would fall by only 12 per cent.
The expected resilience of profits is attributed to the industry's emphasis
on reducing costs by using new technology which requires fewer offshore
staff.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Lautro fines life insurer record Pounds 225,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A record Pounds 225,000 fine has been imposed by Lautro, the self-regulating
organisation for the life insurance industry, on Aegon life assurance for
serious structural failures in its compliance procedures.
The penalty is the first to be levied as a result of the second round of
routine inspection visits carried out by the regulator.
It reflects Lautro's statement last week that there could be 'little excuse'
for companies which still had seriously inadequate compliance procedures in
spite of the extensive amounts of regulatory guidance that had been issued.
The regulatory offences, admitted by Aegon, occurred between May 1990 and
March 1993 and related to weaknesses in the internal control systems.
As a result of the rule breaches, Aegon has had to review 2,000 files using
standards set by an independent firm of accountants and pay some Pounds
10,000 compensation to 65 investors.
The payments relate to complaints against the company which it had already
admitted but where Lautro believed it had undercompensated customers.
Five specific shortcomings listed by Lautro included failures in vetting
procedures for appointing some company representatives and 'tied' agents, in
checking selling practices, in properly investigating the high levels of
policies sold by some sales agents being surrendered early, and in dealing
with complaints promptly and properly.
Lautro also said that the compliance department had inadequate resources.
Mr Peter Baines, Aegon chief executive, said that since the second
inspection visit the company had increased its compliance department from
six to 11 staff and had appointed a new head of compliance.
He said that during 1991 and 1992 the company had expanded rapidly, and
admitted that he and colleagues had failed to keep up with the changes in
regulatory standards that Lautro was introducing.
Although the fine is a new record - about Pounds 45,000 higher than that
recently imposed on Legal &amp; General for widespread and systemic weaknesses
in compliance - it is likely to be superseded shortly as other cases from
the second round of inspection visits are determined.
Mr Baines estimated that beyond the fine itself the disciplinary action had
cost Aegon almost Pounds 500,000, taking account of its payment of Lautro's
costs of Pounds 20,000 as well as the cost of engaging outside advisers and
making systems changes. He expressed confidence that all the necessary
compensation payments had been made.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Little change due on law for women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, last night accepted that some changes
should be made to the Sex Discrimination Act to improve employment
opportunities for women. However he ruled out wholesale recasting of its
provisions.
While promising to have further discussions with the Equal Opportunities
Commission, he told the Commons: 'I do not think we should substantially
reshape the legislation.'
Mr Hunt rejected Labour charges that over the last 15 years the government
had exploited the increase in male unemployment by encouraging the use of
part-time women workers to drive down wage levels.
He said women often wanted to combine work with family commitments, and had
benefited greatly from the creation of more than 2m part-time jobs over the
past 10 years.
Ms Clare Short, who speaks for Labour on women's issues, said the
overwhelming majority of women were in low-paid jobs with little opportunity
for promotion, and no pension entitlement.
She said the expansion in the number of part-time women workers had followed
the destruction of more and more full-time jobs for men, and had resulted in
the 'dragging down of standards' for everyone.
Ms Short added: 'Women do not want rotten wages, no training and no pensions
 -that is why full-time rights for part-time workers are crucial'.
She called for urgent action to implement the recent House of Lords'
judgment that the UK's laws on part-time workers' rights over redundancy pay
and unfair dismissal were in breach of European law.
Ms Short said Labour's commitment to introduce a minimum wage would 'pay for
itself' through the increase in the income tax yield and the savings in the
social security budget resulting from reduced payments of family credit.
Mr Hunt condemned discrimination against women as 'not only inefficient but
clearly wrong' and maintained that there was great scope for a bi-partisan
policy.
He stressed that only 13 per cent of women with part-time jobs would prefer
to work full time.

The Japanese arm of Trafalgar House, the UK construction and engineering

business, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The company, which opened its Japanese branch last month, will become the
first UK group to acquire a licence to provide fabricated steel for the
construction industry.
The move however, comes at a time when the sharp fall in the economy and the
plunge in the property market has hurt the Japanese construction industry.
Trafalgar says it intends to gain market access by supplying low-cost steel
products from its Dubai operations to Japanese fabricated steel
sub-contractors, facing a profit squeeze.

<TEXT>
Hong Kong, the world's busiest container port, is to build its first
terminal designed to cater for China trade down the Pearl River Delta,
writes Louise Lucas in Hong Kong. If the trade went to a port in China it
could cost the colony more than HKDollars 13bn (Pounds 1.1bn) over 10 years,
according to government estimates.
The newest terminal will be part of an overall port project which aims to
put in place up to 24 new container berths by the year 2011. It will handle
the growing volume of cargo that comes down river from China - often bundled
up in sacks, and nearly always requiring containerisation  - which is
expected to double by 2001 and quadruple in the following decade.
There were 20.7m tonnes of freight carried by river last year, and the Port
Development Board reckons existing facilities will reach full capacity by
1996.
The River Trade Terminal will be built and operated by private enterprise
and the first phase should be completed by late 1997. The project is
expected to go out to tender this year.

Mr Miguel Mancera is to be governor of Mexico's newly independent central
bank. Head of the existing non-independent central bank for the past 11
years, he had been favourite to take the post.
The Bank of Mexico, which becomes formally independent from April, will have
broad powers to set monetary policy, and will be prohibited from providing
credit rates to the government below market levels.
However, the finance ministry will have overall responsibility for exchange
rate policy.
Mr Mancera, an economist with a doctorate from Yale, will serve for three
years and nine months. He is widely respected in Mexico and abroad, and is
known for his aversion to inflation, commitment to pro-market economic
policy, and support of a stable currency.
However, some Mexican banks have criticised him for his cautious attitude to
financial liberalisation, in particular his opposition to rapid development
of a futures and options market in Mexico.
Four other economists appointed to the board of governors are all known for
their technical expertise and political independence. They are: Mr Guillermo
Prieto, Mr Ariel Buira, Mr Jesus Yacamen, and Mr Francisco Gil Diaz.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Clinton officials give Whitewater evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three White House officials yesterday gave evidence in secret to a federal
grand jury investigating the Whitewater affair. A stack of documents were
also turned over to the same panel, convened by Mr Robert Fiske, the
independent counsel probing Whitewater.
First to be called was Ms Margaret Williams, chief of staff to Mrs Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who said afterwards she was encouraged to be involved in a
process 'where the finding of fact is important, as opposed to innuendo and
rumour-mongering and gossip and sensationalism.'
She was followed by Ms Lisa Caputo, the first lady's press secretary, and Mr
Mark Gearan, White House director of communications. All are said to have
attended meetings with regulatory officials investigating Madison Guaranty,
the failed savings and loan institution at the centre of the Whitewater
affair, involving Mr and Mrs Clinton's 1980s financial dealings in Arkansas.
Seven more senior White House and Treasury officials have secured
postponement of testimony, most until next week. But one of them, Mr Roger
Altman, deputy Treasury secretary, confessed to the Wall Street Journal
yesterday to 'a piece of awful judgment' in arranging a meeting on February
2 with the White House to discuss the status of the Madison inquiry.
He was then acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency
formed to clean up the nationwide savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. He
said he never told President or Mrs Clinton, or Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the
Treasury secretary, in advance about his initiative, and insisted the
session was purely informational.
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, again alleging tampering with
official inquiries, said Mr Altman should resign, as should Mr Webster
Hubbell, associate attorney general and formerly a partner in Mrs Clinton's
Little Rock law firm.
The White House said resignation was not on the cards, but Mr Altman's star
in Washington has been much dimmed.
Also, 82 Republican congressmen yesterday demanded an investigation into an
old story: Mrs Clinton's participation in an investment partnership accused
of profiting by short-selling drugs stocks last year when she was attacking
pharmaceutical companies for overcharging.
Both Mr and Mrs Clinton sought to give the impression of business as usual
yesterday, the president speaking in New York and the first lady attending a
healthcare meeting on Capitol Hill. The threat of early congressional
hearings on Whitewater, which Mr Fiske said could interfere with his
inquiries, appeared to recede. Senator William Cohen, Maine Republican,
doubted they could be held before June.
The president could also take some encouragement from two polls published
yesterday which showed that, notwith standing a torrent of critical and now
nationwide media coverage, the public is still unpersuaded of the
seriousness of Whitewater.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Balaguer heads for seventh term of office: Dominican
Republic election looks like usual one-horse race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Antonio Reynoso, recently suspended from the priesthood for involvement
in politics, is promising a virtual revolution in the Dominican Republic. If
he wins the presidential election in May, he is planning (threatening, say
cynics) to lead 'a government without theft and with efficiency'.
There is general acceptance in the country that official corruption is
endemic. President Balaguer, who admitted as much in recently decreeing that
corrupt officials should be tried, immediately dampened public expectations
of change by saying there was no proof.
While Mr Reynoso's plan for clean government is being received with some
sympathy, he is unlikely to get a chance to implement it. A familiar picture
is emerging in the election campaign. The three main contenders will be the
conservative Mr Balaguer, Mr Juan Bosch, his arch rival and once an avowed
Marxist who has done an ideological volte face, and Mr Jose Francisco Pena
Gomez, a social democrat doing well in opinion polls.
Mr Balaguer, who is finishing his sixth term, had said on 14 occasions that
he would not stand again. More recently, after returning from medical
treatment in the US, the 87-year-old president said his decision would
depend on his health. The incumbent Reformist Social Christian party then
surprised no one by deciding he would stand again.
Mr Balaguer and Mr Bosch (85) have contested all elections in the country
since the 1960s. The president, who is blind, believes in public works and
was particularly keen on presiding over the inauguration of the Columbus
light-house, a massive structure the cost of which is unknown even to senior
ministers.
Mr Bosch, who is ill, and who shed his Marxist habit four years ago and
proclaimed the virtues of a market economy, is likely to fare far worse in
the election than his traditional close and controversial second. Mr Pena
Gomez, 54-year-old leader of the Dominican Revolutionary party, appears most
likely to mount the strongest challenge.
He has a handicap, however. He is black in a country of long-standing
prejudice against the black 10 per cent of the population, and where the
tone has been set by Mr Balaguer's writings which have been dismissive of
the intellectual, moral and physical qualities of blacks. The issue has
become a factor in the campaign with Mr Pena Gomez's PRD accusing the PRSC
of mounting a racist campaign.
Whoever wins will face a difficult task in trying to move an economy which
Mr Bernardo Vega, a former central bank governor, describes as being 'on
auto-pilot while in a state of suspended animation. There is marginal
economic growth, no inflation, no movement of the exchange rate.'
The main sectors have suffered from a coincidence of setbacks which have
dampened economic growth. The increasingly inefficient state sugar producer
has been overwhelmed by deficits, and there has been a progressive reduction
in the US's valuable sugar quota. The state-owned gold producer has been
forced to close by falling prices and high production costs. Nickel
production has also been hit by low prices.
The trade deficit reached Dollars 1.75bn last year, 15 per cent higher than
1992, but the balance of payments has benefited from earnings from the free
trade zones which produce exclusively for export, mainly to the US, and from
tourism.
'This has been supported by substantial inflows of funds repatriated by
Dominicans abroad to benefit from the attractive interest rates of about 35
per cent for Dominican peso deposits,' said Mr Vega. 'But because of these
high rates there has been little investment. Now interest rates are coming
down and there will be some capital flight before the election.'
In trying to massage the economy towards expansion, the government has been
subsidising sugar mills, coffee, cocoa and rice. This has damaged the fiscal
accounts and has not produced many positive results. Under an agreement with
the International Monetary Fund, the government is being forced towards
prudence in its fiscal affairs. The economy is about Dollars 640m in arrears
on servicing its Dollars 4.5bn foreign debt, but some relief should come
from an agreement with commercial bank creditors to reduce by about a half
the Dollars 1bn which they are owed.
Except for Mr Reynoso, none of the candidates is promising to do anything
very different. The auto-pilot may have security of tenure.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Trade News: EU rejects US allegations of hypocrisy

The European Commission yesterday rejected US allegations of hypocrisy over
the US-Japan trade dispute, and denied it had erected barriers against US
products, writes Gillian Tett in Brussels. It said although the EU did not
endorse US strong-arm tactics in the trade row, it was 'just as concerned'
about the deficits the EU and US had with Japan.
The commission was responding to an attack on Wednesday night, by Mr Micky
Kantor, US trade representative, who accused Europe of standing on the
sidelines in the US-Japan dispute while continuing to impose barriers
against some US goods.
Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, accepted that some problems
remained between the EU and US over trade barriers, but insisted progress
was being made to remove them. 'The EU also has a very long list of US trade
barriers, some of which have been in existence for decades,' said Sir Leon.
Examples included US tax rules on certain cars and regulations which
stipulated levels of American tobacco in cigarettes, a spokesman added.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Clinton officials give Whitewater evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three White House officials yesterday gave evidence in secret to a federal
grand jury investigating the Whitewater affair. Stacks of relevant documents
were also turned over to the same panel, convened by Mr Robert Fiske, the
independent counsel probing Whitewater.
The officials called yesterday were understood to be Mr Mark Gearan, the
communications director, Ms Margaret Williams, chief of staff to Mrs Hillary
Clinton, and Ms Lisa Caputo, the First Lady's press secretary. All are said
to have attended meetings with regulatory officials investigating Madison
Guaranty, the failed savings and loan institution at the centre of the
Whitewater affair, involving Mr and Mrs Clinton's 1980s financial dealings
in Arkansas.
Other senior White House and treasury officials have secured temporary
postponement of testimony, most until next week. But one of them, Mr Roger
Altman, the deputy secretary of the treasury, confessed in an interview
yesterday with the Wall Street Journal to 'a piece of awful judgment' in
arranging a meeting on February 2 with the White House to discuss the status
of the Madison inquiry.
He was then acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency
formed to clean up the nationwide savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. He
said he never told the president, First Lady, or Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the
treasury secretary, in advance about his initiative in briefing the White
House, but insisted the session was purely informational.
Republicans have alleged the briefings were improper and raised the
possibility of official tampering in the case.
Washington suspects Mr Altman, the Wall Street investment banker who has
been a high flyer in the administration, may be the next prominent victim of
Whitewater. Although the White House insists there is no question of his
resignation, his chances of succeeding Mr Bentsen have clearly diminished.
President Bill Clinton went on the road to New York yesterday for speaking
engagements to give the impression of business as usual. The threat of early
congressional hearings on Whitewater, which Mr Fiske said could interfere
with his own inquiries, appeared to recede. Senator William Cohen, the Maine
Republican, doubted yesterday that hearings could be held before June.
The president could also take some encouragement from two polls published
yesterday which showed that, notwithstanding a torrent of critical and now
nationwide media coverage, the public is still unpersuaded by the
seriousness of Whitewater.
The Wall Street Journal/NBC survey found 34 per cent believing it was being
used against him for political purposes, with only 16 per cent persuaded he
had done anything wrong. The USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll found well over half
convinced Mr and Mrs Clinton had done something unethical. But both reported
only a little erosion in the first couple's approval ratings.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Hungary confirms lead in freeing up
telecoms - Nicholas Denton reports on the award of local network concessions
to foreign-led partnerships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary, in awarding concessions to foreign-led consortia to run local
telecoms networks in 15 out of the country's 54 districts, has confirmed its
innovative policy in telecommunications. Budapest privatised its national
operator and adopted digital mobile networks before most east European
countries.
In December it sold 30 per cent of Matav, the national telecommunications
company, to Deutsche Telecom of Germany and Ameritech of the US for Dollars
875m in eastern Europe's largest privatisation. The local tender further
dilutes state control over the telecoms sector.
The government granted concessions in four districts to UTS, a partnership
of French telecoms equipment manufacturer Alcatel and US Telecom East, a
group of US local telecommunications companies. UTS plans to invest Dollars
275m over a decade to build up the number of lines in its regions by the
government requirement of 15.5 per cent a year.
Two local areas centered on Szeged, Hungary's second-largest city, go to
Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the diversified French public utilities group.
Other foreign-led consortia have won in another nine regions, with the
remaining 39 staying with Matav, the national operator.
The authorities have indicated that they are prepared to grant licences for
local telephone companies to operate cable television in parallel. Hungary
would be the first country after the UK where the regulators have relaxed
the barrier between the two, increasingly converging, businesses.
Budapest's is a policy of letting 'a hundred flowers bloom', says Mr Henri
Piganeau, Hungarian project director for CGE.
However, the entry of independents will do little in the short-run for
competition. The concessions give the winners exclusive local rights for
eight years and do not impinge on Matav's monopoly of trunk and
international traffic. Independent operators will take over less than 20 per
cent of existing lines, with the majority remaining with Matav.
Rivalry with cable television providers will be muted. The
telecommunications ministry said that it would grant dual service licences
on a case-by-case basis and would take into account the interests of
existing cable operators.
Nevertheless, CGE for one plans to run fibre-optic cable as close as
possible to houses in the expectation of a permit to offer television. The
company estimates that cable television services have the potential to add a
fifth to the value of the business.
When the local monopolies expire, CGE's Mr Piganeau forecasts, strong local
operators will begin to raid border areas of neighbouring regions. 'It
provides the seeds of future competition,' he says.
In the meantime, the independents should be able to lead Matav by example,
according to Mr Piganeau. Their performance will provide a benchmark by
which to measure the national operator's performance.
On balance, analysts say Hungary's liberalisation has probably gone as far
as it could without undermining Matav or making the environment so risky as
to deter new entrants into the market.
'Hungary is really leading the way on this one,' says Mr James Roberson of
United Telecom Services.
Hungary is an unlikely telecommunications pioneer. The telephone network,
with just 7 lines per 100 inhabitants, was the most sparse in the Soviet
bloc even though its communist neighbours hardly set exacting standards.
But in some races there are advantages to coming from behind: in the drive
to develop modern telecommunications, eastern Europe - and particularly
Hungary - is demonstrating that backwardness has its compensations.
The growing strain on state finances, far from limiting development, has
pushed Budapest to liberalise and attract private finance. The auction of
local concessions raised a useful Ft8.2bn (Pounds 54m) for the government
and attracted commitments from foreign consortia to invest Ft20bn in the
first three years.
Low line-density, still only 15 per 100 compared with a west European
average of 43, provided the political impetus to invite in independent local
operators. Long waiting lists for phones have made Matav one of Hungary's
most unpopular companies and fuelled demands by many communities for more
responsive local operators.
Local authorities criticise Matav for putting the trunk network and
businesses above provision of new lines for ordinary households. 'That's
what happens when you have King Kong calling all the shots,' says Mr
Roberson.
The inadequacy of communist telecommunications regulation freed regulators
to tear up past laws and fashion the 1993 telecoms act around modern
technology and the new possibilities of competition.
All in all, Hungary has offered a classic example of what telecoms analysts
call the 'leapfrog' - the ability of countries with backward networks to
jump over a whole stage of telecoms development. Hungary's neighbours, which
start even further back, have a similar opportunity.
The independents certainly hope so. UTS says it is looking at other east
European countries and CGE believes its operations in south-eastern Hungary
could provide a springboard for expansion into neighbouring Romania and even
Serbia.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Aylwin pardons 3 Chileans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Patricio Aylwin, in practically his last official act, has
pardoned three Chileans condemned to life imprisonment for the attempted
assassination of the then military ruler General Augusto Pinochet in 1986.
The three, all members of the Frente Patriotico Manuel Rodriguez, were
yesterday due to leave for Belgium where they are expected to spend 20 years
in exile.
The controversial pardon, announced less than 24 hours before today's
handover of power to fellow Christian Democrat president-elect Eduardo Frei,
is a sign that civilian authority has taken deep root since the military
government stepped down in 1990.
Mr Aylwin was keen to deal with the issue now in order to prevent it from
causing friction with the military authorities during Mr Frei's six-year
term.
The armed forces have made it known they would not look kindly on the
release of those who attempted to kill their commander-in-chief.
Civilian-military relations have been difficult, mainly over human rights
trials, but the Aylwin administration has become more confident as its
largely successful economic and social policies gained support. However,
military influence remains. The president has no authority to remove Gen
Pinochet as head of the armed forces. He is expected to stay until 1998.

FT  11 MAR 94 / US warns Japan on surplus: 'Great nations keep their
commitments,' says Christopher
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan was warned yesterday to live up to its commitment to reduce its
current account surplus significantly or risk losing international
credibility.
'Great nations keep their commitments,' Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary
of state, said in Tokyo. The US had kept its part of the bargain, made in
bilateral framework negotiations, to take steps to reduce its deficit. Japan
had voluntarily agreed to lower its surplus, but 'no one would agree with
the contention that Japan has met its commitment,' Mr Christopher said.
While in other respects, the US's single most important bilateral
relationship was healthy, it continued to be troubled by the trade
situation. 'Compliance with the framework agreement should be the basis for
going forward,' Mr Christopher said.
Although there were no breakthroughs in his talks yesterday with Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa and Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's prime and foreign ministers, Mr
Christopher said he had sensed a greater recognition that the status quo was
unsatisfactory to the US.
Japanese officials had assured him that Japan would draw up by the end of
the month steps to fulfil its framework agreements.
Mr Christopher further defended the US government's decision to revive the
Super 301 provision in the 1988 US trade act giving it the right to
retaliate against unfair trade practices.
The US decision has come under attack from several quarters, including the
European Union, as going against the trend of 'multilateralising' trade
issues.
Yesterday Mr Gerard Longuet, French trade and industry minister, joined
growing international criticism of Washington's decision to revive Super 301
saying as an 'unjustified attack' on Japan.
Super 301 was a tool to open Japan's markets not only to the US, but to all
countries, Mr Christopher said. Neither the US nor Japan wanted a trade war
and Super 301 was useful in encouraging the parties to have the kind of
dialogue that rendered retaliation unnecessary.
Mr Christopher said that while other countries might not agree with the
measures employed by the US in opening up Japan's markets, 'the world looks
to the US for leadership' and 'will be very glad to reap the benefits of
what the US is doing. Whatever their position,' he said, 'the rest of the
world will applaud if we can achieve those results.'

FT  11 MAR 94 / Brazil cuts import duties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil has cut import duties on a wide range of household products following
criticism that the government's economic restructuring programme has led to
big price rises. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, said lower
tariffs would curtail price rises because imports could now compete with
locally-made goods.
Inflation is thought to have risen this month as companies raise prices
following introduction of a new accounting unit, the unit of real value
(URV), designed to form the basis of a new currency. Companies also feared a
government price freeze as in previous restructuring attempts.
The media has highlighted examples of prices doubling, adding to political
pressure on Mr Cardoso to act and avert calls for stronger measures, such as
the government setting key prices.
Products targeted in the duty changes include toiletries, paint and
medicines. They are almost all made by companies with near-monopoly or
oligopoly control over the local market. Import duties on such goods are cut
from 20 per cent to 2 per cent.
Meanwhile, Brazil is increasingly optimistic it has persuaded the IMF to
grant a standby accord as part of the country's Dollars 52bn (Pounds 35bn)
private bank debt rescheduling plan.
IMF approval is a prerequisite for the US treasury to issue zero coupon
bonds as guarantees for part of the rescheduling. Mr Cardoso is likely to
visit Washington for talks with Mr Michael Camdessus, chairman of the IMF,
in time for the Fund to issue a letter of intent next week.
Brazil's congress has approved, in the first of two scheduled votes, the
reduction of the president's term of office from five to four years.
The new rule will apply to the country's next president, due to take office
next year following elections in October.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Trade News: ABB set to sign Russian contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Percy Barnevik, president and chief executive of Asea Brown Boveri, will
sign a preliminary contract in Moscow today which could lead to the
construction of a Dollars 500m (Pounds 342.4m) hydrocracker plant at Kirishi
in southern Russia.
The initial engineering contract will be awarded to ABB, Europe's largest
electrical engineering group, and Chevron, the US oil company, its partner
in the proposed project.
Lummus, a US company that is part of ABB, is a world leader in the
technology for hydrocrackers, which crack heavy oils into light fuels. The
final contract for the plant has not yet been awarded.
Mr Barnevik coupled his announcement of the initial contract, at ABB's
results meeting in Copenhagen yesterday, with another plea for more western
finance for power and oil-and-gas related projects in Russia and Ukraine.
He said it was 'a great tragedy' that the west, with some exceptions, had
contributed almost no new money to help ex-Soviet republics reach economic
and political stability. Tens of billions of dollars, rather than hundreds
of millions, were needed, he said.
The west had missed the opportunity to support the reform programme in
Russia, he said. Reforms would now take longer.
Mr Barnevik said ABB saw revamping of Russia's oil and gas industry as a top
priority because it would boost exports. But modernisation of polluting
power stations was also important, along with increased automation to raise
productivity of basic industries.
He said western finance was vital for energy-related projects in Ukraine.
The priority was improved safety and availability of power from nuclear
stations, more district heating, more efficient use of coal, and energy
efficiency in basic industry. This would help Ukraine reduce its dependence
on imports of gas from Russia and Turkmenistan.

FT  11 MAR 94 / The people of 'Bop' turn backs on a loser: Patti Waldmeir
reports from Mmabatho on the revolt against a homeland president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'When we got our independence we were told we were being liberated from
apartheid, only to find we were coming into a greater apartheid,' says Mrs
Pinkie Tsikwe, trying to explain the revolt of the normally docile
inhabitants of the nominally independent black 'homeland' of Bophuthatswana
against their President, Lucas Mangope.
'Being oppressed by a black man is worse than being oppressed by a white
man,' she says, sitting at the lace-covered dining room table of her
tasteful three-bedroomed brick home in the capital Mmabatho. It is only a
few hundred yards from the scene where, only hours later, a large part - if
not all - of the Bophuthatswana police force revolted against Mr Mangope and
joined anti-government demonstrators.
Mrs Tsikwe, whose husband is one of the striking civil servants who
paralysed the government of this apartheid homeland, insists that the
protests are not political. Whatever the public demands of civil servants or
university students - chief among these is that 'Bop', as it is widely
known, should be re-incorporated into South Africa - the real problem is
that the people of Bophuthatswana 'have just had enough of the President'.
Even the civil servants' strike, launched over the issue of whether
government employees' pension funds are being raided to fund normal
government expenditure and since recast as a protest at Mr Mangope's refusal
to re-incorporate, is not political, she argues.
'It isn't the pensions, it isn't the politics, it's money,' she insists,
adding that ministers awarded themselves a 50 per cent pay rise while normal
civil servants received only 5 per cent.
When mutinying police presented a petition to the government late yesterday
afternoon, they too mentioned money, conditions of service and housing,
though their chief demand was that the police 'should not be used by any
political party, especially the Christian Democrat party (of President
Mangope), as political tools'. They, too, want out of politics.
What she does not say, but what civil servants' leaders hint at, is that the
inhabitants of Bophuthatswana have smelled blood: they know that Pretoria no
longer supports Mr Mangope (it once rescued him from a military coup in
1988, but relations have since soured) and they know that the African
National Congress is set to win a big election victory in the rest of South
Africa.
Under those circumstances, Bop's inhabitants seem inclined to be pragmatic.
They will follow the most basic rule of politics in Africa: support a
winner. And Mr Mangope has all the hallmarks of a loser.
Judged in terms of economic development, this would be an unfair verdict on
his 17-year rule. For Bop, a nation of 2m Tswana people that gained nominal
independence from Pretoria in 1977, has more to lose economically from
re-incorporation than any other homeland. Economic growth in recent years
has exceeded that in most independent African countries, and certainly has
bettered that in South Africa proper. Education, housing and health care are
all arguably better in Bop.
Still, it looks like the end of the line for President Mangope. It was
unclear last night whether he had been toppled from power: but without the
support of the majority of police, it seems unlikely that he can hold out
against the demand for re-incorporation and for Bop's citizens to
participate in South Africa's elections.
Perhaps he never had a chance of resisting. Government sources made clear
that Pretoria would intervene militarily if 'South African nationals' - in
practice, that meant whites - were threatened (seconded officials from South
Africa hold senior jobs in the civil service and several white motorists
have already had narrow escapes from the angry mob).
Units of the South African Defence Force have carried out highly visible
manoeuvres on Bophuthatswana's border. And the Bophuthatswana Defence Force
has not been loyal; Bop soldiers regularly responded in kind when greeted
with the black power salute of the ANC, and took little part in putting down
unrest.
Even most of the police, the bastion of President Mangope's support,
appeared to give in with strikingly little resistance. After negotiating
with students on the University of Bophuthatswana campus, they emerged to
present a petition entitled 'Police for Peace' to the South African
ambassador, and later embraced demonstrators in emotional scenes of
surrender.
Their revolt is a propaganda coup to the ANC, which has skilfully
manipulated the protest to look like a massive vote of support for the ANC.
The apparent demise of Bop would inevitably raise hopes among some ANC
leaders that the much stronger, meaner and more determined regime of Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi can be similarly toppled. This seems unlikely: civil
servants in his KwaZulu homeland are both more committed to the ruling
party, Inkatha, and more fearful of brutal reprisal, than their Bop
counterparts.
The ANC would do well to remember that KwaZulu is not Bop; if they do not,
the consequence could be vastly worse violence.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Christopher visit stirs Beijing rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The arrival in Beijing today of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, has galvanised Beijing's dissident community into trying to use the
occasion to draw attention to its cause.
Yesterday's annual session of China's parliament, the National People's
Congress, has also provided a focus for dissenters, who have been sending
petitions to parliamentary leaders.
Premier Li Peng warned that China would resist human rights pressures,
saying it would 'never allow anyone to interfere in its internal affairs
under any pretext'. Documents circulating in Beijing include an appeal by a
group of academics for 'release of all those imprisoned because of their
ideology and speech'.
The academics, among them a couple whose son was killed in the 1989
pro-democracy protests, complained about the recent arrests of political
activists. 'People of insight feel shocked and worried,' the petitioners
told Mr Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC's standing committee, effectively the
parliamentary speaker.
Wang Dan, a prominent student leader from the 1989 pro-democracy movement,
is reported to have written an open letter to the NPC calling for human
rights issues to be placed on the agenda.
Mr Christopher's visit is focusing renewed attention on Wei Jingsheng,
China's most prominent dissident, detained last week and asked to leave
Beijing for the time being. Yuan Hongbing, a lawyer, was also arrested last
week and accused of being 'involved in unlawful acts in inciting turmoil'
and disrupting order.
Premier Li told the NPC yesterday that a resolution critical of China's
human rights behaviour had failed in Geneva. 'This shows that to attack
China by using human rights is unpopular,' he declared. For the second year,
the UN human rights commission approved a Chinese motion not to vote on the
resolution, which cited reports of execution and torture.

Nigeria's military regime has postponed indefinitely the national

It was to be the basis for a political reform programme promised by General
Sani Abacha when he seized power last November. A commission set up nearly
two months ago to organise the conference sent a preliminary report this
week to the head of state which contained only one specific recommendation:
to hasten the building of accommodation for the delegates in the capital
Abuja.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Thai loan rate cut may hit bank profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND's commercial banks started to raise deposit interest rates and
lower the cost of loans this week, raising the spectre of declining profits
for an unusually successful near-cartel of 15 commercial banks.
The Bangkok Bank, the Thai Farmers bank and the Krung Thai bank trimmed
their minimum retail rate (the rate charged to good small customers) by  1/4
of a percentage point to 11 3/4 per cent with most of the others expected to
follow suit shortly.
Unusually these banks also increased deposit rates: the Bangkok Bank raised
fixed deposit rates by  3/4 of a percentage point after admitting that
deposits declined by Bt1.2bn (Pounds 32m) in the first two months of this
year. Bangkok Bank said the rearrangement would squeeze its interest rate
spread from 3.5 per cent to 2 per cent, and would cost the company around
Bt400m this year.
Similarly Thai Farmers bank increased, for example, 3-month deposit rates by
 1/4 of a percentage point to 7 per cent as part of a total adjustment
costing Bt200m.
The move will appease the Bank of Thailand which last year watched with
horror as money became cheaper but interest rates charged to small customers
remained high.
However, Mr George Morgan, head of research for HG Asia in Bangkok, said
'banks had to do this because credit growth has been much quicker than
deposit growth. There is a lot of window dressing going on here - the
Bangkok Bank's three month deposits under Bt1m in Bangkok are not being
adjusted at all, for example.'
The central bank devised the MRR - comprising deposit rates plus
administration costs plus a profit margin - last October as the rate to be
charged good retail customers. Typically this was 7% plus 2% plus 2% to give
a target of 11% or a bit higher for the MRR over the longer term.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Kazakh president's allies 'win big majority'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ALMA ATA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Kazakh government yesterday released figures showing that allies of the
president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, won a large majority in Monday's
parliamentary elections, and denied western claims the polls were unfair.
Diplomats said Mr Nazarbayev controlled at least two-thirds of the new
177-member parliament and his opponents probably had fewer than 30 seats, or
less than 15 per cent. The results raised new concerns about ethnic tension,
as Kazakh candidates won 56 per cent of the seats, against 27 per cent for
ethnic Russians.
The Kazakhs comprise 43 per cent of the republic's population and the
Russians 36 per cent. 'It looks like Nazarbayev got a landslide,' one
diplomat said.
The elections have been condemned as unfair by observers from the Council on
Security and Co-operation in Europe. The delegation said the polls favoured
supporters of Mr Nazarbayev by, among other factors, an apparent systematic
effort to disqualify independent candidates. The elections were Kazakhstan's
first since it gained independence in the Soviet break-up two years ago.
The election results showed allies of Mr Nazarbayev belonging to political
parties will comprise a 95-seat bloc of parliament, or 53 per cent. His
supporters are also believed to make up a majority of the 60 successful
candidates who ran with no party affiliation.
Kazakhstan's foreign minister, Mr Tuligen Suleymenov, said the CSCE
delegation had been 'ill-informed'. Mr Karatay Turisov, the republic's
electoral commission chairman, released a point-by-point denial of their
conclusions.
'It would be naive to believe we have the same democratic principles as
western countries,' he said. 'It's impossible to change the psychology of
people in a two-month campaign after 70 years of communism.'

FT  11 MAR 94 / Li urges economic consolidation
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Premier Li Peng yesterday told China's annual parliamentary session that
political stability and further consolidating economic reforms were the main
priorities in the year ahead.
Mr Li's 'state of the republic' address placed heavy emphasis on combating
inflation, reducing unsustainable rates of economic growth and ensuring
public order in the face of a widening income gap between country and city.
'Economic development is the centre of all our work,' Mr Li told some 2,800
delegates to the National People's Congress which convenes once a year.
'Social stability, in turn, is an indispensable prerequisite for economic
development and smooth progress in reform.'
Mr Li's remarks reflect the leadership's increasing concern about an erosion
of the central government's authority and widespread disillusionment with
Communist rule.
'In some areas public order is poor, and not enough has been done to combat
social evils,' Mr Li added.
'The corrupt practices of a few government functionaries . . . have impaired
the close ties between the government and people.'
China's premier acknowledged 'mistakes' in the government's performance,
including a 'fairly sharp rise in prices'. He pledged additional efforts to
restrain price rises, but gave little indication of what steps might be
taken to curb cost-of-living increases.
He announced few new initiatives in his 90-minute address, but reminded
delegates that China in its present phase of explosive economic growth was
'presented with a rare historical opportunity'. Among his main points were:
China's GDP growth target for this year is 9 per cent. China forecast 8 per
cent growth in 1993, but the economy grew by 13 per cent last year and shows
little sign of slowing.
State enterprises in 'dire straits' would receive some assistance, but in
the end 'must rely on their own efforts to extricate themselves from their
predicament'. Attempts would be made to accelerate enterprise reform.
New capital spending would be restricted to construction projects already
under way with special emphasis on China's infrastructure requirements.
China should proceed gradually with banking reforms aimed at ensuring that
commercial banks are relieved of their policy-lending obligations. A
National Development Bank for infrastructure is to be established.
Mr Li won applause for remarks that amounted to a slap at Britain over Hong
Kong. 'No matter what happens, the Chinese government and people are
determined and able to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as
scheduled and to ensure long-term stability and prosperity there.
'British colonial rule in Hong Kong is coming to an end. No force can stop
that.'

FT  11 MAR 94 / Confusion reigns in UK-Malaysian row: British businessmen
are standing on the sidelines in a quandary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are plenty of confused people about in Kuala Lumpur these days.
Confused British business people wondering if they are ever going to win
another contract in Malaysia; confused diplomats trying to analyse every
Malaysian government move; confused locals wondering why Britain has been
turned suddenly from friend to enemy.
Two weeks ago, Malaysia proclaimed its disgust about what it called the
patronising attitude and innuendoes of the British media.
Dr Mahathir Mohamed, Malaysia's prime minister, was particularly upset about
a report in the London Sunday Times alleging he had been involved in seeking
payments from a British company.
The dark clouds of Dr Mahathir's anger burst on British business. The
Malaysians said that until the British media mended its ways, no government
contracts would be awarded to British companies: a potential loss, said the
Malaysians, of Pounds 4bn to those companies.
In the latest move, Najib Tun Razak, Malaysia's defence minister, has said
Malaysia wants the British government to make a clear statement dissociating
itself from the 'baseless allegations in the British press'.
Like two not very distinguished actors, both Malaysia and Britain have
stumbled round the issue over the past two weeks. At this stage, few are
predicting an early end to what has become a messy political and commercial
quarrel.
The initial Malaysian government statement reflected not only intense anger
with the British media but also a Malaysian desire to have its considerable
economic achievements recognised.
'We believe the foreign media must learn the fact that many developing
countries, including a country led by a brown Moslem, have the ability to
manage their own affairs successfully' the Malaysian statement said.
What Dr Mahathir and his cabinet did not say was precisely what was
required. 'I don't want an apology either from the British government or the
British media,' said Dr Mahathir.
'All I want is the truth. But then the British media is incapable of telling
the truth.'
London's reaction has only added to the confusion. On one hand, Prime
Minister John Major called the Malaysian action shortsighted and not
remotely justified.
On the other, one of Mr Major's ministers launched a stinging attack on what
he called the bombast of the British media, and said Dr Mahathir's
government was entitled to fair and accurate reporting.
Meanwhile, business people have stood on the sidelines, in a quandary about
what to do. The stridency of the initial statement from Kuala Lumpur
encouraged officials and local business, anxious to show their loyalty to Dr
Mahathir, to talk of severing all contacts with Britain.
The Malaysian government became alarmed; its international image might
suffer if the situation got out of control. Britain could claim that the
Malaysians' actions infringed Gatt regulations. There could be retaliatory
action by the European Union.
Kuala Lumpur issued a statement clarifying matters: Malaysian students,
contrary to announcements by senior officials, would still go to Britain.
Private-sector business contacts would carry on as before.
Dr Mahathir uses the term Malaysia Inc and the line between public and
private business is very blurred.
A big British power company, in partnership with a Malaysian concern, is
tendering for multi-million-pound contracts with Tenaga Nasional, the
semi-privatised electricity utility.
'We really don't know where we are,' the company's regional head declared.
'Is Tenaga considered public or private? We're confused and so are our
partners. We've received no official notification of what we should do. It's
all very frustrating.'
There have been signs of the fog clearing around the issue. A delegation of
British business leaders, including Lord Prior, chairman of the British GEC
group and a former cabinet minister, was in Kuala Lumpur earlier this week
seeing Dr Mahathir.
Various formulas for an end to the Malaysian ban are being discussed.
Reports in Kuala Lumpur suggest Dr Mahathir wants Mr Major's government to
make a formal statement distancing itself from the British media reports on
Malaysia.
But Mr Major might not wish to take such a stand and risk being accused of
giving in to what some in Britain see as Dr Mahathir's unreasonable demands.
Mr Major also does not have the relationship with Dr Mahathir built up by
Lady Thatcher, his predecessor.
Much media attention in Britain is now focused on a parliamentary inquiry
into allegations that aid to Malaysia was linked to the sale of Pounds
1.3bn-worth of British arms.
The present row might be patched up by some deft diplomatic footwork. But
whether the British media will in future report what Dr Mahathir considers
to be the truth is another question.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Russia, co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process, appeared
divided yesterday over initiatives aimed at restarting peace talks between
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, suspended since the Hebron
Mosque massacre two weeks ago.
Conflicting international moves have diminished chances for a speedy
resumption of talks and strengthened the determination of Mr Yassir Arafat,
PLO chairman, to expand the scope of peace negotiations to include the issue
of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
PLO officials said Mr Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State, told Mr
Arafat yesterday to resume talks with Israel without pre-conditions, or
Washington would veto a UN Security Council resolution condemning the Hebron
Massacre.
The PLO said it was supporting a move by Russia, which is pursuing a Middle
East policy independently from the US for the first time in three years, to
convene a new peace conference in Madrid. Israel has flatly rejected the
proposal. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, is expected in Tunis
today to discuss the proposal with Mr Arafat.
The European Parliament lent its backing to PLO demands yesterday for the
dismantling of some Jewish settlements in the occupied territories to
protect Palestinians from Jewish settlers and reduce Arab-Israeli tension
after the massacre.
The PLO has said it will not return to the negotiating table until the UN
passes a resolution condemning the Hebron bloodbath and Israel takes
measures to dismantle sensitive Jewish settlements such as the ones in
Hebron, disarm Jewish settlers and accept an international force in the
occupied territories.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, has made some gestures towards the
PLO but has ruled out meeting the full list of demands. The Israeli
government has been hoping the US would be able to nudge the PLO back to
talks in Washington, with the promise of a speedy signing of an agreement on
implementing Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of
Jericho.
Yesterday's ultimatum by Mr Christopher to Mr Arafat came after the US asked
the UN Security Council to postpone a vote late on Wednesday on a resolution
condemning the Hebron massacre.

its Dollars 900m (Pounds 616.4m) gas debt to Russia. During talks in Moscow,
Ukraine agreed to pay half the debt in cash and the remainder in equipment,
thus giving Russia part-ownership of Ukraine's gas industry. But Gazprom the
chairman, Mr Rem Vyakhirev, kept the pressure on Ukraine to make good on
this new deal, saying: 'If we do not restore order together by April 10,
deliveries of gas to Ukraine will be cut off completely.' Last week, Russia
reduced gas deliveries to Ukraine by 75 per cent.

Compensation awards for similar types of personal injury typically vary by
600 per cent across Europe, according to a report by Davies Arnold Cooper, a
leading firm of City solicitors. A review of award levels in 13 EU countries
(including Scotland) and seven EFTA countries showed anomalies which were
'hugely unfair to European citizens and businesses', said Mr David McIntosh,
a senior partner at the firm. Irish courts generally made the biggest
awards, while courts in Greece, Portugal, Spain, Norway and Denmark were
less generous. Non-economic awards - for bereavement or pain and suffering -
varied from nothing to Pounds 250,000, with the higher rates awarded in
predominantly Catholic countries, the report said. Mr McIntosh urged
Brussels to launch a formal inquiry into the problem and urged the
introduction of Europe-wide guidelines on compensation levels.

Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist RPR's candidate for the French presidential
elections in 1995, was almost level with the prime minister, Mr Edouard
Balladur, in a poll on who is best placed to beat the likely Socialist
candidate, Mr Michel Rocard. The poll, published yesterday in the weekly
Valeurs Actuelles, said Mr Balladur could beat Mr Rocard by 56 per cent to
44 per cent, while Mr Chirac could win by 55 per cent to 45 per cent. Mr
Balladur, a longtime Chirac aide and RPR member, has not yet said whether he
will run. But several polls published on Wednesday suggested that Mr
Balladur had fallen from favour. A Gallup poll for L'Express, France's
leading news magazine, gave his approval rating as 47 per cent, compared
with around 60 per cent for most of 1993.

The US Export-Import Bank has given its final approval to Dollars 317m
(Pounds 217m) of loan guarantees for upgrading the controversial
Soviet-designed nuclear reactor at Temelin, in the Czech Republic. Temelin
is close to the Czech border with Austria, and the Austrian government has
fiercely contested the plans to bring the still uncompleted reactor into
service. Eximbank said its guarantees would help finance Dollars 334m of
improvements to be carried out by Westinghouse Electric to the
instrumentation, control and fuel systems of the Temelin reactor. Studies by
the US and by the International Atomic Energy Agency have indicated that the
Soviet VVER-1000 reactor can be operated as safely as western-designed light
water reactors, so long as control improvements are made. The control system
Westinghouse will install at Temelin is, according to US nuclear experts,
more advanced than that operating at the UK's Sizewell B reactor.

<TEXT>
The explosion in German money supply in January is not a fundamental
obstacle to further cuts in German interest rates, senior Bundesbank
officials said yesterday - remarks apparently designed to calm the nerves of
unsteady financial markets. The Bundesbank would stick to its anti-inflation
course, said Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the central bank president, but this was not
inconsistent with further falls in money market and capital market interest
rates. Two other members of the Bundesbank council stressed that the 20.6
per cent increase in M3 broad money supply in January was an aberration and
that the central bank would continue with its exceedingly cautious programme
of interest rate cuts. The January M3 data, released last week, far exceeded
economists' most pessimistic predictions and deeply unsettled financial
markets despite the Bundesbank's explanation of the special factors that lay
behind the strong rise.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Danish jobless above forecast: Economic watch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate in Denmark was 12.5 per cent of
the workforce in January, unchanged from December and up from 11.9 per cent
in January 1993. The seasonally-adjusted figure of people out of work was
349,900 in January, compared with 348,700 in December 1993. However,
January's unemployment rate was well-above average market expectations of a
12.1 per cent rate. A state-subsidised job-rotation scheme was introduced in
January, but its effect is not yet clear.
Germany's Hermes export-credit insurance programme is likely to post a
deficit of DM7.5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in 1994, because of problems collecting
debts from Russia and Iran, according to the chairman of the Bundestag's
budget committee. In 1993, the Hermes programme deficit was DM5.1bn.
Norway's consumer price index rose 0.4 per cent in February, compared with
January, taking the year-on-year inflation rate to 1.4 per cent. The January
year-on-year inflation rate of 1.3 per cent was the lowest recorded since
1963.
West German consumer price inflation was an annualised 3.4 per cent in
February, according to revised figures, compared with an annualised rate of
3.5 per cent in January. West German producer prices were unchanged in
January compared with a year earlier.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Lenin's namesake carries capitalist flag: Vladivostok is
heading for the free economy thanks to one Vladimir Ulianov
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perched on Russia's craggy eastern coast, Vladivostok is a potentially
vibrant Pacific Rim city struggling to emerge from its dross Soviet shell.
Right-hand drive Japanese cars - a third of the price of inferior Russian
vehicles - abound. The best hotel in town, the Vlad Motor Inn, was shipped
over, fully built from western Canada and offers the same amenities as any
comfortable Canadian inn, from fluffy towels to Molson's beer.
But, as the ugly Soviet apartment blocks which mar Vladivostok's picturesque
natural setting suggest, the city's and Russia's communist past still
threatens to block its market development.
The home port of the rusting Pacific fleet and the site of defence
industries which employ much of the city's workforce, Vladivostok has a
powerful anti-reform constituency, which has found an ally in the region's
new governor.
Moreover, the xenophobia which was expressed here and elsewhere in Russia,
with strong support for the extreme right in the December elections, has an
added fillip in Vladivostok because of widespread local fears of
economically thriving China, just a three-hour drive away. Vladivostok's
biggest success story is its stock exchange, the most active in Russia.
Unlike most exchanges in the country, which trade in commodities or
privatisation vouchers, the Vladivostok exchange trades only in the shares
of privatised companies. It can do so because 230 of the 500 large-scale
enterprises in the Vladivostok area have already been transformed into joint
stock companies - a figure which makes the region Russia's leader in
large-scale privatisation.
Mr Viktor Sakharov, a bearded former marine biologist who is president of
the stock exchange, says the booming activity on the exchange, where Rbs100m
worth of shares are traded on average each week, is teaching the directors
of local large enterprises to look to the private sector rather than the
government for capital.
'Factory directors are beginning to understand that no-one will give them
money any more, that the days of cheap credits are over,' says Mr Sakharov,
who gives weekly economics lectures to the 'Red Barons' in the hope of
'pounding some market economics into their heads'. The managers are
learning. Mr Sakharov believes that that the only way to get capital
investment is through share offers. Foreigners are also starting to get in
on the action. Mr Sakharov estimates that British, Australian, South Korean
and Japanese investors have already purchased Dollars 3m (Pounds 2m) worth
of shares and says Dollars 24m is in the pipeline from the United States and
the UK.
The biggest obstacle to more foreign investment is physical. To buy shares
traded on the Vladivostok stock exchange investors must first make the
gruelling journey to this Pacific outpost.
A few hardy western businessmen live in Vladivostok and act as local agents
for UK, US and Asian companies.
Investing could become easier if Seji, the most active investment company
operating on the exchange, succeeds in its plan to open an office at the
Hong Kong stock exchange this spring.
Seji's trading operations are run by the ironically named Mr Vladimir
Ulianov. But although the thin, nervy businessman bears the name Russia's
first Bolshevik leader was known by until he assumed the more familiar nom
de guerre of Lenin, the present-day Mr Ulianov is the face of Russia's
fledgling, and embattled, capitalist revolution.
In 1991, Mr Ulianov and a small group of fellow officers serving in the
Pacific fleet decided that they had better prospects working in Russia's
nascent market economy than in its rusting navy.
Since then, it's been clear sailing. Seji now has working capital
approaching Rbs2bn and in November alone turned a profit of Rbs368m
speculating in the shares of just one company, Sesco, the Far Eastern
Shipping Company.
A typical project is Seji's plan to finance the production of light aircraft
at a local defence plant in which it holds a 10 per cent interest. Seji is
willing to raise the Rbs3bn which the cash-strapped factory requires to
produce helicopters and light aircraft, but only on the condition that it
has control over how the money is spent and where the profits from eventual
sales go.
Without tough controls, Mr Ulianov explains, any investment in a Russian
factory disappears in subsidies to loss-making divisions of the enterprise.
'Crudely put, our strategy is not to give any cash to the factory
directors,' Mr Ulianov says. 'The factory is only allowed to be the
assembler.'
This is the maxim of every successful Russian businessman, but it is a point
which has been lost on western aid donors and on the representatives of the
old Soviet elite at the top of the Russian government, including the prime
minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, whose hand has been strengthened by the
result of the December elections.
If Mr Chernomyrdin has his way and the flow of soft credits to Russia's 'Red
Barons' is renewed, they will again be in a position to resist the tough
financial constraints imposed by private businessmen such as Mr Ulianov and
other investors in Vladivostok's exchange. Citing this sort of anti-reform
action in the aftermath of the elections, a worried Mr Sakharov said: 'We
knew our people were stupid, that they were an ignorant, lumpen proletariat,
but we had no idea that they were quite so stupid.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French Association of Banks yesterday called on the government to cede
control of interest rates on deposits that fund small company and home loans
to the newly-independent Bank of France. The banking association said it was
frustrated at the government's failure to cut these rates, and so reduce the
cost of money for onward lending. Loans to small companies and house-buyers
amounted to 27 per cent of all credits in the economy, it said, and were
thus 'a fundamental element in the conduct of monetary policy', which was
entrusted to the Bank of France in January. David Buchan, Paris.

Spain's parliament was suspended for two hours yesterday amid angry
accusations from opposition deputies that ruling socialists had voted more
than once during a debate on labour reforms. The house was voting on
opposition amendments to the government's labour reforms, which sparked a
24-hour general strike earlier this year. The opposition Popular party lost
the amendments by just two votes, but said socialists had voted for absent
colleagues by secretly pushing the buttons which electronically register the
votes. Deputies stamped and hissed when it was revealed that six more votes
were counted in one ballot than in the next. The matter was referred to the
House Committee who will investigate the charges of vote-rigging. Reuter,

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Portuguese government has dismissed the head of the tax department and
threatened to auction assets of a top football club as part of a crackdown
aimed at stemming a big shortfall in tax revenue.
The move by Mr Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, was praised as courageous
by tax consultants. But officials of FC Porto, the football club, said it
was an affront to their dignity - particularly the listing of the lavatory
of the referees' changing room as one of the assets to seize.
Mr Francisco Rodrigues Porto was dismissed as director general of taxes
after revenue in 1993 fell Es373bn (Pounds 1.43bn) below the government
forecast. The shortfall was the main cause of a doubling of the forecast
budget deficit last year to 8.2 per cent of gross domestic product.
However, Mr Vasco Valdes, the member of government directly responsible for
taxes last year, was promoted in a cabinet reshuffle in December.
Tax specialists said an increase in VAT on basic foods and restaurants had
led many small shopkeepers and cafe owners to resort to the black market.
The abolition of border collections of VAT on imports had further increased
tax evasion.
The computer system for processing tax collection was also woefully
inefficient, they said, because of government cost-cutting measures that had
frozen spending on hardware, software and personnel.
No other signal that Mr Catroga is determined to fight tax evasion could
have been stronger than his decision to tackle a leading football club.
'Football teams spend billions on foreign players they can't afford and
simply ignore the taxman,' said a tax consultant. 'Until now politicians,
fearful for their popularity, had just shrugged their shoulders.
FC Porto officials were so taken aback by the threat to seize assets to
secure part of an estimated Es1bn in tax and social security arrears that
they called an emergency meeting yesterday.
Analysts now wonder whether Mr Catroga's zeal to combat tax evasion will
lead him to tackle a case with more serious implications. The attorney
general is investigating 67 companies alleged to have to sold false invoices
to other companies to enable them to claim fictitious VAT and corporate tax
repayments. Police are reported to be investigating dozens of other
companies, many of whom are alleged to be contributors to political party
funds.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Britain will send 900 extra troops to Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain sent the first contingent of an extra 900 soldiers to Bosnia
yesterday as part of an international deal that could increase the United
Nations peacekeeping force by 7,185.
The deal, arranged by Britain in a series of diplomatic meetings in New
York, falls short of the 10,000 extra troops requested by General Sir
Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, to police ceasefires in Sarajevo
and central Bosnia. UN troops in Bosnia currently total 13,000.
However, British officials said there were 'encouraging signs' that
diplomatic efforts led by Sir David Hannay, the British ambassador to the
UN, would prompt further offers.
In particular, the US is under strong pressure to send ground troops to
Macedonia, allowing a Nordic battalion serving there to be transferred to
Bosnia.
A first group of 90 British soldiers arrived at Split airport in Croatia
yesterday on their way to Bosnia. Aides to Mr John Major, prime minister,
said the UN had received firm offers of 3,435 extra soldiers from eight
countries, including the UK.
Several of the deployments are temporary. France will delay the withdrawal
of a battalion already serving in Bosnia, and Britain said it would review
the deployment of the additional troops after four months.
A further 2,430 soldiers are to be redeployed from other parts of former
Yugoslavia, increasing the number of extra peacekeeping troops in Bosnia by
5,865. In addition, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, is
considering an offer of 1,000 troops from Turkey, a former colonial powers
in the region.
British officials said Bosnian Moslems and Croats had approved the
deployment of Turkish troops, who could play 'a valuable role' if they were
stationed 'well away from the Serbs'. Mr Boutros Ghali was believed to be
waiting for confirmation from the Swedish and Argentine governments of a
further 320 additional troops.
The deal will increase the number of British troops in Bosnia to 3,350, the
second largest national contribution after France. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the
defence secretary, told the Commons that the deployment of further British
troops 'would help to make the difference between success and failure for
the ceasefires.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said Britain was unwilling 'to get
involved year after year, but at the moment it is quite clear that extra is
needed to implement the ceasefire'.
However, the decision was approved against a background of deep divisions
among Conservative MPs about what amounts to a reversal of British policy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government yesterday gave the go-ahead to a reorganisation of
the state sector's defence industry by announcing a L4,068bn (Pounds 1.65bn)
increase in capital for seven key companies.
Mr Piero Barucci, treasury minister, unveiled a plan under which the
loss-making groups, including the helicopter manufacturer Agusta, will pass
without payment from the Efim state holding group, now in liquidation, to
Finmeccanica. The Iri state group controls 85 per cent of Finmeccanica, its
main industrial and high-technology arm, while the rest is floated on the
stock market.
The transfer has been made possible by a formula which guarantees survival
of the seven without burdening Finmeccanica with their L7,000bn debts. In
addition to the capital increase and other state credits, Efim's creditor
banks will take shares in Finmeccanica and Iri's stake in the group will
fall to nearer 60 per cent.
The measures ensure that the state keeps control of strategic defence
manufacturers and rationalises them under the umbrella of Finmeccanica,
which has extensive defence interests centred on Alenia, its aerospace
subsidiary.
An important element of the re-organisation is a government defence plan
that foresees arms spending of L55,000bn over 10 years, for which
Finmeccanica lobbied hard. About half Italy's defence procurement budget
goes to the seven ex-Efim companies which comprise Oto Melara, Breda
Meccanica, Officina Galileo and SMA, together with three Agusta companies.
The expanded Finmeccanica, which is in profit, will control about two-thirds
of the country's defence interests and its turnover is intended to rise from
about L10,790bn in 1993 to L13,500bn in 1995.
The heavily-indebted Efim was placed in liquidation in 1992 and for more
than a year its defence offshoots have been leased to Finmeccanica, giving
it management control but not financial responsibility.

fighting to save their jobs

<TEXT>
At the gates of the Deutsche Aerospace plant at Lemwerder, in the bleak
marshes of the Weser estuary in the north German state of Lower Saxony,
several hundred bitter and baffled workers gathered this week to demonstrate
their determination to save their jobs.
Since last October they have mounted a permanent vigil at the gates to
protest against the impending closure of the factory, where the Transall
military transport aircraft is built, and Airbus aircraft serviced.
The entire 1,200-strong skilled labour force is set to be sacked as part of
a restructuring programme in the German aerospace industry, battered by cuts
in military spending and the slump in demand for civilian aircraft such as
the Airbus.
Their guest of honour on the makeshift speaker's platform was Mr Rudolf
Scharping, leader of the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), and the
man who hopes to win the next general election on October 16 to become
federal chancellor in Bonn.
The trouble was that he had little firm hope to offer the workers at
Lemwerder, for his own party stands for even more drastic cuts in the
country's defence budget than the present liberal-conservative coalition
headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
'I have come here because I believe that politicians have the goddam duty to
go to the very places where decisions are being taken about jobs,' he said.
'It is all very well to fly off to the Far East, like Chancellor Kohl, and
lecture people about blooming landscapes. They should come and visit the
places in Germany where the jobs are under threat.'
It was a good line for the cameras, but it was not really what the
threatened workers had come to hear. They wanted promises that a future SPD
government in Bonn would provide the new orders to keep them in business.
Mr Scharping could only promise to 'create a stable framework' for business
to do its best. As for military spending, he admitted he wants further job
cuts in the Bundeswehr, down from the present 370,000 to just 300,000.
The opposition leader is treading an acutely cautious path in his long
campaign to overthrow the Kohl coalition, desperately anxious not to give
any hostages to fortune which may destroy his party's best chance of power
since it fell from grace in 1982.
'Jobs, jobs and jobs again,' is the campaign theme of the SPD at the start
of Germany's 1994 election marathon, which culminates in the general
election on October 16.
It is by far the greatest concern of the electorate, beyond law and order,
immigration, social welfare, housing or education. Mr Scharping is concerned
to show that his party not only cares, but that it has ideas about how to
create new jobs. Lemwerder was a tough place to start.
Mr Scharping was left in little doubt about what the failure of any rescue
plan for Lemwerder might mean.
'The anger of the people is aimed against the managers, for now,' said Mr
Erwin Nowak, chairman of the works council. 'But if Lemwerder is not saved,
then all the big parties will certainly feel it at the general election.'
This week the focus of Germany's entire political establishment is on the
first poll of no less than 19, among the 5.9m electors in the state of Lower
Saxony. It should give some clear indications about the spate of elections
to come.
The outcome of Sunday's vote is in little doubt: Mr Scharping's colleague
and erstwhile rival for the SPD leadership, Mr Gerhard Schroder, looks set
to be swept back to power as premier in the state parliament in Hanover.
His red-green coalition, between the SPD and the Green Party, has a big lead
in the opinion polls over Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democratic Union
(CDU).
Recent opinion polls give the SPD some 45 per cent support in the state,
against 35 for the CDU. In 1990, the SPD won power from the CDU with 44.2
per cent to 42.0, while the Greens, with 5.5 per cent, made up the
difference. The Free Democratic Party (FDP), Mr Kohl's partners in Bonn,
managed 6 per cent then, but this time they are in danger of falling below
the 5 per cent minimum needed to win any seats.
The Greens could do a little better this time - one poll gives them 8 per
cent support. If the FDP fails to make the grade, it means Mr Schroder has a
chance of an absolute majority.
The unknown in this election is how the extreme right-wing Republicans will
perform, as well as an assortment of other citizens' movements. In the
opinion polls, only 3 per cent say they will vote for the Republicans, but
there is still a big proportion - around one in three  - undecided.
Mr Schroder's success has been that, in spite of fears in the business
community when he formed his red-green government four years ago, he has
proved to be far more pragmatic than his left-wing credentials suggested. As
unemployment in the state has risen towards 11 per cent - the second highest
in west Germany - he has become ever more concerned to be friendly towards
industry, and distance himself from the stern environmentalism of his
coalition partners.
Indeed, he stunned the last SPD party conference in Wiesbaden by citing
Lemwerder as a case for giving defence industries a better deal. He was
denounced by his party colleagues, but the message to the Lower Saxony
electors was clear: for Gerhard Schroder, jobs come even before party
politics.
His success has left the CDU bewildered and trailing. 'He is a pure
pragmatist without principles, and erratic, too,' says Mr Christian Wulff,
his 34-year-old CDU challenger. 'We say red-green is unfriendly to business.
Look at Lemwerder: the red-green coalition has banned military research in
the state, so it has all gone to Bavaria. Now they wonder why companies like
Dasa close down in Lower Saxony entirely.'
Mr Wulff, who has been a staunch Christian Democrat since he was a
schoolboy, has chosen a campaign poster with a huge black-and-white close-up
of former Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in the background, and a modest little
colour photograph of himself in front.
His critics say he is deliberately trying to distance himself from Mr Kohl
by identifying with the CDU's great founding father.
Yet Mr Kohl is about the only real weapon he has. His style is a total
contrast to that of Mr Scharping. At a rally in the sports hall of Nienburg,
north of Hanover, last week, the chancellor was relaxed, fatherly,
deliberately cultivating his statesman's image.
He made the same speech he has been making for months, calmly ignoring his
unpopularity in the polls. I am the man who delivered unification, the safe
old face you can trust, he seems to say. I know all the actors on the world
stage, and they trust me. Germany is going through a turbulent time, and the
outside world is in turmoil. But I am unflappable and unmovable. Stick with
me.
It is a message which is just starting to get through to an electorate which
none the less is heartily fed up with the current administration in Bonn,
and says it wants a change. But it is a message which is certainly too late
to save Mr Wulff from defeat in Lower Saxony.
As far as Mr Schroder is concerned, he is already almost home and dry. But
Mr Scharping and Mr Kohl have their eyes fixed firmly on a much more distant
goal.

German elections: a marathon which could change the political landscape
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
March 13
Lower Saxony parliament
Sunday's poll for the state's parliament is the first vote in Germany's
election marathon which involves six other state parliaments, elections
for local authorities in nine states, the electoral assembly
(convention) to choose the next federal president in May, the poll for
the European Parliament in June, and finally the general election on
October 16. Lower Saxony will send the first signals for a campaign
which could transform the political face of the country.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
March 20
Schleswig-Holstein local councils
These are the first in a series of local council elections which could
well see a big backlash against the traditional political parties in
favour of local citizens' movements. The local authorities are
responsible for most local services and have been forced by financial
stringency to cut back in many areas, and raise their charges. The main
round of elections coincide with the European poll on June 12, with
North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state, coming to the polls on
October 16.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
May 23
Presidential convention
The federal convention, or electoral college, in Berlin will elect a
federal president to succeed President Richard von Weizsacker. The real
contest is between Mr Roman Herzog, the president of the federal
constitutional court, for the Christian Democratic Union, and Mr
Johannes Rau, prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, for the Social
Democratic party. How the minority Free Democratic party votes will
almost certainly decide the issue.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
June 12
European parliament
These elections throughout Germany will provide the first national
indicator of popular political trends. The fear of the main parties is
that voters may be tempted to vote for extremist protest parties, like
the extreme right-wing, nationalist Republicans, because they do not
consider the poll as important as a national election. Additionally,
local council polls are being held in seven states. (See March 20 above)
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
June 26, Sept 11, 25, Oct 16
State parliaments
There are six elections, five in east Germany. Again, the greatest fear
is over a backlash against the traditional political parties of
centre-left and centre-right, because of unhappiness over the
consequences of unification and the resulting high unemployment. The
exception is in the west, in Bavaria, where the conservative Christian
Social Union is struggling to maintain its absolute majority in the
parliament.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Oct 16
National elections
The finishing line for the exhausted campaigners and the moment of
truth for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative-liberal coalition. Can
he reverse what looks certain to be a string of negative results in the
state and local elections, and still hang onto power in Bonn? Or will
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the youthful SPD leader, persuade the cautious
voters that his party is 'capable of government' at national as well as
provincial level?

FT  11 MAR 94 / Irish telecoms tariffs cut by competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fierce competition has broken out in the international sector of the Irish
telecommunications market, worth IPounds 200m (Pounds 192m) a year, since
the state-run telecommunications company Telecom Eireann opened up the
market last autumn.
The latest entrant is International Telecommunications Ltd (ITL), a private
Irish company, which began operations yesterday. It is offering business
customers reductions of 30 per cent on Telecom Eireann's tariffs for most
international calls. The company said it would not charge sign-up fees or
service charges, nor impose minimum traffic levels. Nor would customers be
obliged to use ITL's service exclusively.
Telecom Eireann says it will 'compete aggressively' for market share. Last
month it introduced a 30 per cent volume discount for customers with
international traffic of more than IPounds 2,000 a month. It also introduced
a new tariff structure last September, cutting the cost of international
calls by up to 40 per cent.
Mr Fergus McGovern, chief executive of Telecom Eireann, said yesterday the
new tariffs had resulted in 28 per cent a year growth in the company's
international traffic.
Around 30 per cent of the company's total call revenues of IPounds 600m come
from international traffic.
Under European Union competition directives, Telecom must relinquish its
monopoly of the Irish market by 2003, and since last autumn has had to allow
competitors access to its international business.
Around half of international calls made are to the UK. British Telecom,
which launched a service out of Ireland for business customers last
November, says Ireland is the second largest international direct dialling
route out of the UK.
Allied Irish Bank, one of the biggest customers of Telecom Eireann, is
shortly to put out a tender for its international call traffic.
Earlier this month, it was confirmed that Telecom Eireann is seeking 'a
strategic alliance' and that a proposal has been received from Cable and
Wireless, thought to be worth up to IPounds 500m, to set up a joint venture
to handle Telecom Eireann's international calls business.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Germans settle row over care for aged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
One of the longest-running political battles in Bonn, over the creation of a
new social security scheme to finance nursing care for the aged and
handicapped, was yesterday settled in a top-level cross-party compromise.
Almost 20 years after plans for the scheme were first proposed, the final
details were thrashed out in talks between leaders of the ruling coalition
and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD).
It means German workers and employers will have to pay an extra 1 per cent
in social security contributions from January 1, rising to 1.7 per cent in
later years, to finance the introduction of statutory nursing care
insurance.
The scheme will pay for the cost of care in old peoples' homes, and of
residential care in their own homes for the elderly and handicapped. The
costs have hitherto been paid by local authorities, but soaring numbers of
old people threatened to overwhelm their financial resources.
The annual cost of residential care is estimated initially at DM14.4bn,
(Pounds 5.60bn) with additional administrative costs of around DM1bn. Up to
2.1m old and handicapped people are estimated to be eligible for assistance.
Strong industry opposition to the deal was overwhelmed by the determination
of the political parties to be seen to be capable of making a decision in an
election year, when electors are threatening a backlash against the whole
political establishment.
The deal was done yesterday after several hours of negotiations between Mr
Rudolf Scharping, leader of the SPD, and Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary
leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the main party in the ruling
coalition.
Mr Scharping reached the deal against the objections of many within his own
party, who claim that the compromise amounts to an infringement of wage
bargaining autonomy in German industry.
The key to the compromise was an agreement to offset the increased costs to
industry by the cancellation of one day's holiday per year, providing one
extra day's work. That is supposed to pay for the first phase of the scheme,
to finance nursing care at home.
There is no agreement on compensatory measures to offset the second phase,
the cost of care in residential homes. That will be subject to a report by
the government's independent economic advisers, the so-called 'five wise
men."

FT  11 MAR 94 / Russian premier backs sale of state farms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NIZHNY NOVGOROD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, yesterday spoke out
strongly in favour of private ownership of farms, backing a programme to
auction state farms across the country.
His comments dramatically re-establish the prospects for reform in Russia,
which appeared to have stagnated since last December's parliamentary
elections strengthened anti-reform groups.
The prime minister spoke immediately after attending the auction of the land
and property of a state farm in the Nizhny Novgorod region. The region has
become a much-promoted symbol of practical market reform in Russia.
Speaking after the auction to governors and senior officials from other
regions and republics within Russia, who had come to observe the land sale,
Mr Chernomyrdin said with some passion there was 'no more criticising, no
more talking. We now have a model, you must just go and do it'.
He said the government would adopt the Nizhny approach as a federal
programme - though to accommodate local objections he said the programme
would be adopted 'as a basis', leaving room for local changes.
Mr Boris Nemtsov, the young, pro-reform governor of Nizhny, who was
surprised and delighted by Mr Chernomyrdin's emphatic support, said before
the prime minister announced his decision that 'if Chernomyrdin wishes to
write himself a place in history, this is his chance'.
Laws and decrees already exist to provide a legislative base for land
privatisation - but the crucial government report guidelines have so far
been lacking.
More surprisingly, the deputy prime minister in charge of agriculture, Mr
Alexander Zaveryukha - the most conservative of the senior cabinet members -
also called for the land sale programme to be adopted at a federal level,
and even supported the creation of a centre for training in land
privatisation, to be established in Nizhny Novgorod.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister for privatisation, and one of
the few radicals left in the government, found himself on the same side as
his more conservative colleague - but warned the conference of governors
that unless privatisation is pushed through energetically by the regional
leadership, 'all our support, all our subsidies will be of no use because
the peasants will not feel themselves masters on their own land'.
The Nizhny programme, developed over the past year with the assistance of
teams from the International Finance Corporation, gives each member of state
and collective farms the entitlement to a plot of land and part of the farm
property - but encourages them to band together in groups to create
viable-sized holdings.
The auction yesterday of the Sixty Years of October Collective Farm was the
third in the region, in a process which has been slow, painstaking and is
still regarded with doubt by many in the countryside accustomed to the
slothful but secure rhythm of state farm life.
Mr Anthony Doran, the IFC's manager for Russia, said the programme had been
designed to apply to the federal as well as the regional level - as long as
key elements like transparency, simplicity and speed of sale were observed.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Hungary protest fuels media row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Protests intensified yesterday in Hungary against the dismissal of
independent broadcasters ahead of May elections which polls say the
governing conservatives are going to lose.
Thousands of people gathered outside the state radio to object to the
sacking by the broadcasting authorities of leading journalists, particularly
those producing '168 Hours', a popular and influential political magazine
programme.
The government insisted yesterday it was not directing the dismissals, but
the clampdown on the media coincides embarrassingly with Hungary's impending
application for membership of the European Union. Critics say the dismissals
undermine Budapest's claim that Hungary's democratic maturity entitles it to
accession before less advanced east European neighbours.
Opposition politicians accused the governing conservatives, which trail a
resurgent Socialist party in the polls, of a partisan purge to win control
of the airwaves for the campaign for elections on May 8.
The government, while denying any direct involvement in the dismissals,
responded that 80-85 per cent of the press followed an opposition, usually
left-wing line.
The office of Mr Peter Boross, the prime minister, said: 'There are only a
few papers and programmes in Hungary in which government officials can speak
in the awareness that they will not be subjected to deliberate and biased
distortion.'
Polarisation of opinion, so sharp that it is described as the 'media war,'
threatens to embitter electoral debate and crowd out discussion on how to
pull Hungary out of its four-year economic recession.
While the largest newspapers are generally hostile to the governing
Hungarian Democratic Forum and its coalition allies, the broadcasting
authorities have now neutralised the last remaining critical programmes in
national broadcasting. Last year an overhaul of state media prompted
resignations of the independent presidents of national television and radio.
The US State Department's latest report on human rights in Hungary held that
the electronic media were 'subject to increasing political pressure'.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Second attack hits Heathrow: Mortars fired at airport after
Sinn Fein warns of further 'spectaculars'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA early this morning appeared to have launched a second attack in less
than 36 hours on Heathrow airport after the government conceded that hopes
of an early breakthrough in the search for peace in Northern Ireland had
been killed.
Security services were alerted shortly after midnight when 'incendiaries'
were fired near terminal four. However, an airport official said it appeared
that none had detonated and there had been little damage. There were no
reports of casualties.
Scotland Yard officers later confirmed that three mortar shells were found
in the south-east area of the airport close to terminal four. There were
also reports of two suspicious packages.
The airport's southern runway and a perimeter road were closed.
The attack followed non-specific warnings to the media. Initial reports
indicated that three thuds were heard, but police were unsure of the
location of the launch site.
The London Ambulance Service said it was alerted at 12.11am to 'an act of
aggression' at Heathrow. Ambulances and fire engines were standing by.
The second assault underlined fears in London and Dublin that the republican
movement has rejected the peace initiative.
Both governments were united in their condemnation of Wednesday's attack -
which yesterday led to calls for an inquiry into security operations at
Heathrow - and accepted the likelihood that it signalled rejection by the
republican movement of the peace initiative. Nevertheless Mr John Major, the
prime minister, insisted the search for peace would continue.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, described as 'despicable'
remarks made by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, in a radio interview in
which he appeared to warn of more possible events like Wednesday's attack on
Heathrow.
Mr Adams said: 'This attack comes in the middle of a stalemate. I would ask
now for John Major to end the stalemate. There are causes of conflict; the
conflict is ongoing. Every so often there will be something spectacular to
remind the outside world.'
Mr Adams' remarks came as an off-duty RUC officer was shot dead last night
in Belfast.
Ministers earlier mounted a joint effort to demonstrate they will not be
knocked off course in attempts to reach a political settlement in the
province.
Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, claimed that the
IRA's latest action and the failure of Sinn Fein to react positively to the
Downing Street declaration would not deter London and Dublin from pressing
on.
At Westminster, Mr Major told MPs the 'unjustifiable' IRA attack would make
'no difference whatsoever' to the search for peace. He said the declaration
set out 'a series of principles upon which we hope and intend to try and
build a permanent peace in Northern Ireland'.
In the Dail, Mr Reynolds attacked the IRA action as 'criminal and
politically naive'.
But both London and Dublin privately accept that the political momentum
which followed December's declaration has largely been lost. They are
resigned to an extended and highly problematical process aimed at
establishing a framework for progress involving the province's
constitutional parties.
Speaking after yesterday's Anglo-Irish conference in London, Sir Patrick
said the first Heathrow attack had shown that the IRA could not make its
case democratically and had again resorted to force.
Sir Patrick stressed that both governments were committed to continuing the
so-called three-stranded political talks process and added: 'There is no
limit to our patience because there is no limit to the advantages that
success in that process will bring'.
He emphasised, however, that the prize of prosperity and peace might lie 'at
the end of a very long road but a road on which neither government is going
to weary of travelling'.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in one of the most downbeat
assessments from Dublin on the chances of an end to IRA action, said that
'the credit is running very low, if not totally expired' on the part of
those who had yet to make up their mind on the Downing Street declaration.
Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party,
dismissed the bilateral talks in the province as 'a stopgap' that did not go
to the heart of the problem.
Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP, came near to calling for the
three-stranded approach to be abandoned.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Northrop launches Pounds 1.39bn hostile offer for Grumman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A takeover battle erupted last night over US defence group Grumman, as
military aircraft manufacturer Northrop launched a Dollars 2.04bn (Pounds
1.39bn) hostile offer in response to an agreed Dollars 1.9bn bid unveiled by
Martin Marietta on Monday.
Northrop coupled its bid with an attack on Grumman's board for entering into
a takeover deal with Martin Marietta, even though Northrop and Grumman had
spent months in late 1993 and early 1994 discussing a friendly merger.
It described as 'improper and illegal' a so-called lock-up agreement under
which Grumman will pay Martin Marietta Dollars 50m if its offer for the
company is outbid, and said this did not serve shareholders' interests.
Northrop is bidding Dollars 60 a share in cash for Grumman, compared to
Dollars 55 a share in cash on offer from Martin Marietta. Grumman's
shares,which closed at Dollars 54 7/8 , down Dollars  1/8 in normal trading
yesterday, soared to Dollars 61 3/4 in after-hours dealing.
Northrop said it had arranged financing commitments of Dollars 2.8bn from
Chase Manhattan Bank and Chemical Bank. Martin Marietta's bid is being
financed by BankAmerica and JP Morgan.
The struggle for Grumman manifests the consolidation in the US defence
industry, which is rationalising in the face of a shrinking Pentagon budget.
Most deals in the sector have been friendly, though in 1992 Martin Marietta
and Northrop were on opposite sides of a Dollars 475m battle for LTV's
missiles and aircraft divisions. That tussle was won by Northrop and two
allies - Loral and Carlyle Group.
Northrop, based in Los Angeles, has sales of about Dollars 5bn and derives
roughly half its revenues from the B-2 stealth bomber programme, which is
being wound down. It also makes the F-18 fighter and fuselage sections for
Boeing 747 commercial jumbo jets. Maryland-based Martin Marietta, with 1993
sales of Dollars 9.3bn, has been expanding rapidly through takeovers.
Both companies argue that Grumman, which used to be known primarily as a
maker of warplanes, but has diversified in recent years into electronics and
data systems, would make an excellent strategic fit and immediately add to
their earnings per share. Some 40 per cent of Grumman's shares are owned by
an employee investment plan.
Mr Kent Kresa, chairman of Northrop, said that his company and Grumman had
conducted months of merger discussions because of the fit between the
businesses, and as late as February 25 Northrop had offered to make a bid of
'not less than Dollars 50 a share, if invited to do so.'
He complained that Grumman had signed a merger agreement with Martin
Marietta, without informing Northrop that it was in negotiations or inviting
the company's best bid.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Unions to consider Pounds 2.3bn Air France rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and GILLIAN TETT

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Air France yesterday put a rescue plan, including a three-year wage freeze
and 5,000 voluntary redundancies, to its 14 trade unions. The French
government has made union acceptance a condition for injecting FFr20bn
(Pounds 2.3bn) into the ailing state airline.
An official of Force Ouvriere, the largest union at Air France, said it
would 'not put a spanner' in the management's plan. Two other big unions
complained the government was 'blackmailing' them into accepting the scheme.
Mr Christian Blanc, the new Air France president, said all 14 unions must
approve the rescue to prevent any recurrence of the damaging strike that led
to the scrapping of a previous austerity plan last October and the
resignation of his predecessor, Mr Bernard Attali.
In contrast to the Attali plan, the new measures do not include forced
redundancies or pay cuts.
Air France's request for 'at least FFr20bn' in state aid to help cover its
losses, which amounted to FFr7.5bn last year, and to help service its
FFr37bn debt, requires approval from the European Commission.
Confident of approval, Mr Blanc said the Commission should be reassured that
the state aid would not distort competition in the European market, as Air
France would be reducing its fleet from 166 to 149 aircraft during five
years. It plans to increase by 2 per cent a year the seats per kilometre it
could offer, by better use of its carriers.
This would also be the last time Air France would seek state aid, he
promised.
Decisions on airline aid are made by Mr Abel Matutes, the transport
commissioner. His officials said the French aid request - though very large
 -was in proportion to aid recently promised by Portugal and Greece to their
carriers. The UK is expected to lobby against the state aid.

Confusion reigned in the South African black 'homeland' of Bophuthatswana
yesterday as hundreds of police and soldiers revolted against the government
along with thousands of looting protesters, celebrating what they believed
was the overthrow of President Lucas Mangope.
Early this morning, however, there were reports that soldiers loyal to
President Mangope had opened fire on protesters in the capital Mmabatho and
the town of Mafikeng as troops of the nominally-independent homeland tried
to restore order.
The president's whereabouts were not known, but there were persistent
reports he had fled by helicopter. It was unclear however whether he had
left the homeland or was attempting to regroup his forces from his home
village.
Armed right-wing whites sympathetic to Mr Mangope, who had vowed to keep the
homeland independent of a new black South Africa, were reported to be
gathering outside the towns, some driving into the capital on what appeared
to be military scouting missions.
The Afrikaner Resistance Movement, a neo-Nazi group that has vowed to fight
against black rule in South Africa, had said it would send its members to
Bophuthatswana to help stave off an African National Congress-led coup in
the run up to next month's general election. Mr Mangope is an adamant foe of
the ANC and had refused to let Bophuthatswana participate in the April 26-28
poll, which the ANC is expected to win easily. His demise would be a
substantial victory for the ANC.
South Africa's 'ambassador' in Mmabatho, Tjaart Van der Walt, said last
night Mr Mangope had told him he was going to his country residence outside
the city. South African officials said Mr Van der Walt had assured them Mr
Mangope would be able to regain control, although early this morning this
seemed highly uncertain.
The violent protests started four days ago when demonstrators demanded the
homeland be reincorporated into South Africa and take part in the country's
first all-race elections. With a population of slightly more than 2m it is
one of 10 black homelands created by Pretoria under its discredited
apartheid policy.
'We are free, at last]' shouted one demonstrator outside the campus of the
University of Bophuthatswana yesterday. Other protesters waving ANC flags
clambered on to police armoured vehicles to embrace those who only moments
before had shot volleys of teargas and rubber bullets into the campus.
Soldiers and police stood by as thousands of protesters looted and set light
to a large shopping complex in the capital Mmabatho, which demonstrators
said was owned by a company in which the president held shares. Gunfire
filled the streets of the capital and looting went on for several hours,
with demonstrators carrying out furniture, computer equipment, kitchenware,
televisions and clothing.
There were jubilant scenes as police laid down their arms and invited
'comrades' - young ANC students - to climb on to police and army vehicles,
including a water cannon which had been used against students. Police and
students went to the South African embassy to deliver a petition entitled
'police for peace', addressed to Mr Mangope and demanding that he stop using
the police as a political force.

FT  11 MAR 94 / PM vows to search for peace: UK and Ireland say hopes of
early Ulster breakthrough ended by Heathrow attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments last night conceded that Wednesday night's
IRA mortar attack at London's Heathrow airport has killed hopes of an early
breakthrough in the search for peace in Northern Ireland.
Both governments united in their condemnation of the attack - which led to
calls yesterday for an inquiry into security operations at Heathrow - and
insisted that they would not be knocked off course in attempts to reach a
political settlement in the province.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish
counterpart, claimed that the IRA's latest action and the failure of Sinn
Fein to react positively to the Downing Street declaration would not deter
London and Dublin from pressing on.
At Westminster, Mr Major told MPs the 'unjustifiable' IRA attack would make
'no difference whatsoever' to the search for peace. He emphasised that the
declaration set out 'a series of principles upon which we hope and intend to

In the Dail, Mr Reynolds attacked the IRA action as 'criminal and

Both London and Dublin privately accept that the political momentum which
followed December's declaration has largely been lost. They are now resigned
to an extended process aimed at establishing an agreed framework for
progress involving the province's constitutional parties.
Speaking after yesterday's Anglo-Irish conference in London, Sir Patrick
Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the Heathrow attack had shown the
IRA could not make its case via the democratic process and once again had
resorted to force.
Sir Patrick stressed both governments were committed to continuing the
so-called three-stranded political talks process and added: 'There is no
limit to our patience because there is no limit to the advantages that
success in that process will bring.'
He emphasised, however, that the prize of prosperity and peace might lie 'at
the end of a very long road but a road on which neither government is going
to weary of travelling'.
In a speech in London last night, Sir Patrick reinforced the government's
'business as usual' approach by concentrating on the issue of relationships
between Northern Ireland and the republic - strand two of the talks process.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in one of the most downbeat
assessments from Dublin on the chances of an end to IRA action, said that
'the credit is running very low, if not totally expired' on the part of
those who had yet to make up their mind on the Downing Street declaration.
He said: 'Perhaps they (the IRA) are giving a message to both governments
that they are not going to participate.'
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said that the airport attack was a
reminder that the causes of conflict remained.
Mr Spring described as 'deplorable' reported remarks by Mr Adams that more
'spectaculars' like Heathrow were to be expected.

Police and soldiers in the South African black 'homeland' of Bophuthatswana
revolted against the government yesterday, joining thousands of jubilant
protesters celebrating what they believed was the overthrow of President
Lucas Mangope.
'We are free, at last]' shouted one demonstrator outside the campus of the
University of Bophuthatswana. Other protesters waving African National
Congress flags clambered on to police armoured vehicles to embrace those who
only moments before had shot volleys of teargas and rubber bullets into the
campus.
The president's whereabouts were not known last night, but there were
persistent reports that he had fled. It was not clear whether the whole of
the homeland's police force and army had switched to the side of the
demonstrators.
Soldiers and police stood by last night as thousands of protesters looted
and set alight to a large shopping complex in the capital Mmabatho, which
the demonstrators said was owned by a company in which the president held
shares.
Looting went on for several hours, with demonstrators carrying out
furniture, computer equipment, kitchenware, televisions and clothing.
Gunfire filled the streets of the capital last night as protesters
celebrated their victory.
Earlier in the day there were jubilant scenes as police laid down their arms
and invited 'comrades' - young ANC students - to climb on to police and army
vehicles, including a water cannon which had been used against students.
Police and students went to the South African embassy in Mmabatho to deliver
a petition entitled 'police for peace', addressed to Mr Mangope and
demanding that he stop using the police as a political force. The petition
also included a number of economic demands.
There appeared to have been no attempts to take over government buildings,
the president's office or the homes of ministers last night, but the
whereabouts of ministers were unknown.
South African officials said they had been assured by their 'ambassador' in
Mmabatho that Mr Mangope would be able to regain control, although this
seemed unlikely last night.
There were, however, reports that members of the paramilitary Afrikaner
Resistance Movement had set off for Bophuthatswana from a nearby town, to
assist their right wing ally Mr Mangope.
If the president has indeed fallen, this would represent a blow to the
efforts of the right-wing Freedom Alliance to boycott April's all-race
elections, though the main partners in the alliance, Inkatha and the
Afrikaner Volksfront, yesterday reaffirmed their resistance.
Gen Constand Viljoen, Afrikaner Volksfront leader, said negotiations with
the ANC would be halted until the ANC recognised the sovereignty of
Bophuthatswana - a demand which may have been overtaken by last night's
events.

The UK, where British Airways has made clear its opposition to any
subvention for the French carrier, is expected to lobby against the state
aid. Praising BA's turnround in recent years, Mr Blanc said the UK carrier
should give Air France the chance to do the same. He criticised BA for its
'lack of fair play' in wooing passengers away from the French airline and
'its clear desire to see Air France disappear'.
Mr Blanc threatens unions that if Air France does not adapt to the new rules
of international air competition, it may go under. 'We must live with these
rules or disappear,' he said.
Mr Blanc, addressing journalists at one of the Meridien hotels which Air
France owns, said he would sell the hotel chain 'before the summer'. Accor
of France and Forte of the UK are rival bidders.
Mr Blanc also revealed Air France's intention to disentangle itself from its
Dollars 30m investment in CSA, the Czech airline.
In addition to selling some aircraft, Mr Blanc said Air France planned to
cut its level of non-fuel purchases by 16 per cent during three years,
starting with a saving of FFr650m this year.

Riot police fired at demonstrators in the South African black 'homeland' of
Bophuthatswana for the second day running yesterday as a civil service
strike paralysed the government of the increasingly embattled President
Lucas Mangope. At least 32 people were wounded, witnesses said. The homeland
government said a police officer was killed.
Mr Mangope, who yesterday closed the broadcasting service and sacked its
staff, rejected a request from the Independent Electoral Commission to allow
campaigning and polling for South Africa's April elections to take place in
the homeland. Bophuthatswana said earlier this week it would not participate
in these elections.
As teargas drifted toward the government offices from the nearby University
of Bophuthatswana, Mr Ephraim Keikalame, finance minister, admitted: 'It is
not possible to have an effective functioning government under these
circumstances.'
Almost the entire public service appeared to be on strike, but telephones
and electricity continued to function. The capital's main hospital complex
was deserted by staff. Outside the university, police armoured vehicles
roared up and down throughout the day, firing teargas canisters and rubber
bullets at students barricading the entrance gate.
'This is the kick of a dying horse,' said one student, weeping from the
effects of the gas, while another vowed: 'We want to make Bop ungovernable.'
Using rubbish bin lids as shields and brandishing sticks as spears, students
did the toyi-toyi dance, the hallmark of the African National Congress, as
they demanded that nominally independent Bophuthatswana, a creation of
apartheid, be reincorporated into South Africa. The rioting provoked a
threat of direct South African intervention, with the Transitional Executive
Council, the multi-party body overseeing government in the run-up to
elections, saying it would give Mr Mangope a week 'to change his attitude'.
Meanwhile there was uncertainty last night over whether various rightwing
South African parties would contest the April elections. Parties were due to
lodge candidate lists by yesterday afternoon, but many - including the
mainly-Zulu Inkatha Freedom party and the right wing Freedom Front - failed
to do so.

<TEXT>
The US economy grew modestly at the beginning of this year despite the
effects of bad weather and showed little sign of rising prices, the Federal
Reserve system said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
'The economy expanded moderately in January and February despite unusually
severe weather in the east and the Midwest,' the Fed said in its Beige Book
report on national activity.
The economic summary by the 12 Federal Reserve district banks covers the
period from mid-January to Feb 28. It was prepared by the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston.
'Overall, only limited price pressures are reported - prices of building
materials, selected metals and some chemicals are said to be rising, but
prices of manufactured goods and consumer goods generally are not
experiencing upward pressure, the Fed said.
Manufacturing activity picked up in most industries across the country,
notably for vehicle-makers and their suppliers and for producers of building
products.

<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, has been in
exploratory talks with the right-of-centre Liberal Front party (PFL), the
second-largest in Congress, with a view to building an alliance ahead of
October's presidential elections.
Both sides are reluctant to talk about the discussions, which are still at
an early stage.
Mr Cardoso, who is trying to push an ambitious economic restructuring
programme through Congress, is also measuring reaction to the proposed
alliance within his own party, the Social Democratic Movement (PSDB).
Linking with the PFL would provide Mr Cardoso with a viable political base
and support in the country's north-east, where he has looked weak in all
opinion polls. It would also provide a strong challenge to the present
presidential front-runner, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing
Workers party.
In the latest polls, Mr da Silva won 30 per cent backing compared with Mr
Cardoso's 11 per cent.
Mr Lus Eduardo Magalhaes, leader of the PFL in the lower house, said the
situation should become clearer by the end of this month, the deadline for
Mr Cardoso to resign under Brazilian law if he wants to run for president.

Pakistan told the UN Human Rights Commission yesterday it was dropping a

Kashmir region, Reuter reports from Geneva. It agreed to drop the
resolution, which had led to a severe bilateral crisis with India, after a
joint appeal by Iran and China, later supported by a string of other
Islamic, Asian and developing nations.
Pakistan's draft was the most contentious of all the resolutions at the
annual six-week session. It was introduced by a fierce attack on India by
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on a visit to Geneva last month.

<TEXT>
King Hussein of Jordan's efforts to mend fences with Saudi Arabia, which
still begrudges Amman's pro-Iraqi stance during the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis,
were shattered yesterday when he failed to meet King Fahd during a short
visit to the Saudi kingdom, James Whittington writes from Amman.
Although the trip was presented from the Jordanian side as a minor
pilgrimage to perform the Umra at religious sites, officials in Amman had
been privately optimistic that a rapprochement between the two monarchs was
possible.
'We simply would not have made the trip if we thought King Fahd would not
see us,' conceded one senior official.
Diplomats described the trip as a 'serious snub' to King Hussein. 'It shows
clearly that the Saudis have not forgiven him for what they saw as an act of
betrayal during the Gulf war,' one said.

Rising long-term interest rates in Japan threaten to have an adverse impact
on the domestic economy, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the country's central

decision on Tuesday by the Industrial Bank of Japan to raise its long-term
prime-lending rate by 0.6 percentage points to 4.4 per cent.
Mr Mieno said the Bank of Japan had no intention of intervening to influence
long-term rates and would leave the matter to the markets. He pointed out,
however, that long-term rates were linked to short-term rates, and that the
bank would continue to make appropriate short-term adjustments as necessary.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Office Automation
(24): Setting the pace - Implementation / Work flow is changing the way
Britannia Building Society operates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britannia Building Society is working on a strategy for office automation
which will put it at the heart of the society's operations, writes John
Kavanagh. The strategy will be based on document image processing and work
flow automation, which have already been used to redesign the handling of
mortgage arrears and property recovery.
Britannia, one of the top 10 building societies in the UK, was claimed by
its supplier, Olivetti, to have been the first organisation in the UK to
adopt document image processing. That was in 1986.
The society, based in Leek, Staffordshire, and with 200 branches, is thought
to have the biggest installation in Europe, with 180 workstations served by
a Filenet system. Olivetti introduced the system in the UK and still sells
it, although US supplier Filenet now has its own operation here.
For the first few years, Britannia used the system purely for storing and
accessing documents on screens instead of as paper files. Everything from
the mortgage application form onwards, but excluding property deeds, is
scanned in or entered as word processor files. All queries are dealt with
through the system: original documents are no longer kept.
Tax forms relating to investment accounts have been scanned in since they
were introduced in 1991. The society would have needed extra staff to handle
them manually but won agreement from the Inland Revenue that images would be
acceptable.
These paper storage and retrieval applications alone brought significant
savings but the society is now also increasingly exploiting the automated
work flow potential of the system.
Early last year, Britannia transformed the handling of arrears, building it
around work flow and on-line access to information. The changes made a
'significant impact', according to Mr Barry Foster, head of systems
development. Well over Pounds 10m in arrears was collected in 1993 and a
large percentage was seen as directly attributable to the new system.
'Previously we sent progressively serious letters, but we now work through
telephone contact,' Mr Foster says. 'The department has been reorganised
into teams, who work shifts so that they can call people at home in the
evenings.
'Every night our ICL mainframe works out which accounts have gone into
arrears and passes them to the Filenet system. All documents, such as
correspondence, relating to each case are scanned in and the system can also
retrieve accounts and other data from the mainframe, so staff have immediate
access to all information when they call. Filenet keeps track of cases if
they progress to litigation and recovery of the property.'
Having fully automated the post-mortgage processes, Britannia is now looking
at activities which lead up to a mortgage being accepted.
'We're piloting a PC-based sales system which will be the front-end to the
entire process and installed at the point of first contact with the customer
in the branches,' Barry Foster says.
'This means the whole process from customer contact to handling
applications, completion, sending the payment and passing the data over to
the administration system is being totally reviewed. The Filenet system will
play a part in the redesign.'
Other developments being considered include putting branches on-line to the
document retrieval system and providing similar document handling and work
flow facilities to insurance company Britannia Life.
'In all developments we have to be convinced of the benefits, because this
is an expensive technology,' Barry Foster says. 'In addition, we've been
installing more and more PCs instead of simple terminals as workstations to
the Filenet system. The terminal response times have not been good - 10
seconds or more - and PC response times are quicker, because the PC can
handle more of the processing. Response times have been the subject of more
discussions with Olivetti and Filenet than any other issue.'
The latest discussions are over the replacement of the ageing Filenet
central processor - 'we want some assurances before we make the move but
we're confident that there will be significant improvements,' Mr Foster
says. 'Despite the response times, the system is still far faster than
having to look for paper files.'
System performance upgrades and strategy review are the main preoccupations
of Barry Foster and his team at present. Their deliberations are likely to
have a considerable impact on the future of the society.
'The society is going through very considerable change at branch level and
in business redesign,' he says. 'Work flow will be an increasingly
significant part of the strategy.'
Filenet
Filenet for document image processing and Workflo software for work flow
automation, launched in 1985 and now on version 3.1, released in 1993.
Supplier: Filenet, a US company formed in 1982. Olivetti launched its
products in the UK in 1985 and Filenet set up a UK operation in 1991.
Filenet's 1993 turnover was up by 14 per cent at Dollars 158m; the company
has 900 staff world-wide, including 150 in Europe.
Price: A typical system, including central processor, an optical disc
jukebox and work flow software, costs around Pounds 100,000.
Number of users: There are 35 customers in the UK and 730 world-wide.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Office Automation
(25): An end to the paper-chase - Insurance industry applications / A big
investment in automation has paid dividends for a small insurance firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Document image processing and work flow automation have made quite an impact
on insurance company Motor Claims Services (MCS). They have streamlined and
imposed discipline on working methods to speed up the handling of claims,
halved paper and telephone costs and enabled the company to expand without
moving to bigger offices.
Insurance companies of all sizes are awash with paper and have been prime
targets for document systems suppliers. MCS was set up in 1988 by broker
Bennetts Group with three staff and moved to document image processing when
it outgrew its claims management system (and the supplier went out of
business) in the early 1990s.
MCS insures against risks not normally covered by motor insurance. These
range from car hire costs to legal expenses and the pursuit of civil actions
in cases of injury. MCS has 18 staff at its Reading offices handling 10,000
claims a year and issuing 200,000 policies. It expects to grow to 500,000
policies in two years.
MCS chose the Stormforce system from Mitre Technology, partly on price and
partly on the recommendation of its auditors, who had already worked with
Mitre.
MCS now has a system including a central Hewlett-Packard Unix processor
running Mitre's Stormforce document management and work flow software and an
Informix database management system.
Stormforce can access client data held in the database. The system serves 20
personal computers, a Fujitsu document scanner and three laser printers.
The contract, including consultancy and training, cost Pounds 250,000 -
quite an outlay for a company which typically charges premiums of about
Pounds 10 on those 200,000 policies. But the impact has been quite dramatic
and the company is considering adding more facilities. - 'a year ago we had
16 filing cabinets, six feet high and four feet wide,' says Mr David Green,
admin and systems manager. 'Today, we have six - and the number is still
falling.
'Once, we had sheer mountains of paper and every piece went through several
moves. Someone would open the post, find the appropriate files, take them to
the case handlers, who would generate letters which would go to the typing
area and then back to the handlers and eventually into the files and back to
the filing clerks.
'All this paper-chasing might take a day or two and during that time it was
difficult to find where a file was, which meant delays in dealing with
clients' calls.'
Today, says Mr Green, 'we now store absolutely everything on the system,
from incoming correspondence, diagrams and photographs, which are all
scanned in, to brief details of phone calls, even if it's just a call asking
for a reply to a letter. Once documents are scanned in, we keep the physical
copies for just seven days, simply as a precaution. The only documents kept
for longer are those that might be needed in court.
'When staff log-in each day, the system gives them a list of tasks which are
due on specific claims. They can review the entire history of a claim, all
the documents, correspondence and phone calls, and can generate standard
letters, without moving from their desks. These daily reminders force people
to do the most pressing tasks, while the quick access to documents helps
them to do those tasks. Previously, people would have a pile of papers on
their desks and tasks would gradually work their way up to the top.
'Claims are handled much more quickly. That means we have more satisfied
customers and we cut costs, because the more chasing and monitoring we have
to do, the more it costs us.'
He adds: 'Our paper costs have been cut by half, partly because we used to
keep a paper copy of every letter that went out,' says David Green.
'Photocopying costs have also fallen. Phone bills have been reduced, because
the information is always on hand and we don't have to hunt out files and
call people back.'
MCS is now planning to provide fax links to and from the system, reducing
use of paper even further - 'at present, we have to scan in incoming faxes
and we print documents simply to put them through a fax machine, which is
silly,' says David Green. 'If we can send and receive directly through the
system we can speed everything through even more quickly.
Stormforce
This is a document imaging and work flow management system with fax links
and automatic generation of standard letters. It was introduced in October
1992 and is on release 2.3.
Hardware and operating systems: Unix and IBM-type personal computers running
Windows.
Supplier: Mitre Technology, part of K2, a UK computing services group. K2
was formed in1988. K2's latest results show that it grew 72 per cent to a
turnover of Pounds 4.3m and operating profit grew 64 per cent to Pounds
201,000. It has 48 staff. Sales and support are direct from the company in
Watford.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Office Automation
(22): Customer service enhanced - Electronic forms / Electronic mail has
long taken over from telexes and paper forms at Mercedes-Benz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz originally installed Verimation's Memo office automation
package to get rid of telexes. Today, the vehicle manufacturer not only uses
the package as its standard method of telecommunications, both internally
and to dealers, but also as a replacement for paper forms, writes John
Kavanagh.
Mercedes-Benz has 1,000 staff and 180 franchisees in the UK. It introduced
Memo in 1988 on its IBM mainframe computer at the UK headquarters in Milton
Keynes. The franchisees now have computer systems of their own and all but a
handful connect to the mainframe to use Memo. There are 2,000 electronic
mailbox users on the UK system.
'The initial aim was to cut the number of telexes and telephone calls,' says
Mr Andy Sheldon, who is responsible for supporting Memo users in the UK. 'We
were getting 500 free-format telexes a day from the UK franchisees, for
example, to order emergency parts needed on top of their standard stock
deliveries.
'The franchisees now complete a structured electronic form on their systems
and transmit it via Memo. Staff in the parts department check all orders on
their workstations and can accept, reject, correct or query them, sending
the queries back via electronic mail. All this has cut paper and time.
'Another major time-saving application went live last October. In the past,
if a part received by a dealer was damaged, a lot of paperwork was raised
and it took 15 days to process a claim. We've now introduced an electronic
form here, too. The warehouse people look at a claim on screen and decide on
the appropriate action. There is no paper involved at all.
'This has cut the time to handle damaged parts from 15 days to 1 1/2 days.
There have been staff-savings here: previously there was a significant data
entry function, but now the dealers do it themselves.'
The electronic forms are also used internally. Secretaries fill in weekly
absence reports for their departments through Memo. Staff going on trips
book travel and accommodation by sending an electronic form to the company's
travel agent, which is linked to the system.
The latest application is expected to have a big effect on customer service.
'From February, dealers can get immediate automatic decisions on goodwill
claims,' says Andy Sheldon. 'If a part fails just outside the warranty
period, the dealer can fill in an electronic form; this goes through Memo to
a system on our mainframe which looks up the customer details and various
tables to decide whether the part will be replaced free of charge.
Previously this involved phone calls or faxes: now there's a decision within
five seconds, while the customer is with the dealer.'
Other central applications also have links to the electronic mail system.
When new cars arrive at Harwich from Germany, the vehicle system is informed
and this generates a message to the appropriate dealers.
Mercedes-Benz does not use the bulletin board facility, which can hold
announcements for inspection by any user. Instead, it sends general messages
 -such as reports on stolen cars - to a central electronic mail box which
each dealer has in addition to its individual staff mailboxes.
'All the mailboxes are held on disc on our mainframe and there are about
100,000 messages stored at any time, so if we had the bulletin board we
would save disc space by only holding the general messages once,' Andy
Sheldon says. 'However, that means buying the software, so it's swings and
roundabouts.'
The diary facility is used extensively to arrange meetings and book rooms
and equipment. 'Very few people in my division have diaries,' Mr Sheldon
says.
The UK operation chose Memo because the group uses it as the worldwide
standard. Mercedes-Benz's international data communications network links 15
mainframe computer installations and serves 110,000 Memo users, making the
company Verimation's biggest customer. Most communication in the UK and with
Germany and other countries goes via electronic mail as a matter of course.
'We saved several hundred thousands pounds in the first year by cutting
phone and telex costs,' he adds, 'but we've had electronic mail for so long
now and it's become so ensconced that we don't even really think about the
savings any more.'
Memo electronic mail system
Memo also offers electronic forms, work flow management, bulletin board and
scheduling facilities, some as standard and others as extras. It was
launched in 1984. The latest version, 4.1, was released at the end of 1993.
Supplier: Verimation, formed by Volvo in Sweden in 1984 and in the UK in
1987. Now 25 per cent owned by Volvo and 75 per cent by Swedish software
company Sapia. Volvo owns Memo.
Turnover in 1992 was Pounds 12m. There are five staff in the UK and 280
worldwide.

(23): Happy birthday, Liz - Electronic messaging / Public bulletin board
systems are now finding wide use in business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bulletin board systems are no longer the exclusive preserve of young PC
enthusiasts who swap virus programs and broadcast 'Happy Birthday Liz' or
other, less flattering, messages to each other.
Indeed, Mr Reg Scaife and his colleagues in the UK Industrial Sugar Users
Group confess to being middle-aged or older and in many cases completely new
to information technology. Yet they now regularly dial into the CIX public
bulletin board system to share the latest news from Brussels and
electronically discuss topics planned for their next meeting, writes John
Kavanagh.
The Industrial Sugar Users Group consists of 55 companies such as Cadbury,
Mars and Nestle, plus five trade associations, including the British Soft
Drinks Association and the Ice Cream Federation. These organisations account
for well over half the UK's sugar consumption.
Reg Scaife is the group's secretary. He is a keen PC user and got hooked on
CIX in 1991 when he discovered it was a good source of advice on office
systems. He often leaves queries and finds that suppliers and other users
key in their suggestions. Mr Scaife saw that a bulletin board system could
benefit the Industrial Sugar Users Group. With members' agreement he created
a private conference on CIX, open only to group members.
'We felt that things needed to be done more quickly but at the same time
dragging everyone to London for emergency meetings was not ideal,' he says.
'Even using the telephone and fax is time-consuming and frustrating and
you're never certain if someone has received a message.
'We can now cope with emergencies. For example if a Brussels announcement
demands a quick response or a statement to the press, we can clear it with
the group's officers very quickly.
'In addition, we have more productive meetings. A bulletin board system
can't replace face-to-face meetings but our three or four meetings a year
are now better prepared. We discuss issues beforehand through CIX, so our
meetings concentrate on the topics which have emerged as most important,' he
adds.
Minutes are available through CIX almost immediately afterwards. In
addition, when Mr Scaife attends an EC meeting in Brussels he prepares a
report on his PC and transmits it to CIX before going to bed - 'one of our
members starts work at 7am, so he can see a report on yesterday's Brussels
meeting as soon as he gets in,' Mr Scaife says.
The system depends to an extent on people disciplining themselves to dial in
regularly - 'one benefit is that you can choose to look at your messages
when it fits in with what you're doing, whereas the phone forces you to stop
and deal with the call,' Reg Scaife says.
'However, this does mean that if things go quiet for a fortnight, people
slacken off logging in. I try to keep them in the habit by putting in news
relating to the industry.'
Connection charges have been cut dramatically by the use of a software
product known as an off-line reader. Without such products, users have to
key in text and read messages while on-line, incurring hefty connection
charges and telephone costs.
An off-line reader enables a user to prepare text beforehand and send it in
one burst; the reader also retrieves messages and stores them on the user's
own computer disc. The off-line readers used as standard by the sugar users
group are from Ashmount Research: Telepathy for those using the DOS
operating system and Wigwam for those with Microsoft Windows. These products
also organise incoming messages into a database for easier reference.
Reg Scaife says using Wigwam has cut his CIX and associated telephone
charges from Pounds 60 to Pounds 17 a month, even though his use of the
system has increased.
Despite the amount of text he sends and receives, he is rarely on-line for
more than two minutes.
Compulink Information Exchange This product, CIX, is a public bulletin
board, conference system and electronic mail service. Private conferences
can also be set up. CIX enables users to send faxes from their personal
computers. It also provides a link to the world-wide Internet service.
Supplier: Compulink Information Exchange, a UK company formed in 1987 with
the sole business of running the service.
Number of users: CIX says 'tens of thousands.'
Price: Pounds 25 registration fee, then connection charges of 6p per minute
at peak rate and 4p off peak, plus VAT. There are also the standard
telephone charges.
Contacts: CIX is on (0492) 641961 and 081-390 8446. Its main competitor is
Compuserve, on 0800 289458, which offers access to a wide range of
information databases. Ashmount Research, supplier of Wigwam for both CIX
and Compuserve, is on 071-935 7712.

(21): Who said the paperless office was just a dream? / Goodbye to
secretaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two-dozen professional staff at IQ Software in the UK, but no
secretaries - and the company dreams of becoming paperless, too, reports
John Kavanagh.
IQ, which develops and sells information access software aimed especially at
managers and senior executives, bases the entire way it operates on computer
systems.
'We think in terms of automation and productivity, rather than
administration and secretaries,' says UK general manager Mr Geof Gibbons.
'If someone finds they've done the same admin job three times in the last
week, we start thinking of ways to automate it.'
The main office in Winchester and smaller operations in Manchester and
Colchester are supported by two main software packages, supplied through the
parent IQ Software company in the US to all its European subsidiaries. These
are Futurus Team Combo, an office automation product from Futurus, and Sales
Control from Sales and Marketing.
The UK company also has Sunaccounts from Systems Union, Microsoft Word for
word processing, Lotus 1-2-3 for spreadsheets and its own products for
management information access. The systems run on a Novell office network
supporting relatively cheap IBM-type personal computers, generally chosen on
price.
'We have an almost paperless office,' Geof Gibbons says. 'We run sales
control like a groupware system for everyone in the company. The marketing
people enter details of sales leads and allocate them to salesmen.
'A salesman phones and then gets the system to produce a standard follow-up
letter. The system records that the letter has been sent. The salesman can
ask the system to remind him to chase up the lead so many days later. He
might arrange a demonstration and generate another letter. The system again
records this fact but we don't keep paper copies in a file or anything silly
like that.
'The salesman will use the Futurus Team electronic mail system to get the
support people to check that product trials are going well. The support
people log their activity in the system. When the lead turns into a
customer, the accounts people are notified through the system and create
accounts records in Sunaccounts.'
The result is that all activities relating to a customer are logged
paperless on the system. In addition, all activities use - or are sparked
off by - information which is handled and recorded once only, he says.
'Sales people know which information and prices they've given. The support
team know of any problems and what was done about them. Marketing can check
the progress of a prospect. Training consultants know the amount of training
to be done.
'We also key-in summaries of any correspondence from customers, so that's
available on the system, too.'
The Futurus Team electronic mail facility is a natural part of every-day
life at IQ Software and is regarded as more productive than the telephone.
While we speak, Mr Gibbons keys in a question he cannot answer and sends it
to a technical specialist; the answer comes back towards the end of our
conversation.
'E-mail is the simplest way of communicating between people here in
Winchester, in the remote offices and at the US head office,' he says. 'You
don't tie-up valuable time in phone calls. Written messages tend to be more
succinct and thoughtful, because you've got to key them in. And you can add
to them and send them to any number of appropriate people at the same time.
We don't use a discussion database like Lotus Notes: instead we build a
dialogue from an initial e-mail message.
'For example, I might broadcast a question about a customer, a salesman
might add a comment about what he has done and say he's waiting for the
support team to do something and then the support person might add his
comment. This also gives us a log of the entire conversation.
'We do e-mail to some customers, via the public Compuserve network service.
This hasn't been taken up as much as we'd like by customers. There still
seems to be a lot of psychological barriers: even people who are well used
to using PCs prefer to talk on the phone. Even in our company, with all our
office automation, there's one guy who sends little paper notes in response
to e-mail messages. Fortunately, he's the only one.'
A separate simple electronic mail system in Futurus Team is used to pass on
telephone messages. Anyone answering the telephone for someone who is out
types a message into this system, so there are no scribbled notes on
people's desks. Geof Gibbons says this does not put staff off taking other
people's calls: in this company, communications and information technology
are a natural part of the way everyone works. IQ Software has looked at
voicemail systems, which record spoken messages, but feels they are still
too expensive for its needs.
Another electronic mail system enables people to communicate directly and
immediately on urgent matters. A user can send a message through a PC to a
colleague, who is notified by an audible beep and can key in a reply.
IQ Software finds this especially useful if someone takes a query on the
telephone and the person who knows the answer is also engaged: the two
colleagues can hold a conversation through their PCs while talking to
outsiders on the telephone.
Futurus Team's bulletin board facility is used by the US headquarters to
send product and other information over night. At the US end, the system
checks for any product documents which have been changed since the previous
day's connection and sends those across.
In Winchester, this facility is also used to keep track of training course
bookings and to maintain certain other information such as staff names and
addresses.
A diary system is also part of Futurus Team and is used to arrange meetings
and book resources such as a meeting room and a projector. If one person
arranges a meeting, the system notifies the others via electronic mail.
IQ Software has taken various measures to ensure that while information
technol ogy is fundamental to the way the company works it is not also an
Achilles' heel.
'All the discs are mirrored, so all data is written to two disc drives at
the same time,' says the company's support manager, Mr Neil Hutton, who also
looks after the internal systems.
'Everything is archived to tape every night. We have uninterruptible power
supplies in case of mains electricity problems.
'One benefit of using a Novell network is that any machine attached to it
can be the file server, so if the usual file processor goes down, we can
move the discs to another machine.
'We use standard 486 PCs, not quite the state of the art but perfectly
adequate for our needs.'
Geof Gibbons underlines the importance of having the systems constantly
available - 'we've been fully automated from day one and never had a
secretary. We started on a single machine and when there were two of us, we
bought another and got a network.
'The systems have absolutely proved themselves in terms of the productivity
of our people,' he concludes. 'We just couldn't work without our systems
now. It's as simple as that.'

(20): Ways to unlock the information blocks - Developing ideas across the
company / Unipart, the vehicle components group, is increasingly finding
that groupware supports its lean, team-based structure. The on-line computer
system means fewer meetings, yet greater discussion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Work group software could have been made for Unipart - and the company is
certainly taking it on in a big way.
Unipart became one of the success stories of the 1980s after the 1987
management buy-out of the vehicle components manufacturer from Rover Group.
The company was streamlined into an organisation with fewer hierarchical
layers and an emphasis on team working. Its last reported turnover was more
than Pounds 660m and pre-tax profit was up 29 per cent at Pounds 19.8m.
Work group software found a Unipart 'evangelist' in the early 1990s in the
shape of Mr Mick Moignard, who had become a user through his work on
committees in the international computer users group, Guide.
Mr Moignard, a consultant in Unipart Information Technology, the group's
computing operation, found that the Notes software product from Lotus
Development enabled committee work to be done with fewer meetings yet
greater discussion: members shared their views through the on-line Notes
system.
For the last nine months Mr Moignard has been working full-time on Notes in
Unipart. Growth in the use of the system has been such that since last June
Notes has been allocated its own dedicated central processor.
'Notes fits in very well with the corporate culture and the lean, team-based
organisation that Unipart has created,' Mr Moignard says.
Applications have become wide-ranging but Unipart started with a relatively
simple system for the company's reception desk. When members of staff
arrange meetings with visitors they enter the details. The reception desk
has access to the information and when a visitor arrives a security name
badge is printed at the touch of a key.
'This system was developed in a couple of hours, which made quite an
impact,' Mick Moignard says.
The next application was a catalogue system for Unipart U (for university),
a big training initiative launched last autumn to encourage all staff to
commit themselves to continuous learning. The Pounds 2.5m venture included
fitting out a training centre with 14 lecture and seminar rooms and
providing a library, open 15 hours a day for study and the loan of books,
periodicals, videos and computer software for training.
Notes was used to put the catalogue on-line to everyone's personal computer.
'In effect, Notes has taken the library out of its room and on to people's
desks, where they can browse for books and other materials,' says Mick
Moignard.
'Again, Notes made an impact because development is straightforward and the
resulting system is easy to use.'
After these early successes, Notes was considered for more ambitious
projects, notably supporting a large team working on refitting warehouses.
Most of the team members were scattered across the head office in Cowley,
Oxford, but a couple were working with suppliers in the US.
'The main requirement was easy and simple access to shared documents such as
specifications and work-in-progress reports,' Mick Moignard says.
All staff had to work from the same version of a document and had to be able
to contribute to it from their own offices in different parts of the
building and even in the US.
'Without shared documents you risk having individuals holding different
versions on their own PCs and working from them,' Mr Moignard says. 'This
way everyone always sees the up-to-date version. If information is kept by
individuals, then it's corporate information which is not available to the
corporation. This company sees shared information as power, not personal
information. Notes promotes the shared information view: we've certainly
seen attitudes changing since it was introduced.'
The warehouse project support system was set up so that changes could only
be made by named individuals but anyone could enter comments: these are
linked to a document in the database. The documents are mostly produced
through word processing software but some drawings have been scanned in and
are held as document images.
Important new issues are discussed at a senior level in the overall project
and then allocated to work teams. A team manager might assign an issue to an
individual. This handing-on of responsibility is recorded through the
system, which automatically adjusts the access controls at each step.
Again, fast development and ease of use have proved attractive - 'modifying
the system and adding facilities are very straightforward and demand very
little programming effort,' Mick Moignard says. 'The users come to us but we
do the changes with them, so they have a very strong feeling of ownership
about the system and their information.' Other work group applications are
now being developed to help manage information technology projects. A little
system has also been produced to capture views on the internal Notes
courses, which introduce end-users to the product in half a day.
About 170 of the 600 personal computer users in the group now use Notes and
the number is growing steadily as more and more applications are added.
About 30 people are on-line at a time.
Mick Moignard says the alternative to Notes in most of these applications
would have been a conventional database management system - 'that would make
things more difficult,' he says. 'People would have to learn about database
directories, data structures, networking and so on.
'One attraction of Notes is that it works on less formal data structures.
For example, with the catalogue system we could scan in book covers and
blurbs or 20-second clips from the videos. With traditional database tools,
you are more limited in what you can do.'
The potential of using Notes in different ways - for example in project
management and to catalogue the library - cuts training costs, he points out
 -'one lot of training covers a vast range of applications: each time you
use Notes in a new application it reinforces the original training.'
He is not too concerned yet about Notes demanding extra disc storage. He
agrees that the ease of use could tempt users to load up a system with
information: his own idea of video clips is one example.
But he adds: 'It's also possible that work group software uses less disc
space overall, because it manages a central store of corporate information,
whereas without it people are likely to be setting up their own databases
and documents, possibly duplicating each other's efforts.'
Mick Moignard is clearly a committed evangelist on work group software. But
he constantly points to the way new Notes users have become enthusiastic
converts.
'Our users certainly now have that strong feeling of ownership of
information. They no longer feel it's locked up in a mainframe computer and
that they can only get at it in certain complicated ways. There's a wide
variety of application ideas emerging across the group. We certainly see it
helping us to support the lean structure of the company and to provide IT
systems where they've been regarded as expensive or complicated in the
past.'

(17): Software gives big productivity boost - Efficient access to data /
Linking groupware and database software has given a pensions team simple
access to both data and documents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Packaging manufacturer Lawson Mardon Group is certainly getting its money's
worth out of Lotus Notes, reports John Kavanagh.
The company has added the software product to its pensions system to give
easier access to its database, put Inland Revenue regulations on-line and
provide a forum for discussion and sharing experiences.
The results have been big productivity increases, better use of skilled
specialists' time, faster response to queries and more detailed records.
Lawson Mardon produces packaging ranging from chocolate bar wrappers to
cigarette cartons and cans for pet food. In the UK alone it has a dozen
largely autonomous manufacturing sites - and across Europe there are 4,500
staff.
Last year a new pensions administration system went live at the operations
centre in Bristol, produced using software development and database
management products from Gupta. Technical manager Mr Nick Burnard says the
Gupta products 'made it easy to knock up some screens and prototypes with
end-users and then move from the prototype to the final system quite
quickly.'
The new system handles tasks such as keeping records on 15,000 current and
former staff, calculating pensions and making payments.
Having got the essential administration functions working, the company
started looking at different ways of accessing the data and adding other,
unstructured information, typically held as paper documents.
The central pensions administrators liaise with local pensions contacts at
the many company sites, keeping up-to-date their records, which are held in
Bristol, and answering queries on anything from individual staff to Inland
Revenue regulations.
The department wanted to speed-up the response to queries, partly by giving
the local pensions contacts on-line access to their data as far as possible.
Nick Burnard's team settled on the Notes software package from Lotus
Development, largely because it could both provide a simple way for
end-users to access a database and handle unstructured information.
Lotus offers a facility for setting up forms on the screen, similar to paper
forms. Local pensions people, used to sending paper forms to the central
department, can now fill in the details through their personal computers and
transmit the forms to the central system. There is no group network, so the
local contacts call the central system over dial-up lines.
Confidentiality and security concerns have led Mr Burnard's team to deal
with each type of request at a time, so not all the electronic forms are
handled automatically at the Bristol end yet. But he says every task is
being looked at to see if it can be automated.
As the forms are received by the Notes system it checks whether a form type
is one it can handle. If it is not, it directs the form to a queue of work
to be dealt with by the central pensions administrators, who look at the
forms on their screens and access the database themselves to retrieve the
required information.
Forms which can be handled automatically, for example a request for details
of a staff member, are recognised by Notes and converted into a format which
can be processed by the Gupta database enquiry software. The Gupta software
retrieves the data and it is sent back to the remote site.
Previously, all enquiries were based on manual procedures, paper forms and
largely paper files.
'There were no really tight procedures in place,' says Nick Burnard. 'Bits
of paper were passed between people and if a file you needed was on
someone's desk, you had to find where it was.
'People can now see who is doing what. Managers have greater control of the
workload and can make adjustments to accommodate holidays and sickness, and
so on.
'An added benefit is that the system automatically records everything that
happens. With a paper system you might not bother to record every step. For
example, if a request for a benefits statement came in and some of the
information was found to be wrong, you might just put it right and not
record the error or why it was wrong, yet this could prove important in the
future for this file and for others. The new system keeps a record of all
such changes.'
Some forms require action which is outside the system, but the pensions
administration unit is looking at automation here to pass the job from a
pensions specialist to a secretary.
One example is the addition of a new staff member. At present a pensions
administrator creates a record, prints a letter and prepares a welcoming
pack, including company and pension booklets.
'We could use an electronic form, completed by the person's local pensions
contact, to create the record and print the letter automatically,' says Nick
Burnard. 'A secretary could then put together the welcoming pack.'
Confidentiality and security are controlled by checks on the author of each
request form. Pensions contacts can search the database using many keywords,
such as name, birth date and National Insurance number, but their own
identification determines the records they can inspect.
Nick Burnard says filling in electronic forms to get at the database is far
easier than learning Gupta's more traditional database access languages.
'We have introduced Gupta's Quest language to some of the central end-users
and, although it's a good product, they have trouble understanding the
formal database structures,' he says.
However, ease-of-use was not the only reason for installing Notes. The
department also wanted to put unstructured or semi-structured information
on-line.
The full text of the Inland Revenue's book of regulations has been loaded
into Notes (the Inland Revenue supplies it on disc as a computer file, as
well as in an A4 binder). Nick Burnard says Lawson Mardon's legal and
pensions specialists have 'translated the relevant sections into English'
and these translations, too, have been loaded into Notes. In addition, the
company's own case histories have been loaded.
All these regulations and case histories can be indexed and cross-referenced
in many different ways - 'this all means that less-experienced people can
deal with more queries without consulting senior specialists, who can make
better use of their time,' Mr Burnard says.
Leaflets from the Department of Social Security are also stored. These are
entered using a hand-operated scanner.
The pensions unit is considering scanning on a larger scale so that
documents such as letters from pension fund members can be entered and
accessed electronically.
The bulletin board or conference facilities of Notes are used, to enable the
various sites to learn from each others' experiences.
'The local contacts used to meet infrequently to discuss issues but now they
can go on-line to the discussion database at any time,' says Nick Burnard.
'This is of particular benefit to the smaller operations, where certain
circumstances might only come up very occasionally. They can send a request
for help to the discussion database and draw on the experience of the larger
operations, where such cases crop up more often. This is turning out to be
quite a lively forum, because people are being helpful and responding very
well.'
Automation has brought significant increases in productivity, which are
reflected in improved and faster service, rather than job cuts - 'the staff
can handle more pension scheme members and more complicated enquiries,' he
says. 'The senior people are finding time for research work: for example
they are looking at the quality of the data and at the company's payroll
systems.'
Taking on a work group and conference package like Notes to do database
enquiries demanded some lateral thinking. After all, the administration
system was developed using Gupta products and Gupta could provide its own
enquiry languages - 'if we had only been running the administration system
and not had the unstructured information and the discussion database we
might have done things a different way - but even then I'm not so sure,'
Nick Burnard says. 'We can certainly knock-up enquiry forms very quickly
with Notes.'

(19): Experience is more valuable than documentation - Consultant's Critique
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The information that people write down tends to be that which is easy to
structure. It is often obvious. Anyone who has tried to write a procedures
manual for any job soon finds that it is easy to describe which forms are
filled in but much harder to describe how to acquire the information to do
so.
Lawson Mardon's use of Lotus Notes has the ability to capture experience.
The conversations that occur on the system provide a knowledge base that
would be hard to obtain in any other way.
Anyone joining the company can read how other people have handled particular
cases. In addition, they can pick the brains of more experienced staff
without having to interrupt them. The effect of interruptions on work flow
should not be under-estimated.
This unstructured collection of experiences can be periodically edited and
organised. It is usually essential to do so to save staff the effort of
trawling through the originals.
In many electronic mail systems, there is a frequently-asked questions file.
This encapsulates replies to the most common queries and forms a useful
starting point for any newcomer.
Another benefit from the system is the audit trail that Lotus Notes
provides. It tracks all the transactions including errors and subsequent
corrections. This forms an invaluable basis for quality programmes and
possible BS5750 certification.
I was pleased to see the mix of technologies used. Far too many systems
expect clerks to become database programmers.
While a database language carries power, it also requires different
disciplines from those in common use. The use of forms via Lotus Notes gives
users a metaphor they are familiar with.
Lessons from this study are:
There are enormous benefits in capturing experience and making it available
to newcomers.
Electronic mail messages become a valuable audit trail.
Most people are not programmers.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Business Briefing
(15): The groupware revolution - Era of the 'empowered team' - Groupware
could redeem the broken promises of 1980s office automation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago we were being promised the prospect of a paperless office. So
much for that: 10 years later various survey reports (supplied on paper)
show that 10,000 filing cabinets are delivered to UK offices every day, only
five per cent of business documents are held on computers and that people
spend four to six weeks a year looking for the other 95 per cent. Spending
on office automation increased seven-fold between 1980 and 1990, yet office
productivity rose by a meagre one per cent.
Enter groupware, an ill-defined set of software packages which will
nonetheless generate a market worth Dollars 2.5bn in products, consultancy
and training in Europe and the US this year, according to a 300-page report
on this market by research firm Ovum.
Groupware has evolved from electronic mail and from the 1980s attempts at
office automation to support office workers at all levels. Whereas early
office automation focused on word processing, groupware aims to help people
work together through communication with each other and through access to
shared information, whether they are processing invoices, involved in a
major engineering project or discussing corporate strategy.
Several related types of products have been identified as lining up under
the groupware banner. Communication with or through a shared system, for
example electronic mail, is fundamental to all applications. As the Ovum
report puts it: 'E-mail is the mother of groupware.'
The automatic storage and retrieval of document images by any number of
people at the same time is a desirable part of many applications: incoming
correspondence, forms, drawings and other documents which cannot be keyed in
through word processor systems are scanned in to be held on disc and called
to a screen in seconds rather than hunted down in a filing cabinet or on
someone's desk.
Work flow management software, a late 1980s development of document image
processing, usually refers to systems which manage document handling tasks
carried out by clerical staff. Case studies in this issue of Software At
Work show how work flow management can transform the way whole departments
work, bringing big increases in efficiency and making work more interesting.
Features variously described as information sharing, electronic conferencing
and task management also fall under the groupware heading. At the simplest
level there are bulletin board systems, which allow users to leave comments
and queries for inspection and response by others.
A development of this is the production of a document such as a corporate
strategy, possibly controlled by one or two people, to which others can add
their comments. Our Unipart case study (see page 14) shows how this can be
taken even further to become a key part in the management of big projects.
Other software in the broad category of groupware includes specialist
products such as shared diaries and meetings schedulers.
The Software At Work case studies reveal almost unbounded enthusiasm for
groupware among users who in some cases are pushing such products to their
limits, running widely differing applications from the same product.
Software packages starting at less than Pounds 400 are forming the basis for
the entire way some companies are organised and work.
'The enthusiasts are fervently committed to the idea that groupware offers
an entirely new and even revolutionary approach to IT support for
white-collar work,' says Ms Rose Lockwood, senior consultant at Ovum. 'At
the other extreme, sceptics believe groupware is little more than a
marketing strategy for a motley collection of products which are being
repositioned by software vendors.' But she adds, 'We believe the enthusiasts
are nearer the mark.'
The research firm, Business Intelligence, which is also producing a hefty
report on introducing and using groupware, says the combination of products
covers the four main tasks that people perform in offices: finding
information, using information, communicating with others and attending
meetings. Groupware in the form of e-mail and conferencing eliminates the
frustration and time wasting of trying to contact someone by telephone when
the person is out or not answering or engaged. Document image processing,
work flow management and conferencing enable people to discuss issues when
convenient to them individually and without attending meetings. As our case
studies show, groupware can cut the number of meetings and make those which
are actually held more productive. Communications and access to documents
improve the ability to use information. As Business Intelligence director Mr
Ian Meiklejohn puts it: 'Stand-alone PCs provide useful tools such as
spreadsheets and word processing packages, but a significant amount of
management work involves input from several sources. The ability to share
the document and work with it in a team is a considerable benefit over the
benefits delivered by stand-alone PCs.'
There are great hopes that while the office automation systems of the early
1980s failed to live up to their full promise, suppliers and users will get
it right with groupware. This confidence stems from two developments. First,
the technology is now relatively cheap, offers good performance and is
widely used by people of all levels. Personal computer systems are quite
attractive to users these days and high-capacity communications through the
emerging ISDN digital services means pictures, voice and video can be
transmitted from one screen to another.
Indeed, Mr John Williams, UK work flow marketing manager at Digital
Equipment, believes that 'there is probably enough technology on our desks
already to support everything we want to do.'
Ian Meiklejohn at Business Intelligence backs this view by pointing to
surveys which show that more personal computers will be attached to networks
this year than were installed in 1989. Research firm IDC says the number of
electronic mailboxes on public systems will grow from 4.9m in 1991 to a
massive 38m in 1996.
The conclusion is that many individual users are ready for groupware, both
psychologically and technically.
The second reason for the confidence in groupware is that it fits in with
the way businesses are re-organising themselves - 'it is clear that the
empowered team is becoming a much more important part of the corporation,'
says Ian Meiklejohn. He defines an empowered team as one which has the
authority to make decisions to achieve a given task - 'if empowered teams
are to work effectively they must have much better tools for sharing and
using information,' he says. 'Groupware provides that set of tools.'
This issue leads to a note of caution from Mr Meiklejohn and others -
'groupware could fail to deliver productivity improvements unless it is
accompanied by a critical approach to business re-engineering,' he adds.
'It's not that groupware makes business re-engineering possible, although it
certainly helps, but rather that unless business processes are rethought,
groupware may deliver no more than mini- and mainframe-based office
automation has done in the past.'
Rose Lockwood at Ovum agrees and adds that any expansion of local area
networks should now be done with groupware in mind: 'Many users have
implemented groupware in an ad hoc way, leaving most decisions about what
systems are developed and how they are administered up to end-users. This is
dangerous and likely to lead to the same kind of dysfunctions that have
dogged the desk-top world for a decade.'

(16): It's not science fiction - Groupware product devolopment / Pounds 13m
'awareness campaign' launched in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 13m programme aimed at both developing groupware products and
spreading awareness among UK businesses was launched by the Department of
Trade and Industry last month, reports John Kavanagh.
The DTI believes the computer-supported co-operative working programme will
develop 'the next generation of IT after groupware.'
Eight projects involving 40 information technology companies, user-companies
and universities will receive government funding of Pounds 5.7m over the
next three years through the DTI and the Science and Engineering Research
Council. Participants will put in at least equal funds.
The projects range from the evolution of existing products to the realms of
virtual reality. The UK work flow software specialist, Staffware, is leading
a Pounds 1m project involving Balfour Beatty, BP, Grand Metropolitan,
Pfizer, Brunel University and Imperial College.
This project will develop Staffware's product to enable it to show members
of a team how a document they are working on has changed and explain the
context in which the changes have been made.
The system will also include an 'intelligent agenda', which will help
individuals determine priorities and suggest what they should and should not
do.
'The aim is to provide some of the clarity and immediacy of a meeting or
telephone call without forcing people to fit their schedules around the
needs of others,' says Staffware's technical director, Mr Jon Pyke.
Digital Equipment is working with National Westminster Bank, Lancaster
University and management science specialist Syncho to look at support for
group working in retail banking, taking into account changing work practices
and emphasis on customer service.
Other teams are developing systems to support group working in areas ranging
from boardroom decision making to planning big engineering projects.
Virtual reality appears in a Pounds 3m project led by BT and bringing
together nine organisations. One pilot system will enable specialists at
different sites to 'visit' factories without leaving their offices, to work
with others on production problems.
The other pilot will create a virtual reality fashion catwalk and enable
designers and buyers to discuss and change garments and transmit the final
designs to manufacturer. Such projects are not science fiction but have
commercial aims. Jon Pyke at Staffware says his project will produce
facilities that his company's customers have been asking for.
The Pounds 250,000 that Staffware is receiving amounts to 40 per cent of its
investment in the development.
Details of the development programme are available from Garth Shephard,
telephone (0438) 718528 or 071-215 1311.
The first main awareness event is a conference entitled 'The Virtual
Corporation,' in central London on May 10-11.
Details are available on 081-541 5040.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control
Systems (14): A global view of finance - Consolidation in financial services
/ Information on financial market changes is Knight-Ridder's main commodity,
but fluctuation was less welcome in-house, when it came to consolidating
international accounts. A multi-dimensional spreadsheet was the answer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For Allan Richardson, chief financial officer at Knight-Ridder
Financial/Europe, based in London's Fleet Street, the problem of controlling
five finance departments across the continent held few fears. He had already
dealt with the same issues in previous posts in multinational organisations,
and had clear ideas of what was needed.
'What you really want is something like a spreadsheet, which allows
accountants to look at what they want, wherever it is held, and in whatever
format suits them,' he says.
Knight-Ridder Europe is part of the Dollars 2.3bn US-owned multinational,
provider of financial information and services to the European commodities
and financial services market. Its own product is information: news,
reports, and analysis of foreign exchange fluctuations, and international
commodities pricing.
However, the mechanisms Knight-Ridder had in place to handle its own
financial reporting were, in Richardson's view, too reliant on spreadsheets.
These involved the writing of macros, (inbuilt programs written to suit
specific needs), frequent re-keying of data, and unwieldy models which made
global budgeting in particular very clumsy.
Mr Richardson's main objection to spreadsheets as a tool for control is that
the data is tied to the specific spreadsheet structure - 'if you change one,
you change the other. What we want is to change the spreadsheet without
affecting the underlying data,' he says.
No spreadsheet assessed by Knight-Ridder, including Excel and Lotus 123,
could get round this problem. Lotus Improv was a single-user,
single-currency tool, not sophisticated enough for Knight-Ridder's purposes.
Extracting data from the mainframe to a PC was too cumbersome, and didn't
meet the demand for dynamic data. The data had to be live, and real, not a
'frozen copy' of centrally-held information. This requirement led to an
evaluation of various executive information systems (EIS), including EPS,
Comshare, Express and Essbase.
The company decided that it needed a multi-user client-server system, which
would provide easy access through a graphical user interface, and access (by
name, such as 'sales') to any available data item. The eventual choice,
based on its ability to handle changes efficiently, was Essbase, running on
an HP3000 mainframe supporting a Novell network of 486 and 386 PCs. The
entire installation, excluding an 'extra,' the currency conversion package,
was around Pounds 40,000.
Essbase, from Arbor software, is described variously as a a
multi-dimensional analysis tool, a decision-support system, executive
information system, and spreadsheet. Its attraction was that it could be
addressed by end users through the familiar medium of their Lotus or
Microsoft spreadsheets.
'What Essbase does is to download transactional data, from invoicing,
general ledger or any other source and mix it with other data,' he says. 'It
allows me to first define the structure, then define the report and cut and
dice the data any way we wish to see it. Forecasting is a different job
again, but with this, rather than creating a new set of figures, we can have
actual, budget, and forecast: rather like playing 3D chess.'
Multi-dimensional analysis provides a familiar spreadsheet 'look and feel,'
to Knight-Ridder's 40 or so users across Europe, but is far more flexible
than spreadsheet modelling. This flexibility allows Richardson to extract
data to a level of detail that once would have demanded custom-built Cobol
programs.
He can examine the sales performance of a particular country, mapped against
target, allocate direct costs, and tell which products are making what
profit. All tailoring is being done in-house - 'you need one person who is
PC-literate and who understands accounting,' says Mr Richardson.
The main benefits have been timely information in a manageable format, using
dynamic data - 'rather than spending time writing macros, and putting data
in, it frees people's time to ask questions and look at what is actually
happening,' he comments. 'Interpretation becomes the key: it makes the job
more interesting.
Arbor Essbase
This product, the Essbase Multi-dimensional Analysis System, version 3, was
launched in October 1993. It enables workgroups of financial managers,
business analysts and product managers to simultaneously access and analyse
large amounts of corporate data consolidated from spreadsheets, relational
databases and legacy systems in a client-server environment.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control
Systems (13): Choosing from a privileged position - Financial consolidation
at ICL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, the UK-based computer company in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority
stake, had inside knowledge of the software market when looking for ways of
improving its worldwide financial control, but it didn't have all the
answers. Now its directors do - and within five days of business completion
The international computer company, ICL, is still involved in a continuing
evaluation of the packages it is using for financial control, writes Claire
Gooding. Even before its acquisition by Fujitsu, ICL was changing its
direction and becoming a supplier of computer services rather than hardware.
Even so, its restructuring into 26 businesses worldwide brought exactly the
kind of problem it seeks to solve for its own clients: a move away from
proprietary software to something less costly to maintain, and more flexible
to use, which would be a single, integrated worldwide solution.
'We were trying to resolve the problem of creating separate autonomous
businesses,' explains Cornel Wight, the strategist and manager of financial
systems whose job it was to assess ICL's financial and commercial
infrastructure across the world.
ICL wanted tools its various national offices could use to develop local
systems in their own language.
'As well as reporting to the headquarters on a monthly basis, the right
tools had to meet fiscal requirements,' says Mr Wight. 'With 80 sites around
the world, each has its own culture. We wanted a solution that would suit
their own local needs, timetable, and structure, and minimum requirements
for management reporting.'
The computer company already had its own proprietary software, but it didn't
meet the 'time zone' problems, and because it was centrally-driven, people
were deserting in droves to use spreadsheets. ICL was in a privileged
position in having inside knowledge of some well-established packages,
including executive information systems from Planning Sciences and Comshare,
and accounting packages with 'EIS-like' extensions, such as Tetra's
Chameleon.
But although ICL spread its net wide, the choice was limited by two factors:
First, the data had to be 'dynamic,' and not contained in a separate
database, so that businesses could report to the managing director on the
same day.
Secondly, the software had to work with many different 'inherited' packages
in use in various businesses and acquisitions, such as Nokia. The choice was
narrowed to two of the best-known consolidation packages, from IMRS and
Comshare.
'The key was that the IMRS packages were friendly for the account managers
and had a neat separation of the consolidation and the reporting functions.
There was also a high 'comfort factor' in working with the company, and the
user-endorsements were very convincing,' adds Mr Wight.
ICL implemented the IMRS Micro Control consolidation and reporting system
with Hyperion, its Windows-based companion, and the OnTrack graphical
reporting module.
The initial contract was worth around Pounds 1m, with installation taking
place across local area networks and PCs in ICL companies worldwide. An
in-house 'hit team' implemented the software to ICL standards and culture at
each site.
Mr Wight's team had been working for some time to reduce the completion time
for accounts - 'now, without fail, we are meeting our five-day requirement
between closing the books and reporting to group. It also facilitates
budgeting and forecasting, because people are familiar with the spreadsheet
format.
'We wanted to capitalise on the all the various models and techniques that
people had built up, without any re-keying of data. Their data is
automatically imported into Micro Control.'
It is the product's ability to present different faces to different groups
of users that most appeals to Cornel Wight's users - 'friendliness is at
appropriate levels: 'point and shoot' for managers, ledger-like for
accountants. Early users report that they are halving their costs: that's
significant when spending around Pounds 1m annually on reporting.'
Micro Control
This product, currently on release 3.5, was launched in 1987 as a DOS-based
data collection, data collection, consolidation and reporting system. Other
IMRS products are OnTrack, launched 1991, described as visual information
access, (EIS reporting), and Hyperion, launched 1993, claimed to be the the
world's first Microsoft Windows-based enterprise-wide financial control
tool.
Users: there are 1,300 corporate headquarters, with thousands of
reporting-locations worldwide.
Supplier: IMRS, founded in the US in 1981; UK operations launched in 1987.
IMRS common stock is traded in the NASDAQ National Market System under the
symbol IMRS.
Price: a corporate site licence starts at Pounds 60,000; maintenance is
charged at 15 per cent of initial sale after one year.
User views include: 'Stable,
robust software, auto-link with Lotus and Excel; integration of IMRS
databases; computer-based training; easy to install.'

FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control
Sytems (11): Window on the world - Integrated accounting in manufacturing /
For Henkel, the manufacturing group, linking existing 'islands of
automation' to create an integrated view brought the benefits of the new,
without losing the familiarity of old tools
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One problem facing Henkel, the chemicals, cosmetics and household products
group, was a good one to have: that of integrating its operations as the
group expanded.
Brand names such as Aapri, Silkience and Pritt sticks are probably more
familiar names than that of their manufacturer, Henkel. But the German-based
group is large - Dollars 8bn turnover and 140 production units - with
interests in domestic and industrial chemical products, DIY products,
including wallpaper.
In the UK, finance director Norbert Frank explains the problem: 'Different
people need to look at different things: margins achieved within a period,
manufacturing performance, yield, wastage, and so on. We had many
applications on our System 38 - all good 'island' solutions, but not
integrated.'
He wanted closer financial control, with financial systems that would link
with sales and distribution, manufacturing, production planning, and human
resources. (See 'enterprise' in buzzwords, page 4).
A complete upgrade left the coast clear for new hardware - AS400 or a Unix
computer - and a fresh start, with GUI (graphical user interface) and
Windows.
Mr Frank was convinced that he had found a state-of-the art offering in the
new R3 package from SAP, whose mainframe accounting solution R/2 had long
been in use in the German parent company.
'It combines the Windows world with the applications software,' says Mr
Frank, 'and I have not seen any other package that does that.'
The main attraction of R3 was the ease of use, and its executive information
system or EIS-like facilities.
'The benefits are the transparency and accessibility of financial data. We
can now 'drill down,' looking at an individual account balance and then
right down to a single transaction or document, but at the same time, access
is easy at the highest level, using 'drop down' windows,' he says.
Another benefit was that users did not have to abandon their Excel
spreadsheets. Users can simply choose Excel from within R/3.
Henkel has been treated very much as a pilot site for R3 in the UK. The
implementation uses a Hewlett-Packard 9890 database server and 9730
computers in a client/server configuration with PCs, and will eventually
support 250 users in the UK alone.
Mr Frank's 'anchor group' has forged a configuration that is likely to be
adopted elsewhere in the Henkel group, in the Asia Pacific operations. The
first part of the project went live in April 1993, after a six-month period
in which SAP provided a full consultancy service. This accounted for around
Pounds 500,000 worth of the Pounds 2.5 project total, with a Pounds 1m
expenditure on software, and Pounds 1m on hardware.
According to Mr Frank it has been a revelation, exciting even, to emerge
from a more limited world into an 'Open' system that can expand with the
company.
'It is not just a matter of turning on the the screen and making a better
decision. We are growing by acquisition at the rate of one a year, and now
we can easily integrate any acquired business on a Unix platform.
'Now, people are all using the same data at different levels of the
hierarchy. Decisions will be made on this data as we build up an executive
information system, which will work at different levels for users in
different areas.'
Software: SAP R/3
Product: R/3 is an integrated suite of client/server-base applications
software that covers the the entire scope of business operations, from
accounting and financial management, to manufacturing, logistics and human
resources management.
Supplier: SAP UK is a wholly owned subsidiary of SAP AG, the world's seventh
largest software company, which is publicly quoted in Germany. SAP was
founded in 1972 in Germany, and SAP UK was established in 1988. Turnover: DM
707.1m 1992, with DM123.3m profit, DM831.2m in 1991, with 127.2m profit. UK

FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control
Systems (10): Fruitful solution - User view: Financial consolidation /
Geest's efforts to expand into Europe brought about a need for more complex
consolidation than spreadsheets could provide. A consolidation package
provided the best of both worlds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Black Sigatoka, a fungal disease of fruit, rarely appears on balance sheets.
But for Geest, the fresh food importer best-known for its bananas, it has
threatened the Costa Rican crop and affected the share price.
This is just one of the challenges facing Geest, which has been expanding
over the last few years, and building its presence as a European supplier -
a strategy that has already cost Pounds 120m. Currently the group has a
turnover of Pounds 625m, and employs around 7,500 people worldwide.
Up to 1991, the process of financial consolidation used to be fairly
straightforward, involving little in the way of foreign currency with
returns only from the UK and the West Indies. Supercalc spreadsheets managed
the profit-and-loss accounts easily.
But, according to group management accountant Richard Peck, Geest's
restructuring put a strain on the process - 'as we expanded, we realised we
could not cope with the inflexibility of the spreadsheet,' he says. 'We
couldn't add new companies to the consolidation, nor extra lines to the
profit and loss accounts, and we needed to add an analysis of component
parts.'
In seeking an alternative, Geest was wanted something easy to use that it
would be able to tailor and manage in-house. It also sought an integrated
approach that would reflect its structure.
'We wanted flexibility, but we also wanted what I call 'rigidity,' so that
the reporting units couldn't change things. We wanted 'cross-checks' so that
retained profit on the profit and loss had to be the same as net profit
carried into the balance sheet,' he says. 'It was a matter of having control
over the figures.'
Geest assessed several well-known consolidation packages including IMRS'
MicroControl and Comshare's FDC.
'There was very little between them, both were rich in functions, but we
felt FDC was more user-friendly, and that we could build up our applications
more quickly, with less help from suppliers,' comments Richard Peck.
The FDC solution enabled each of Geest's business sectors, (banana, fruit,
and products) to do its own consolidation before submitting to head office.
Mr Peck adds: 'Head office can set its own reporting requirements, but the
banana sector, for example, might want to add its own information: FDC gave
us the option of adding its own database at that lower level.'
Mr Peck and his colleagues wrote their own applications with the minimum of
training, provided by Comshare as part of the Pounds 75,000 contract. Geest
also bought extra personal computers, and spent a further Pounds 10,000
extending its software to provide the basis of an executive information
system. FDC is now in use in 30 locations, including Holland, Belgium, Costa
Rica, the West Indies and Miami.
'The main benefit,' concludes Mr Peck, 'is the speed of consolidation, and
the fact that we get accurate information now, within those shorter
time-scales.
'We now run a consolidation in just over an hour instead of two of three
days. And because the data is more accurate and reliable, people have more
confidence in the figures and in making decisions on them. Communication has
also become better, because we're all looking at the same figures.'
Excel, a favoured spreadsheet in-house, still plays its part - 'the figures
are pulled straight through from FDC to Excel, which gives us standard-look
reporting and high quality presentation.'
Commander FDC
This product is a financial consolidation software system, based on local
area networks (LANs), and is PC and Windows compatible. It collects,
consolidates, analyses, forecasts, and reports on financial information.
There are 2,000 users, worldwide. Version 2.1 was launched in 1990; products
in the same family include Commander, (1986) claimed to be the world's
leading executive information system, and Commander Budget, (1993) the
PC/LAN-based budgeting system.
Supplier: Comshare International was formed in 1966 in the US, with a UK
operation launched in 1971.
Price: Pounds 40,000 for initial one-user licence for FDC; Pounds 34,000 for
25 users of Commander EIS LAN.
User views: 'User-friendly, control and support can be in-house, also good
support from vendor, useful interface with Excel.' Other comments:
'Complexity demands considerable in-house expertise. Some bespoke
programming needed (where features 'didn't do as much as expected' for one
user); 'performance can be slow over high-volume consolidation, eg 12 hours
for one annual budget.'

Systems (12): Familiarity wins affection - Spreadsheet usage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although BBC Frontline's use of the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet came about as
part of a complete software suite, financial controller Tim Sutton has no
regrets.
'Its universality means there is no need to train new staff, and it's
possible to move data between applications on a common platform,' he says.
The 140-strong publishing arm of the BBC upgraded from individual PCs to a
network, and now has several users of Lotus.
Mr Sutton's knowledge of spreadsheets means he is critical, but still
appreciative - 'Excel may be better at simplification of processes. Lotus
may be more long-winded in some respects, but people know it.'
Another user, Roger Smith at McVities, the cake and biscuit manufacturer,
agreed on all counts, including the observation that it can sometimes be a
barrier to moving to other spreadsheets. A Lotus user-site since the dawn of
the 1-2-3 spreadsheet in the early 1980s, McVities now has 300 users all
over Europe - 'everyone knows and uses it, so there is easy interchange of
data, and because it is so widespread, new staff know it,' he says.
Lotus 1-2-3
Lotus 1-2-3, release 4.01 for Windows, was launched in Sept 1993. Lotus
1-2-3 presents data in a spreadsheet form for quick and easy analysis.
Latest figures give Lotus 43 per cent of the Windows spreadsheet market.
Number of users: 20m worldwide.
Supplier: Lotus Development Corp, founded 1982 in Boston, US: Lotus UK was
founded in 1983.
Price: Pounds 365 for edition 4.01 under Windows, Pounds 79 for upgrade.
Pounds 455 for DOS release 3.4, upgrade Pounds 99. Support charges start at
Pounds 75 annually.
User views: 'Well-known, used and familiar: no training for new staff;
support can be poor, unless extra premium paid, moving of models between
packages can be clumsy, heavy memory usage, can be slow under Windows.'

Systems (8): The right choice - Accounting at the National Exhibition Centre
/ When the NEC upgraded its core financial systems, keeping the familiar
modelling and planning software running was a priority, but it also wanted
better information to feed in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The amount of paper produced by any information system is often in inverse
proportion to its usefulness. Triggered by this rule of thumb, the National
Exhibition Centre, near Birmingham, is looking at rationalising its output,
and is even experimenting with PC-supported CDs (compact discs) as a source
of financial information, rather than printed reports, writes Claire
Gooding.
The NEC is one of the largest exhibition complexes in Europe, and is still
expanding. In the last two years, the National Indoor Arena and the
International Convention Centre, ten or so miles away in the centre of
Birmingham, have been part of the growth, which has been managed without
taking on extra management staff. In 1993 the NEC had profits of Pounds
11.5m; it employs 1,100 people.
The finance department faced an all-too-common problem in attempting to
update its financial systems in a drive to improve efficiency and save
costs. Each department had its own way of reporting, and software tools it
was happy with, such as Lotus spreadsheets for internal and departmental
reports. Figures from sales, purchase, and other departments were fed by the
finance department into a highly tailored implementation of the
well-established FCS/EPS modelling package.
But 18 months ago, hardware upgrade from an ICL ME29 to an ICL DRS6000
provided an opportunity to replace Cobol-written financial systems with Open
Systems software under Unix. The NEC board chose an integrated accounting
system under Unix called Chameleon, because its design allowed for bespoke
tailoring, without sacrificing the essential support that went with the
standard package.
Its suppliers, Tetra provided on-site consultancy and 'excellent support'
for the NEC in a contract worth Pounds 290,000. Since April 1993, the
existing systems have been linked in what Barney Flint, responsible for
in-house systems development describes as 'a sort of bio-feedback loop,'
with all the systems feeding FCS, which in turn re-feeds the figures back
into Chameleon. Some of the in-house NEC enhancements have since been
adopted by Tetra as features for general release.
Speed of response, reliability, and better information have been the result
 -'the ME29 was only available to a finite number of people,' says Mr Flint,
in charge of systems development. 'Now we have 50-60 users perpetually
online, some of them miles away. We have greater control, better management,
and a lot more information: so much so that we have to rationalise it.'
Barney Flint feels the right choice was as much to do with the vendor and
the level of support as with the software itself, and adds a general
warning: 'Don't believe sales literature, sales-people, or 'the pitch.' Get
it on your desk for three months - and then make a decision.'
Software: Chameleon 2000
This product is a 1992 version of the Chameleon accounting software suite
first launched in 1987, is multi-currency, multi-lingual, provides full
financial control with management reporting and offers pan-European
functionality and the facility for integration with corporate systems.
Users: 2,500
sites in UK, 1,000 more worldwide; for the 2000 version: 120 UK sites, 60
elsewhere).
Supplier: Tetra, founded in 1979, has 10 years' experience of implementing
Open Systems (Unix-based) accounting packages.
Turnover: Pounds 12.2m in 1993, with Pounds 2.3m profit.
Price: modular - average starting price for core system (ledgers only) of
32-48 users, around Pounds 25,000. User views include 'excellent support,
good performance; consistent user-interface; inter-operability with other
packages.'

Systems (9): An end to disparate systems - Integrated control / An
integrated package can provide the route to a common source of information
for the the company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of the 260 employees at plastics manufacturer EVC compounds, 150 or so use
the Movex software installed in 1992.
'We had disparate systems, functional, but not integrated,' says Chris
Droogan, commercial services director. 'If I asked for the sales figures,
I'd get two or three answers - close, but not the same.'
The company looked at a number of specialist manufacturing packages with
financial systems as part of the solution. Swayed by the 'comfort factor' of
seeing the software operating in a sister organisation, EVC became something
of a pioneer for the AS400-based Movex software in the UK.
Now Droogan can point to a 50 per cent reduction in working capital, stock
reduced by 40 per cent, an IT budget that has been halved and an
installation managed by two IT staff. 'We can target our attention on
problems and areas of opportunity' says Droogan. 'Movex was the vehicle for
change. We are now recognised as being able to deliver a high standard of
customer service. The financial director has a better grip of financials:
the level of control, speed, and quality of information has markedly
improved.'
Movex software
Movex, a Swedish product, is an integrated information system which
addresses the needs of manufacturing companies, including those which run a
range of operations. Features are multi-lingual and multi-currency.
Supplier: Movex (UK) was formed in the UK in 1978 as a custom software house
called Acksus, specialising in manufacturing systems.
Number of users: 750 sites worldwide.
Price: Pounds 75,000 is representative; sales and support: direct from Movex
(UK), maintenance at 17 per cent. Other services available: training,
consultancy, project management, installation planning.
User views: 'Excellent support and supplier response. Continual upgrades
built into licence fee, user group monitors developments; user-friendly,
comprehensive, adaptable to different departments, user-modifiable, regular
feedback on enhancements; bespoke enhancements can be costly.'

Systems (5): Making the most of a valuable legacy - Integration: EIS
reporting / A management information system that would work across Europe
was the aim for Boots Healthcare International's financial reporting
software
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The formation of a new business unit in 1991 - Boots Healthcare
International - threw into relief a gap in management information for the
Boots Group. The newly-formed business unit deals with consumer
(over-the-counter) healthcare products, and has a turnover of Pounds 150m.
The problem was that the 'legacy' accounting systems that provided
management information to the Boots Group had no way of reflecting the
change.
'Our starting point in looking for a decision support system was the
weakness of management information for the new business,' explains John
Rycroft, head of information technology (IT) in BHI.
'Consumer healthcare products had been part of pharmaceuticals, and there
was no way of stripping out that information from systems designed before
the split.'
However, those systems, tailored versions of the MSA accounts package now
owned by Dun and Bradstreet, were still essential to day-to-day running. Nor
were there any criticisms about the accuracy or operational aspects of the
accounts; only of the reporting facilities.
'We did consider replacing the systems, but rapidly realised that we'd make
better progress by 'wrapping' them in a more flexible information system,'
explains Mr Rycroft.
A look at EISs, such as PC Express, convinced his team that an EIS could
provide the right functions, and the ease of use. Flexible, powerful
functions and the handling of large volumes of data were high on the
shopping list, but design was the critical factor, especially as the system
would have to serve the entire European BHI operation.
Boots staff already had in-house understanding of Holistic Systems' Holos
EIS software, gleaned from a sales and marketing application built four
years previously on a DEC Vax. It was this existing experience that swung
the decision in Holos' favour.
For the management system, running on a 'downsized' Hewlett Packard
Unix-based computer, BHI brought in some Holos expertise from consultants
KPMG: 'We had used them for other decision support systems, but the
partnership worked well because we wanted ideas, not just development
experience.'
John Rycroft's five-strong design team, led by project manager Phil Carter,
grew their own Holos expertise, and developed their own in-house BHI
standards for consistent design features, such as navigation round the
system. An EIS is only as good as the analysis effort that goes into it, and
Rycroft attributes the success of the project to this attention to detail.
Paul Harmer, lead designer on the team, explains the balance: 'Obviously you
need data analysis, but the design of the systems that sit above that is
critical. I've seen developers turn out gimmicky applications whose poor
design seriously impairs use.
'The senior people using the system here don't have time to explore every
facility: the systems must bring the right information up straight away.
'You need to combine power with operational simplicity, which is all down to
design. Neglect that at your peril,' he adds.
'We haven't come across anything that we need to do that we can't do in
Holos.'
John Rycroft assessed the in-house effort involved at three man-years,
costing Pounds 150,000: significantly, more than twice the Pounds 70,000
spent on the actual Holos software. The system is already live, and about to
be implemented across Europe, with a projected 300 or so users.
Typically, the 100 or so UK users are looking at such issues as brand
performance in part of a market, or across a market: for example, sales of
the Strepsils throat pastilles.
Mr Rycroft estimates there are about 71m 'cells' of information: well beyond
the reach of a spreadsheet - 'managers now have information about the
financial performance of the brand that they didn't have before: that's all
about improving the quality of decision-making,' he concludes.
Software details: Holos
This product, (current version 3.2), was launched in 1988, and combines
executive information (EIS) and decision support (DSS) in a seamless
management information system that incorportes dynamic linkes to most
relational databases and can access all types of data from PCs, mainframes
and external text retrieval services.
Supplier: Holistic Systems, founded in the UK, 1986; turnover Pounds 6m in
year ended March 1993. Price: Pounds 50,000 entry price. Sold direct in UK,
but through distributors in some European countries. Maintenance: 12 per
cent of contract value.
Hardware and operating systems: DEC Vax, DEC Alpha, Unix platforms including
IBM RS6000, Sequent, HP 9000, ICL DRS, Sun.
User views: 'Powerful software for development - handles large volumes,
links with Oracle, pro-active development of enhancements.' Also quality of
support ('much improved').

Systems (6): European perspective - EIS case study: Electronics supplier /
The size of Philips Consumer Electronics made it difficult to get an
overview that allowed managers to compare and co-ordinate operations, until
an EIS was implemented
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Picking a supplier who would be around in the long term was vital to Philips
Consumer Electronics - and so was international support. As one of Philips'
five leading product divisions with a Pounds 6bn turnover of its own, PCE
needed to overhaul its information systems in line with its European
reporting structure.
The aim was to provide a co-ordinated approach, with some local autonomy.
'The main issue was gathering information across diverse groups and
presenting it to managers so that they can make effective decisions,' says
Royston Morgan, information manager at PCE.
Problems in co-ordination were first pointed out by the colour TV business
group, which wanted to compare factory with factory using the same
yardstick. The ability to analyse differences called for an EIS, and four or
five were assessed. Pilot's Command Centre and Lightship Professional
software satisfied Morgan's demand for a product that would provide
co-ordination across Europe.
'Any application had to fit in with our infrastructure and support our
business aims, allowing us to co-ordinate centrally from the headquarters in
Eindhoven,' he says.
There are now 200 regular users of the system, and 350 or so approved users,
largely in the layers of management below director-level. Mr Morgan sees
direct bottom-line benefits after 18 months, particularly in sales and
marketing areas, but remarks that the main effort has to go into business
thinking, not programming.
'It's not a question of who can program it, but of who can understand the
business, and translate those needs into an application,' he says. 'The
analysts must understand the business in general, and be able to translate
the business needs of others.'
Software details:
Pilot Lightship
This product is a centralised client/server reporting environment. LightShip
Professional is a Windows-based graphical user interface that can access and
present data from multiple sources and formats.
Supplier: Pilot Software was founded in 1984 in the US, founding a UK

Systems (7): An aid to recovery / EIS user-view: Whitcroft - The vision that
information technology could give a company more than manual accounting
methods led to an EIS for a building and textiles conglomerate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Fishwick, group financial controller at the Winslow-based Whitecroft
building and textiles conglomerate, was anxious to escape from the 'blind
alley' brought about by two-dimensional spreadsheet models and cupboards
full of paper.
The Acuity executive information system, EIS, was chosen from a shortlist of
five, for both financial control and business management information.
An important requirement was a single-supplier agreement - 'one bottom to
kick' - with the hardware supplier, Bull, providing front-line support.
The aim was to give 'similar but different' views of data to managers in
different operational departments.
PA Consulting helped define the financial, business, and management needs,
but even so, the implementation has evolved over the 18 months it has been
in use, especially as a change in management re-focused the effort.
'The analysis never stops,' says Andrew Fishwick, who went from filing
cabinets to the computer in one step.
Once the wide area network linking with the headquarters is in operation,
data will be collected locally in Lotus spreadsheets, and even floppy discs
will be obsolete.
'We now have a standard financial reporting system that has tightened up
financial control disciplines throughout the group, particularly in terms of
cash flow management and short-term profit forecasting,' says Mr Fishwick.
'But you have to educate people out of paper. We've broken new ground using
Acuity, but it's been an investment of time, and Acuity has learned things,
too: we've helped them develop a consolidation tool for the commercial

Systems (3): From EIS to OLAP - Buzzwords
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An EIS, or executive information system, was originally conceived as a
screen-based information service geared specifically to top executives, with
easy-to-use, ready-packaged information which would provide a complete
picture of the organisation. 'Drill down' provides detail on components,
also in graphical form. 'Traffic lighting' is a technique to aid analysis,
particularly of danger-zones or by pre-determined norms or limits for
situations.
Some now interpret the acronym as 'enterprise intelligence service' as EIS
proves useful to managers further down the chain. The system sources include
information drawn from internal computer and paper-based systems. It might
also include external services, such as on-line share prices: this was once
thought of as a primary executive function, but has proved to be a
little-used option for most EIS-users. Increasingly, EIS applications are
merging with their forebears: decision support systems (DSS) and management
information systems (MIS).
The latest buzzword to describe this development is OLAP - on-line
analytical processing. This describes a multi-dimensional approach which
allows the user to draw data together from different sources and view it as
a 'cube,' which can be turned in any direction, to report on any dimension
or set of dimensions such as time periods, sales regions or product.
'Legacy' is the term used to describe inherited, working systems, often
mainframe-based. Although often used in a pejorative sense (because of the
expense of maintainance as systems age), a legacy is often valuable, and can
consist of core applications. It is not always desirable or practical to
upgrade such systems. The alternative is 'downsizing': that is moving the
applications on to a smaller computer, often a 'client-server' system of
workstations capable of working independently, but linked through a central
'server' computer for sharing of applications and data. Where legacy systems
cannot be abandoned, 'interoperability' is an option. This is often used
where there are multiple operating systems in one installation, and is eased
by using software written to be transportable ('ported') between different
operating environments. Where this is not possible, 'feeder' systems can be
especially written to give data a route between, for example, a spreadsheet
and a consolidation system.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control
Systems (4): How today's executive sees the enterprise - Evolving EIS
systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taking different views of the same data, taken from different sources, has
given suppliers of executive information systems (EIS) an inside track on
multi-dimensional analysis, writes Claire Gooding.
Driven to escape from the 'executive' niche, several EIS suppliers are
converging on the same ground: that of data consolidation. Most also have
their eyes turned to the growing client server market, where the networked
PC/workstation rules.
'We're finding managing directors are much more aware of the need to control
finances, not just report on them,' says Steve Fluin, sales director at
Comshare UK, a Dollars 100m company which claims to lead the EIS market
worldwide. 'As organisations come out of recession, executives realise they
need to be able to control pro-actively, rather than just react. They want
'intelligent facilities that tell them where to look.'
Comshare's Budget and Financial Data Control products are aimed at this
market, and the development of 'exception alerting.'
David Friend, founder of Pilot Software, is credited with the development of
'traffic lighting,' a similar early warning system built into his Lightship
software. He agrees that retrieval is the problem - 'the typical problem is
multi-dimensional, 'slice and dice' view of data by region or product,' he
says. 'There's now an enormous amount of data, but it's difficult to get the
gold out.'
His four-year redevelopment of Lightship has concentrated on being able to
deliver multi-dimensional analysis of vast volumes of data, at high speed.
EIS tools are beginning to draw on the techniques of linking and combining
data, as used in relational databases.
The ability to present different views of data - such as looking at time
periods, sales regions or product breakouts - is known as OLAP, or on-line
analytical processing.
Business intelligence
IRI Software's Simon Rigden is another believer in 'slicing, dicing and
pivoting' the data to give a specific focus. He uses the term 'business
intelligence' for IRI's Express system, rather than EIS, to emphasise the
need for an enterprise-wide view of the data.
'Having a large enterprise-wide database is of little value if end-users are
unable to synthesise necessary information from those data stores,' he says.
'Traditionally, EIS has been the domain of a small number of executives, but
it's a big problem to spread it through an organisation. Databases and their
front-end add-ons, typically based on query/report generators, or
spreadsheets, limit the way in which data can be summarised, viewed and
analysed.'
Arbor Software's Essbase claims to be one of the first to capitalise on the
client/server revolution to create multi-dimensional views for different
groups (workgroups) of users.
According to Nigel Geary, managing director of Arbor Software in the UK, the
idea is to enable users to manipulate massive amounts of data from disparate
sources without any professional IT help, filling the gap between the
expensive mainframe modelling package, and the 2-D spreadsheet - 'users can
pull out data and look at it in any form,' he says.
Arbor's plan is to make its package complementary with other software
companies, 'so that they can package it and make it the standard front-end
for consolidation.'
The first such agreement, with Comshare, has already been reached.

Systems (2): All singing from the same sheet / Business briefing - The
information you need is probably in the computer system somewhere. But how
can you get at it? Claire Gooding looks at some of the ways companies are
bringing information into line for better financial control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most computer users know that having too much information is as difficult as
not having enough. The problem is one of delivering it accurately, to the
right person, in a comprehensible format, at the point when and where it is
needed. If the first hour of any meeting is spent arguing about whose
figures are right, you probably have too many systems, and none of them
quite right.
There have been successive waves of software development: accounting
systems, management information systems, executive information systems, all
promising to be the answer to financial control. Nevertheless, companies
still have cash-flow problems, managers still wade through paper-overload,
and still re-key data from paper reports or from one computer to another
'Computer systems, and particularly the financial systems, hold vast amounts
of data. But is seems that the packages currently available make it quite
difficult to interpret and analyse the data for accounting, modelling, cash
flow control,' says John Tate, director of the London-based Tate Bramald
consultancy that researches and tracks financial software.
In 1993, Tate Bramald had more than 1,000 replies to questionnaires sent out
to all members of the Chartered Institute of Certified Accountants, asking
what they would like most to change in existing software. Reporting
facilities came top in the firing line.
Mr Tate adds: 'Typically, a computer system will hold most if not all the
key information a company needs to meet legal requirements for historic
reporting. So it's easy to see what has happened, but it's difficult if in
fact it has failed to help them manage their business today and in the
future.'
He gives cash flow forecasting as an example. Packages contain up-to-date
data on how much customers owe and suppliers are owed. Records show how
promptly they have paid or been paid, but most systems fail to pull this
together.
'An aged debtors report will give you a lovely report on when the the money
is due - theoretically,' says John Tate, 'but it won't tell you about
customers' payment habits, and how likely you are to get that cash on time.
Also, it won't combine it with similar information in the purchase ledger.
It all needs to be brought together to do a useful cash-flow.'
There is evidence to suggest that many failing companies are actually
profitable, or could be, if they had better financial control. In a cautious
recovery from recession, running out of cash through over-trading is a
constant danger. One bankruptcy can bring swathes of others in its wake: the
problems of being a small creditor of a large, slow-paying organisation, are
well-documented.
Trading in the 1990s is made even more difficult by the speed of change.
Speed of response is essential as 'Just-In-Time' manufacturing techniques
push the responsibilities for supply and demand further down the line.
Companies change hands: alliances are made and broken, as illustrated by the
recent takeover of the Rover Group by BMW, and Honda's impending divorce
from Rover.
Changing circumstances can trigger off a need for new views of existing
data. For example, the effect of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on
the brewing industry has been profound. It brought about a need for all
sorts of information that had never before been required: new information
technology mechanisms had to be swiftly put in place. Similarly, a sudden
change in European Union regulations about importing bananas has brought new
challenges for Geest, the fruit importers, (see case study, page 8).
Increasing 'globalisation' of business means that conducting business across
national borders bring further demands on information delivery. National
accounting regulations are complex enough. International consolidations are
akin to playing three-dimensional chess through a mirror.
All of this takes place at a time when computing has never been more
'personal.' The biggest investment takes place not in hardware or software
but in people and their expertise. Managers who become used to using
particular tools are loth to give them up in favour of anything new, however
'whizz-bang' they appear.
People like what they know. This was one of the constant themes from users
interviewed for this issue of Software At Work. Instead of identifying a
single market sector and looking at a range of similar applications, (such
as computer-aided design or accounting packages for PCs), the broad topic of
financial control called for a different approach.
The aim was to find out what different sorts of software packages are
available, and how adaptable they are in providing financial control.
Interviewees ranged from those concerned with the quality of the 'raw
ingredients' of financial control - such as timesheet and estimating
systems, and even asset management - to those performing international
consolidations. In between came executive information systems, and
accounting systems with EIS-like extensions.
Several of the most common grumbles were familiar IT bugbears. Agreeing on
the accuracy of data is still a problem. So is re-keying of data from one
system to another. Viewing information from different angles is a common
requirement, as is the need to work in multiple dimensions and currencies.
The inflexibility of reporting tools is exactly what has led to the
development of top-level presentation and analysis software known as
'executive information systems.' These combine sophisticated analysis with
intuitive ease of use, with features such as 'drill down,' which allow the
user to track down the sources of a high-level figure.
There is often a time-lag between the introduction of such tools in to a
company, and their actual use. In fact, the main effort in implementing an
EIS can come in the analysis phase beforehand, when people are forced to
look at what information and systems they already have, and how, why, and
where the information flows.
Large organisations with in-house skills are typically turning to management
information (MIS) or EIS systems and developing their own reporting
structures, feeding from disparate databases or spreadsheets. A similar
shift is taking place with accounting systems. Companies such as Great
Plains, Platinum, and Systems Union are opening up file structures, and
making them available to query languages (such as SQL) and reporting
products such as Forest and Trees.
Standard front-ends and complementary coupling with other packages seem to
be the way forward. IMRS' latest release of its Hyperion financial
management software features the Standard Query Language, SQL. Many popular
packages allow users to cling to familiar rafts, such as the spreadsheets
Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Excel. Their great advantage, as users confirm, is
that everyone else uses them: a lingua franca of finance. This is useful in
a world where a company runs a number of operating systems, OS, (Tate
Bramald's survey found only a quarter of installations ran only one OS,
whereas more than 30 per cent ran four or more OSs). Even so, a spreadsheet
has its limitations in two dimensional modelling, and data presentation.
PA Consulting's senior consultant Keith Robertson takes a dim view of
financial managers who are hooked on pretty graphics, and rely on standalone
PC systems to deliver them. But he believes that, while the recession slowed
technology's progress, the surviving products are of improved quality.
This brings its own dangers: business managers who become experts in their
own local software solutions, but lose their focus in their fascination with
information technology - 'conversations in sports clubs these days often
revolve around what facilities particular packages offer,' he adds. 'A
business needs to ensure it pays key staff to provide business skills,
rather than falling into the trap of becoming a workshop where staff
exchange ideas on new IT products and features.
'Nowhere is this more important than in the area of financial control, where
the bottom line has real monetary value, rather than merely being
represented by a series of various-size graphics of Big Ben in different
shades of green.'

The CMG consultancy recently discovered some scepticism among potential
users of executive information systems, EIS. In a survey undertaken jointly
with the supplier of information systems SAS Institute, CMG interviewed over
240 executives in the mortgage-lending industry. Fewer than 20 per cent of
building societies use EIS, and many had failed in their first attempt. Over
half used internal development tools. According to senior consultant Bob
Frost, 'there are very few true EIS systems around at present. Many which
purport to be EIS are merely graphical presentations of existing
information. Over the next five years we foresee a convergence of an
organisation's information delivery systems.'

FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control
Systems (1): Instant data at managers' fingertips / Comment - Financial
control demands clear presentation of data to management. Here, David Carter
looks at radical new developments in what are called 'super drill-down'
accounts packages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the need for clear data presentation, surveys among users of
accounting software consistently show poor reporting to be their greatest
source of dissatisfaction. The standard response of the industry is to offer
improved means of extracting information such as report writer packages,
output to a spreadsheet or, current flavour of the month, by bolting an EIS
(or 'executive information system') on the top.
However, a number of package designers have realised that, in the end, these
solutions lead nowhere because they do not go to the root of the problem.
The answer lies in the way the data is organised in the first place. If
users are going to achieve fast and effective reporting out of a package, it
is because the package has been designed from the ground up, with the proper
file structures in place to provide it.
Over the last year or two, a number of packages with radically new designs
have been coming on to the market, offering superb delivery of management
information. It may be some time before they are sufficiently developed to
offer all the modules and functionality of established systems, but their
arrival surely sounds the death knell for the current generation of market
leaders.
How should management information be delivered? Most managers manage by
exception - that is, they take corrective action when a situation goes out
of line. Take, for example, a clothing retailer with 1,200 product lines
falling into 15 product groups. The first facts the manager wants to see in
his monthly sales report are the total sales figures versus budget for each
group.
If sales for 11 groups are on target, that's fine: he can now forget about
them and concentrate on the task of sorting out the four under-performers.
Initially, then, the manager wants to see totals at the beginning of the
report, not at the end, and to see them at a high level such as product
group rather than individual product. Only if a product group total requires
further investigation does he need to 'drill down' and review the sales of
the individual products that make up the total to pin-point exactly what
went wrong.
The obvious advantage of this 'totals first' approach is that the volume of
data becomes so much smaller and therefore more manageable. While at the
detail level a year's sales at the clothes retailer might comprise 1,200
individual product lines and 50,000 sales transactions, at summary level
these could be summarised into 15 product groups each with 12 monthly sales
totals - a mere 180 numbers fitting comfortably into a couple of screens.
Unfortunately, instead of providing totals first and details second, most
package designers are still stuck in the mould of manual reporting systems
which give details first, totals last. The format of a typical computer
report is exactly the same as a manual daybook - a transaction listing with
the oldest transaction shown first and the most recent last, and the report
total calculated at the end.
Hence, the near universal defect of current accounting packages - that they
offer the user little or no high-level summary information and he finds
himself having to wade through floods of low level transaction data which
simply obscure the wood for the trees.
When defining the key features of a 'totals first' system, the first
observation to make is that it has to be screen-based, rather than
paper-based, with managers browsing through high level totals on screen and
printing-off low-level transaction data only when a copy is specifically
required.
Secondly, the system must offer multiple totals at all levels. So, a manager
might start by looking at total sales year-to-date for a product group, then
drill down to the total year-to-date sales for each product within that
group, then select one product and drill down to show total sales for each
individual month. The manager could then select one month and drill down to
the individual sales invoices within that month, then select an individual
invoice and display it as originally entered on to the system. This is a
one-dimensional series of views moving downward from one level to another.
But totals must be held multi-dimensionally as well because users also want
to view data 'sideways.'
The clothing retailer, for example, might want to see total sales for a
product group broken down into sales by individual store. In a similarly
multi-level, multi-dimensional way, an accountant browsing through his
general ledger might wish to see the monthly wages bill broken down by
employee type across each of the company's divisions.
Finally, and most important, all these monthly totals have to be available
instantly. Users of screen-based systems will not be prepared to sit around
and wait while the computer trawls through several thousand transaction
records and calculates a total.
There is only one way to provide instant totals, that is by storing them
on-line, having already been calculated in advance. This is the fundamental
difference between the new design and the old.
Traditional packages comprise a layer of master files beneath which is a
layer of transaction files. The new design packages interpose another layer
between the two - a multi-level, multi-dimensional layer of on-line totals
which are updated whenever a transaction is entered. I have used the term
'drill-down' when describing how these packages work.
Unfortunately, virtually all software vendors claim 'drill-down' for their
packages these days. By this, they mean the ability to trace associated
transactions throughout the files in the manner of a relational database. To
denote the quite different idea of zooming down from on-line totals one
supplier has coined the phrase 'super drill-down.'
It is important to differentiate between the two. Existing accounts packages
can be adapted to some extent to provide 'ordinary drill-down.' However,
adaptation to provide 'super drill-down' is not possible.
The only way a software vendor is going to be in a position to offer 'super
drill-down' is by a complete product rewrite. 'Super drill-down' packages
are thin on the ground. They are technically difficult to write.
In particular, it is difficult to update multiple monthly balances during
data entry without slowing down response time. Object-oriented techniques
seem to be an essential pre-requisite.
The accounts package market: products on offer
At the corporate and 'FT Top 500' companies level of the accounts package
market are Oracle Financials from Oracle Corporation and Open1 from
Financial Solutions. Oracle runs under Unix while Open1 claims 'total
flexibility across all leading servers, operating systems and client
interfaces.'
Prices of each run from Pounds 30,000 upward. A third 'super drill down'
supplier to the corporate market is Altair, whose best-known customer is the
tour operator, Owners Abroad, running a 60-user RS6000-based system under
Unix.
At the medium-size company level, Altair also offer Altair Plus, which
starts at Pounds 8,000 and competes against such products as Tetra
Chameleon, Multisoft Premier and SunAccount. Altair plus runs under Unix and
Novell, and a client-server version is due shortly which can be front-ended
by a PC running Windows 3.1.
At the smaller and medium company level, the admirable Exchequer from SBS
Financial Systems competes with Pegasus Senior, Sage Sovereign and Tetra
2000. SBS have recently released Sales and Purchase Order processing for
this package, and a full suite of modules, including multi-currency, costs
Pounds 3,995.
Finally, SBS also offer an entry-level version of Exchequer starting at
Pounds 495 which competes with Sage Financial Controller.

FT  10 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: US pressure on BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness of oil issues in the US on Tuesday night and in early New York
trading yesterday caused further tremors in the UK majors, where British
Petroleum dropped 9 1/2 to 353 1/2 p after heavy turnover of 11m shares.
Much of the selling, dealers said, emanated from the US and followed the
recent steep fall in Atlantic Richfield, regarded by oil specialists as the
leading Alaskan oil play.
Dealers added that the market was increasingly concerned over profitability
in the Alaskan oil fields. 'Every Dollars 1 fall in the oil price reduces
BP's earnings from Alaska by Pounds 100m,' said a Nomura oil analyst.
Shell gave up 2 1/2 at 696 1/2 p, unsettled by weakness in international oil
shares, while Burmah Castrol fell 7 to 811p.
Enterprise Oil held at 420p in spite of being included in a sizeable sell
programme yesterday and ahead of this morning's preliminary results.
The market has been rife for some months with stories that Enterprise may be
about to chop its dividend payment, but analysts insist the company will
maintain the payment. Talk of a sizeable rights issue is also seen as wide
of the mark, according to dealers.
ICI rose 18 to 767p in response to a press interview with Sir Denys
Henderson, the company's chief executive, and broad stock market support.
Smith New Court reiterated its buy recommendation on the shares, and dealers
said both SG Warburg and Goldman Sachs were bidding for stock.
Euro Disney improved 15 to 405p, reflecting a sharp gain in the
French-traded stock. A press report that the troubled theme park had agreed
a restructuring with banks and the Walt Disney parent company prompted
dealers to cover short positions.
Standard Chartered, one of the market's most volatile stocks in recent
weeks, lived up to its reputation, the shares racing ahead immediately
following the bank's preliminary results and the proposed share split and
then retreating to close sharply down on balance after the post-results
meeting with analysts.
The bank's profits were in the middle of the market range, but the dividend
was at the top of expectations, while there was good news in the form of a
four-for-one share split.
The good news saw Standard shares pushed up to 1208p before closer analysis
prompted a sell-off down to 1117p. They closed 37 off at 1143p on turnover
of 4.7m.
Specialists said the market was unsettled by implied growth of only 15 per
cent in the dividend, against similar prospects for other banks. Profits
estimates for 1994 were hoisted to around Pounds 500m.
Barclays tumbled 10 to 502p on keen turnover of 5.9m, with some traders
deciding that the shares were too high relative to the sector and ahead of
this morning's preliminary results.
National Westminster fell 17 to 467p on 8.6m traded and Lloyds 14 to 567p.
Merchant banks retreated in the wake of Schroders, which confirmed recent
market speculation by being dropped from the FT-SE 100 Index; the non-voters
lost 40 at 1053p.
Fears of big provisions with the figures on March 17 hit United Biscuits,
which lost 3 1/2 at 335p. Analysts are worried that it could have to find
some Pounds 50m for restructuring at Keebler, its US arm.
An unwanted line of stock hanging over Unilever saw the shares slip 19 1/2
to 1088 1/2 p.
Rolls-Royce put on 4 1/2 at 181p ahead of today's figures, with Henderson
Crosthwaite reported to have been a keen buyer. Also reporting today is TI
Group, up 8 at 434p.
Engineering group T&amp;N recorded its second highest daily turnover - 16m
shares - following the release of full-year figures in line with market
forecasts. The shares closed 2 easier at 245p.

FT  10 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAT in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries was the strongest
performer in the FT-SE 100 Index as it announced profits at the high end of
the range of analysts' forecasts. The shares were also boosted by a firm
denial that BAT was poised to launch a rights issue and closed 15 higher at
485p with 10m traded.
BAT reported a 10 per cent rise in 1993 profits and raised the dividend by 8
per cent. It also hit out at speculation that it was planning a bid for
Victoire, the insurance arm of Suez, of France, and was considering a large
rights issue for acquisition purposes.
Mr Nyren Scott Malden of BZW, the company's broker, said: 'These are very
satisfactory results indeed. The company dealt with the three main fears -
the worry of a rights issue, concern over cash flow and the state of Farmers
(BAT's US insurance arm).'
The second perceived candidate for a rights issue, Cadbury Schweppes, also
issued a denial as it published profits figures. The shares jumped 10p
initially but slipped back after analysts realised that the UK had not
participated in the profits rise. Analysts added that Cadbury had shed no
new light on the link with Dr Pepper, of the US. The shares closed unchanged
at 494p.

FT  10 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Drug hint unsettles Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo fell sharply as word leaked into the market that
arch rival Astra had announced good news on its anti-ulcer product,
offsetting recent worries about Losec's German prospects. The news hit
sentiment over Zantac, Glaxo's headline anti-ulcer drug, already suffering a
slowdown in sales growth.
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, held a conference call late on
Tuesday between Astra executives and Lehman clients. Astra said it expected
approval in the first half of this year for using Losec with an antibiotic
to combat h-pylori, the agent that causes ulcers.
The combination treatment is expected to cure, rather than merely suppress,
ulcers and analysts believe that as much as a quarter of Zantac sales could
be threatened. Astra did not say where approval would come from, but
analysts expect it to be the UK.
Last week, worries over Losec gave a fillip to Glaxo shares, which jumped to
712p. Since then, however, they have lost all their gain and yesterday
closed 14 1/2 off at 663 1/2 p.

FT  10 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bond markets continue to upset share
prices - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Favourable news on dividends and profits proved insufficient yesterday to
protect the UK stock market against another slide in US and German bond
prices towards the end of the session. With British government stocks also
turning off, the market slipped back sharply in the late afternoon to close
with a fall of 17.7 on the FT-SE 100 Index for a final reading of 3,246.7.
Equities opened firmly, encouraged by the absence of the rights issue
threatened by rumour mongers at the close of the previous session. Several
trading programmes, apparently weighed towards the buy side, also helped to
put 6 points on the Footsie within the first half-hour of official trading.
But then, as so often happens, stock index futures took a hand and London
could make no further headway.
The modest reduction in German money market rates at the Bundesbank repo
tender, while favourable to interest rate hopes, appeared to indicate that
rates in Germany will come down very slowly.
Hopes of a further reduction in UK base rates were fostered by continued
firmness in sterling, although market strategists showed no sign of changing
their view that the next rate cut will be held back until next month, when
UK consumers will be hit by higher tax and social security charges.
The flat rejection of rights issue rumours by BAT Industries was accompanied
by excellent profits and dividend news. The stock market, with interest
excitement now subsiding, is turning its attention to dividend growth
prospects, both in terms of yield comparisons between equities and bonds,
and also as an underpinning of optimism on corporate earnings.
RTZ, the base metals group, also increased the dividend payout, and several
other leading stocks responded to good profits statements. British Land
eased after announcing a Pounds 150m Eurobond issue, helping to take the
steam out of fears that the stock market is threatened by a large
fund-raising from a big name.
Until late afternoon the Footsie held fairly steady, with the loss held to
around 4 points. It was the slip in German bonds, and then in US bonds,
accompanied by a 16-point fall in the Dow Average in early trade in New
York, which proved the undoing of London stocks.
Seaq volume increased to 730.2m shares, from 676.2m on Tuesday when retail
business reached a substantial worth of Pounds 1.69bn. The FT-SE Mid 250
Index dipped by 10.1 to 3,913. But there was no sign of a bearish turn in
the market. Legal &amp; General, one of Britain's leading life and general
insurance groups, disclosed yesterday that it expects the bull market in UK
equities to continue 'well into 1995' and that, given 'the current outlook
of strong earnings growth', it expects to stay overweight in UK stocks for
the medium term.
The FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee yesterday approved the following
constituent changes. In the FT-SE 100 Index: inclusions - De la Rue, Tarmac
and NFC; exclusions - Schroders, Scottish-Hydro Electric and Anglian Water.
In the FT-SE Mid 250 and Actuaries 350: inclusions - Telegraph, Mercury
World Mining, Kleinwort, EP Investment Trust, Flextech, Berisford Int,
Burford Hldgs and AMEC; exclusions - Geest, Ashley (Laura) Hldgs, Amstrad,
Greene King, Henderson Admin Grp, Life Sciences Int and JIB Group.

FT  10 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The retreat in US and German bonds continued to exact a toll on stock index
futures, leaving the near month contract in the doldrums after early
attempts at a rally, writes Joel Kibazo.
There was a firm start to trading in the March contract on the FT-SE 100
after it opened at 3,255. But having touched 3,262, demand for the contract
petered out.
Independent traders took the lead in selling and the contract surrendered
the early gain, drifting lower over the next few hours in subdued trade.
Dealers kept an eye on bond markets and the first signs of a slide in German
and US bonds brought active selling of March. It ended at 3,237, down 12
from its previous close and about 3 points below its fair value premium of
minus 8. Volume at the official close was 13,328 lots, and good activity in
the June contract brought turnover of 2,818.
In the FT-SE Mid 250 Index on the Liffe, turnover was 351 lots as it closed
at 3,917. On the OMLX, volume in the same contract rose to 60 lots. It ended
at 3,913.
Liffe traded options had a quiet session, with volume falling to 30,633. The
FT-SE 100 option traded 12,964, while Ladbroke was the busiest stock option
with a total of 2,331 deals, followed by Argyll at 1,875 and Land Securities
at 1,818.

FT  10 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recoups fall after beige
book price news

Wall Street
US share prices ended little changed yesterday after reassuring news from
the Federal Reserve on inflation and a rally in bond prices helped the stock
market recover from early losses, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.69 at 3,853.41, well
above its low for the day of 3,829.77. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 ended a net 1.18 ahead at 467.06. The American Stock Exchange
composite was just 0.89 off on balance at 466.79 and the Nasdaq composite
0.93 firmer at 793.05.
Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 310m shares. Declines retained
a narrow lead over rises by 1,112 to 997.
As on Tuesday, the stock market took its cue from bond prices, with equities
falling from the start in the wake of early selling on the Treasury market.
By mid-morning the Dow was more than 20 points down.
Bond prices, however, bounced back into positive territory during the
afternoon following the release of the Fed's 'beige book' report on the
economy. The report contained mixed news on the economy, but the element
that the bond and stock markets focused on was inflation, and here the beige
book found 'only limited price pressures' in the economy.
The recovery in bond prices helped stocks to pick up from their lows.
Although the rally was not particularly convincing at first, the steady
rebound in bonds eventually provided enough of a lift to equities that most
were able to end the day at, or slightly above, their opening levels.
Among individual sectors, semiconductor stocks firmed notably following a
positive report on sales from the semiconductor industry association. Texas
Instruments climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 84 1/4 , Motorola added Dollars
1 3/8 at Dollars 108 and Micron Technology put on Dollars 3 at Dollars 80
3/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Intel rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 71 5/8 .
International Paper fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 71 1/2 in busy trading
after the company warned analysts to lower their first-quarter earnings
estimates.
General Instruments dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 45 3/8 on newspaper
reports that the Justice Department has requested information about the
company's dominance in its domestic market.
Boyd Gaming rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 18 1/2 after the company was chosen
as the sole operator of a Missouri riverboat casino.
Heinz slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 31, a 12-month low, after the food
group announced a 21 per cent fall in third-quarter profits to Dollars
128.6m in the wake of troubles at its Weight Watchers business.
Motor stocks continued to outperform the market as investors favoured the
sector. Chrysler added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 60 3/4 , Ford climbed
Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 65 3/8 and General Motors firmed Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 62 5/8 , all in busy trading.
Canada
Toronto stocks shook off earlier weakness and closed higher, driven by a
rebound in gold shares and continued merger-fuelled media strength.
Conglomerates, one of several sectors to reverse direction late in the day,
also finished firmer.
The TSE 300 index was finally a net 13.2 up at 4,444.4. Market volume was
heavy at 86.3m shares valued at CDollars 969m and rises led falls by 405 to
383.
An analyst said rate-related jitters are easing in spite of an
across-the-board rise in mortgage rates by Canada's major banks.
The precious metals index regained 1.91 per cent at 10,046.0. Comex gold
bounced off a three-month low on a short-covering rally, with the
most-active April issues up USDollars 2.40 at USDollars 380.10 an ounce.

FT  10 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Improved bonds trigger
bounce in Nikkei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A rebound in the government bond market encouraged late afternoon bargain
hunting by investors, which led equities to recover most of the losses they
sustained in small-lot arbitrage selling during the morning session, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average was finally marginally lower, losing 59.21 at
19,839.18 after falling to 19,665.67 and bouncing to 19,894.29.
Most investors remained inactive ahead of the March futures and options
settlements tomorrow. Foreign investors, a major force of the Nikkei's
recent rise, were absent; investment trust funds took profits as clients
cancelled their accounts.
Volume remained flat at 300m shares. The Topix index of all first section
stocks shed 10.83 at 1,605.49 and the Nikkei 300 finished 2.49 down at
295.90. Declining issues outscored advances by 615 to 393, with 169 issues
unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 2.64 at 1,329.70.
Some traders do not expect the futures settlements to trigger volatile price
movements. 'Investors seem to want to keep their shares until the March
year-end, to receive dividends,' said one broker.
Blue chip steels encountered bargain hunting. Kawasaki Steel, the most
active issue of the day, firmed Y5 to Y351 and Nippon Steel edged forward Y2
to Y344.
Profit-taking depressed high-technology shares. Hitachi receded Y5 to Y920,
NEC Y10 to Y1,010 and Sony Y30 to Y6,190.
Kajima, the leading construction company, dropped Y35 to Y918 on large-lot
selling. The company is alleged to have bribed Mr Kishiro Nakamura, the
former construction minister, who quit the Liberal Democratic Party
yesterday due to increasing scrutiny from the prosecutors and the media.
Other construction issues were also weak, with Shimizu down Y25 to Y894 and
Obayashi losing Y11 to Y672.
Financial stocks were lower on arbitrage linked selling. Industrial Bank of
Japan fell Y30 to Y3,250 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank slipped Y20 to Y1,930.
Sakura Bank, which announced it would issue Y100bn in preferred stock,
weakened Y40 to Y1,410 on fears of increased supply.
Brokers also lost ground, Nomura Securities dipping Y30 to Y2,230 and Nikko
Securities Y30 to Y1,280.
In Osaka, the OSE average was off 67.56 at 21,890.38 in volume of 98.4m
shares. Profit-taking left Aoyama Trading Y110 down at Y5,710.
Roundup
Worries about overseas markets were a depressing feature in the region.
HONG KONG saw light profit-taking, and the Hang Seng index declined 70.20 to
10,224.38 after a rise of 554 over the previous three trading days. Turnover
was weak at HKDollars 3.8bn, down from HKDollars 5bn.
Conglomerate Jardine Matheson fell HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 62.50 as a
rumour circulated that the company might drop its listing in Hong Kong.
MANILA suffered one of its heaviest falls this year, fuelled by uncertainty
over interest rates and political doubts.
The composite index dropped 130, or nearly 5 per cent, to 2,507.33.
KARACHI finished at a record high on brisk trading of financial shares
before a six-day holiday. The Stock Exchange 100-share index climbed 19.75
to 2,562.06.
SINGAPORE fell victim to fears over US interest rates, the Straits Times
Industrial index dropping 17.33 to 2,222.85 and the All Singapore index
losing 2.70 at 581.22.
AUSTRALIA found that renewed pressure on the bond market rebounded on
equities, taking prices broadly lower.
The All Ordinaries index ended 24.9 down at 2,146.8, just off its intraday
low of 2,143.5, in modest trading.
KUALA LUMPUR saw an early positive trend reversed in later trading, leaving
the Stock Exchange composite index with just a slight rise on the day of
0.13 at 1,056.43.
BOMBAY had an early rally and the BSE index closed 102.78 up at 3,847.39.
The improvement came after falls in six consecutive sessions since the
budget.
JAKARTA experienced slow trading and bearish sentiment before an annual
holiday. Overseas selling helped push the index down 6.60 to 514.57.

FT  10 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Moving ahead in Warsaw - The market is
growing up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's stock market is showing signs of maturity as local investors become
more discerning. Until now, the rush was on to buy stocks irrespective of
company results or price/earnings ratios, as many new investors entered the
market.
The apocryphal story of the elderly lady buying shares in a loss-making
company, only because they 'did not cost much', is often repeated, and
companies that have split their shares have seen additional turnover and
price gains.
But this week the trend appears to have changed as the Zywiec brewery stock
rose by 32 per cent in value on the news that Heineken, the Dutch brewer,
had decided on a Dollars 40m investment. Turnover also rose to twice the
usual value and investor interest spilled over to Okocim, the exchange's
other listed brewery. Last month Brau und Brunnen, the leading German
brewer, astounded the industry when it took 25 per cent of Okocim's stock.
That news brought little movement in the shares. Okocim's 1993 results had
been poorer than those of Zywiec and it was only after Heineken made its
announcement that the Okocim price also moved up, by 21 per cent in two
sessions.
One sobering moment this week was the stock market entry of Rafako, a boiler
maker in southern Poland, whose initial price of 1.5m zlotys exceeded the
public offer price by 25 per cent, and then only after the offer price was
raised at the last moment from 700,000 zlotys a share to 1.2m zlotys.
This is modest compared with results recently achieved by stocks such as the
notorious Bank Slaski which, in spite of a steady decline since January, is
still trading at 10 times its public offer price.
The response of Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the new minister in charge of
privatisation, has been an announcement that the disposals of the
state-owned Jelfa pharmaceuticals plant and Polifarb Wroclaw, a paint
producer, will be through the exchange, with shares going to investors
offering the highest price.
Meanwhile, continuing delays in the opening of investment accounts, without
which shares cannot be bought and sold, mean that the flow of new money into
the exchange is being slowed, thus depressing overall turnover and helping
to calm the market.

FT  10 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Swiss banks lead Zurich
equities down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fall in bond markets continued to depress bourses, writes Our Markets
Staff.
ZURICH turned weaker, continuing to take its lead from the banking sector,
and the SMI index finished 43.9 or 1.5 per cent lower at 2,858.5.
SBC, the last of the big three banks to report, shed SFr10 to SFr439 after
it said that it expected last year's record profit to be followed by good
1994 results. CS Holding was SFr10 easier at SFr439, as investors reacted to
preliminary figures which came after the market closed on Tuesday. UBS
bearers, SFr47 lower at SFr1,237, led the active list and Bank Julius Baer,
the portfolio management bank, fell SFr70 to SFr1,470.
Analysts commented that while the banks' results had proved broadly in line
with expectations, the level of dividends had left some investors
disappointed. Yesterday's selling was also attributed to the view among
foreign buyers that the shares had limited short-term potential.
Cyclicals continued to attract attention although Brown Boveri gave up an
early advance to finish SFr4 lower at SFr1,125 ahead of today's annual news
conference: some analysts expected ABB's 1993 profit to be halved by higher
taxes and restructuring costs.
Ascom bucked the trend, adding SFr70 to SFr1,340 for a cumulative two-day
rise of 12.6 per cent, after the troubled telecommunications company was
effectively put up for sale on Monday.
PARIS blamed bond market weakness as the CAC 40 index fell 16.79 to 2,199.64
in thin turnover of FFr3.53bn. Dealers thought that the Bundesbank's repo
rate cut was too meagre to advance the prospect of cuts in French, or German
key interest rates in the weeks ahead.
Dealers picked out the relatively few climbers for comment. In engineering,
Vallourec hit a year high, closing FFr22 higher at FFr297 after several buy
notes, and on investor interest in underperforming cyclicals.
Euro Disney climbed FFr2.10 to FFr36.15, reacting to the view that a
financial restructuring plan for the troubled leisure group can be agreed
before the March 31 deadline.
FRANKFURT stayed in its shallow downtrend, the Dax index falling 7.95 to
2,116.09 on the session, trying again for an afternoon lift but eventually
subsiding to an Ibis-indicated 2,118.01. Turnover fell from DM10bn to DM9bn.
Mr Edgar Benischek, head of trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said
that the gentle cut in the Bundesbank's repo rate from 5.97 to 5.94 per cent
was much as expected. However, financials reflected the fall in bond markets
and Deutsche Bank dropped DM12.50 on the session, to DM796.
Mr Benischek was encouraged, however, by the fact that the big blue chips,
which led the recovery from last week's market setback, continued to be
active: Daimler rose DM4 to DM815 as BMW dropped DM19 to DM866 on
profit-taking; Volkswagen and BASF, he said, were close to three or four
year highs.
Slightly lower down the scale, Lufthansa rose to DM192 in the post bourse,
after falling DM2.50 to DM184.50 on the session, on the prospect of a
dividend in 1994; Schering recovered DM48 to DM1,029 after last week's major
broker sell recommendations were overtaken by buying from one of the
pharmaceutical company's big supporters.
MILAN turned down in response to the poor performance of bond futures and in
technical trading relating to the end of the account. The Comit index shed
6.34 to 662.89.
BCI picked up from a weak start to finish L42 ahead at L6,308 although
analysts cautioned that the stock was unlikely to mirror the near-30 per
cent jump above the privatisation price achieved by Credito Italiano.
Credito was L19 higher on the day at L2,648.
Insurers were weak with RAS shedding L788 or 3.1 per cent to 24,820.
AMSTERDAM continued to trade a little nervously with an eye on the
performance of bonds. The AEX fell back 2.27 to 420.75.
One of the main losers was aircraft maker, Fokker, which lost Fl 2.70 to Fl
18.30 on announcement of a Fl 460m plunge into the red.
Financials were knocked by fears of climbing rates.
MADRID was lower across the board in thin trading which was halted twice by
technical problems. The general index shed 2.26 to 336.20.
In a mixed banking sector BCH shed Pta60 or 2 per cent to Pta2,870 and
Argentaria fell Pta70 at Pta6,020. Banesto edged Pta2 higher to Pta743.
Iberdrola was the weakest feature among the electrical utilities, falling
Pta15 to Pta1,045.
TEL AVIV saw more arrests for alleged share manipulation and bribe-taking
with a senior investment adviser and two brokers being detained. The latest
move in the scandal which has recently been hanging over the market took the
Mishtanim index down by 10.91, or 4.9 per cent to 210.20.
Sentiment was worsened by a dip in Israeli shares trading in New York.
ISTANBUL again suffered from poor sentiment triggered by economic and
political uncertainty and the composite index fell just over 801 to
13,705.31. Trading was dull and thin although some late buying picked the
market up from earlier lows. The fall over the past three days amounts to an
aggregate of 12 per cent.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Repo cut boosts D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark firmed across the board yesterday as the cautious lowering of
German interest rates lent support to the currency, writes Philip Gawith.
The German currency rose because the market had expected a more generous cut
in the repo rate than the three basis points - to 5.94 per cent - that the
Bundesbank allowed.
The rate move, which was followed by a Belgian rate reduction, confirmed the
downward trend of European interest rates, but underlined the cautious
approach being taken by the Bundesbank.
The US Federal Reserve's 'beige book', released yesterday afternoon,
reported little sign of rising prices and had minimal effect on the dollar.
The US currency was stronger against the yen on indications that progress
was being made in the resolution of the trade dispute with Japan.
German call money rates eased slightly after the Bundesbank added a net
DM500m funds at its weekly repo and let interest rates decline again. Call
money was quoted at 5.95/6.10 per cent, from 6.00/6.15 per cent on Tuesday.
The three basis-point cut was slightly below market consensus, but confirmed
that German rates were on a downward path. The Bundesbank allocated DM83bn
of new funds to replace DM82.5bn of pacts expiring.
The D-Mark finished at FFr3.404, from FFr3.397, against the French franc and
L988.6, from L984.3, compared to the Italian lira.
The Belgian central bank followed the German example and cut its key central
bank rate to 6.15 per cent from 6.25 per cent. The Belgian franc held steady
afterwards at BFr20.590/593 per D-Mark, but closed lower at BFr20.60, from
Tuesday's BFr20.58, in line with the general weakness of EMS currencies
against the D-Mark.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, said Belgium still
enjoyed a positive interest rate differential compared to the D-Mark bloc
currencies. He cautioned, however, that 'at some point the market is going
to call into question the extent to which Belgium can bring rates into line
given its fiscal difficulties'. He said Belgium was getting into 'marginal
territory' where further rate cuts could cause currency weakness.
The Bundesbank's small move has reduced the prospect of a rate cut when the
monetary council of the Bank of France meets today.
The dollar continued in poor health yesterday, finishing nearly a pfennig
lower in London at DM1.7070 from DM1.7155. It closed weaker in New York at
DM1.6995.
Although the release of the Johnson red book, and a speech by Fed governor
Mr John Laware, emphasising a strong growth outlook, were both
dollar-positive, they were undermined by the German rate cut. Mr Steve
Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, commented: 'News on the US is
being offset by the laggard behaviour of the German monetary authorities.'
The release of the 'beige book' - an economic summary by the 12 Federal
Reserve district banks, covering the period from mid-January to February 28
 -was eagerly awaited by a market nervous about the US inflationary outlook.
In the event, the Fed said: 'Only limited price pressures are reported -
prices of building materials, selected metals and some chemicals are said to
be rising, but prices of manufactured goods and consumer goods generally are
not experiencing upward pressure.' This quashed fears of an imminent
tightening by the Fed.
Attention will now shift to the release next week of CPI and PPI figures.
The dollar enjoyed improved fortunes against the yen, closing at Y105.835,
up from a low of Y104.80 on the day. Analysts said the firmer dollar
reflected positive developments on the trade front with Japan. It finished
in New York at Y105.665.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, provided the impetus when he
said progress had been made in the US-Japan cellular telephone dispute. 'I
am not announcing right now we have an agreement. We do not know, but we
have made progress,' Mr Kantor was reported as saying.
There were also reports of progress in the super-conductor sector. But Mr
Cunningham of UBS noted that there was 'still a long way to go'. He said
there were at least five other sectors in which the US could activate trade
sanctions under the Super 301 executive order. 'The market still needs to
see something come out of the Japanese side,' he added.
Conditions in the UK discount market were fairly tight, the overnight rate
rising to 7.5 per cent. The Bank of England provided the market with Pounds
660m of late assistance after earlier putting Pounds 604m into the system.
This compared to a revised shortage of Pounds 1.3bn.
The Bank announced that it will be providing Pounds 4.5bn to the market
today in its new twice-monthly repo. This represents a net inflow of about
Pounds 1.2bn. Analysts said the improved outcome reflected the recent
tightening of two-week rates in the cash market which made resort to the
repo facility attractive.

FT  10 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Bullion bounces from three-month
low - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The GOLD price touched a fresh three-month low in London yesterday before
bouncing in line with a steadying New York market. US prices had opened
lower and at the afternoon fix the London price was set at Dollars 375.30 a
troy ounce. But trade buying and short covering, encouraged, traders said,
by a drop in bond and stock prices, reversed the New York trend and London
responded with a rally to Dollars 379.55 an ounce, up Dollars 3.55 on the
day.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices surrendered Tuesday's advance
after displaying an 'inability to overcome Dollars 1,920 (for three months
delivery)' that one trader suggested might be a signal for 'a downward
retracement'. Upside potential had also been dampened by a widening of the
cash discount against three months metal from Dollars 15.50 to Dollars 20.50
a tonne.
London Commodity Exchange COCOA and COFFEE futures ended their recent
uptrends as no fresh fundamental news appeared to underpin those gains.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: RTZ economist sees metal prices
remaining flat in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Average base metal prices are unlikely to be much different this year from
1993, Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ, the world's biggest mining
company, forecast yesterday.
In spite of some signs of economic recovery around the world, '1994 will not
be a particularly exciting year for metals demand', he suggested as RTZ
announced its annual results. There would certainly not be enough of an
increase in demand to reverse the flood of excess metal into stocks.
Several wild cards would continue to influence the supply and demand
balance, including net Chinese trade, the behaviour of CIS exports, and
conflicting influences on Western production.
Prices would be liable 'to fluctuate over a fairly wide range before any
clear tends become established'. But they should not drop back to the low
points reached last November.
Since then, prices have risen about 20 per cent. The rise 'was triggered,
and even sustained by investors acting largely on technical analysis of
chart patterns', Mr Crowson said. A substantial volume of funds, mainly US,
had been seeking alternative outlets to equities and bonds.
Many investment funds had a 'heads I win, tails I don't lose' attitude to
the metal markets. If prices rose, they held on in expectation of further
gains, and if they fell back, they considered metals even better bargains,
and bought.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shephard backs call for poultry
aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the UK agriculture minister, is pressing the European
Commission to allow poultry farmers in the European Union interim relief on
grain prices to make up for the loss of export subsidies as part of the deal
on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
'I don't see any reason why we shouldn't help the industry bridge the gap
between now and cereal prices coming down in the next two to three years,'
she told a House of Commons select committee of MPs yesterday.
Poultry producers receive no price support from Brussels but must buy their
grain at artificially-high European Union prices. In the past they received
export subsidies on sales outside the EU to compensate for high grain
prices.
Those export subsidies will be cut as part of the Gatt deal with the 600,000
tonnes of poultry meat eligible for the subsidy in 1993 falling to 291,000
tonnes by 2000.
In place of the subsidies, producers are pushing to be allowed to buy world
market grain to feed birds that will be exported. This will continue for
several years until EU grain prices come closer to world levels as a result
of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.
The initiative has the backing of the French and British governments and Mrs
Shephard said it was a very 'sensible' way of helping the industry.
Mrs Shephard urged producers to improve their marketing and tackle the
export market as a way of improving the 'unacceptably' wide UK trade deficit
in poultry meat which had grown from Pounds 62m in 1988 to Pounds 194m in
1992.
She was sympathetic to concerns from the industry that producers were being
burdened with tighter enforcement of EU regulations than in other countries
and acknowledged the need for a 'lighter hand'. However, she also stressed
that the British public was much more concerned about animal welfare issues
than in any other European country and the industry had to recognise that
anxiety.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Central banks 'more
adventurous' with gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KALGOORLIE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Central banks are seeking ever more adventurous and ingenious methods of
making profits from their gold hoards, according to Mr Terry Smeeton, chief
manager, foreign exchange division, at the Bank of England.
He revealed for example, at the Kalgoorlie Gold Conference, that some
central bank gold is to be used to back a new type of investment, a Euro
certificate. But it would not necessarily result in central banks releasing
gold, he said. They would be able to buy or sell certificates during their
life and 'there may be no sale of gold at the end of the day'.
A London group expert in securitisation had well-advanced plans for Euro
certificates with a life of three to five years, pricing linked to the price
of gold and an active secondary market. The securities, which might carry
interest, would be aimed at investors wanting exposure to the gold price.
The scheme would increase the liquidity of some central banks gold holdings
while avoiding sales of metal.
Mr Smeeton brushed aside accusations that central banks, by lending gold to
the market at derisory interest rates, were helping to push down the price
of one of their own major assets. He admitted that central banks had about
1,500 tonnes of gold - equivalent to several months consumption - on loan
and that 'the price might be somewhat higher' if it was not in the market.
He insisted, however, that central banks were responding to market
developments 'instigated by the mining community and encouraged by the
ingenuity of the banking community'. Also, 'the fact that some interest is
being earned on central bank gold reserves may enable a reserve manager more
easily to keep at bay those within the country who may wish to sell the
gold'.
Mr Smeeton said, however, that the UK central bank would not not take part
in the scheme; and he doubted if any other western European bank would be
involved.
He suggested that the spectre of big sales from central bank vaults,
containing 35,000 tonnes, was diminishing. The biggest holders, the US,
Switzerland and Germany, were not active in this area - Switzerland for
legal reasons and the other two countries 'probably because they are
responsible for the world's two major reserve currencies and confidence in
them is enhanced by the knowledge that respective central banks own a
substantial holding of the metal that has long served as the world's
ultimate reserve asset'.
Furthermore, while more sales from western European central banks, also big
gold holders, could not be ruled out, 'I think the long term trend will be
for the bulk of them to be retained'.
Commenting on reports that the Japanese finance ministry was to sell 90
tonnes of gold from unwanted coins, Mr Smeeton suggested the news was leaked
ahead of the sale to head off market rumours that Japan's central bank was
selling gold - which would have been much more alarming.
Delegates who contacted Japan yesterday said the refinery concerned could
handle only a few tonnes a month so the market should suffer no big
disturbance.

The first stage of the Chavimochic land sale is scheduled to take place
today. In this and subsequent auctions on 24 March and 11 April a total of
33 lots comprising 14,770 hectares will be offered to private investors,
Peruvian and foreign. The minimum purchase is 100 hectares and the average
price per hectare is Dollars 1,450. Buyers are guaranteed supply of 10,000
cubic metres of water per hectare per year - they will pay around Dollars
220 per hectare to the private company charged with supplying water and

FT  10 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru's blossoming desert goes
on the market - Irrigation is filling the only gap in an otherwise perfect
climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strange sight greets the visitor to Peru's northern coastal desert. Men
and women trudge along furrows apparently ploughed in the sand. From time to
time they pounce, burrow with their bare hands and come up with a long white
object resembling a stick. They are harvesting white asparagus.
White asparagus, unlike green, must be grown underground to avoid
photosynthesis; and the unpromising-looking desert soil of Peru's desert
coast is an ideal medium - zero precipitation means no diseases and funguses
attack plants. The cold Humboldt Pacific current keeps temperatures
exceptionally stable, ensuring a sort of permanent spring, which is perfect
for cultivation and year-round harvesting of almost any crop known to man.
All the Peruvian desert needs is irrigation, and the capital to install it.
Not surprisingly, the leaders in drip irrigation technology are the Israelis
and the Peruvians are learning fast from them.
'With the climate Peru enjoys, plus water, we have unparalleled comparative
advantages here,' says Mr Alon Lidai, local representative of Netafim, an
Israeli drip irrigation company. On a 11-hectare pilot asparagus farm,
formerly useless desert, Mr Lidai and the Peruvian owner are growing
top-quality asparagus and exporting to Germany.
The ultimate in high-tech irrigation costs Dollars 2,800 a hectare
installed. Annual costs, including water, labour and fertilisers (large
quantities are required on this poor soil) are around Dollars 5,000 leaving
a good Dollars 7,000 a hectare profit - very substantial for a Peruvian
farmer.
Now a first 14,770-hectare lot of newly, irrigated desert land, is coming on
to the commercial market. The Peruvian government, through the national
development institute, Inade, is selling off to private investors the lands
within the initial ambit of the vast Chavimochic irrigation scheme.
'It's the first time in over 25 years - since General Velasco's 'land
reform' - that it's possible to buy large extensions of land,' says Mr
Rodolfo Masuda, Peru's vice-minister for agriculture. 'The intention is to
allow the private sector, national or foreign, to bring about the
agricultural advances we need.'
The Chavimochic project - an 80-year old dream for the people who live in
the Chao, Viru, Moche and Chicama valleys near Trujillo, from which the
scheme takes its name - started to become a reality in 1987. The Santa
River, one of Peru's most bountiful, has been partially diverted, its waters
channeled through 85km of impressive canals and tunnels across the Andean
foothills.
Eventually, the Santa waters will benefit a total of 133,000 hectares
(bringing 59,000 new hectares into production and supplying another 74,000
with permanent water).
Under the philosophy of the Fujimori government - ironically the extreme
opposite of the preceding Garcia regime, which launched Chavimochic and
obtained start-up funding from the Banco do Brasil - the state has no role
in productive activity. It will sell off the modern, unused tomato paste
plant, originally intended to generate foreign exchange earnings to finance
the loan. It will award a concession to a private company to maintain and
operate the infrastructure of headwater intake, canals and so on. And it
will make farmers, for the first time ever, pay the 'real' cost of the
water.
Mr Masuda is relatively optimistic about sale prospects. He hopes some large
food processing consortia will buy the Chavimochic lands (they can acquire
up to 1,000 hectares), install plants and bring new technology.
They will also provide the marketing skills and contacts as yet lacking in
Peru.
The model tomato paste processing plant in the Chao valley is scheduled for
sale in April or May. It comes with 1,000 already-irrigated hectares and has
capacity to produce 21,000 tonnes of paste a year. World prices have
recently surged from around Dollars 650 a tonne to Dollars 800 or so,
raising hopes for a successful sale. Several large Japanese companies are
reported to be interested.
Apart from the area that accompanies the Chao plant, however, the
Chavimochic lands require substantial further investment. Secondary channels
must be built to run water off from the main canal, the land prepared and
high-tech irrigation equipment installed.
Costs could run between Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 6,000 a hectare, on top of
the average Dollars 1,450 base price being asked.
Sceptics say it is possible to acquire irrigated land in other Peruvian
valleys for a third of that price. Prospects for real development at
Chavimochic are likely to hinge on the big investor who has the bucks to
back the vision.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries move higher on economic
report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After a hesitant morning, US Treasuries moved decisively higher yesterday
after the Federal Reserve made reassuring comments about inflation in its
latest report on the economy.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  13/32 at 92- 9/16 , to
yield 6.834 per cent. Prices were little changed at the short end, where the
two-year note was up just  1/32 at 99 15/32 , to yield 4.893 per cent.
After firming slightly at the opening, prices eased mid-morning as investors
sold securities after news of a 0.8 per cent increase in January wholesale
sales compared with a forecast of only 0.6 per cent.
Traders said the selling also reflected nervousness ahead of the midday
publication of the Fed's 'beige book' report on the economy. The market has
been sensitive to signs of resurgent inflation in recent months and analysts
feared any indication of rising prices might prompt fresh selling.
The beige book, however, turned out to be bullish for bonds. The Fed said it
had found only 'limited price pressures' in the economy. Bond prices
gradually began to recover and by late-afternoon were in positive territory.
Earlier, European bonds had ended a featureless session slightly weaker as
traders reported continued technical trading in the absence of significant
investor activity.
With market-moving news thin on the ground, traders focused on the
forthcoming release of the US beige book report and European bonds once
again took their cue from the US Treasuries market.
German government bonds ended a volatile day little changed. bunds rose
briefly after the Bundesbank's 3 basis point reduction in the minimum repo
rate, slipped as investors sold into the strength, and rose again in the
afternoon on short-covering.
Dealers reported scant investor activity and said trading was dominated by
the futures markets. On Liffe, the June bund futures contract fell by 0.02
point to 96.51.
Implied volatility on bund options on Liffe remained high after last week's
sharp increase, indicating continued nervousness and uncertainty. Throughout
the day, implied volatility on at-the-money June bund options ranged between
6.5 and 7 per cent. That compares with last Wednesday's 10 per cent peak,
but is still almost double the average level.
'Volatility is still high after last week's rise - it's lingering in the
market like an adrenalin shock,' said Mr Peter Kerger, head of futures and
options at NatWest Markets in Frankfurt. Gilts, Italian and Spanish bonds
historically have had higher volatility than bunds, and the rise in bund
volatility might indicate 'a certain volatility convergence' resulting from
international portfolio shifts between different markets, he suggests.
French bonds weakened, despite a report from the OECD stating that France
could ease short-term rates independently of Germany at little risk for
long-term yields.
On Matif, the March notional bond future fell by 0.80 points to 125.42,
though it rose by around 0.14 points in after-hours Globex trading.
Belgian bonds outperformed bunds after the Belgian central bank cut its key
central rate by 10 basis points to 6.15 per cent. The Belgian 10-year yield
gap over bunds narrowed to around 60 basis points from 64 on Tuesday, a
trader said.
UK gilts had an uneventful day, tracking other European markets higher and
then easing towards the close as players sold into the firmer market.
The June long gilt futures contract ended around 112 9/16 , down  5/32 from
Tuesday.
Ecu bonds ended little changed after the relatively smooth auction of French
five-year Ecu BTANs and 10-year Ecu OATs. France issued Ecu305m of the 5 per
cent BTANs and Ecu210m of the 6 per cent OATs. The BTANs attracted cover of
3.9 times and the OATs 4.4 times.

system

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's busiest futures exchange, is on the
verge of reorganising its management structure in a move aimed at preserving
its lead in an increasingly competitive industry.
Although the CBoT is enjoying record volume, thanks to volatility in world
interest rate and foreign currency markets, exchange members have complained
of declining profits and a cumbersome committee structure that hampers
innovation and expansion. More agile exchanges like London's Liffe and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange have surpassed the CBoT in dollar value of
contracts traded, and in the amount of institutional business they attract.
Last year, the exchange asked the consultancy firm of Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton
to examine its management practices and recommend reforms. On Tuesday, the
CBoT's board of directors agreed to adopt the Booz-Allen recommendations,
subject to an April 14 vote of the full membership.
Booze Allen has suggested that the CBoT cut its deeply imbedded and
politically oriented system of more than 100 committees to just five,
charged with oversight of finance, strategy, audit, management, and
regulation.
It also recommended that CBoT staff be given more powers for day-to-day
management of the exchange, while the chairman and board of directors,
comprised mostly of trader-members, focus on strategy and planning for the
exchange.
Both Mr Patrick Arbor, CBoT's chairman, and Mr Thomas Donovan, its
president, have endorsed the report.

FT  10 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Convertible for British Land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A handful of borrowers ventured back into the international bond market,
testing the waters with an assortment of Eurobond and equity-linked deals,
including fairly substantial offerings from British Land and Abbey National.
British Land raised Pounds 150m through a Euroconvertible bond with a range
of special features. The bonds are undated, with a coupon of 6 per cent and
a conversion price of Pounds 5.10 per share, a premium of 23 per cent. Swiss
Bank Corporation bought the deal and is distributing it predominantly among
Swiss and other continental European investors.
British Land has the right to redeem the bonds at par after 14 years, or
after seven years if its average closing share price during the preceding 30
days has been at least 130 per cent of the conversion price.
British Land may also allow the bonds to be exchanged at any time after two
years into irredeemable convertible preference shares: there is a further
option allowing the company to exchange the convertible preference shares
back into convertible bonds.
'By going into the preference shares, the bonds are convertible into
non-equity capital, and by reversing back (into bonds) it would cease to be
non-equity capital but would enjoy the tax treatment accorded on interest,'
said Mr John Weston Smith, finance director at British Land.
He said the company had wanted to lock into undated, low interest financing.
He indicated that just over a third of the funds would be used to reduce
bank debt and the rest as part of the company's purchase programme in
association with the Quantum Fund, George Soros's hedge fund. British Land
Quantum Property Investment Fund was formed last June by British Land and Mr
Soros.
The British Land share price which had opened at Pounds 4.14, fell back to
Pounds 4.05 on the news and closed at Pounds 4.07, although SBC said the
stock had come off in line with the overall market. The bonds were launched
at par and closed at 97.00-97.50 - at fees.
The other main deal of the day was Abbey National's L250bn, 10-year issue
with a 9 per cent coupon, which is intended to have particular appeal for
retail investors in search of high-yielding paper.
The Eurolira sector of the international bond market saw a rush of activity
in January, when several borrowers launched deals with coupons in the region
of 7.7 to 7.8 per cent. Abbey National's coupon of 9 per cent is a
reflection of how much the Eurolira sector and Italian bond market have
fallen back in the recent bond market shake-up.
With a re-offer price of 99.625 per cent, the bonds yield 9.06 per cent,
according to Morgan Stanley, the joint lead manager for the deal,
substantially higher than the yields of 8.3 to 8.6 per cent available in the
secondary market.
Growing demand for bonds in Asia has prompted Moody's Investors Service, the
international credit rating agency, to set up its first regional office in
Hong Kong, ahead of its rival Standard &amp; Poor's, Reuter reports.
Edward Young, who will be director of the new Asia-Pacific office, to open
in a few months, said as Asia's private wealth continues to grow, investors
are calling for more research on fixed-interest issues launched in the
region.
The need to finance badly needed infrastructure in Asia will continue to
expand the region's debt market, he added.

PosGold Investments, part of Mr Robert de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon
group and the winner on Tuesday of an ADollars 287m (USDollars 206m) bid
battle for Aztec Mining, yesterday left open the possiblity that it could
accept an offer from Pancontinental Mining for its newly-acquired Aztec
holding.
Pancontinental was the second bidder for Aztec, offering a mixture of
ordinary shares and options, in contrast to PosGold's cash terms. When
PosGold snapped up more than three-quarters of Aztec's shares through a
stock-market raid, Pancontinental said it was withdrawing its rival bid.
It is unclear, however, whether Australian takeover rules make this
possible. Moreover, even if the Pancon offer carries a 90 per cent
acceptance condition, PosGold could be in a position to satisfy this.

<TEXT>
Grumman, which agreed on Monday to a Dollars 1.9bn cash bid from fellow
defence contractor Martin Marietta, had only recently broken off months of
merger discussions with Northrop, the California-based fighter aircraft
manufacturer, it emerged yesterday.
Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that as
late as February 25 Northrop's chief executive, Mr Kent Kresa, wrote to
Grumman saying it was prepared to submit a bid of not less than Dollars 50 a
share, if invited.
'We would also be prepared to consider an offer at a higher level, if
warranted, based on any additional information or analysis you may wish to
provide us,' the letter added.
However, on March 1 Grumman advised Northrop it was no longer interested in
pursuing talks and a week later agreed to a Dollars 55 a share cash offer
from Martin Marietta.
Northrop, in its negotiations, had said it preferred a transaction that
minimised the amount of cash involved.
The documents underline the intense discussions which have been going on
throughout the US defence industry as companies jostle for merger partners
to cushion the impact of a rapidly shrinking falling Pentagon budget.

International Paper's shares were battered Wednesday as the company quietly
began telling securities analysts that first-quarter results would be below
expectations.
The company, which had benefited through much of 1993 from price increases
in its primary product line, uncoated sheet paper, is suffering from heavy
discounting this quarter, analysts said.
Wall Street had been projecting first-quarter earnings of about 75 cents per
share for the company.
Ms Evadna Lynn, analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, said those estimates were
being adjusted to 65 to 70 cents per share.
International Paper reported earnings of Dollars 100m or 81 cents per share
in the forth quarter of 1993.
International Paper's stock fell 4 per cent, or Dollars 2 3/4 in yesterday's
trading, to Dollars 71 1/2 .
Ms Lynn estimated that prices for uncoated printing papers have dropped
Dollars 40 per ton from the fourth-quarter highs, erasing about half of the
price gains experienced during the first three quarters of 1993.
Moreover, price increases for linerboard and corregated boxes, scheduled for
this spring, have been postponed, she said.
Stocks of other paper companies fell along with International Paper
yesterday, with Georgia Pacific closing down Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 70.

<TEXT>
Australian Consolidated Press Holdings (ACP), the quoted media group in
which Mr Kerry Packer's family company, Consolidated Press, has a 45 per
cent interest, yesterday announced an 8.6 per cent drop in after-tax profits
during the six months to end-December, at ADollars 30.2m (USDollars 21.6m).
Sales revenues dipped from ADollars 212.3m to ADollars 208.5m, while
operating profits, before both interest and tax, fell from ADollars 66.7m to
ADollars 55.8m.
However, ACP said that the comparisons were distorted by some changes to
accounting policies in 1992, which bought a one-off benefit; by the sale of
the Offset Alpine business; and by the impact of start-up costs of three new
titles in Australia during the most recent half year - The New Weekly, SHE
and National Enquirer.
The latest half-year operating profit is after a ADollars 6.4m loss in
respect of these titles and their launch costs. The National Enquirer joint
venture was suspended in December, but ACP said that it was confident that
the investment in the two women's magazine titles would 'add substantial
value . . . over the longer term'.
The company added that circulation revenues in Australia had improved by
around 7 per cent, year-on-year, once the impact of new titles was excluded.
However, it acknowledged that the forecast upturn in national display
advertising had not occurred.
'Advertising revenues were flat compared to the same period of 1992. This
situation appears likely to remain unchanged for the remainder of the
current financial year,' it said. Because of this and the start-up costs,
ACP said it was unlikely it would 'significantly exceed' last year's profits
total this time round.
ACP added that it was in 'final negotiations' with bankers over a
restructuring of debt facilities, which it hopes will cut interest costs.
Year-end borrowings are forecast to be below ADollars 270m.

Moody's, the international credit rating agency, assigned a baa1 rating to
Sakura Bank's proposed Y100bn (Dollars 945m) preferred stock issue, the
first to be offered by a Japanese bank.
The bank's capital-to-assets ratio will rise by 0.5 percentage points to 9.6
per cent as a result of the issue. The bank said the increase in capital
would enable it to expand its balance sheet by increasing lending.
Moody's said its rating reflected the bank's poor asset quality and low core
profits.
The bank plans to issue 50m shares at Y2,000 per share with an offer period
between March 16 to March 22. They will be convertible into ordinary shares
from July 1 this year and September 30 1997, and unconverted stocks will be
changed into ordinary shares after October 1997.

FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Float planned for Australian
insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MMI Insurance Group, the Australian general insurer which has links to a
number of Japanese and European insurance companies including Germany's
Allianz, is coming to the stock market.
The New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures, a Australian manufacturing
industry trade association, announced yesterday that it plans to float a 55
per cent stake in the business. The shares will be offered at ADollars 3
each, capitalising the insurer at ADollars 330m (USDollars 237m). The NSW
chamber says it will retain the remaining 45 per cent interest for at least
two years.
MMI's current ownership structure dates back 80 years, to its formation in
1914 by the NSW chamber. After taking on business from non-ACM members, MMI
moved to Queensland and then became a national operation in the late-1950s.
More recently, MMI's business has diversified into property, compulsory
third party insurance and motor cover. The company has also been expanding
by acquisition; in 1986, it acquired the Australian operations of Germany's
Allianz group and in 1988, bought Sirius Insurance, which specialises in the
heavy vehicle and equipment insurance area.
After-tax profits fell from ADollars 25m to ADollars 18.4m in the year to
end-June, after a ADollars 11.6m unrealised loss on investments (ADollars
700,000 loss).
The directors now forecast a current-year after-tax profit of ADollars
28.1m. This includes an unrealised investment gain of ADollars 49.3m. This
implies that the 60.5m shares are being sold at around 10.9 times
prospective earnings. MMI managed total assets of around ADollars 3bn at
end-December.

FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Liberty Life profits surge on
record new life business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Liberty Life, South Africa's largest listed life insurer, has turned in a 24
per cent rise in earnings to 164 cents a share from 132 cents as its growing
domestic and UK insurance and property interests emerged unscathed from
recession in both countries in 1993.
Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said the year was 'undoubtedly' the most
successful the group had experienced in its 36-year history. The advance was
based largely on record new life business written by Liberty Life in South
Africa and Sun Life Assurance, the group's UK subsidiary company jointly
owned with Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), France's state-run insurance
group which is on the verge of privatisation.
Mr Gordon said the increase in new annualised recurring premiums at Liberty
Life to R750m (Dollars 215m) from R577m was the best indication of the
group's progress. Overall new business climbed by 50 per cent to R2.58bn
from R1.7bn the previous year.
Net premium income surged by nearly 45 per cent to R10.6bn from R7.36bn in
the year to end-December. A smaller increase in investment income, up at
R3.9bn from R3.62bn, left total income at R14.5bn compared with R11bn, of
which more than half derived from the group's UK businesses.
Net income rose by a quarter to R441.8m from R352.8m on which a dividend
with a scrip alternative but equivalent to 164 cents, against 132 cents in
1992, was declared last month. The consolidation of Sun Life's contribution
to group results, triggered by new accounting standards in South Africa,
transformed Liberty's balance sheet which showed total assets rising to
R86.6bn from R61.6bn.
Mr Gordon said the group's diversification into the UK shopping centre trade
was paying off with plans well advanced for the listing of Capital Shopping
Centres (CSC) in April. The group plans to raise Pounds 200m from the
flotation of CSC whose major asset is Lakeside Shopping Centre near
Thurrock, east of London.
Mr Gordon added that Liberty would like to acquire a share of the US
insurance market before his retirement as chairman in five years.

FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Pulp and paper group logs a
privatisation record - The Swedish public is to be offered a further 34% of
AssiDoman over the next 12 days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's right-centre government yesterday proclaimed a successful start to
its biggest privatisation issue to date, announcing that an offer to Swedish
and foreign institutions of a 15 per cent chunk of the forestry group
AssiDoman had been three times subscribed.
The government used the bids from institutions to set a price of SKr153 per
share for AssiDoman, valuing the company at more than SKr16bn (Dollars 2bn).
A further 34 per cent stake is to be sold to the Swedish public over the
next 12 days at a discounted price of SKr138.
In total the state should raise around SKr8bn from the sale of the 49 per
cent of AssiDoman, by some margin the largest privatisation Prime Minister
Carl Bildt's market-orientated coalition has pulled off since it came to
power in late-1991.
The previous biggest sale was the SKr2.2bn flotation last May of Celsius,
the defence group. Before that, the state sold its stake in SSAB, the steel
group. Next in line is the planned sell-off in June of the state's majority
stake in Pharmacia, the pharmaceuticals group spun off last year from
Procordia under a deal between the government and Volvo, which jointly
controlled Procordia. That should raise about SKr16bn at today's market
prices. The state's one-third stake in the petroleum retailer OK Petroleum
is also to be sold by private placement.
Mr Per Westerberg, the industry minister, says the government will have sold
35 companies by the time the general election comes around in September. 'If
we succeed with AssiDoman and Pharmacia then we will have raised very close
to SKr30bn over the three years. That is in line with our goal of an average
of SKr10bn a year and we would be very satisfied with that.'
Of the AssiDoman sale he said: 'We will have a strong new pulp and paper
group in Sweden with the financial muscle to act in the market. A strictly
commercial company that can look for partners - like Celsius and SSAB -
without political interference.'
The Swedish privatisation path has not all been smooth, however, and big
question marks remain over potential issues still to come. The opposition
Social Democratic party, which is leading in the opinion polls at present,
is firmly opposed to diluting the state's share in companies such as the
telecommunications company Telia and Vattenfall, the state power company,
which are on the coalition's list for some degree of privatisation after the
election.
The Social Democrats, indeed, were opposed to the privatisation of
AssiDoman. The company was formed at the turn of the year from the
state-owned groups Assi and Doman and will soon also take over a third
company, Ncb. This will make it Sweden's fourth largest forestry group, the
country's biggest owner of forests and the biggest producer of sawn timber.
Under the terms of the present sell-off, the state will remain a 51 per cent
stake-holder in AssiDoman. But Mr Westerberg said this was likely eventually
to slip below a majority holding.
This has angered the Social Democrats who oppose the loss of state control
over companies which they identify as being of vital interest in the control
of infrastructure and natural resources. Mr Anders Sundstrom, the Social
Democratic spokesman on industry, said yesterday his party would block any
further dilution of the state's holding in AssiDoman if it gets back into
power in September.
Mr Westerberg also came under fire over the Celsius issue which was 17 times
oversubscribed - leading to claims that the state 'lost' up to SKr2bn by
under-pricing the shares. It was partly for that reason that he opted for
the pre-bidding method to set a price for AssiDoman.
He should not run into such problems with Pharmacia, which is already listed
on the stock exchange and the privatisation of which is not opposed by the
Social Democrats. Mr Sundstrom also supports the eventual re-sale to the
private sector of Nordbanken, the biggest victim of the Swedish banking
crisis which is not now expected to be ready for privatisation until 1995.
But Mr Westerberg's intention in due course to put the two giants
Vattenfall, Europe's sixth largest electricity producer, and Telia on the
privatisation block will clearly depend on the outcome of the election. 'We
don't want to privatise Telia, Vattenfall or the forests - not even a
minority share,' said Mr Sundstrom.

FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Gambro increases earnings by 30%

<TEXT>
The weak Swedish krona helped Gambro, the Swedish medical equipment maker,
to increase its profits by 30 per cent to SKr976m (Dollars 122m) for 1993.
The improvement encouraged the group to raise its dividend by 25 per cent to
SKr5.50 per share. Earnings per share rose 29 per cent to SKr20.86.
Sales were 43 per cent higher at SKr9.05bn. The increase would have been 12
per cent if acquisitions and currency effects were excluded.
The group's renal care division benefited from strong growth in sales of
dialysis machines and disposable products, which lifted sales by an
underlying 11 per cent to SKr5.95bn.
Growth in cardiovascular surgery slowed, due to increased market
competition, but sales were still up 3 per cent, excluding currencies, at
SKr1.18bn.
The group is proposing a four-for-one share split, increasing shares in
issue to 118m from 29.5m.
BCP, the newly-formed consumer products company which is set to become an
important cash generator for Volvo, yesterday reported pro-forma profits
after financial items in the second half of 1993 of SKr711m, up from SKr552m
in the second half of 1992.
BCP was formed late last year following the break-up of Procordia, a
drugs-to-food group jointly controlled by the Swedish state and Volvo.
It includes Swedish Match and many of Sweden's best-known beverage and food
brands. It is 73.7 per cent owned by Volvo, which is bidding for the
remaining shares.
The new company showed sales in the last six months of SKr11.1bn, marginally
ahead of the SKr10.9bn in 1992.
Pro-forma full-year 1993 profits of SKr1.26bn were down from SKr1.69bn in
1992, due to divestments.
A dividend of SKr1.70 per share is to be paid for the 1993 second-half
period.

FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Rogers-Maclean Hunter deal
approval likely to be slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rogers Communications faces a long wait for Canadian regulatory approval of
its CDollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn) strategic merger with Maclean Hunter.
Both the federal Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)
and the Bureau of Competition must review the deal, as Rogers is Canada's
biggest cable-TV operator and Maclean Hunter the second largest.
Maclean Hunter also holds extensive print media interests.
Federal industry minister Mr John Manley said: 'It is by no means clear the
takeover creates unacceptable media concentration and some argue that Canada
needs the critical mass to compete with the giant US multimedia
conglomerates.'
Mr Phil Lind, vice-chairman of Rogers, said he did not expect the CRTC
decision until early 1995, and a trustee would technically run the merged
business until then. Rogers cannot complete the sale of any parts of Maclean
Hunter, such as the publishing and commercial printing units, until the CRTC
makes its decision.
In the past, the CRTC decisions have leaned towards preventing any single
company from dominating the domestic cable industry. The Competition
Bureau's position will depend heavily on the CRTC decision.
Rogers won the Maclean Hunter board's approval of its CDollars 17.50-a-share
cash offer for all the Maclean Hunter shares it does not already own. It
also got an option on 17.4m Maclean Hunter treasury shares at the same
price.
The expiry date was extended to March 31 from March 15 to allow time for the
US Federal Communications Commission to rule on Rogers' proposal to sell
Maclean Hunter's US cable licences for about CDollars 1.5bn. This was
designed to reduce Rogers' heavy debt load.
The enlarged Rogers would have 33 per cent of the total Canadian cable
subscriber base, up from 23.5 per cent before the deal.
The big US cable operator TeleCommunications has 10m subscribers.

FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sharp third-quarter fall for
Heinz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in HJ Heinz, the US food company headed by Mr Tony O'Reilly, the
Irish businessman, sank to a 12-month low yesterday as the company reported
a sharp decline in third-quarter profits.
Net income fell by 21 per cent to Dollars 128.6m in the quarter ended
January 26, on turnover down from Dollars 1.77bn to Dollars 1.71bn. The
shares fell Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 31.
One reason for the downturn in net profits was an increase in the effective
tax rate for the quarter from 34.4 per cent to 40.3 per cent. But pre-tax
profits were also badly down, by almost 13 per cent.
Heinz said a number of factors were to blame. Two profit-making companies -
the confectionery business of Heinz Italy and the Near East specialty rice
business - had been sold during the year, and the group's marketing expenses
were 19 per cent higher than in the comparable quarter.
But the biggest factor was the poor performance of the Weight Watchers
business, which draws half its revenues from diet classes and half from diet
foods. This suffered from unusually severe winter conditions in the US and
from disruption caused by the Los Angeles earthquake, both of which kept
dieters at home.
Longer-term, Weight Watchers has also been suffering from a decline in the
obsession with personal fitness that characterised the 1980s and from a
tendency among remaining weight watchers to save money in less prosperous
times by making up their own diets.
On the positive side, Heinz saw volume gains in beans, ketchup, pet foods
and food service products (bulk foods for the catering industry), but these
were partially offset by volume declines in the Weight Watchers businesses
(meetings and foods) and StarKist tuna.
Earnings per share in the third quarter fell from 62 cents to 50 cents. For
the nine months to January, turnover was up from Dollars 5.07bn to Dollars
5.1bn, net income rose from Dollars 326.6m to Dollars 473.9m, and earnings
per share rose from Dollars 1.77 to Dollars 1.84 excluding accounting
changes - though this included a gain of 24 cents a share on the sale of the
two businesses.

game role

<TEXT>
The widely-reported collaboration between Microsoft, the world's largest
computer software company, and Sega, the Japanese video game manufacturer,
now appears unlikely to create a significant role for Microsoft in video
game software.
A senior Sega USA official said that Microsoft, contrary to earlier reports,
was not developing an operating system for Saturn, the next-generation Sega
video game machine. Such reports led many industry observers to conclude
that Microsoft aimed to establish worldwide software standards in the video
game arena, just as it has in personal computer software.
However, Mr Steven Payne, director of marketing for Sega USA, the US
subsidiary of Sega responsible for the project, said that the software being
developed with Microsoft for Saturn, a high-performance video game system
under development by Sega, is not expected to include a 'fully-fledged
operating system'.
Microsoft officials said that they were precluded from discussing the
company's relationship with Sega by a non- disclosure agreement. However,
they played down the strategic significance of the relationship, noting that
Microsoft has focused and will continue to focus primarily on PC software.
'Our relationship with Microsoft is evolving and it would be premature to
say exactly what it will involve,' said Mr Payne. However, he noted that
current generation video game machines do not have an operating system;
instead, video game software developers write code that directly addresses
the microprocessor in a video game machine.
Saturn, an advanced video game machine under development by Sega, is
expected to incorporate a CD-ROM drive as well as the familiar game
cartridges. Microsoft's involvement is understood to involve a software
interface to the CD-ROM drive.

FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Toys 'R' Us expansion lifts
full-year income by 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toys 'R' Us, the US-based toy superstore group, yesterday announced its 15th
consecutive year of earnings growth with a 10 per cent increase in net
income to Dollars 483m for the year to January 29.
Fourth-quarter income also rose by 10 per cent, from Dollars 339.7m to
Dollars 374.6m. Most of Toys 'R' Us' profits come in its fourth quarter
because this includes the Christmas season.
Much of the growth was attributable to the company's continued expansion at
home and overseas. During the year, it opened 41 stores in the US and 67 in
Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain and the UK. It also opened its first
stores in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Portugal.
However, the company said it also saw good growth from its existing stores,
due to good inventory management and merchandising initiatives. Same store
sales in the US rose 6.5 per cent in the quarter and 3.3 per cent in the
year.
Total sales in the fourth quarter rose by almost 15 per cent to Dollars
3.9bn, while earnings per share rose by 11.4 per cent to Dollars 1.27. For
the year, sales were up 11 per cent at Dollars 7.9bn and earnings per share
rose by 10.8 per cent to Dollars 1.63.
In January Toys 'R' Us announced that its expansion would continue in 1994
with the opening of 45 more stores in the US and 70 stores internationally,
including the first in Scandinavia. The current tally is 581 stores in the
US and 234 internationally, plus 215 Kids 'R' Us children's clothing stores.

ratified

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ghana's parliament has unanimously ratified four agreements on the sale of
part of the government's shares in Ashanti Goldfields (AGC), Reuter reports
from Accra.
The mines and energy minister, Mr Richard Kwame Peprah, said the
ratification was the last hurdle before the sale went ahead.
The government intends to sell 5 per cent of AGC shares on the local stock
exchange and 20 per cent on the London market to raise Dollars 250m for
development projects.
AGC is currently 55 per cent state-owned, with Lonrho L, holding 45 per cent
of shares.
Seeking to allay Ghanaian fears that the sale was against the national
interest, Mr Peprah said new laws made it impossible for anyone to take a
controlling stake in a Ghanaian mining company without government approval.
The agreement states that neither Lonrho nor the government may sell any
more shares within two years and that both must undertake not to increase
their percentage holding after the flotation, he said.
Shares may be bought by institutions and individuals resident in Ghana and
other countries of the Economic Community of West African States, and by
Ghanaians living elsewhere.
Finance Minister Kwesi Botchway said part of the money from the sale would
be put into a revolving fund to promote local business and boost national
reserves.

<TEXT>
Nova, the western Canada energy and petrochemicals group, may spend up to
CDollars 500m (USDollars 368m) on acquisitions later this year after
completing its reorganisation into regulated and non-regulated businesses.
A new Nova Corporation will hold four new operating units: Nova Gas
Transmission, the regulated Alberta gas pipeline; Nova Gas Services, the
North American gas service business; Novacorp International (gas services
outside North America); and Novacor Chemical, the petrochemicals group.
The plan goes before shareholders on May 8 in Calgary, together with a
shareholder protection plan.
Nova recently bought out its 49.9 per cent partner in Pan Alberta Gas,
Canada's biggest gas exporter. This will raise annual profits by about
CDollars 6m.
The company plans aggressive expansion in gas services in North America and
overseas and total acquisitions this year could reach Dollars 500m, said
spokesman Mr Bill Rowe. A Dollars 500m equity issue was completed last
month, of which Dollars 250m is earmarked for acquisitions.
Talisman, a big gas producer, had 1993 net profit of CDollars 25.8m, or 43
cents a share, up from CDollars 11.2m, or 22 cents, in 1992.
Revenues were CDollars 339m against CDollars 196m. Gas output rose sharply
and prices were higher. A lower Canadian dollar and rising output offset
lower oil prices.

<TEXT>
Kone, the Finnish elevators group, is to sell its cranes unit to Industri
Kapital, a Scandinavian industrial investment fund, for more than FM600m
(Dollars 108.3m).
The sale is part of the group's continuing focus on core business, and
follows last year's disposal of MacGregor-Navire, the world's leading
supplier of shipboard cargo handling equipment. The deal will increase
Kone's equity-to-assets ratio to around 40 per cent
Kone Cranes is a world leader in industrial and ship-to-shore cranes, and
has 40 companies in 20 countries. It had sales of FM1.93bn in 1993, up 26
per cent, and its order book rose 12 per cent to FM1.01bn.
Industri Kapital is backed by a group of Scandinavian banks, insurance
companies and funds, and is already a significant shareholder in a number of
Nordic industrial and service companies.
Mr Bjorn Saven, Industri Kapital managing director, said Kone Cranes had 'a
leading market position in an attractive market niche where we see good
potential for further development'. He said the aim was to seek a stock
market listing for the unit.
Exact terms of the sale will be based on asset values within Kone Cranes
when the deal is finalised over the next few weeks.

Banco Espiritu Santo, one of Portugal's top four retail banks, reports a
15.2 per cent rise in net profits, to Es20.2bn (Dollars 114.9m) for 1993,
compared with 1992.
The bank is paying a dividend of Es168, up from Es161 in 1992. Net assets
grew 19 per cent to Es2,005bn.
Mr Ricardo Espiritu Santo Salgado, president, said a 22.5 per cent rise in
earnings from banking services, to Es21.9bn, had helped offset a reduction
in the margin between loans and deposits, from 4.2 per cent in 1992 to 3.8
per cent. Earnings on bank lending improved by just 2.9 per cent to
Es66.8bn.
The amount of credit extended by the bank grew 11 per cent to Es836bn.
Provisions against credit risks were increased by 12.9 per cent. Following
the issue of Dollars 100m in preference shares in New York, and Es20bn in
domestic bonds last year, the bank's debt-to-asset ratio rose from 9.2 to
10.7 per cent.

<TEXT>
Novo Nordisk, the Danish drugs and enzymes group, has increased pre-tax
profits by 11 per cent, to DKr1.86bn (Dollars 277m), for 1993, on a 14 per
cent rise in sales to DKr12.2bn.
The company said the rising yen and strong sales of growth hormone to the
Japanese market made a significant contribution to the performance.
Earnings per share increased to DKr38.01 from DKr34.12, and return on equity
was 12.7 per cent. An unchanged DKr4-a-share dividend was to be paid.
The improved turnover stemmed party from a better product mix, Novo said.
However, 40 per cent of the sales rise was attributed to Japan, to which
sales improved 43 per cent. The figure takes into account a 23 per cent
appreciation of the yen against the krone.
The share of group sales going to Japan increased to 17 per cent from 14 per
cent. Sales of human growth hormone to Japan were especially strong, the
company said.
The performance was in line with company forecasts. A year ago, Novo said
pre-tax profits would fall below the 15 per cent annual growth which the
group seeks to achieve.
For 1994, Novo expects a larger increase in pre-tax profits than last year,
assuming currencies remain stable and prices on securities markets remain
unchanged.
Health care division sales last year increased by 16 per cent to DKr8.22bn,
with insulin and diabetes care sales ahead by 11 per cent. Sales of
biopharmaceuticals products, including growth hormone, rose by 34 per cent,
and other pharmaceuticals by 30 per cent, boosted by the introduction of a
new anti-depressant in the Nordic markets.
Sales of bio-industrial products, including enzymes, were up by 8 per cent
to DKr3.34bn. Capital expenditure reached a record DKr2.39bn, where it is
expected to remain in 1994.

FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sizing up Banesto's real worth -
A look at the race for control of the bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the dust begins to settle on the Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto)
crisis, the attention of Spain's big banks has turned towards who can gain
from their old rival's problems. The competition to take a controlling stake
in Banesto is starting to warm up.
The matter should be decided early next month, provided that shareholders at
Banesto's annual general meeting on March 26 approve the new management's
plan to recapitalise Spain's fourth-largest bank. An auction of fresh equity
to the bank that bids the most should be held shortly after.
Banesto is not an obviously attractive proposition for any of the other
large banks. After the Bank of Spain intervened to replace the old
management in January, it estimated that Banesto's Pta8,000bn (Dollars
56.8bn) assets had been over-valued by Pta605bn, mostly because of an
over-rapid growth in poor loans.
However, the severity of the plan to clean up its assets, along with the
size of Banesto's market share in deposits and its large branch network,
mean that the bank which took it over could emerge as the dominant domestic
retail bank. Banesto's name remains valuable in the rural south of Spain.
Apart from the potential gains, each of Spain's large banks is frightened
that the others could steal a march on them by taking over Banesto at the
right price. 'Banesto is a big risk, but it could be a big opportunity as
well,' says a director of one of the banks.
The chance to take a controlling stake in Banesto has come through the plan
drawn up by the new management. This gives a bank prepared to hold the stake
in the medium-term - possibly for a minimum of three years - a chance to
have a dominant minority stake of at least 35 per cent.
The plan hinges on the allocation of Banesto's Pta244bn of equity reserves
to provisions against bad debts. Shareholders - including the Corsair Fund
led by J. P. Morgan, the US bank which advised Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's
former president - will also have to agree to dilute their stakes.
This would be done by a 43 per cent write-down in the par value of Banesto
shares, from Pta700 to Pta400 each, raising Pta49bn towards cleaning up
Banesto's assets. Some Pta285bn more, channelled through Spain's deposit
guarantee fund, will be contributed by Spanish banks and the Bank of Spain.
The fund would finally inject Pta180bn of fresh capital into the bank, which
would form 73 per cent of the new equity base, with the remaining Pta64bn
coming from the written-down existing capital. This 73 per cent stake will
then be sold by auction to a 'strategic buyer' from among the banks.
The fund, which is being advised on the auction by the US bank Salomon
Brothers, intends provisionally to ask for bids by April 12, with the buyer
named a week later. The buyer will then have to offer Pta32bn of the stake -
or 27 per cent of the total - at Pta400 each to existing shareholders.
Three banks are thought likely to bid: Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), which has
assets of Pta11,300bn; Santander, which has assets of Pta7,700bn; and
Argentaria, with assets of Pta10,100bn. Each is being advised by an
investment bank: respectively Merrill Lynch, S. G. Warburg, and Goldman
Sachs.
The banks have varying motives to acquire a large stake in Banesto:
Argentaria would gain branches to add to a relatively small network, which
is primarily based on the Caja Postal, the post office savings bank.
However, an Argentaria acquisition could be complicated because the
parliamentary opposition has been hostile to the idea, and it is only
recently privatised.
BBV is also weak in rural areas (outside the Basque country) where the
Banesto network is strong. Mr Emilio Ybarra, BBV chairman, insists his bank
would not simply take on Banesto to grow bigger. 'Size is not our first
concern - our strategy is concerned with profitability,' he says.
Santander has competed aggressively with other banks to gain market share in
deposits and savings products since 1989, when it broke the Spanish interest
rate 'cartel'. It could gain by selling products through both branch
networks, even if Banesto was managed separately from its retail bank.
However, two uncertainties remain. First, banks have been trying to talk
down shares - which yesterday traded at Pta743 each, well above the likely
Pta400 nominal value. 'There is no way that we would bid at Pta750 a share.
It is just not worth it,' says a director of one of the three interested
banks.
A second question is whether J. P. Morgan will attempt to block the plan on
behalf of Corsair, either by voting against it at the meeting, or
challenging it legally. The plan would dilute Corsair's 7.8 per cent equity
stake to about 2.5 per cent if it did not invest fresh money in Banesto.
Most observers expect J. P. Morgan to accede to the plan. 'Corsair's shares
have no value at the moment. It is a choice between gaining something, or
losing everything,' says one banker. Even if it does agree, there is plenty
to argue about before the fate of Banesto is decided at auction.

profits forecast

<TEXT>
Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's third-largest banking group, held out
the prospect of still higher profits this year after a 36 per cent jump in
1993 net income to SFr1.37bn (Dollars 951.4m).
'We expect an increase that will make us very happy,' Mr Georges Blum, who
became chief executive a year ago, said at SBC's annual press conference.
He forecast that a reduction in bad-loan provisions, plus higher income from
fund management and foreign banking business, would overcome the anticipated
decline in trading income from last year's exceptional level.
There was still considerable room for cost-cutting, he said. The 9.6 per
cent growth in non-personnel expenses in 1993 was too high. 'Effective cost
containment is one of our top priorities for the current year,' Mr Blum
said.
Moreover, the bank took advantage of last year's high profits to make
generous provisions for the group's troublesome loan portfolio. Mr Blum
recalled that, in the late 1980s 'mistakes were made' because of the bank's
expansive lending policy. SBC had significant exposures to several of the
biggest corporate collapses of the past few years, including, most recently,
Metallgesellschaft in Germany.
'The major share of value adjustments should be over,' he said.
Mr Blum defended the directors' decision to propose only a 14.3 per cent
rise in dividends this year, pointing out that last year's 36 per cent rise
in net income was due in large measure to the extraordinary 82 per cent jump
in profits, to SFr2.91bn, from trading and derivatives business.
Net interest income was up only 1 per cent to SFr3.1bn, reflecting depressed
business conditions in Switzerland and elsewhere.
However, he said the subscription price for new shares SBC would offer
shareholders under an optional dividend substitution scheme would be lower
than the SFr318.5 per bearer share offered last year.
Mr Marcel Ospel, head of international capital markets and treasury, said
SBC's highly-regarded financial operations and derivatives business made a
pre-tax profit of between SFr1.5bn and SFr2bn last year, and achieved a 38
per cent return on equity. Derivatives alone had an 80 per cent return.

FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Skandia proposes SKr3bn rights
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Skandia, the Swedish insurer, yesterday reported record profits for 1993 and
announced plans for a SKr3bn (Dollars 375.5m) rights issue to back
expansion.
The group said it had rebounded to an operating profit in 1993 of SKr2.01bn
 -the best in its history - from an operating loss in 1992 of SKr3.24bn.
An even more dramatic swing occured in the so-called management operating
result, which includes changes in the value of the group's bond, equity and
property portfolio. This surged to a profit of SKr4.07bn from a loss of
SKr3.72bn in 1992.
Skandia is to pay a dividend of SKr2.00 per share after suspending a payout
last year.
Details of the share issue will not be given until later this month. The
issue will lift Skandia's solvency ratio from 84 per cent at the end of 1993
to around 100 per cent.
Mr Bjorn Wolrath, chief executive, said the new capital was needed chiefly
to fund Skandia's plans to expand organically in the Nordic area.
'We have a substantial market share of non-life business in the Nordic
countries, and now we would like to increase our share in the life business
and in different savings businesses. That means setting up a lot of new
companies.'
He said Skandia wanted to strengthen its international credit rating from
the BBB status it holds to the AA rating it enjoyed in the early 1990s.
Mr Wolrath denied speculation that the rights issue was part of preparations
for acquisitions. Skandia two years ago discussed a merger with Baltica, the
Danish insurer that is now for sale. However, Mr Wolrath said the group had
'no plans for that at the moment'.
He said the results overall reflected Skandia's shift in emphasis towards
life insurance and savings products, as well as favourable movements in
financial markets.

Chez Gerard, the restaurant group which is being floated at the end of this
month, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 800,000 for the half-year to
December 26, compared with Pounds 942,000 for the previous 52 weeks.
Mr Neville Abraham, chairman and chief executive, said that both sales and
margins 'continued to move upwards' in the first three months of 1994.
The flotation of the company, whose restaurants include Bertorelli's, Cafe
Fish, Soho Soho and Chutney Mary, is expected to raise Pounds 14m-Pounds 16m
by way of a placing, which would capitalise Chez Gerard at about Pounds 22m,

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Acal seeks expansion funds and plans full
listing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Acal, the USM-traded electronics and industrial control manufacturer,
yesterday announced plans for an acquisition, a rights issue and a move to
the Official List.
The company being acquired is Sartek Holding (EAF), which distributes,
exchanges and repairs personal computer parts, mainly in the Netherlands and
north-west Germany.
Initial consideration for the proposed purchase will be Fl 18.9m (Pounds
6.6m), with further profits-related payments for the years up to December
1995 not exceeding Fl 23.5m.
To pay for the acquisition, Acal is seeking to raise Pounds 10.1m net of
expenses via a 1-for-3 rights issue at 225p per share. The balance of the
proceeds - Pounds 3.5m - will be used to reduce borrowings.
The rights issue is being underwritten by Schroders. Brokers are Albert E
Sharp.
In addition, the directors forecast that turnover and profits before tax for
the year to end-March 1994 will be not less than Pounds 76m and Pounds 3.4m
respectively, against Pounds 68.9m and Pounds 3.15m last time. A final
dividend of 4.5p is forecast, raising the total from 6.3p to 6.75p.
Acal has also applied to the Stock Exchange for its shares to be fully
listed. They rose 15p to 281p yesterday.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Glynwed rises 47% to Pounds 45.5m - Result
reflects improvement across all the group's activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recovery accelerated in 1993 at Glynwed International, the diversified
Midlands engineering group, the fortunes of which, with 70 per cent of its
sales in the UK, have tended to mirror those of the national economy.
Glynwed yesterday announced a 47 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 30.9m to Pounds 45.5m for the year to December 25. This translated
into earnings per share of 14.91p, up from 9.2p.
For the first time in three years the dividend is fully covered. With a
proposed final of 7.5p, the payment is maintained at 11.65p for the fifth
year running.
With Mr Gareth Davies, the chairman, looking forward 'to another year of
solid progress,' the market responded by pushing the shares to a year's high
of 399p, up 12p on the day.
However Mr Davies warned that in the current first half the results were
'likely to depend more on our own efforts than on any underlying improvement
in our major markets'.
Turnover rose from Pounds 908.3m to Pounds 965.8m, to produce operating
profits of Pounds 53.1m, against Pounds 43.8m.
Five of the six main operating divisions - consumer products, foundry
products, metal services, plastics, steels and engineering - increased
profits. Losses in the tubes and fittings division were reduced from Pounds
2.7m to Pounds 2.2m.
Throughout the recession, Glynwed has been bearing down hard on costs. It
reported that last year the return on capital employed climbed from 13.8 per
cent to 18.5 per cent. There was a 9 per cent increase in turnover per
employee.
Gearing fell to its lowest level since 1988 at 34.3 per cent, and it paid
Pounds 10.1m of interest compared with Pounds 12m in 1992. Net borrowings
fell to Pounds 69.8m, against a restated Pounds 102.2m.
COMMENT
Glynwed is in the position of being able to make money whatever happens to
the UK economy. It maintained a strong cashflow right through the recession.
The steady attrition of costs over recent years means that any upturn in its
markets would turn quickly into higher profits. There are signs of that
upturn and, in any case, over many of its sectors, Glynwed has been gaining
market share. Returns from a property sale have already got the year off to
an unexpectedly good start. The omens are good for pre-tax profits this year
of at least Pounds 60m. This would produce earnings per share of 19.5p,
providing the cover for an increased dividend, and give the shares a
prospective multiple of more than 20. After the dog years, it does not look
a good time to sell.

Profits at Metal Bulletin, the international business publisher, surged from

The shares reacted with a 22p rise to 380p.
Mr Trevor Tarring, chairman, said another strong performance by the metals
information division was enhanced by outstanding contributions from the
derivatives divisions and from World Textile Publications in its first year.
The 36 per cent improvement in profits, the group's sixth year of growth,
was achieved on turnover Pounds 2.6m higher at Pounds 15.3m. Earnings
emerged at 17.2p (13.2p) and a final proposed dividend of 7.1p makes a 10p

Mr Tarring said the momentum experienced throughout 1993 had continued into

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Select Appts cuts deficit to Pounds 0.64m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Select Appointments (Holdings), the USM-quoted international employment
agency, reported a reduced loss of Pounds 642,000 for 1993, on sales up 61
per cent at Pounds 35m.
The outcome was little changed from the first half when a Pounds 692,000
deficit was announced. For 1992 a deficit of Pounds 2.53m was incurred.
Mr Anthony Martin, the chairman, said that activity during 1993 had included
the opening of six new offices in the UK and acquisitions in the US, Hong
Kong and London. Some Pounds 340,000 spent on expansion has been charged
against operating profits.
Two issues of preference shares during the period raised Pounds 15m. Out of
this Pounds 7.24m debt was paid off and Pounds 2.54m was cancelled. In
December, a capital reduction was completed and Select eliminated its
deficit on reserves. At the year end the company had cash of Pounds 1.6m.
Earnings per share came to 0.83p (1.06p losses) basic and 0.63p (0.95p
losses) fully diluted.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Microvitec ends year Pounds 1.6m in the
black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Microvitec, the USM-quoted computing services company, consolidated its
return to the black in the first half and reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.6m for the year to end-December.
The result was achieved on turnover down from Pounds 49.9m to Pounds 35.2m,
of which Pounds 1.88m (Pounds 19.6m) came from discontinued operations.
The turnround from last year's Pounds 2.1m pre-tax loss was helped by the
sale of the distribution business in January 1993, leading to a considerable
reduction in group borrowings.
Mr James Bailey, executive chairman, said gearing had fallen from 87 per
cent at the end of 1992 to 48 per cent by the middle of 1993, and this level
had been maintained for the rest of the year.
This led to a reduction in the net interest charge from Pounds 837,000 to
Pounds 288,000.
Earnings per share emerged at 2.1p against previous losses of 3.4p.
Mr Bailey said the current year had started well, and the order book was
strong.
In addition, the strategic alliance with Acorn was likely to produce
annualised sales of Pounds 6m, he said.
A capital restructuring of the company is to be proposed at the AGM to
enable the directors to consider dividend payments in future years, Mr
Bailey added.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Telegraph to hold on to Canadian stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The directors of The Telegraph group, publishers of the Daily Telegraph have
decided to hold on to a 9.3 per cent stake in Southam, the Canadian
newspaper group. Hollinger, Mr Conrad Black's main corporate vehicle, which
owns 68 per cent of The Telegraph, has a direct 9.3 per cent share of
Southam as well as the Telegraph's matching stake.
The independent directors of The Telegraph had the right to require
Hollinger to buy back its Southam stake at the original purchase price of
CDollars 18.10 (Pounds 9.20) a share. The closing price of Southam on March
8 was CDollars 18.75.
The two-week repurchase option following the announcement of Southam's 1993
results has now lapsed.
Last month, the Telegraph lifted profits by 36 per cent to Pounds 60.2m
helped by overseas earnings and the sale of a stake in Trinity
International.
Nearly 20 per cent of The Telegraph's pre-tax profits come from outside the
UK.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bluebird shares take off as profits soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Bluebird Toys surged yesterday as the company reported pre-tax
profits for 1993 of Pounds 9.8m on the back of a big increase in sales.
The figure compared with Pounds 1.5m a year earlier and was ahead of
expectations. The shares, trading on the USM, closed 90p ahead at 833p after
touching 842p.
Bluebird, which is seeking a full listing for its shares, is proposing to
lift the dividend for the year from 4.5p to 16p.
Mr Torquil Norman, chairman, said the strong performance was the result of
three years of hammering overheads. Bluebird was now the only UK toy company
selling to most countries in the world.
'The order books are encouraging and we are full of confidence for 1994,' he
said.
Group turnover rose by nearly 50 per cent, from Pounds 46m to Pounds 68.9m.
Overseas sales rose from Pounds 16m to Pounds 38.8m. That represented 56 per
cent of total turnover, up from 35 per cent previously.
The sales increase mainly reflected the continuing success of the Polly
Pocket range of miniature dolls, now in its fourth year, and the
introduction of Mighty Max, a similar kind of pocket toy based on a mild
horror theme and aimed at boys. The group believes the two have a worldwide
appeal that will bring in business throughout the year.
A television series featuring Mighty Max, made by a French company, has
already been successfully shown in the US and has been acquired by the BBC.
A further series is in production.
Demand for the two toys picked up so strongly in the run-up to Christmas
that the company was unable to satisfy all outstanding orders.
During the year the group repaid its Pounds 2.5m medium term loan, and ended
the period with net cash of Pounds 5.2m, compared with net debt last time of
Pounds 3.6m.
Fully diluted earnings per share increased to 65.2p (15.4p). The group is
proposing a 4-for-1 share split in order to increase liquidity.
COMMENT
There appears to be no reason why Bluebird, rapidly establishing itself as
the UK's leading toy company, should not notch up record profits again this
year. The 1993 figures did not have the benefit of a full year's sales from
the Mighty Max range. Also, the group believes the Polly Pocket range has
plenty of further potential, possibly becoming a classic like Barbie. Those
who bought shares at the low of 26p in December 1990 have done very nicely.
But if fully diluted earnings hit 80p a share this year, at the top end of
forecasts, the prospective p/e is a little more than 10 and still very
attractive.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: US vehicle side drives T&amp;N ahead to Pounds
70.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in US vehicle output fuelled a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 70.3m at T&amp;N, the motor components manufacturer, for the
year to end-December.
Trading profits in North America jumped by 70 per cent to Pounds 35m (Pounds
20.6m), contributing to a group trading gain of 14 per cent to Pounds 122.8m
(Pounds 107.3m).
While welcoming the improvement Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive,
said there were few recovery signs in continental Europe, one of T&amp;N's most
important markets.
'Europe car production is down by 20 per cent and we've been hit by reduced
demand, even in the UK. Exceptional cost cutting action is under way in
Germany, France and Italy,' he said.
Declining vehicle production, he added, had forced T&amp;N to increase
rationalisation and redundancy charges last year by 96 per cent to Pounds
21.9m.
The group has cut its workforce by more than 3,000 last year and Mr Hope
warned that at least another 1,000 jobs would have to go over the year and
next, reducing the group total to about 40,000.
T&amp;N's Italian operations were worst affected by the downturn, with some
subsidiaries forced to make 'significant' bad debt write-offs following a 50
per cent decline in sales volume.
Mr Hope also predicted another 1,000 job cuts at Goetze, the German
components subsidiary which T&amp;N purchased last year for DM250 (Pounds 97m).
It has already cut more than 1,300, or 30 per cent, of the workforce.
In the UK, meanwhile, trading profits slipped to Pounds 42.1m (Pounds 43.9m)
in spite of increased sales of Pounds 552m (Pounds 531m).
The results were also hit by a provision of Pounds 21.1m (Pounds 16.6m) to
settle asbestos disease claims, mainly in the US.
The provision held overall operating profits at Pounds 101.7m, although this
represented a 12 per cent increase on the Pounds 90.7m total in 1992. Group
turnover advanced by 20 per cent to Pounds 1.66bn (Pounds 1.39bn).
Earnings per share came out at 8.8p (5.8p). The unchanged full-year dividend
of 10.85p was paid at the interim stage, with an alternative scrip dividend
of 16.275p per ordinary share.
COMMENT
T&amp;N has decided to swallow some bitter pills in a bid to increase future
profitability. Heavy rationalisation costs and provisions against future
asbestos claims have overshadowed an underlying performance that remains
relatively healthy despite miserable trading conditions in Europe. Most
analysts were expecting a pre-tax gain of about Pounds 70m without the
provisions. That the company hit that target while enduring heavy charges
pays testament to increased operating efficiency. Having cut costs, it is
expected to report profits of Pounds 91m this year for a forward multiple of
21.1. This is expensive but the City likes T&amp;N's prospects and believes its
asbestos liabilities are covered adequately. The latter proposition will be
tested in coming months.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: TI and Snecma in aircraft joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI Group, the engineering group, and Snecma, the French state-owned
aero-engine manufacturer, yesterday said they had been given the go-ahead
from the European Union regulatory authorities as well as from the French
government to combine their aircraft landing gear operations into a joint
company called Messier-Dowty.
The joint venture will become the world's biggest landing gear manufacturer
with annual sales in the region of Pounds 250m employing about 2,300 people.
TI, which took over Dowty two years ago, signed a preliminary agreement with
Snecma last December after nine months of negotiations.
Apart from requiring approval from the European Union competition
authorities, the joint venture also needed French government approval
because it is considered to be a semi-privatisation, Mr Tony Edwards,
chairman and chief executive of Messier-Dowty, said yesterday.
Mr Edwards also said that the venture followed long standing co-operation
between the UK and the French landing gear groups.
TI and Snecma said they had agreed that the market value attributable to the
Dowty side of the business was about Pounds 30m greater than the value
attributable to the French side. As a result, TI will make an adjustment to
its net contribution to the joint venture and will be entitled to a greater
share of the profits in its first three years.
The joint venture will have its headquarters at TI's head office in
Abingdon, Oxfordshire, and will have an operational co-ordination centre at
Messier-Dowty's head office in Velizy, France.
Mr Edwards said that through the new partnership the two companies would
strengthen their market position by supplying landing gear to both the
European Airbus consortium and Boeing in the commercial airliner sector, and
landing equipment for European and US military aircraft programmes.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Processing side helps lift Strong and
Fisher 47%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong and Fisher, the leather and by-products group which is 88 per cent
owned by Hillsdown Holdings, yesterday announced its second consecutive year
back in profit with a 47 per cent rise at the pre-tax level from Pounds 2.6m
to Pounds 3.82m.
Sales in 1993 were 7 per cent up at Pounds 89.9m (Pounds 84.1m).
Mr Julian Dell, chief executive, said the group had performed well in spite
of sharply higher raw material prices. Cattle and lambskin hides had risen
by about 30 per cent. Finished product prices had begun to improve, but were
not keeping pace with costs.
The improvement in pre-tax profits was due largely to a Pounds 2m increase
in operating profits to Pounds 2.4m in the leather processing business. The
division had benefited from a reduction in capacity during 1992, and a focus
on higher margin premium products.
The by-products operation had also improved profits, with the return rising
from Pounds 632,000 to Pounds 1.04m, in spite of lower volumes.
Mr Dell was confident that the improvement would continue in the current
year, although not at such high levels.
The dividend was maintained at 1p. Earnings per share were 1.7p (1.32p)
basic and fully-diluted 1.45p (1.19p).
The company, which finished the year with cash balances of Pounds 14.7m
(Pounds 18.4m), said it would in time be looking for an acquisition to
offset its dependence on the volatile leather market. However, this would
not be for some months.
It would first seek to conclude discussions over the size of Hillsdown's
stake, the legacy of a rescue of the then-insolvent Strong and Fisher in
1990.
It is expected that Hillsdown will seek to reduce its holding to at least 75
per cent in the coming months. If it does not, Strong and Fisher could lose
its quote.
Mr Dell said this was unlikely. Discussions were under way on a variety of
proposals, he said.
Hillsdown's stake rose from 70.3 per cent to 87.9 per cent in December when
banks which had taken equity for debt in the rescue package exercised their
options to sell.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Currency gain helps Holliday rise to Pounds
13.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holliday Chemical Holdings, the industrial dyes and speciality chemicals
group which came to the market a year ago, increased pre-tax profits by 6
per cent to Pounds 13.1m on a pro forma basis in 1993.
The outcome was slightly better than the company had indicated in a profits
warning in November, and the shares rose 5p to 214p.
Without the impact of favourable exchange rates, which boosted profits by
about Pounds 1m, the pro forma figures would have shown a decline.
The present year is expected to benefit from a further exchange rate gain of
Pounds 2m.
Mr Michael Peagram, the company's founder and chairman, said: 'It could have
been worse, but it was still a bit disappointing.'
He said that profits would have been about Pounds 1.5m better but for two
specific trading problems 'which have now been overcome'.
These were a bout of abnormally fierce price competition for its Spanish
pharmaceutical intermediates business, which has 'subsided substantially',
and a hiatus in ordering by a hair dye customer which was reducing its
stocks. The orders have been rescheduled for the current year.
Mr Peagram said that, after a pause around the time of the profits warning,
the group was again 'actively looking' for acquisition opportunities. The
profits warning knocked the share price back to 174p, against the flotation
price of 195p.
Boosted by exchange rate movements, sales improved by 8 per cent to Pounds
105m, with most of the growth on the colours side.
Here sales rose from Pounds 35.8m to Pounds 41.9m, with underlying growth of
about 7 per cent. Operating profit from colours rose by Pounds 2m to Pounds
6.98m, but chemicals, which takes in both pharmaceutical intermediates and
hair dye, fell by Pounds 1.48m to Pounds 7.88m.
Capital spending was Pounds 6.3m, against the projected Pounds 8m, but is
set to rise to about Pounds 9m this year.
Earnings per share rose 5 per cent to 11.7p on a pro forma basis and there
is a recommended final dividend of 2.4p, giving a total for the year of 4p.
COMMENT
Companies which disappoint soon after flotation are rarely forgiven as
quickly as Holliday. But then the problems do appear to have been genuinely
unexpected one-offs which are already on the mend. Given the extra Pounds 2m
to come from exchange rate movements, a full recovery in the affected areas
would take group profits to about Pounds 16.5m without any underlying growth
from the rest of the business. On that conservative assumption the shares
are on a multiple of less than 15. Despite the excellent record, the rating
is likely to be held back by the threat of a large share issue to fund
acquisitions.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Provisions cut behind Alliance rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society raised pre-tax profits by 67 per cent
from Pounds 123m to Pounds 205m in 1993, helped by lower provisions for bad
and doubtful debts and increased income from its Girobank subsidiary.
The total charge for provisions dropped from Pounds 204m to Pounds 126m, and
reflected falls across all classes of lending - on residential, commercial
and unsecured loans. Girobank increased its contribution to profits by 17
per cent to Pounds 75m.
The group's cost/income ratio remained high, although it fell slightly from
65.6 per cent to 63.9 per cent. The impact of Girobank was evident in that
the same ratio for the society alone was 44.6 per cent (47.2 per cent).
A&amp;L property services, the estate agency subsidiary, cut its pre-tax loss to
Pounds 5m (Pounds 8m).
Mr Peter White, group chief executive, said that increased mortgage lending
in the second half had taken mortgage advances for 1993 as a whole to Pounds
1.5bn, up 22 per cent.
Retail savings rose by Pounds 0.5bn to Pounds 14bn, and wholesale funding
fell by one percentage point to 25 per cent of shares and deposits. Total
assets rose from Pounds 20.53bn to Pounds 21.09bn.
Exceptional costs of Pounds 23.1m in 1993, arose mainly from redundancy
payments, consultants' fees and the write off of some premises. Staff
numbers fell by almost 1,000.
A&amp;L, the UK's fourth largest society, is going through a strategic review,
which has already led it to announce that from the beginning of May the 1.4m
Girobank personal customers will be transferred to A&amp;L.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Motor move by First Direct
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First Direct, the direct telephone banking company owned by HSBC Holdings,
is to enter the growing market for direct telephone sales of motor
insurance.
The group will launch a pilot later this month, offering motor insurance to
a targeted range of customers through Hexagon Insurance, an existing HSBC
subsidiary which sells insurance for a panel of 70 insurers.
'Our customers tell us they are very interested in a car insurance service
from First Direct,' said Mr Peter Simpson, commercial director.
'Car insurance is a natural progression to the development of our range of
services', added Mr Simpson.
First Direct will join a series of other telephone broking services run by
companies such as Hill House Hammond, a subsidiary of Norwich Union, Select
Direct - owned by General Accident and Rollins Hudig Hall, and Telesure.
Telephone-based brokers aim to compete in the direct sales market, which has
grown rapidly in recent years following the success of Direct Line, the
Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary, which both sells and underwrites motor
insurance by telephone and is the market leader insuring more than 1.4m
motorists.
Analysts estimate that telephone-based companies already control more than
15 per cent of the market.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Share sales help Singer to Pounds 34m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singer &amp; Friedlander, the diversified merchant banking group, yesterday
exceeded market forecasts with pre-tax profits of Pounds 34.4m for 1993, up
from Pounds 6m in the previous year.
The figures were distorted by Pounds 12m in exceptional profits, from the
sales of shareholdings in Burford and ACT, but profit before tax and
exceptional items rose by 38 per cent to Pounds 22.4m (Pounds 16.2m).
The recommended final dividend of 1.75p, makes a total pay-out of 3p (2.6p).
The core merchant banking and investment management operations increased
their contribution by 73 per cent to Pounds 16m. A Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 4.5m)
provision was made against bad and doubtful debts.
The corporate finance division benefited from increased activity among
medium-sized companies. Singer owns 51 per cent of stockbroker Collins
Stewart, which had 'an outstandingly successful year'. The private clients
fund management business had more than Pounds 1bn under management.
Further growth could come from fledgling businesses. The structured finance
operation was profitable in its first year of operation, while the retail
fund division is expected to contribute in 1994.
Property contributed Pounds 4m profit from rental income. There was an
exceptional Pounds 3.9m write down against the Pounds 70m property
portfolio, but this was more than off-set by profits from investment sales.
Singer announced yesterday that its property division had raised Pounds 30m
from a 25-year fixed rate debenture, releasing further funds for banking
activities.
During 1993, Singer increased its stake in The People's Phone Company,
provider of cellular telephone services. It now owns 26 per cent, assuming
the conversion of debentures. In addition, it has invested in Associated
Nursing Services and insurance broker Edgar Hamilton.
Mr John Hodson, chief executive, said these stakes were intended to build up
funds to invest in fee earning businesses when opportunities arose.
Earnings per share amounted to 13.19p (0.76p) including, and 7.77p (5.86p)
excluding, exceptional items.
COMMENT
Singer &amp; Friedlander has been switching emphasis from property and stock
investments into developing fee-based businesses. Yesterday's results
demonstrate its success. Exceptional items bumped up the bottom line, but
the increase in higher quality recurrent earnings has been impressive.
Concerns remain over Pounds 53m in legal claims connected to Barlow Clowes,
and this uncertainty could continue to dampen enthusiasm. However, brokers
expect pre-exceptional profits of up to Pounds 25m in 1994, putting the
shares on a p/e of 10.9, based on yesterday's closing price of 99p. With
asset backing estimated at about 100p, the management has earned a higher
rating.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: TDG's Pounds 27m disappoints City - Shares
fall 25p on downbeat statement about recovery prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Transport Development Group fell 25p to 284p yesterday after the
distribution, storage, transport and hire company issued a downbeat
statement about recovery prospects.
Mr Martin Llowarch, chairman, said: 'TDG's perceived status as a
'bellwether' of the UK economy has led some commentators to have rather
bullish expectations about the immediate outlook for profits, although both
here and on the continent, it is no easier to make money than it was a year
ago.
'The group is in good shape, but profit recovery will only be steady rather
than dramatic.'
For the year to end-December pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 33.5m to
Pounds 26.9m, which were depressed by exceptional net losses and closure
costs of Pounds 7.5m.
Operating profit after interest dipped from Pounds 36.2m to Pounds 34.4m and
sales from continuing operations fell from Pounds 565m to Pounds 550m.
UK operating profit increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 35.1m, but the group
said the slow recovery was being accompanied by continuing downward pressure
on margins. Continental European profits fell by 60 per cent to Pounds 3.2m,
reflecting the economies in Germany and the Netherlands, and continuing
difficulties in France.
TDG withdrew from America in 1992 and has agreed to sell its Australian
operation. The group said this pruning would give it an exclusively European
focus and, on the completion of the Australian deal, leave it almost
unborrowed.
The group sold several businesses last year, including Translittoral, a
lossmaking French haulage company, and the Canvey Island storage business of
London &amp; Coastal Oil Wharves. Talks are in progress to sell Beck &amp; Pollitzer
Engineering to a management consortium and sale discussions are being held
concerning two other unidentified businesses.
Earnings per share were 9.63p (12.05p), but before exceptionals rose to
14.89p (13.94p). A final dividend of 6.5p gives an unchanged total of 9.5p.
COMMENT
The drop in the share price reflected TDG's caution about the pace of
recovery, but analysts were if anything more concerned about the extent of
margin pressure across the group. Having trimmed the sprawl of companies
from 120 to 34 in the last few years, TDG's management is still struggling
with tough trading conditions - which is reflected in the unexciting
prospective multiple of 17. Acquisitions could spark more interest, but
European distribution is very fashionable and companies are being sold for
fancy prices. TDG's cautious managers are unlikely to do anything rash, but
a re-rating is unlikely until the group shows its hand.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Portals beats expectations with 22% advance
to Pounds 31m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong overseas demand for banknote paper and a growing appetite for round
teabags helped Portals Group report a stronger than expected advance in
1993.
Pre-tax profits of the security and specialist papermaker and environmental
protection and control products group rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 31m in
the year to end-December.
That compared with profits of Pounds 25.5m in 1992, when the outcome was
depressed by net provisions totalling Pounds 1.84m. Interest costs for 1993
fell to Pounds 91,000 (Pounds 617,000) and the group recorded a Pounds
304,000 (Pounds 127,000) profit on the sale of properties.
Turnover from continuing operations grew by 11 per cent to Pounds 197.9m
(Pounds 178.3m) led by the security and specialist papermaking division
which lifted its turnover by 15.2 per cent to Pounds 116m (Pounds 100.7m.)
Earnings per share were up 27.6 per cent to 34.55p (27.08p) and a final
dividend of 10.75p (9.5p) is recommended making a total for the year of 16p
(14.5p.)
Buoyed by the higher than expected profits and an upbeat market assessment
from Mr John Lloyd, Portals' managing director, the group's shares closed up
29p at 608p.
Mr Lloyd said that as a result of increasing demand for Portals' banknote
paper, particularly from developing nations and eastern Europe, the group
had decided to install a new 4,000 tonne banknote paper machine costing
Pounds 19m at its Overton mill, which will come on stream in 1996.
Operating profits from continuing operations increased by 8 per cent to
Pounds 30.8m (Pounds 28.5m). In the security and specialist papermaking
division
the increasing demand for round teabags - which now claim two thirds of the
marketplace - helped JR Crompton lift output to record levels.
After a strong performance in 1992 the protection and control division
recorded flat operating profits from continuing operations of Pounds 8.56m
(Pounds 8.43m) on turnover up by 5.5 per cent to Pounds 81.9m (Pounds
77.7m.)
The group ended the year with Pounds 16m of net cash compared with net
borrowings of Pounds 2.75m a year earlier.
COMMENT
Portals' specialist papermaking business used to be viewed as dependable but
boring, but this is changing. The market, which historically has grown at a
real rate of between 2 and 3 per cent a year, is now growing at between 4
and 5 per cent a year. The banknote market has expanded because of the
break-up of the Soviet empire and growth in emerging markets like south-east
Asia, and demand for high security paper is growing as governments try to
keep one step ahead of the counterfeiters. Pre-tax profits could reach
Pounds 34.5m this year producing 39p of earnings and a prospective p/e of
15.6. Buy this stock.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ind Newspapers rises to IPounds 29m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Independent Newspapers, the Irish newspaper group controlled by Mr Tony
O'Reilly, has achieved an 81 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits from
IPounds 16m to IPounds 29m (Pounds 27.9m) on turnover of IPounds 173.5m.
Some IPounds 7.3m of the profit increase was due to lower interest charges
resulting from the conversion last April of the group's IPounds 30m
convertible capital bond issue.
This included the reincorporation of an interest credit of IPounds 2.5m in
accrued interest on the bonds. Net debt at year-end fell to IPounds 11m
(IPounds 48m), giving gearing of 6 per cent. Recent acquisitions in South
Africa and the UK have since increased borrowings to IPounds 30m.
Operating profits for 1993 rose to IPounds 27.1m (IPounds 22.2m). An
exceptional charge of IPounds 3m as a provision against the investment in
the loss-making Tribune newspaper, was offset by an IPounds 3.8m gain on the
disposal of its Mirror Group stake .
The profit contribution from the Australian interests in the APN newspaper
group and Buspak advertising doubled to IPounds 9m, and its UK subsidiaries
returned to profit with a contribution of IPounds 0.5m.
The input from the core Irish newspaper business grew by 6 per cent to
IPounds 18.4m.
Princes Holdings, the 50 per cent-owned cable TV subsidiary in Ireland, did
not contribute any profits, but increased its subscriber base by 57 per cent
to 103,000 customers through a deliberate loss-leading marketing campaign.
Mr Liam Healey, group chief executive, said the subsidiary would begin to
show profits this year. A subscriber base of some 250,000 customers was
targetted for 1997.
Last month the group spent IPounds 22m on a 29.99 per cent stake in
Newspaper Publishing, publisher of the UK Independent and Independent on
Sunday.
It has also taken a 31 per cent stake in the South African Argus newspaper
group through a share-swap deal which will give Argus shareholders a 5 per
cent holding in Independent Newspapers.
Earnings per share came through at 30.54p (19.44p) basic and 24.93p (19.6p)
fully diluted.
A final dividend of 7p is recommended, for a total of 11p (9.3p adjusted).
COMMENT
Independent Newspapers is a big fish in the cramped pond of the Irish
newspaper market, and growing contributions from overseas acquisitions like
APN will be vital to sustain the impressive level of growth achieved
hitherto. Barring civil war in South Africa, the Argus move appears a good
one. But the taking of a minority stake in the loss-making Newspaper
Publishing group in the UK without being able to bring Independent's proven
management skills to bear at board level, could misfire. Earnings per share
of 28p look achievable in 1994, giving a prospective p/e multiple of 17.7,
which makes it pricey in the confines of the Irish market but cheap against
its international peers.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Waste Recycling in Pounds 5m placing plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The waste sector welcomed an addition to its ranks yesterday with the
announcement that Waste Recycling Group was seeking a quote through a Pounds
5m placing.
Waste Recycling, which reclaims and recycles non-hazardous waste, is issuing
10m ordinary shares at 50p, valuing the enlarged group at Pounds 8.1m.
Mr Paul Rackham, managing director and founder, will be some Pounds 6.5m
richer as a result.
Under the deal, he will receive 7.1m shares, which will be placed with
institutions.
Mr Rackham will retain 6.2m shares through his private investment vehicle
and original owner of the business, Paul Rackham Ltd. This represents 38 per
cent of the enlarged group.
The remaining 2.9m shares in the placing will raise about Pounds 1.2m, which
will be used to pay inter-company loans owed to Mr Rackham.
Waste Recycling said a listing would help it to finance acquisitions through
the issue of shares if circumstances were appropriate.
There were further opportunities to expand in East Anglia and it had
established links with 23 councils in the area.
The group reported an increase in pre-tax profits over the three years from
Pounds 431,000 in 1991 to Pounds 1.02m for the year to December 31 1993.
Sales rose by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 2.61m in the same period. Last year
dividends totalling Pounds 1.75m were paid to Paul Rackham Ltd.
Waste Recycling has two non-executive directors appointed since February -
Mr David Williams, non-executive chairman of waste recycling and chairman of
Mosaic Investments, and Mr Sam Wauchope, managing director of Acorn
Computers.
There are three full-time directors, including the founder's son Mr Paul
Rackham junior, who has worked for the group since 1984.
Waste Recycling is being sponsored by London stockbroker Marshall
Securities.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Jessups falls back in last four months
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Warnings of losses at Jessups, the Essex-based motor dealer, were borne out
with a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 599,000 on sales of Pounds 123m in the 16
months to December 31 1993.
Problems experienced in the final four months of the period transformed the
result. At the 12 months' stage, to August 31 1993, the group was showing a
Pounds 707,000 profit on sales of Pounds 92m.
In the 12 months to end-August 1992 Jessups made profits of Pounds 506,000
profit on sales of Pounds 76m.
The motor dealership division suffered a Pounds 473,000 loss in the period
under review. The company said that in certain new locations refurbishment
and management integration had proved difficult and expensive to achieve.
Interest charges rose to Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 518,000) and losses per share
emerged at 11.68p (earnings 105p).
In view of the loss the final dividend is being omitted leaving shareholders
with 3p for the 16 months - 4.5p was paid for the preceding 12 months.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: James Dickie shares up 46% on trading
position
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A trading statement yesterday from James Dickie anticipating 'significantly
improved' interim results prompted a 46 per cent rise in the company's
shares yesterday. After an rise of 20p in early trading they finished 47p
higher at 150p.
The announcement said the USM-traded engineering components maker had
benefited over the opening half year from increased volumes of production
and sales, particularly on components supplied to the construction equipment
sector.
The group has also benefited from a faster-than-expected integration of
Striker Engineering.
The results, covering the six months to end-February, will be released on
April 25. The company intends to resume interim dividend payments for the
first time since 1990.
For the first half of the previous year Dickie swung from losses of Pounds
292,000 to profits of Pounds 250,000 pre-tax.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Making money out of the wrong terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive of London Weekend Television, lost his job
yesterday - and made some more money.
However it was not just the resignation settlement reached after he failed
to negotiate acceptable terms to stay on with Granada, the new owners of
LWT, that added to his riches.
He made another Pounds 46,000 when the market digested the news of his
resignation and marked Granada's shares up by 4p, presumably in the
expectation that the new LWT chief executive, Mr Charles Allen of Granada,
may cut costs more enthusiastically than Mr Dyke.
'We would have liked to have kept Greg Dyke on, but it had to be on the
right terms,' said Mr Allen, who has set up shop in the spartan Waterloo
room at LWT's Southbank headquarters until the chief executive's office
becomes free at the end of this month.
The right terms for Mr Dyke, one of the more charismatic executives in
commercial television, famous for turning round the fortunes of TV-am, the
breakfast broadcaster, by giving greater prominence to a glove puppet called
Roland Rat, were essentially that he remained as the LWT chief executive.
As the man running a subsidiary of Granada he would have reported to Mr
Allen as head of Granada's television and leisure businesses.
Mr Dyke, whose jobs have included local newspaper reporter and trainee Marks
and Spencer manager, would have stayed if he had been offered oversight of
Granada Television as well as LWT and a seat on the main Granada board.
Mr Dyke may have lost his job, but even before the effects of the 4p rise in
the Granada share price, his stake in the company was worth about Pounds
8.2m.
As a result of the successful Granada takeover, one of the oddest but most
effective management duos in commercial television is leaving LWT.
The 'toff', Sir Christopher Bland, former Guards officer and LWT chairman,
will leave at the end of next week some Pounds 14m richer, soon to be
followed by Mr Dyke, who has always played up his proletarian origins.
Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, will take over as chairman of
LWT.
Mr Dyke has always insisted that the two were much more similar than
appearances suggested.
'We both swear like troopers, have the attention span of a peanut, and like
to win,' he said, before it became totally clear that they had lost.
The scale of the loss became clear on Friday February 25, the final deadline
for the Granada bid. At the 11th hour Sir Christopher and Mr Dyke were
offered 4m shares by arbitrageurs at Pounds 8 each, the sort of price they
had been arguing the company was worth.
After a half-hearted attempt to finance the share purchase they decided to
bow to the inevitable, partly because the deal might have cost them several
million pounds.
In the Waterloo room yesterday Mr Allen was relaxed and conciliatory after a
holiday. When he was appointed chief executive of Granada Television 18
months ago after a career in accountancy and general management, it was
portrayed as something close to the end of civilisation.
He believes he has proved his point that 'the bottom line' and producing an
increased stream of quality television are not mutually inconsistent.
As with the first months at Granada Television, Mr Allen will spent the next
three to six months as hands on chief executive, encouraging staff to come
up with a plan for the future and then sticking to it.
An unspecified number of jobs will go where there is duplication and overlap
between Granada and LWT, but Mr Allen is thinking more in terms of growth
and making more programmes than in cutting back.
By next year he is thinking of developing an international satellite channel
with partners, but calling on the programme strengths and libraries of
Granada Television and LWT.
By then, Mr Dyke might have a clear idea what he wants to do next. At the
moment the speculation runs from chief executive of a bid for a new Channel
5 franchise through managing director of BBC Television (fully occupied at
present) to buying Brentford, the football team he supports.
More plausibly, some of the City investors who supported Granada in the
hostile bid against LWT are now interested in supporting financially
whatever Sir Christopher Bland and Mr Greg Dyke decide to do next in the
media.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Insurance covers BAT's downturn from
tobacco - US price war hits underlying profits from tobacco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Full year profits from BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services
group, were hit by an 18 per cent fall in underlying profits from tobacco -
due largely to a price war in the US market.
However, Mr Martin Broughton, BAT chief executive, said that the inroads
made by cut-price brands in the US market had been partly reversed last
year.
Premium brands now had about 67 per cent of the market, an increase of some
5 percentage points from a year ago.
Kool, BAT's main premium brand, suffered a fall in underlying volume of 18
per cent, in a market down by 5 per cent. All the loss of market share had
come in the first half, BAT said, with the position stable in the second
half.
Trading profit in tobacco was down 8 per cent at Pounds 1.21bn, on sales up
9 per cent at Pounds 13bn. The profit figure was struck after a Pounds 138m
profit from an exchange of brands last June with American Brands, and a
Pounds 73m rationalisation charge, of which Pounds 51m was incurred in the
US.
Trading profits in insurance, excluding discontinued business, were Pounds
913m, an increase of 39 per cent in local currencies. Group profits on life
insurance rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 321m.
Eagle Star's general insurance business was hit by unexpectedly high
provisions for discontinued financial insurance business.
General insurance losses declined sharply to Pounds 9m, after Pounds 190m in
1992.
Eagle Star's underwriting losses on continuing business fell to Pounds 142m
(Pounds 280m), mainly as a result of rate rises and improved weather
conditions. However, claims from domestic mortgage business rose to Pounds
115m.
Losses from discontinued business were higher than expected at Pounds 143m
(Pounds 145m). 'We got our model wrong and we had to beef up our
assumptions,' said Mr David Allvey, group finance director.
Eagle Star's premiums rose by 15.5 per cent to Pounds 2.21bn (Pounds
1.92bn), while life premium income declined to Pounds 861m (Pounds 866m).
Its solvency margin rose to 56 per cent.
For the group as a whole, profit in Europe was more than doubled at Pounds
765m.
North American profits were down 15 per cent at Pounds 914m, while profits
in the rest of the world were 7 per cent down at Pounds 462m.
The tax charge was sharply lower at 30.3 per cent, compared to 41.5 per
cent.
This was mainly due to last year's enhanced scrip dividend, which saved the
group Pounds 90m in advance corporation tax. A normal tax rate would be in
the range 33 per cent to 35 per cent, BAT said.
Balance sheet gearing dropped from 55 per cent to 40 per cent. Ten
percentage points of the fall were also due to the scrip dividend, which
saved Pounds 400m in cash.
Earnings per share were up 31 per cent at 38.5p. However, the dividend was
raised only 8 per cent to 20.1p (18.6p) via a final of 12.2p.
Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said this was partly because last year's low
tax rate would not be repeated, and also because the group wanted to
increase its dividend cover to at least two times.
Last year's figure was 1.85 times.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BICC profit of Pounds 104m fails to cover
pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The absence of exceptional items helped BICC, the cables and construction
group, post significantly higher pre-tax profits last year. However the
profits were again insufficient to cover the group's maintained dividend.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 104m from a restated Pounds 63m the
previous year when profits were reduced by property and Channel Tunnel
provisions totalling Pounds 39m. Group turnover increased by 7.4 per cent to
Pounds 3.92bn (Pounds 3.65bn.)
Operating profits were flat at Pounds 135m, excluding a Pounds 2m
acquisition contribution last year and the substantial property and Channel
Tunnel charges in 1992.
Earnings per share were 15.4p, just ahead of the 1992's restated
pre-execeptional level of 14.7p. Sir Robin Biggam, chairman, said the group
had again been successful in generating cash from its operations and this,
taken in conjunction with signs of improvement in some of the group's
markets, had led the board to recommend a maintained final dividend of
13.25p making a full-year total unchanged at 19.25p.
The shares fell 16p to close at 438p.
He said the results, 'continued to reflect the exceptionally difficult
trading environment which we have experienced over the last three years'.
'We now have two very strong and competitive businesses, which are in
excellent positions to benefit from improving market conditions. recently we
have seen some signs of improvement in Australia, North America and the UK,
and other European markets are likely to stabilise in the current year.
Accordingly, we expect to see our performance improving in 1994.'
In construction Balfour Beatty posted operating profits of Pounds 40m, up
Pounds 3m on the previous year on turnover that slipped to Pounds 1.83bn
(Pounds 1.85bn.) Over the past five years Balfour Beatty has generated
Pounds 150m of profits.
The group's other core business, cables, was affected by continuing market
weakness. BICC Cables, which mainly operates in Europe, saw profits fall by
14 per cent to Pounds 67m from Pounds 78m the previous year on turnover that
increased to Pounds 1.05bn (Pounds 946m.) Profits in the UK, however, held
up well.
Sir Robin said the decline was largely attributable to losses incurred in
power cables in Spain. There was also a softening of demand for cable in the
Italian, German and Portuguese markets.
COMMENT
BICC has been forced to dip into reserves again to maintain the dividend.
With its main markets around the world showing signs of improvement, a
similar move should not be required again this year. The group has a clear
strategy, the balance sheet is strong and its businesses have been
rationalised. Pre-tax profit of about Pounds 140m are expected this year
producing earnings of about 20.2. With a lofty prospective p/e of 21.7, the
stock is supported only by its generous yield.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Bio-tech to focus on cancer
treatments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Bio-technology, the emerging pharmaceuticals company which floated
on the stock market in 1992, yesterday announced it had decided to focus its
own-funded research chiefly on products for the treatment of cancer.
The statement fuelled speculation that results for the first clinical trial
of its lead cancer drug, Batimastat, due to be announced next Thursday, will
be favourable.
The company also revealed it had patented a new oral version of the drug
which would be more suitable for chronic treatment than the current
injectable compound. This will start clinical trials next year.
Mr Ian Smith, pharmaceuticals analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the decision
to concentrate its resources on cancer suggested that the Batimastat trial
had gone well. 'This is an important drug, not only for British
Bio-technology but for the sector as a whole.'
Following a strategic review the company has decided to focus its resources
on the cancer treatments which it will fund right through clinical trials
and on to the market worldwide. In its other main research areas of
inflammatory diseases and virology it will be looking for development and
marketing partners.
The company reported a loss before tax of Pounds 4.74m for the three months
to January 31, compared with a Pounds 3.32m loss for the third quarter last
year.
The shares, which added 3p to 438p yesterday, have risen 15 per cent in the
past month, taking them back above the 425p flotation price.
Although the company ended the quarter with cash of Pounds 34.4m it is
planning a rights issue this year to fund further product development.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wetherspoon seeks Pounds 22.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JD Wetherspoon, the pub operator, yesterday announced a 76 per cent increase
in interim profits and a Pounds 22.1m rights issue - just 17 months after
the rapidly expanding chain came to the market.
The group's shares have climbed rapidly since being launched at 160p and
yesterday closed at 393p, up 10p on the day. The 1-for-4 rights issue is
priced at 315p.
The Wetherspoon estate has grown from 44 pubs at flotation to 77 today, most
within greater London. The group said permissions were in place for the
conversion of a further 14 sites into pubs. Ten of these were expected to
open for trading by the end of the current financial year.
Mr Tim Martin, chairman, said proceeds of the rights issue would be used in
part to reduce short-term borrowings and finance current developments. The
balance would be placed on deposit, pending further investment in the pub
expansion programme.
The rights issue will dilute from 22 to 18 per cent the stake held by Mr
Martin, the group's 38-year-old founder, and his wife.
He said: 'The proceeds of the rights issue will strengthen our capital base
as we continue to invest in our expansion programme.'
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.49m to Pounds 2.62m in the six months to
January 31, while sales rose by 56 per cent to Pounds 20.56m.
Mr Martin said: 'The 24 pubs opened in the last financial year combined with
the 20 pubs opened and due to open in the current financial year will have a
beneficial effect on earnings for the year.'
Earnings per share increased 41 per cent to 8.6p (6.1p) and the interim
dividend is raised by 22 per cent to 2.2p (1.8p).
COMMENT
JD Wetherspoon's marketing formula - reserving up to a third of its bar
space for non-smokers, and offering food all day - has clearly struck a
chord with customers. The establishment of non-smoking areas slightly
depressed drink sales in the first half and food is a lower margin business,
but these factors were offset by the success of opening large pubs in town
centres such as Croydon and Norwich. The enthusiastic Mr Martin believes the
UK could eventually support 300-400 of his outlets. Given that gearing had
reached 68 per cent, it seems sensible to ask shareholders to help to seize
the available opportunities. The shares are on a prospective multiple of 21,
which looks justified by the group's growth prospects.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered at Pounds 401m - Strong
earnings from Hong Kong and Asia Pacific boost profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered, the UK-based international banking group, yesterday
raised its 1993 dividend by 20 per cent to 24p after strong earnings from
Hong Kong and the Asia Pacific pushed its pre-tax profits to a record Pounds
401m.
The pre-tax figure was twice the Pounds 189m returned in 1992, that figure
having been restated for exchange rate adjustments and changes in
accounting.
The increased dividend was four times covered by earnings per share of 96.2p
(24.7p restated).
The bank announced a proposed 4-for-1 split of its Pounds 1 ordinary shares,
which have been volatile because of limited liquidity. The shares yesterday
closed 37p down at 1143p after initially rising sharply on the results.
Hong Kong operations contributed Pounds 234m of the pre-tax profit, with a
further Pounds 139m coming from other Asia Pacific countries. There was a
loss of Pounds 16m on operations in the UK after making a Pounds 159m
provision against UK bad debts.
Mr Patrick Gillam, chairman, said that Standard Chartered would concentrate
on building businesses in east and south east Asia. It intended to seek
listings on the Singapore and Hong Kong stock exchanges to reinforce its
commitment.
The charge for bad and doubtful debts was Pounds 233m, sharply down on the
Pounds 364m in 1992, although the 1992 figure included a Pounds 269m
provision against Standard Chartered's involvement in the securities
industry scandal in India.
Mr Gillam said the bank had already recovered Pounds 34m from its exposure
to the Bombay scandal, helped by employing its own fraud recovery team. It
was pursuing further claims and expected to get more money back.
The charge included nearly Pounds 20m against a single corporate exposure in
Japan, but half of the total came from topping up old UK problem loans. Mr
Gillam said provisions were intended to establish 'a solid base' for future
profits.
The bank reduced its exposure to commercial property in Hong Kong by Pounds
250m during the year. However, Mr Peter Wood, director of risk management,
said he expected provisions against bad debts in Hong Kong to rise
eventually.
Ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets rose strongly after it retained
earnings of Pounds 171m (Pounds 11m) and issued Pounds 100m of preference
shares. The tier one ratio of core capital to risk assets rose to 6.6 per
cent (4.9 per cent).
The cost to income ratio fell slightly to 63.3 per cent, against 64.4 per
cent despite a rise in operating expenses to Pounds 1.06bn (Pounds 791m).
Mr Malcolm Williamson, chief executive, said the bank could save 'tens of
millions' by centralising some processing in its regional 'hubs'.

FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Guinness Peat Group advances to Pounds 28m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guinness Peat Group, the UK investment vehicle of New Zealand entrepreneur
Sir Ron Brierley, yesterday reported a sharp increase in 1993 pre-tax profit
to Pounds 27.7m, boosted by a profit of Pounds 4.64m on disposals. It
compared with Pounds 7.75m last time.
The company also announced a 1-for-10 rights issue at 25p - a 28 per cent
discount to yesterday's closing price of 34.5p. The company, which has
existing cash resources of Pounds 29.5m, said it would raise Pounds 8.5m
from the issue to fund further investments.
Figures include a maiden contribution from the Brown Shipley merchant
banking group, acquired last April. BSH showed a Pounds 0.5m pre-tax loss,
but contributed Pounds 2.2m from the sale of a subsidiary.
GPG said that following the sale of its fund management operations, Brown
Shipley has net cash balances of Pounds 6m, compared with its purchase price
of Pounds 5.6m.
GPG operating profit was Pounds 23.6m, up from Pounds 8.7m. The company had
an active year following the lifting of its share suspension in November
1992. It has sold a number of businesses, and built up investments in
Physicians Insurance Company of Ohio, and Australian-listed companies,
Australis Media, and ASC.
The company's principal business, its 56 per cent stake in Tyndall
Australia, the life assurance and fund management group, performed well and
remained the main source of earnings.
GPG said that the market value of its share portfolio was at a Pounds 12m
premium to book value, at the year end, and it is reviewing investment
opportunities, primarily in the UK and Australia.
Earnings per share rose to 3.76p (1.39p). The figure was depressed by an
increase in the overall tax rate to 44 per cent, due primarily to Tyndall.
There is no dividend but this 'will be seriously considered in 1995'.

FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Clondalkin declines 18% to
IPounds 10.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Clondalkin, the Dublin-based printing and packaging company, continued to be
adversely affected by 'flat demand, pressure on selling prices, low raw
material prices and cost inflation' in 1993, as pre-tax profits declined
17.5 per cent from IPounds 12.8m to IPounds 10.5m, or Pounds 10.1m sterling,
over the year.
The group added that operating profits fell in Ireland and the mid-Atlantic
region of the US, the two areas where market conditions had been weakest.
Elsewhere, in the US and in the UK, profits rose. Group operating profits
emerged at IPounds 11.1m (IPounds 13.3m).
Turnover grew to IPounds 152.7m (IPounds 149.6m). Earnings declined to
17.52p (22.48p) per share, but the final dividend is maintained at 2.898p
for an unchanged total of 4.732p.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Fokker drops deeper in the red as market demand falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker, has ploughed heavily into the red for 1993
after slack market conditions forced it to cut prices to attract customers.
The company, which came under control of Daimler-Benz of Germany last year,
said net losses totalled Fl 460m (Pounds 164m). This is more than three
times higher than its previous predictions of a Fl 150m loss. Fokker posted
a net profit of Fl 19.8m for 1992.
The shares closed down nearly 12.5 per cent at Fl 18.30 from Fl 20.90 on
Tuesday.
Fokker blamed the unexpectedly large losses on a provision of Fl 275m to
cover the cost of cutting prices to customers. Group turnover fell nearly 10
per cent to Fl 3.7bn from Fl 4.1bn.
The price discounting has allowed the company to reduce its unsold stock to
just six aircraft in March 1994 from 32 at the start of 1993.
Like other aircraft manufacturers, Fokker has been hit by the financial
difficulties of the world's airlines.
The 1993 figures also include a separate charge of Fl 90m to finance
redundancies in the first half. Last month, Fokker said 1,900 further jobs
would have to be eliminated this year, representing the third large
restructuring in three years, as part of wider efforts to reduce output to
meet lower market demand. 'The company cannot afford to continue building
more aircraft than the market demands,' it said.
Interest charges rose to Fl 181m from Fl 126m, reflecting Fokker's increased
involvement in sales financing, mainly leasing, as a way of finding
customers.
The company also announced that Mr Ben van Schaik is to become its
management board chairman on April 1, succeeding Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn who
resigned last month after a boardroom row.
Mr van Schaik, a Dutchman, is the head of European sales at Mercedes-Benz
Commercial Vehicles in Stuttgart, Germany.
The appointment ends speculation that Fokker's majority shareholder would
put a German or a non-Dutch national at the head of the company.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Morgan Grenfell jumps 194% pre-tax to new record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Grenfell, the UK-based investment bank subsidiary of Deutsche Bank,
yesterday announced a 194 per cent rise in pre-tax profits and said it would
pay a Pounds 100m dividend to its parent company.
The group's profits for 1993 were Pounds 235.8m and it had a pre-tax return
on average capital employed of 55 per cent.
Mr John Craven, chairman, said the profits were a record for the company
which, when it was acquired by Deutsche Bank at the end of 1989, appeared to
be in its decline as a merchant bank. Deutsche Bank paid Pounds 950m for the
group amid market comment that it had paid too much.
While Morgan Grenfell benefited from favourable conditions in all its
markets in 1993, Mr Michael Dobson, group chief executive, said that two
businesses - debt arbitrage and trading and Treasury activities -
contributed roughly a third of all revenues.
Fee and commission income, generated by most of Morgan Grenfell's individual
businesses, contributed roughly half of all revenues. Of the group's eight
sectors, each contributed at least 5 per cent of all revenues.
Profits were particularly strong in debt arbitrage and trading - a sector
that in the past year has incorporated an emerging markets equities team.
Trading volumes last year exceeded Dollars 118bn (Pounds 80.8bn), up from
Dollars 68bn in 1992.
Morgan Grenfell's trading activities for its own account in foreign
exchange, debt and derivatives also contributed strongly to revenues,
although Mr Dobson said it appeared unlikely that similar conditions would
be repeated in 1994.
The Morgan Grenfell Asia unit, a merchant banking and stockbroking operation
concentrated in the six emerging markets in the Pacific Rim, achieved record
profits on the back of a surge of investor interest in the region.
Morgan Grenfell also had strong growth in its asset management division,
where net new business rose by Pounds 2.5bn in 1993 and total assets under
management rose to Pounds 28.3bn from Pounds 20.5bn. Mr Dobson said that
Morgan Grenfell was attracting new business at a rapid rate, and in the
first two months of 1994 alone net new accounts totalled Pounds 1.5bn.
The group also said its corporate finance activities grew in 1993, advising
on 145 transactions worldwide worth Pounds 12bn. Mr Craven said that about
80 per cent of all its corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions
advisory businesses were cross-border.

FT  10 MAR 94 / RTZ remains steady and completes move into mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, demonstrated its resilience to low
commodity prices with a steady performance in 1993 when its plans to focus
the group wholly on mining were completed. Mr Robert Wilson described the
year as a landmark for the company, concluding the restructuring started in
1988. Since then, average dollar non-ferrous metal prices fell 44 per cent,
with a 15 per cent decline last year.
In total 'the dismally low prices for many of our products', including coal
and iron ore, reduced 1993 earnings by Pounds 122m, said Mr Wilson. However
this was more than offset by a Pounds 78m contribution from volume growth
and a Pounds 103m gain from exchange rate movements.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 521m to Pounds 435m. But the figure
contains Pounds 217m of exceptional items, including Pounds 165m related to
the disposal of its Pillar industrial division. Group turnover increased
from Pounds 4.6bn to Pounds 4.8bn.
Net attributable earnings were up 20 per cent to Pounds 287m.
Earnings per share rose from 22.5p to 27p. However, adjusted earnings, which
reflect the underlying performance by excluding exceptional items, rose by a
more modest 10 per cent, from Pounds 338m to Pounds 373m.
Sir Derek Birkin, presenting his last results as executive chairman, said
the prices of most metals appeared to have stopped falling. 'However, they
are likely to be volatile for some time because of a combination of renewed
investor interest, possibly erratic supplies, and high inventories.'
A final dividend of 7p is proposed, bringing the total to 20.5p compared
with 19.5p. Sir Derek said the increase 'should be taken as an indicator not
of the outlook for 1994 but of our confidence in the company's potential
once recovery is soundly established'.
During the year the group moved into the US coal industry for a total outlay
of Pounds 320m, and disposed of Pillar, which should realise Pounds 900m.
The sale helped to cut net debt from Pounds 1bn to Pounds 384m, reducing
gearing from 36 per cent to 12 per cent. Mr Christopher Bull, finance
director, said it was 'not a bad time to have a very strong balance sheet'
as the company expected to double capital expenditure this year from 1993's
Pounds 265m.

FT  10 MAR 94 / BAT denies planning bid for Groupe Victoire: Insurance
businesses offset decline in tobacco side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the tobacco to insurance conglomerate, yesterday denied
market rumours that it was to bid for Groupe Victoire, the French insurance
company. BAT also reported a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
1.81bn, with its insurance businesses offsetting a fall in tobacco profits.
Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said BAT had 'no present intention' of buying
Victoire or having a rights issue. 'We're not going to preclude what might
happen next year or the year after, but the statement means what it says,'
he said.
Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive, said: 'It is well known that we are
interested in expanding our financial services business, and we make no
secret of the fact that we are looking at continental Europe. We have no
wish to comment on any specific transactions.' Speculation about a bid for
Victoire, worth approximately Pounds 1bn, has arisen since the group's
parent, Compagnie de Suez put it up for sale.
BAT's insurance business, consisting of Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar in the
UK and Farmers in the US, raised full-year profits by 53 per cent from
Pounds 598m to Pounds 913m. Tobacco profits, however, were hit by a price
war in the US, and excluding profits from the disposal of brands the
underlying fall there was 18 per cent.
Mr Broughton said there were early signs of recovery in US tobacco. 'But
given what happened to US margins last year, it would be a very brave or
foolish man who would forecast margins in 1994.'
Cigarette sales and profits were lower in continental Europe. Tobacco
profits in Australia, Hong Kong and south and central America also fell.
Sir Patrick said the group performance 'demonstrated the resilience of our
strategy, with a year of exceptional difficulty for tobacco offset by firm
recovery in financial services'.
The improvement in insurance was achieved despite heavier than expected
provisions for mortgage indemnity business. Provisions for discontinued
operations amounted to Pounds 143m, against Pounds 145m in 1992.
Losses from Eagle Star's domestic mortgage indemnity business of Pounds 99m
rose from Pounds 69m, but overall general insurance underwriting losses - on
so-called continuing operations - fell to Pounds 142m from Pounds 280m.
BAT's shares rose 16p to 485p.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Cadbury seeks Dr Pepper purchase as profits rise 25%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks group, is interested in
acquiring all of Dr Pepper, the US soft drinks maker, it confirmed
yesterday. Cadbury bought a 20 per cent stake for Dollars 231m (Pounds 155m)
last August, bringing its holding to 25 per cent.
Mr David Wellings, Cadbury chief executive, said 'the two businesses would
be worth more together, provided the shareholder values can be realised. The
question is whose shareholders get the benefit of those values, and that's
what is being discussed'.
The company said present talks were concerned with co-operation between the
companies and with the issue of Cadbury representation on Dr Pepper's board.
Mr Frank Swan, head of the drinks division, said 'the primary strategic
issue is that however the final rationalisation of the US soft drinks
industry proceeds, we now have a seat at the table'. The question was one of
price, he said. 'At the right price I'd like to own Dr Pepper, but at the
right price I'd like to own Coca-Cola.'
Cadbury's full-year figures, released yesterday, were better than expected.
Pre-tax profits, helped by last year's rights issue, rose 25 per cent to
Pounds 416m. Earnings per share were up 16 per cent, or 10 per cent at
constant exchange rates. The dividend was raised 9 per cent to 14.4p.
Excluding acquisitions, the company said, sales rose 3 per cent and trading
profits 7 per cent. Trading profit in confectionery rose 20 per cent to
Pounds 208m, with the strongest performance from continental Europe and the
Americas, and the weakest in the UK. Drinks profits were up 16 per cent but
profits in Europe halved, mostly because of competition and write-offs in
Spain. In the UK, drinks volume was up 6 per cent, but prices fell 2 per
cent. UK drinks profits rose 12 per cent to Pounds 101m.
Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman, said the group planned to grow further through
acquisition. Cadbury spent Pounds 476m last year on acquisitions, raising
Pounds 340m of the cost through a rights issue. However, gearing fell from
59 per cent to 46 per cent, excluding intangibles, while free cash flow rose
from Pounds 100m to Pounds 185m. Mr David Jinks, finance director, said the
group had the capacity to finance Pounds 400m-Pounds 500m of acquisitions
without recourse to shareholders.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Norway's Uni Storebrand pulls out of international
reinsurance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, yesterday reported record 1993
results but announced that it was withdrawing from the international
re-insurance business following a succession of losses.
'Negative results over several years plus a weak capital base are the main
reasons why Uni Storebrand International is being wound down,' the group
said. It is charging NKr450m (Pounds 408m) against the 1993 accounts to
cover expenses during the run-off period.
Uni has also written down the value of its shares in Uni International,
which made an operating loss of NKr357m last year, by NKr694m. In 1993 the
international business represented 20 per cent of group premiums.
Uni said its international reinsurance operations were unlikely to generate
an acceptable rate of return for the foreseeable future, and capital could
be deployed more profitably on core domestic businesses.
Uni is to continue to undertake insurance business internationally in
sectors such as marine, oil and satellite within its non-life unit. But the
Singapore office is to be closed while Uni Storebrand UK has been supplied
with a liquidity support guarantee of up to Pounds 20m to continue
operations. The UK business is to be put up for sale.
In the US, Uni last year failed to succeed with an initial public offering
for Christiania Re, but said that operations would continue until the unit
was sold.
Uni is not the only Scandinavian insurer to withdraw from international
reinsurance. Last year, Swedish rivals Skandia and Trygg-Hansa cut their
reinsurance business.
For 1993 the group achieved a net profit of NKr1.02bn against a loss of
NKr3.54bn in 1992. The result was helped by NKr3.4bn in realised gains on
securities and bonds against losses of NKr800m in 1992.
Group net operating income rose last year to NKr23.6bn from NKr20.6bn.
Premium income fell to NKr13.7bn from NKr14.3bn. Uni plans to pay a dividend
of NKr1.10 per preference share and NKr0.20 per ordinary share.

FT  10 MAR 94 / T&amp;N raises asbestos lawsuits provision to Pounds 21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the British engineering and motor components group, said yesterday it
had increased its liability provision for asbestos-linked legal action by 27
per cent after a flood of new compensation claims in the US.
The Manchester-based group, formerly one of Britain's largest manufacturers
of asbestos-based products, has set aside Pounds 21.1m to cover legal and
settlement costs arising out of the claims, compared with a Pounds 16.6m
provision in 1992.
In spite of the increased provisions, T&amp;N said it expected its liabilities
to decline. The issue has cast a shadow over the group's prospects for more
than a decade.
Claims, mainly in the US, from victims of asbestos-related diseases have
left insurance companies - and the troubled Lloyd's market in London - with
billions of pounds of losses and have forced some of the world's leading
asbestos producers into bankruptcy proceedings.
T&amp;N - formerly Turner &amp; Newall - said a class action under way in New York
might significantly reduce legal claims. Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief
executive, said T&amp;N had joined forces with 20 companies and their insurers
to pursue the action, which is being overseen by the US Centre for Claims
Resolution, a body that seeks to arbitrate legal actions.
'This is a watershed ruling. It would significantly limit our liability and
progressively reduce our costs to zero over the next 10 years,' Mr Hope
added. According to T&amp;N, the preliminary plan has been approved by a federal
court judge and a final ruling is expected in the next two weeks.
The action aims to alter US law so that future asbestos claimants would have
to submit to medical tests and settle for fixed compensation payments linked
to their level of disability or illness. Companies taking part in the action
would settle claims more rapidly.
Aware that such a class action is likely to succeed, US law firms are
understood to have sharply increased the number of cases filed against such
companies, attempting to extract settlements before the new system comes
into effect.
T&amp;N claimed the number of cases filed in New York against asbestos producers
and their insurers was running at about 3,000 a month. In the past decade,
T&amp;N has spent more than Pounds 130m on asbestos legal costs and settlements.
Mr Hope said the company had also built up a balance sheet provision of
Pounds 38.4m to cover longer-term legal costs. Those potential costs include
13 outstanding actions against asbestos products from buildings.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Kohl issues plea to UK and Spain over EU enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany issued an extraordinary personal appeal to
Britain and Spain yesterday to drop their objections to the compromise for
enlargement of the European Union.
He pinned the blame for the failure of the latest round of negotiations
firmly on those two countries, and said if no agreement was reached by next
week, it would be impossible to admit Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden by
January 1 1995.
'Given the overriding political importance of this enlargement for Europe,
it is completely impossible both for the (German) government, and for me in
particular, to understand how some member states have not yet endorsed the
consensus,' he said in an official statement.
Mr Kohl said a fishing rights package put on the table on Tuesday protected
the interests of all member states of the community, in particular Spain,
while taking into account the particular importance of the industry for the
Norwegian population.
As for the British objection to any change in the number of votes needed for
a 'blocking minority' in the Council of Ministers, he said the Greek
presidency had put forward 'a sensible proposal' building on suggestions
made by Germany. The German concern is that if the whole package is not tied
up by next week at the latest, there will not be enough time for the
European parliament and all member states, as well as applicants, to approve
it before the end of the year.
Officials fear if that deadline is missed, the enlargement process could be
delayed for months.
The German government is particularly baffled by the British attitude over
the voting question.
In Strasbourg, the European Parliament warned the UK and Spain it would not
support the EU's planned move from 12 to 16 members without a change in
voting rights to reflect an expanded Europe.
But while the Norwegian government appeared sanguine yesterday about
prospects for a final resolution of its fishing rights conflict with Spain,
Madrid said proposals it had been presented with in Brussels late on Tuesday
were 'a joke'.
Government officials in Madrid dug their heels in after Germany's public
criticism. Responding to a charge by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign
minister, that Spain 'has to move', they said it was up to Norway to move by
making a more serious offer.
London, though, was trying to ignore the German appeal. No 10 Downing Street
said that Mr John Major, the prime minister, remained 'determined to protect
our interests in an enlarged community'.
Officials said the government was committed to retaining the existing
23-vote blocking minority.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Ukraine currency crisis threatens crop-planting: Russia
claims it needs no imports of grain this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY, JOHN LLOYD and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine's hard currency crisis is severely restricting the spring planting
of its wheat, sugar beet and vegetable crops, as its inability to import
seed, fuel and fertilisers threatens to lead to severe food shortages later
this year. The republic was once the Soviet Union's bread basket.
The crisis comes as President Boris Yeltsin of Russia claimed his country
needed to make no purchases of grain this year for the first time in nearly
40 years. 'We have grain in reserve, a good reserve to last until the next
harvest,' he said yesterday.
US grain markets shrugged off this claim. 'Yeltsin is trying his best to
show the IMF he is keeping inflation under control, and that Russia does not
need to be so dependent on foreign debt,' said Mr Joe Victor, analyst with
Allendale, an agricultural consultant. 'The market still believes Russia
will import grain.'
Russia imported 14m tonnes of wheat last year. Two months ago Russian
agricultural officials estimated the country would have to import 12m tonnes
of wheat and animal feeds this year.
Ukraine has secured only 10 per cent of the agricultural inputs required to
sow seeds this month, said an agriculture ministry official in Kiev. A
western diplomat estimated that Ukraine urgently needed Dollars 3bn (Pounds
2bn) this year to avoid a collapse. Last week US president Bill Clinton
announced Dollars 20m in additional grain credits to Ukraine.
The prospect of missing spring planting is tragic in a country with a third
of the world's black soil in its territory. For Ukrainians, it would be a
potent reminder of the 1930s famine in which millions died under the effects
of Stalin's collectivisation.
With Soviet-style state orders still in place, Ukraine forbids farms to sell
their product abroad, thus prohibiting farmers from earning foreign exchange
to buy materials. Farms are left to barter their remnants from last year's
harvest.
Representatives of western companies which have exported foodstuffs to
Ukraine believe the huge cuts made in purchases because of the lack of hard
currency will soon be felt by a population already suffering from shortages
and rising prices.
Many workers throughout the country have not been paid for two months. Some
say they fear social unrest in a few months time because of the looming
shortages.
Russia, even if it has a grain surplus, would not lightly bail out Ukraine.
The two are still haggling over gas supplies, with the Russian gas monopoly
Gazprom saying Kiev has produced Dollars 7m against a bill which Gazprom
claims is Dollars 900m. Talks on this are due to resume today. Gazprom has
cut the amount of gas it sends to Ukraine from 200m cu m a day to 50m.

FT  10 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: RTZ
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a measure of RTZ's quality that earnings and the dividend have been
edged higher despite the cyclical trough in metals prices. If the company
looked hemmed in following the acquisition of Nerco's US coal assets a year
ago, the sale of Pillar has restored its room for manoeuvre. Year end
gearing of 12 per cent - rising to perhaps 20 per cent as higher capital
expenditure starts to bite - leaves plenty of scope for deal-making. Another
step in US coal would make good sense.
Not that RTZ needs a deal to deliver earnings growth. Capital expenditure of
Pounds 500m this year points to no lack of investment opportunity within the
existing business. Big gains should come from the cyclical upswing in metals
prices. True, RTZ's heady cocktail of currency and commodity exposures makes
the pace of profits growth unusually difficult to judge. On the company's
own view that average metals prices this year will be little different from
last, the immediate outlook is far from sparkling.
But if metals prices peak towards the end of the decade at levels which are
in real terms similar to the late 1980s, RTZ might squeeze up to Pounds 1 a
share of earnings from its existing assets. On that basis the shares -
having risen by 30 per cent since November - stand on a peak earnings
multiple of nearly 9 times. While investors are prepared to take an
optimistic view of metals prices, that rating seems fair enough. It will
take another well-judged deal to move the shares much higher.

FT  10 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While HSBC has been diversifying out of Asia with its purchase of Midland,
Standard Chartered seems to be moving in the other direction. Not only did
three quarters of last year's operating profits originate in the Far East;
the bank is talking about disposing of activities in the industrial world
that do not fit in with its particular focus. All that makes its shares
attractive to investors looking for emerging market exposure. But it also
makes the business more risky, especially given Standard's abnormally low
regional bad debt provisions. That in turn requires a high return.
Yesterday's 4 per cent fall in the share price suggests Standard's net
return on shareholders' funds of 20.8 per cent is not yet quite high enough,
even though it is roughly similar to that of HSBC. A high return is all the
more necessary since the bank is still highly leveraged, especially in Hong
Kong, where net assets of only Pounds 307m support a balance sheet of Pounds
11.5bn.
Standard now has some healthy earnings to retain, but its tier one capital
ratio was bolstered last year by an issue of preference capital and a
reduction in risk-weighted assets. A test for the new management is to
exploit its Asian franchise to improve returns. This year it will be helped
by falling UK provisions and a lower tax charge. Standard should earn enough
to permit another large dividend increase. That could underpin the share
price but it would take evidence of more fundamental improvement to drive it
forward again.

FT  10 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Food manufacturers about to report will salute Cadbury Schweppes' results.
The stock market may fret about Cadbury's flat second half profits in the UK
once exceptionals are stripped out - although the weather had a lot to do
with that. It may also be unnerved that 6 per cent volume growth in UK soft
drinks was bought at the cost of a 2 per cent decline in prices. But any UK
food manufacturer that can achieve underlying volume growth of 3 per cent
and lift margins from 11 to 11.7 per cent in unforgiving markets must be
doing something right. Besides, while the UK still accounts for 45 per cent
of profits, Cadbury has a comparatively small exposure to the big food
retailers. It is also the best positioned to exploit alternative
distribution channels such as vending machines. But Cadbury aspires to play
in a bigger league. On that score, there remain considerable strategic
doubts. The biggest concerns its 25 per cent shareholding in Dr Pepper;
Cadbury is showing a capital gain on its shares but receives no dividend and
can not equity account its holding since it does not have board
representation. Cadbury may be able to sweet talk some co-operative deals
but the investment only makes sense if it can buy Dr Pepper at a fair price,
adding that company's 11 per cent market share of US soft drinks to its own
5.6 per cent. But Cadbury will have to tread a careful path to avoid
antagonising Coca-Cola and Pepsico. Its agreement to help the Canadian
private label manufacturer, Cott, in mainland Europe can hardly endear it to
its mighty US competitors.

FT  10 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: BAT smokes without fire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT's smoking cash flow machine coughed slightly in 1993. The dust-up
started by the Marlboro men in the US has certainly bruised Brown and
Williamson. Its position as number three in the US market means it must
continue to follow rather than lead the battle over margins. That struggle
may abate now that Marlboro is regaining ground, but there remains a threat
of higher tobacco taxes - and thus renewed pressure on gross margins - later
this year.
From a profits' perspective, the disappointment in tobacco was offset by
growth in financial services. Gearing also fell, though significantly most
of the improvement came from paying last year's dividend in shares rather
than cash. The crimp in underlying cash flow may still be a medium term
barrier to the company's expansionist ambitions in continental Europe. BAT's
aim of increasing both its dividend payout and its cover is another
inhibition on large acquisitions. The company argues that prudence dictates
it will not pay the kind of fancy prices currently being demanded by
Parisian sellers of insurance companies. In truth, constraints elsewhere
within the business must also have played their part.
For the time being BAT is probably stuck with growing its own greenfield
life business on the continent and chiselling more from the existing
insurance operations. The problem of valuing a combination of tobacco and
insurance earnings also remains. Potential for dividend growth underpins
BAT's yield. But in the absence of anything more dramatic, the shares are
unlikely to catch fire.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Salmon wars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not since Elizabethan apprentices rioted because they were made to eat too
much salmon has this prized fish been as cheap or widely available as it is
now. So much so, that worried Scottish salmon farmers have complained to
Brussels. They blame the Norwegians who, they claim, are encouraging massive
overproduction by subsidising their salmon farmers through loans via the
state-owned banking system.
The Scottish farmers have not attracted as much sympathy. Cheap salmon is
something most people welcome. If Norwegian taxpayers are willing to pay the
bill so that others can gorge themselves, then that is their affair. This is
certainly the view of the UK Treasury, which has declined to intervene on
the Scots' behalf.
There are, however, some serious issues at stake. The Scottish salmon
industry provides livelihoods to 6,000 people, most of whom live in remote
regions of the highlands and islands where there is little other work. If
present trends continue, much of the industry could be devastated, adding to
the social cost of maintaining those communities.
Furthermore, the Scottish salmon growers have commissioned an outside report
from Ernst &amp; Young which says that, over the past five years, Norwegian
salmon production costs have been subsidised to the tune of 20 per cent of
the cost of sales, and that Norwegian farms have consistently lost money
over that period. Moreover, the number of smolts now being reared points to
a 50 per cent growth in Norwegian output by 1995, by which time Norway could
be supplying the entire demand of the EU by itself.
The Norwegians dispute many of these findings, particularly the allegation
of widespread subsidisation. But the question at this stage is not whether
the E&amp;Y report constitutes conclusive evidence of anti-competitive practices
so much as whether it presents a prima facie case for further investigation
by Brussels. This would appear to be so.
This may be a small dispute about a luxury product. But that is not enough
to warrant dismissing these concerns. Quite apart from the issues of
regional development and state aids, the volumes of salmon now being
produced in Europe exceed the catch of cod. So the effects of salmon
overproduction could spill into the white fish market. Indeed, recent
demonstrations by Breton fishermen were triggered by anger at Norwegian
fishing practices.
Salmon and chips might be an appetising prospect, but not at the cost of
heavily distorted trade.

The Japanese know how to exact subtle revenge. Honda may have taken a

German patriotism - by using Franz Beckenbauer, the national soccer coach,
in a big advertising campaign on behalf of the company's Sigma saloon. 'As a
coach I want everything to run as I wish,' says the football hero - his
choice no doubt driven by commercial good sense, rather than silly matters
like nationalism.

The French have surpassed themselves in gastronomic one-upmanship, judging
by a press release from Michelin that accompanies its 1994 Guide to France.
Michelin's views on Britain's culinary skills are well known. Only two
British establishments are deemed worthy of its snooty three stars. By
contrast, 457 eateries in France have been awarded this accolade, according
to a table in Michelin's latest press release.
Obviously someone had enjoyed a good lunch; the true figure is a more modest
20.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps Ray Seitz, the US Ambassador to the Court of St James, isn't going
to quit Britain after all.
He's due to relinquish his post in the early summer, and will most likely be
replaced by admiral Bill Crowe. But it seems Seitz, a career diplomat with
28 years' experience, has all but decided against returning to the State
Department. Like several of his predecessors, he has come to like London,
and there is no obvious big job for him to go to in Washington.
If Seitz wanted to stay in the UK, he wouldn't be short of job offers. Still
only 53, he has a contact book which would make him a natural non-executive
director for a company with big US interests. Charlie Price, a former US
ambassador, went on the boards of Hanson and British Airways.
If he wanted a proper job, he could go into consulting, become a City
merchant banker, or try his hand at international trouble shooting for a big
company like GEC.
Alternatively, if money is no object, then Seitz might consider following in
the footsteps of a predecessor, Kingman Brewster, who went on to head
University College, Oxford.
Come to think of it, he might make a good figurehead for Oxford's new
Institute of American Studies.

Very seldom is a whale caught off the eastern Caribbean island of St

whaling bans.
The heat will intensify when the International Whaling Commission meets in
Mexico in two months. France is proposing a 'no-whaling' sanctuary in
Antarctica; Japan is opposing it - which way will the four islands jump?
Don't get your hopes up, Greenpeace. According to an observer at last

FT  10 MAR 94 / Ill at home and unable to travel: Market reforms and
overseas competition are putting pressure on Japan's drugs industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese spend more per capita on prescription drugs each year than any
other country. They are also more likely than most to visit a doctor - on
average once a month.
Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare will be hoping to curb the cost of
such heavy medicine use today, when it reveals details of its latest plan to
slash drugs prices. The ministry has proved increasingly successful in
tackling growing healthcare costs; the consequent damage being inflicted on
the ailing pharmaceuticals sector threatens its ability to survive on the
global stage.
The industry's plight has come as a surprise. In the 1980s, western
competitors feared it would follow the path of the automotive and
electronics industries and dominate international rivals. The advantages of
Japanese drugs groups included a fast-expanding domestic market and a
skilled, well-educated scientific workforce. A decade ago, the country was
beginning to lead the world in development of some therapies, for instance
drugs to lower cholesterol levels.
But it is now proving a setting sun rather than rising star. In the domestic
market, growth is slowing: the prescription drugs market grew by 13.5 per
cent in 1987, 4.4 per cent last year, and observers expect no growth this
year. Mr Hiroaki Shigeta, president of Nippon Roche, the Japanese subsidiary
of the Swiss group, says: 'I'm very pessimistic for the overall growth of
the market. It'll be almost flat for the next five years.'
The ministry's reforms, which have caused the market to stagnate, have been
forced by an explosion in demand for healthcare, caused by a rapidly ageing
population. The proportion of those over 65 doubled from 6 per cent in 1960
to 12 per cent in 1990. And the ability of the government to pay for
healthcare is being undermined by the recession.
Total spending on medicine represents about 28 per cent of all Japanese
healthcare expenditure - the highest proportion in the world - most of which
is reimbursed by the government. The government wants to cut that figure to
20 per cent by 2000, according to the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association.
But Japan has become the world's second-largest pharmaceuticals market -
worth about Y5,800bn (Dollars 55bn) last year - on the basis of
over-prescribing of medicines. Disease is not more common; rather,
physicians have an incentive to prescribe because they also dispense drugs.
Mr Robert Schembs, project co-ordinator at the consultancy group PMSI, says:
'Every time a doctor writes a prescription, he is writing himself a cheque.'
The government is tackling the escalating drugs bill on two fronts: by
cutting prices paid to manufacturers and by curbing the volume of drugs
prescribed. Price cuts announced today - expected to average 6.6 per cent -
will be the latest in a series of reductions that began in 1982.
The government has also announced two other measures in the past 12 months
to control prices. First, additional price cuts are being imposed next month
on two successful types of medicine: cholesterol-lowering treatments and
interferons, mostly used for treating hepatitis. 'This is a worrying
precedent,' complains Mr Jiro Ichinaka, managing director of nese operations
at Yamanouchi, the drugs company. 'The ministry has never applied the rules
in this way before.'
Second is a scheme introduced to control the price of new drugs. Drugs
defined as 'innovative' can be priced at a premium of 30 per cent above
existing therapies, but the criteria for qualifying have been drawn so
tightly that only four or five medicines have been given the premium over
the past decade.
To curb the volume of drugs prescribed, the ministry has attempted, with
little success, to separate the prescribing and dispensing of drugs. It has
made more progress in giving geriatric hospitals an incentive to prescribe
fewer drugs by setting a fixed budget for each patient.
Another problem for the domestic drugs industry is the increasing aggression
of overseas companies in the Japanese market. Western groups are poised to
seize market share from Japanese companies, and thereby raise their profit
margins, by increasingly marketing their own products.
Most western groups have set up their own development facilities in Japan,
enabling them to prove their drugs' safety and efficacy to the ministry
without the help of Japanese groups. And those western companies that have
not done so already are setting up their own distribution system. In January
next year, for example, Zeneca of the UK will begin to terminate a 20-year
relationship with Sumitomo Pharmaceutical.
In the face of such developments, an obvious strategy for Japanese companies
would be to look for export opportunities. But Japanese global reach in
pharmaceuticals is limited for three reasons:
A lack of innovative products. Japanese pharmaceuticals companies spend a
substantial proportion of sales on research and development, but their lower
turnover means that, in absolute terms, they spend paltry amounts compared
with the industry's international leaders. Takeda, the chemicals group,
invests about Dollars 280m in drugs R&amp;D a year - the highest by any Japanese
company, according to brokers CS First Boston. In contrast, Merck of the US,
the world's largest group, expects to invest Dollars 1.2bn this year.
Even when Japanese companies discover potentially profitable drugs, most do
not have the international infrastructure to conduct clinical trials in the
US and Europe.
A lack of investment in marketing. Rather than constructing an international
presence by promoting a breakthrough drug - as SmithKline French did with
Tagamet in the 1980s - the Japanese have tended to license the promotion of
the medicines they produce to foreign drugs companies.
For example, Sankyo, Japan's biggest drugs group, has licensed out the
marketing of Mevalotin, the world's fourth best-selling medicine, in most
countries. As a result, the product generates limited international
revenues.
The efforts of Japanese groups to overcome such weaknesses have been
lacklustre. During the late 1980s, they made a series of ill-conceived
acquisitions in Europe and the US. Fujisawa, for example, acquired
Lymphomed, a US group making cheap, non-patented drugs in 1989. But in 1992,
the new subsidiary made a pre-tax loss of Dollars 29.9m on sales of Dollars
216m, largely because of a dispute with the US Food and Drug Administration
over the registration of some of its products.
Japanese pharmaceuticals companies remain among the least profitable in the
world because of their high costs. Margins have expanded, following the
introduction of a voluntary code 18 months ago that banned the most
expensive promotional practices, such as lavish entertainment for doctors at
medical conferences. Nevertheless, most groups still have big overheads.
Large salesforces are an obvious target.
Many observers also expect to see a spate of mergers over the next few
years. 'We must see a significant reorganisation of the top 20 Japanese
companies over the next five to seven years,' says Mr Shigeta at Roche.
Current speculation is focused on the possibility of three large drugs
groups, Shionogi, Yamanouchi and Chugai, forming an alliance.
If companies are reluctant to rationalise themselves, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry may try to force the pace, as it has in
Japan's bulk chemicals industry.
Even then, however, the sector's prospects may not brighten significantly,
given the head start of western counterparts in R&amp;D and marketing. Japanese
drugs groups may be condemned to playing a marginal role in the
international medicines' arena.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Personal View: Taxing the skilled to cut unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'If there were a miracle cure, it would not have gone unnoticed.' True
enough, Mr Delors. The problem is getting the patients to take the pills.
Unemployment is a complex disease, and the Group of Seven ministers at next
week's jobs summit should recognise that the cure involves three sorts of
treatment. Two can be temporary: a dose of reflation; and some physiotherapy
to help the jobless back into work. But the third treatment, to reduce the
huge structural component of unemployment, is like insulin: we will have to
go on taking it for a long time.
Regarding the diagnosis of the structural unemployment problem, there is now
widespread consensus on three basic points:
The main cause is a fall in demand for unskilled labour, relative to skilled
labour, in conjunction with labour market institutions that put a floor
under unskilled wages.
Removing this floor would not solve the problem, just change its form (from
European-style open unemployment into American-style working poverty or
withdrawal into crime).
Better education and training, to reduce the supply of unskilled labour, is
a vital part of the solution, but will only work slowly - over decades, not
years.
So what else is to be done in the meantime? The answer for Europe is to find
ways of boosting relative demand for unskilled workers without reducing
their wages. Government job creation schemes could help. But making taxes on
employment strongly progressive would have a larger effect. In other words,
we should make the employer's national insurance (or, on the continent,
social security) contribution a steeply rising percentage of the employee's
wage.
The effect of a progressive payroll tax is to widen the gap between the cost
of employing skilled and unskilled workers, and hence to increase the
relative profitability of less skill-intensive products and processes. The
tax thus simulates the demand-side effects of the wider wage differentials
between skilled and unskilled workers which have enabled employment to rise
more rapidly in the US, while permitting the gap between the wages received
by skilled and unskilled workers to remain limited by European notions of
fairness.
Progressive payroll taxes are not new. Prompted by Richard Layard of the
London School of Economics, the UK in 1985 reduced employer's NI
contribution rates for the lowest-paid workers, and the last budget further
cut these reduced rates - which apply to the bottom quarter of all full-time
employees. The recent EU white paper urges the same approach for other EU
countries, in eight of which payroll taxes are now regressive. The white
paper also wants more subsidies for unskilled employment.
The problem with tax reductions and subsidies for low-paid workers is how to
finance them, though part of the cost is recouped by reduced outlays on
unemployment benefits. An attractive, symmetrical solution is to increase
the rates of tax on higher-paid workers. As well as balancing the books,
raising taxes on skilled labour amplifies the desired increase in relative
demand for unskilled labour. Collecting higher taxes on skilled workers is
also much simpler administratively than subsidising unskilled workers.
An obvious objection is that we should not discourage skilled employment at
a time when Europe needs to upgrade its industrial skills to meet
international competition.
This concern is largely misplaced - with an appropriate amount of reflation
(to absorb the formerly unemployed) a progressive payroll tax would not
reduce the absolute numbers of skilled workers employed, even though the
ratio of skilled to unskilled workers would fall (as with all other ways of
reducing unskilled unemployment).
There is, however, a more subtle and more valid objection, which is that
anything that cuts unemployment among unskilled workers while maintaining
their wages will reduce incentives to acquire skills and thus undermine
efforts to improve education and training. This disincentive may be mild,
since skill acquisition is the outcome of chance as much as choice and the
chances of children getting a decent education are reduced if their parents
are unemployed. But it probably exists.
The issue is whether the benefits of lower unemployment outweigh the costs
of lower incentives to acquire skills. Most Europeans would say yes. The
progressive payroll tax is not a free prescription, but it is worth paying
for.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Mr Balladur in retreat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The doggedness with which the French have stuck to an exceptionally rigorous
monetary policy through the present recession commands a certain respect.
So, too, does the surprisingly docile response of most of the French people
in the face of economic stagnation and rising unemployment. Yet the oddly
persuasive combination of patrician calm, monetary rigour and tactical
retreat in the face of special interests with which Mr Balladur has
confronted his public is finally losing its appeal. This week the French
prime minister's approval rating in the polls fell below 50 per cent for the
first time.
As the OECD's latest survey on France points out, the policy of competitive
disinflation could readily be justified until about mid-1992. Since then it
has looked increasingly questionable. The defence of the franc within the
exchange rate mechanism and the extreme caution that has prevailed since the
widening of the ERM bands last year have resulted in high real rates of
interest that are not justified by domestic economic conditions. Last year
output is estimated to have fallen by  3/4 per cent, unemployment rose to 12
per cent and exports, which were an engine of growth until mid-1992, have
fallen.
The OECD estimates that the low point of the cycle was reached in the second
quarter of 1993, but expects domestic demand to remain weak this year while
unemployment continues to grow to a peak of 12 1/2 per cent. The problem is
that the French, having entrusted monetary policy to the Bundesbank, are now
hostage to external fortune. Given the weakness of demand, a flagging money
supply and an underlying inflation rate of 2 per cent or less, a further
easing of monetary policy is clearly needed. Yet the Bundesbank is caught on
the hook of its own money supply numbers, which continue to run way above
target. Further rate reductions may prove to be painfully slow.
This seems a high price to pay in pursuit of the uncertain goal of monetary
union. The more Mr Balladur's government continues to wait for something to
turn up in the macroeconomy, the more it undermines its attempts to address
the problems of the supply side. There is a significant structural component
in a general government deficit that has been running at 5.8 per cent of
GDP; and while measures have been taken to reduce the cost of the state
pension system, more still needs to be done to cope with the impact of an
ageing population on both pensions and healthcare. That is difficult against
a background of recession.
Much the same can be said of labour market reform and industrial
restructuring. Air France is now to receive another substantial capital
injection after its rationalisation plans have been softened to placate the
workforce and public opinion. The tough parts of the privatisation programme
 -notably Renault where the unions remain militant - will almost certainly
be deferred until after the presidential election in 1995.
All this is worrying, given the French economy's poor performance in
generating new jobs. The risk must be that, if the rest of the European
economy does recover, France will merely enjoy jobless growth. If it fails
to recover fast, the OECD's alternative prescription of a change in policy
mix to launch a renewed assault on the budget deficit looks a political
non-option.
The French authorities are, then, taking a monumental gamble at the macro-,
microeconomic and political levels. The risks inherent in the alternative
gamble of seeking to reduce short-term interest rates to below German levels
may be less great than perceived. But the political investment in current
policy is huge. It will take a a commensurately large shock to change it.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Jail madness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
England's prison population is rising sharply. Since the beginning of last
year, the numbers have increased from 41,000 to 48,000 and are still going
up. Over the past six weeks, jails have become so overcrowded in some parts
of the country that prisoners have had to be kept in police cells. At nearly
one prisoner for every 1,000 people in the country, the UK in 1991 had a
higher proportion of its population in jail than every Council of Europe
nation apart from Hungary.
The rise in prison numbers stems from a hardening in public attitudes to
crime. The idea that society was being too soft on criminals has been picked
up by judges and reflected in their sentencing policies.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has also seen the opportunity to play
to the public mood by promising a crack-down on crime. He has instituted
policies designed to send more offenders to jail and make prison life more
austere. This is a marked u-turn from the policy of reducing the prison
population pursued by previous Conservative home secretaries.
One fear is that the mounting jail population will lead to such overcrowding
that there will be another round of prison riots like that at Strangeways in
1990. This fear was voiced by prison governors in their annual conference
yesterday.
Mr Derek Lewis, the prison service's director-general, says it is wrong to
talk about a crisis. But he admits that the situation is difficult. The
growth in the prison population has delayed reforms to end overcrowding and
'slopping out', where prisoners do not have toilets in their cells. While
prison capacity is being expanded to cope with the increased numbers, army
camps and other contingency arrangements may have to be deployed to house
prisoners if numbers rise faster than expected. All this carries a greater
risk of rioting, Mr Lewis acknowledges.
Even if the risks of riots are exaggerated, the overall policy of increasing
prison numbers is madness. Violent criminals must be jailed so long as they
are a danger to the public. But there is no sense in putting non-violent
criminals for long periods behind bars.
Not only does it cost the taxpayer about 10 times as much to keep a prisoner
in jail as to monitor a community service order. There is little evidence
that prison helps rehabilitation. Mr Douglas Hurd, when home secretary, used
to say that jail was an expensive way of making bad men worse. It is time Mr
Howard abandoned his demagogic policies and imbibed the wisdom of his
predecessors.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Folly in a privatised railway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr OWEN SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Batchelor's article 'Obstacles on the mainline' (March 7) on
BR's privatisation is timely in illuminating the intrinsic difficulties
associated with this nonsensical policy. It is difficult to see how an
adequately capitalised railway can emerge from the application of the
framework laid down in the Railways Act 1993 without changes which will be
massively detrimental to the travelling public.
Recent reports in your newspaper have indicated that annual rates of return
on their equity investments of up to 20 per cent are sought by capital
markets in the UK. These are significantly above the low rates of return
which those profitable parts of the rail business generate now (in 1992
InterCity was calculated as making a return of only 1 per cent on its
capital assets).
BR operates one of the leanest railways in Europe and scope for internal
efficiency savings is small. Returns on capital investment will therefore
likely be increased by cutting services, closing lines and increasing fares
leading to big falls in usage.
The same has occurred with bus deregulation and privatisation since 1985,
where ministers have acknowledged the follies of the policy by backtracking
on their manifesto commitment to deregulate bus provision in London. It is
hoped BR privatisation will be similarly reconsidered before irreparable
damage is inflicted on the national railways.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Relationship as 'special' as ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER M FELIX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was somewhat disappointed to read the article by Philip Stephens 'US
and UK affirm unity on policies' (March 2) concerning John Major's visit to
the US.
I think there is a great danger in playing down the significance of
Britain's relationship with the US.
Americans, as we all know, are loath to indulge in self-deprecation and
would find such an article difficult to understand.
The facts of Britain's trading relationship with the US are nothing short of
impressive. Britain is America's largest investor, and vice versa. Joint
trade between the two countries is currently at about Dollars 70bn and there
is absolutely no reason to think that the British-American trading and
investment axis will not grow in strength, in particular as both countries
are important stepping stones to their respective expanded marketplaces of
the EU and Nafta.
May I commend Mr Stephens to a more positive 'American' outlook?

FT  10 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Barclays slow to dispense its cheque
clearing policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Miss ISABEL ASHMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was delighted to read that Barclays has shown the other big banks the
way in clearing cheques in three days rather than four ('Lloyd's gives way
on cheque clearing', March 4), but perhaps this news has not yet reached
Barclays' Hammersmith, west London, branch.
On February 21 this year I paid two UK clearing bank cheques into my account
with Barclays.
Five days later, on February 26, a Barclays cash dispenser declined to
dispense cash, informing me that, although the 'balance' on my account was
substantially in credit, the 'cleared funds' available to me were
insufficient to meet my request.
On February 28 my branch told me that it could 'confirm clearance' the
following day - not three days after I paid the cheques in, not even four,
but eight days. The cheques then cleared.
Documentary evidence is to hand should Barclays wish to dispute any of the
above.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Profit margins still falling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From VALERIE BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Philip Coggan is incorrect in concluding in his article 'Mixed picture
on inflation prospects poses problems for Clarke' (March 2) that
manufacturers' margins have been widening.
Far from it. Input prices are only a relatively small proportion of total
manufacturing costs. Declines in manufacturing productivity over the past
few months, and consequent increases in unit wage costs, have been
significant contributory factors to the 3.7 per cent rise in output costs
recorded by the CSO index. Margins, according to a reading of these indices,
are flat. Further scrutiny of the official data and evidence from several
industrial sectors suggest these price indices do not fully reflect the
increasing extent of trade discounting. Taking these factors into account,
manufacturers' unit profit margins are undoubtedly still falling.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Question hangs over Channel 5
frequencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr STEPHEN CASTELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There has been considerable coverage in the Financial Times in recent
weeks of coming 'information superhighways' - digital multimedia
communications channels on inter alia satellite, cable TV or fibre
optic/telephone networks providing a wide range of (interactive)
entertainment, information and transactional services to the home or
workplace.
In this context, we have been alarmed to read reports that the Department of
Trade and Industry is considering withdrawal of the terrestrial television
frequencies which have already been allocated to the future commercial
television channel, Channel 5 - this is in connection with some 'grand, slow
plan' to introduce digital television in the UK using these frequencies -
and that the DTI may at present be negotiating with the Independent
Television Commission over such a manoeuvre.
If true, this would run counter to the government's belief in market forces
and entrepreneurial zeal as determining factors in the take-up of new
digital television. It would also be a highly damaging repudiation by the
government and the ITC of specific assurances given with respect to the
existing Broadcasting Act 1990.
We forwarded our own proprietary proposals to bid for the Channel 5 licence
on the basis of a digital transmission system delivering a unique digital
multi-channel television service. During 1991-1992, the ITC finally
confirmed to us in writing that a proprietary digital television bid for
Channel 5 was legally permissible under the act.
At the same time, we had meetings and correspondence with the DTI, the Home
Office and the prime minister. All were consistent in confirming that the
government could not, and would not, interfere in the ITC's conduct of its
obligations under the act with respect to Channel 5.
We therefore now urgently call on the ITC to acknowledge publicly the
earlier private confirmation given to us, and for the DTI to confirm
publicly that it will not interfere with the frequencies allocated for
Channel 5.
We have already spent substantial time, effort and money on our unique
digital plans for Channel 5 and are once again preparing to make a bid for
the Channel 5 licence based on a digital transmission system.
We trust we may therefore look forward to the ITC advertising the Channel 5
licence, as it is obliged to do under the act, later this year.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Economic Viewpoint: What's wrong with economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Death of Economics is the misleading title of a hyped-up book by Paul
Ormerod out on March 21. Careful reading shows that the author does not want
to bury but to reconstruct economics. Having become chief forecaster for the
National Institute of Economic and Social Research at a precocious age,
Ormerod should have both the team leadership and the computational skills to
make a serious effort to do so later; but this book is not it.
It is easy for Ormerod to score some good hits. While the book was being
written, forecasters failed to predict the Japanese recession, the strength
of the US recovery or the depth of the collapse in the German economy. And
Ormerod is right to condemn the way in which too many economists will
describe someone as a 'sociologist' as a superior form of putdown.
He wrongly assumes, however, that the only opposition to economic
scholasticism comes from the left of the political spectrum, at points
between Marx and Galbraith. He seems not to know the equally trenchant
criticisms from, for instance, the 'Austrian' school - not merely the
card-carrying members but others, such as the more empirical Schumpeter, who
concentrated on entrepreneurial initiative and poured scorn on 'perfect
competition'.
For a while I thought that his book was going to be merely another attack on
Thatcherism and Reaganism disguised as an attack on economics. Fortunately
there is more to the book than that. But Ormerod repeats like a mantra Lady
Thatcher's remark, 'There is no such thing as society', as if merely citing
it were a knock-out blow. For a demonstration that this saying can bear a
civilised and sensible interpretation, I must modestly refer readers to a
publication of my own in the accompanying list.
Ormerod seems half to believe that Thatcher-Reagan economic policies are
based on esoteric, modern General Equilibrium Theory or its close relation,
the New Classical Macroeconomics. Indeed, he accuses Conservative ministers,
as others have done, of not appreciating the extremely unlikely conditions
required for free competition between numerous agents to promote a perfect
allocation of resources.
In fact, neither political leader has been influenced by the New Classicals
or even been much aware of them. The economist who influenced Thatcher in
her formative period was Hayek, who was of course light years from current
New Classical orthodoxy both in style and in substance. He saw markets as
'discovery procedures' which are never in equilibrium and never produce an
optimum, but are the least bad method we know of co-ordinating the
activities of millions of human beings without having to make excessive
demands on their mutual knowledge and love. Thatcher was also influenced by
Hayek's assertion of a relation between a free society and market capitalism
 -topics dismissed by the New Classicals as 'not economics'.
Nearer to his home ground, Ormerod's attempt to attribute ultra free market
policies to mainstream economists flies in the face of all empirical
evidence. The Thatcher era began with the famous letter by 364 economists
denouncing the 1981 Budget - which was much like the last Budget under a
prime minister and chancellor from a very different wing of the Conservative
party. At the end, the Institute of Economic Affairs was discomfited to find
that the majority of the economists it polled deliberately distanced
themselves from government policies, above all the attempts to curb public
spending.
A less pretentious but better-focused critique of current academic economics
appeared last year by the German-American monetary economist, Thomas Mayer,
entitled Truth versus Precision. Mayer admits to favouring competitive
capitalism but to having an interest in income redistribution - for instance
via a negative income tax. He was, also, ejected from the hardline
monetarist Shadow Open Market Committee for deviationism - all of which
biases me in his favour.
Yet his book contains many passages which could equally occur in the
supposedly unique Ormerod book. He reports cynicism among younger, ambitious
academics, who follow practices such as 'sticking in the maths' so that
their articles can be published and they can obtain tenure. Another example
of the folklore of the profession is remarks by graduate students that
'policy is for simpletons'.
Mayer focuses on the practices of economists in the most prestigious
American universities. He complains that precision and mathematical
elegance, which have a legitimate place, have come to play a dominating role
in economics which they do not have even in the natural sciences. Like
Ormerod, Mayer regards what is called the New Classical Economics as, on
balance, a retrograde influence. The main propositions of this school are:
that economic agents behave as if they know the correct model; that markets
normally clear without surpluses or shortages.
The New Classicals are probably best known to practitioners in the financial
markets through the more extreme form of the 'efficient markets' hypothesis
 -which is difficult to reconcile with the recent shake-out in the bond
market, let alone the equity crashes of 1929 or 1987.
Beneath the surface populism, it is Ormerod, not Mayer, who emphasises the
mathematical side of economics. His real crusade is against what he calls
the linear view of mainstream economics. The issue can be safely left to the
modern economics industry with its heavy mathematical bent. Indeed, it is
beginning to use non-linear relationships, for instance by introducing chaos
theory. I wish I could be so confident of its ability to handle policy
problems.
Ormerod's own practical contribution is to point out that the Phillips curve
linking unemployment to inflation is liable to shift its position quite
suddenly. But during any one period, unemployment circles around a
surprisingly stable rate, and normal economic policies seem powerless to
shift the position of that 'attractor point'. This point bears a suspicious
relation to our old friend the non-accelerating inflation rate of
unemployment (or NAIRU), which Ormerod has spent several chapters trying to
kill.
Ormerod rightly complains that forecasting models downplay the role of
profits, which appears as a residual. He himself has a medium-term model
which relates economic growth to the profit share. But he has, as far as I
can tell, no better explanation than anyone else of why the underlying
unemployment rate has moved so adversely (outside the US) in recent decades;
and in his policy recommendations he falls back on work-sharing, which is
for an economist the equivalent of showing the white flag.
What has gone wrong with economics is not that mysterious. It has been the
over-emphasis on economic technique as opposed to underlying ideas. Both the
Keynesian revolution and the monetarist counter-revolution arose from
problems thrown up by real events, while the New Classical school was a
development internal to academic economics. The result, as Mayer points out
more clearly than Ormerod, is that people interested in policy are turning
more and more to schools of government or management consultants, a process
which has its costs, as we see with Clinton's trade policies. But in the end
the academic market, like others, will have to correct itself.

A CONSERVATIVE REVOLUTION? THE THATCHER-REAGAN DECADE IN PERSPECTIVE Edited
by Andrew Adonis and Tim Hames
Manchester University Press 261 pages, Pounds 35/Pounds 12.99
'The United States and Britain have together been the greatest alliance in
the defence of liberty and justice that the world has ever seen.' So said
Margaret Thatcher in New York in August 1991, placing upon record a
staggering example of her starry-eyed lack of deep analysis of such terms as
'liberty' and 'justice'.
Since the Suez fiasco in 1956, there has been no mistaking the axiom of
Britain's statecraft: in the end you have to do what the Americans want; so
best find out in advance what it is, and make sure you do it.
Parallelism between British and American policy was never clearer or closer
than during the near contemporary regimes of Ronald Reagan and Margaret
Thatcher in the 1980s, when it seemed also to reflect a personal sympathy.
Certainly, without 'the American factor' it is hard to account for Britain's
consent to submergence in a united Europe or for the direction of government
policy towards a united Ireland at Ulster's expense.
Since Mrs (now Baroness) Thatcher's departure, any personal factor has been
removed. So a book 'to explore perspectives in Anglo-American conservatism
in the Thatcher-Reagan decade', congealed out of a seminar at Nuffield
College, Oxford, in late 1991, is timely, even though two-and-a-half years
have elapsed.
Parallelism there certainly was. In part this is attributable to that
worldwide cross-infection of political thought and vocabulary which
condemned both America and Britain to see evidence of national decline in
the collapse of Keynesian orthodoxy and in the depressing global comparative
statistics of productivity and balance of trade. But the search for hard
evidence of 'the greatest alliance that the world has ever seen' proves on
the whole abortive.
The book suffers from the weakness of all symposia: the different voices
seem to be saying their own thing without visibly taking account of one
another. All the more impressive is the unanimity with which the
contributors converge on essentially the same conclusion: circumstances were
similar but the causes different in the two countries.
It all has to do with the generational nature of politics - the electorate
reacts to a continuously changing memory of the world through which it has
lived. That emerges with startling clarity from what is the centrepiece of
the book: a brilliant analysis by Andrew Adonis of the transformation of
Britain's Conservative party in the 1980s in terms of class and
self-perception.
This 'brought to the fore a Tory elite more assured in its rapport with the
electorate and more confident in its ability to sustain its support than any
in the party's modern history'. It was that altered electorate, an
electorate which no longer remembered the 1930s or the wartime years, which
gave the Conservative party the conviction that it could reverse the
consensual policies pursued by Macmillan and (after his celebrated U-turn)
by Edward Heath, and the self-confidence to administer repeated doses of the
same medicine.
The corresponding American analysis of 'Republican elites under Reagan and
Bush' by Professor John R Pitney inculcates the same generational message:
'A new generation' had 'grown up when the New Deal order seemed to be going
senile . . . in their world view the 'liberal welfare state' was not a
popular hope but a discredited relic'. By 1980 'the (Republican) party's
establishment was in deep trouble, and the unravelling of the New Deal
consensus which they represented during the 1960s confirmed their downfall'.
'Moderate Republicanism,' says Prof Pitney, 'had supported civil rights for
blacks; but the racial violence of the mid-1960s destroyed the national
consensus on civil rights and created a new electoral cleavage based on
race.
'Moderate Republicanism represented anti-communist interventions overseas;
but the Vietnam war and the domestic upheaval it brought in its wake fatally
undermined the national consensus on foreign policy issues that had existed
since the late 1940s. Finally, state interventionism in the economy and the
maintenance of the welfare system were undermined by the advent of higher
rates of inflation and the concomitant squeeze on middle-class incomes.'
Does it not all sound familiar, like a description of the way in which the
Conservative party in Britain had 'run downhill' between 1952 and 1974? An
American electorate had arisen which did not know the immediate postwar
years. These years 'were the high water mark not just for Big Government but
Big Business and Big Labour as well. Vietnam, Watergate and other upheavals
both deepened their dissatisfaction with existing institutions and
highlighted alternatives to hack politics', adds Prof Pitney.
It is no business of a symposium to arrive at any very profound conclusions;
but the outcome of this study ought to be reassuring. One of the great laws
of politics is that nations and societies may be relied upon to 'revert to
type'; and here exposed is the mechanism by which that happens.
Thatcher and Reagan were the beneficiaries of a generational conjuncture.
This precession of the generations continues remorselessly: what was
thinkable becomes unthinkable, and what was impracticable becomes
practicable. We lived to see in Britain an electorate in the 1980s which was
prepared calmly to jettison the political presumptions of the 1950s and
1960s. We could yet live to see an electorate in the US which will reject
the facile assumptions of its country as world policeman. Generation by
generation, the electorate turns upon its axis: be patient.

<TEXT>
Your fears were well founded. As its title led you to forebode, Omma -
Oedipus and the Luck of Thebes - the new play by Kenneth McLeish at the
Young Vic - is (1) postmodern, (2) swottish, (3) boring, (4) bad.
1. Postmodern. For McLeish it is not enough to re-tell the tale of Oedipus.
A time-traveller, he jumps back and forth through the pre- and post-history
of Oedipus's family; and at the same time he has to keep us oh] so
ironically detached from the whole affair. Thus his play zooms us halfway
through the scenario of Sophocles's King Oedipus; Oedipus's enquiries into
the past are in motion, Jocasta has just entered, and . . . Then one of the
cast of four says 'Enough of that,' and suddenly rattles us back through the
pre-Jocasta history of Thebes's royal family - at bewildering speed.
Next Omma fast-forwards us to Oedipus's children (the interval occurs in the
middle of this bit, by the way), pausing occasionally for the odd one-man
choral ode. What next? Back to Oedipus, Jocasta &amp; Co.
2. Swottish. When it comes to the early history of Thebes, McLeish goes
overboard. Omma rewinds through Agaue killing her son Pentheus (see The
Bacchae), and - a really obscure nugget, this - the occasion when Oedipus's
father Laius was guilty of homosexual child molestation and manslaughter. As
for the title, 'Omma' - but of course we knew this one] - means 'eye', hence
'apple of the eye', hence 'lucky charm,' hence 'luck'.
Since Thebes houses the blind prophet Tiresias, and since Oedipus blinds
himself, the eye/luck irony might be interesting . . . if only McLeish had
remembered to make it so.
3. Boring. The cast of four, directed by Tim Supple, intone Omma with a
truly rare mixture of speed, detachment, and flatness. They wear the same
black modern dress throughout, whichever characters they play (Conrad Nelson
gets to play Oedipus, Polyneikes, Eteokles, Ismene, and the main choral
odes). An impressive variety of lighting picks them out from the
encompassing gloom. And they wear head-sets (like disc-jockeys) with
microphones just before their mouths so that we hear their voices, droning
so rapidly, only as amplified through the loudspeakers. Were they attempting
the intensity of maximum restraint? or the coolness of utter objectivity?
They didn't quite achieve either.
In Act Two, Colin R. Campbell (who at this point is playing Haimon) squeezes
a bit of naturalistic vehemence into his speeches: the effect is a relief
but, in context, unstylish. As Kreon, Paul M. Meston is quite outstandingly
stony.
4. Bad. The best section is, I suppose, the Antigone part of Act Two. Here
the pace slows somewhat, McLeish's language occasionally blooms, and
something of the tone and structure of Greek tragedy loom into view.
Elsewhere, however, Omma is unconcerned with even making its main story
lucid to its audience. Poor Oedipus] He had a bad enough time anyway, but
now McLeish &amp; Co. have sunk him in obscurantism.
At The Young Vic, SE1, until April 2.

THE JOY LUCK CLUB (15) Wayne Wang
ON DEADLY GROUND (18) Steven Seagal
MY LIFE (12) Bruce Joel Rubin
PETAIN (12) Jean Marboeuf
The Joy Luck Club confirms that the most lethal device in movies is the
flashback. Gather your audience. Sit it down before a teeming screenful of
Chinese-American women celebrating 20-odd years of togetherness in San
Francisco. And then pull the time-space levers.
Suddenly there is a rush of wind and an upward flight of popcorn. The
filmgoer is plummeting into the past, where the film's four main matriarchs
re-enact the formative agonies of life in the East: those that drove them
toward the putative ecstasy of life in America. Nor do the film's
interdimensional free falls end there. After each trip we return to the
present only to be trapdoored a shorter distance into the daughters' early
lives in the West. One marries a bedhopping playboy, another a
penny-pinching control freak. A third tries to break free of her mother's
emotional hold . . .
Chinese-American film-maker Wayne Wang, whittling down novelist Amy Tan's
doorstopping bestseller for the screen, succeeds beyond reasonable
expectation. As Wang's early films showed (Chan Is Missing, Dim Sum), he has
a photographer's eye for finding distinctive faces and using light to sculpt
them to comic or poignant effect.
After ten minutes of mild confusion, we feel we know these eight women as
well as they know each other. Better still: we want to know more about them
and about the raw emotions that lie behind the refined social masks. France
Nuyen is the playboy-marrying daughter, carrying her sadness behind a
curtain of dark hair. Tamlyn Tomita (of Come See The Paradise) is the
childhood chess prodigy who grows up to be outflanked by life and love. Best
of all, Tsai Chin is the sternly stoical mother who still wears the scars of
the arranged marriage she endured - and escaped - in childhood.
This story produces the film's funniest single flashback moment: the first
sighting of her groom. Fearing an older man, the girl looks up to glimpse
something even worse - a fat boy carrying a large grin and a pet iguana.
'Maybe I prayed too hard,' murmurs her voice-over narration.
The scene typifies Wang's haiku-like economy with word and image. However
kleenex-intensive some stories are, however hard the string section soars
and sighs, The Joy Luck Club has the hard bright light of human reality.
Produced by Oliver Stone, this is the East-meets-West film that Heaven And
Earth should have been. Produced for Disney, it shows this studio can make
films with a mature emotional glow for adults as well as sparklers and
schmaltz packages for the young.
'What does it take to change the essence of a man?' philosophises someone in
the Alaska-set thriller On Deadly Ground. Two possible answers. One: a deep
emotional or spiritual experience. Or two, as in the case of the film's
villain played by Michael Caine, a pint of black hairdye and some deep-tan
face make-up. Not to mention an accent poised somewhere between Nebraska and
Neasden. Given Caine's new portly frame, he looks like Robert Maxwell
ventriloquised by a bad Cary Grant impersonator.
This evil oil tycoon wishes to shortcut safety procedures on his new
platform, so that he can open it before the expiry date is reached on his
drilling licence. Otherwise the land will revert to the Eskimos. 'Eskimo'
here means a fur-clad actor speaking in a rare language called Eco-babble:
this runs to sentences like: 'The great bear will sigh in the grass if the
white devil poisons our watery hunting ground . . .'
'The hell with the gahd-dam Eskimos,' raves Caine. But his ace
troubleshooter and fire-fighter Mr Seagal thinks differently. Furrowing
eyebrows that already look as if they were knitted on a grim day by Mme
Defarge, he joins the Eskimo cause and even one of their tribes. (Cue
interlude of ethno-romantic rapprochement a la Dances With Wolves). From
here, clad in a native fur ensemble that would cost Dollars 1000 on Rodeo
Drive, our hero marches forth to destroy the rig and Mr Caine in a climax
that is almost as enjoyable as it is ridiculous.
Did we mention that Seagal directed this film? And that he delivers its
astonishing closing speech, in which the entire industrial world is taken to
task for using fossil fuels 100 years after they could have been made
obsolete. As we all know today, cars can be driven on methane or hot air or
wave-power or possibly even two 1.5V batteries rubbed together. So why
aren't they? Mr Seagal is furious, and he is backed up here by Warner Bros:
a studio not yet noted for its fleet of methane-fuelled limousines, but
certainly known for the supplies of hot air used to energise some other
vehicles.
Not all in movies is new green hope for the morrow. The terminal ward of
western cinema is still busy, with Michael Keaton checking into one of the
bedspaces recently vacated by Debra (Shadowlands) Winger and Tom
(Philadelphia) Hanks. In My Life, written and directed by ex-Ghost scenarist
Bruce Joel Rubin, cancer patient Keaton has only a few months to live;
though it seems longer to us as we watch the ailing Los Angeles PR executive
video-record his life and thoughts for the yet-unborn child of his pregnant
wife Nicole Kidman.
'How to play basketball', 'How to cook spaghetti' and 'How to enter a room'
(sic) are some of the chapters in this audiovisual primer. And he could have
included one on 'How to keep a press show audience fidget-less in its
seats.' Sentimentality is rampant. Not content with being the grim
lens-wielder of Beverly Hills, Keaton must be allowed several reels of
drooling over his newborn child. (Yes, he lives long enough to annoy the
maternity ward by video-recording the birth.) He also has a Mom and Pop with
whom he must patch up old grudges before the curtain-time.
How the rich and self-obsessed die is, of course, one of the great subjects
of American cinema. But even by movieland's standards of maudlin
self-massage, My Life is heavy-duty material.
Keaton does his best with the terminal make-up and stoical wisecracks. But
Miss Kidman, a bright, sensible actress, looks deepeningly unhappy as she
passes from underscripted wife to underscripted mother while wearing the
chic-est maternity smocks in California.
No escape this week even at the arthouse. Given the few foreign-language
films that enter Britain, how remarkable that Petain can be among them.
'Pedestrian' is an understatement for this walking-wounded movie recreating
the sad story of Vichy France. Jean Dufilho is Petain, a white moustache
delivering a series of beleaguered dicta; Jean Yanne is the growl and five
o'clock shadow called Laval (Petain's Hitler-supporting premier, later
executed by the Allies); and Jean Marboeuf is the director of a film that
lasts 2 1/4 -hours and never varies its history-class-for-idiots pacing.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Arts: Monteverdi's 'Venetian Vespers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trying to recreate the golden period of St Mark's, Venice is not easy more
than three centuries later. In the 30 years Monteverdi spent there both he
and the other composers wrote any amount of fine music that has come down to
us, but the atmosphere of that thriving period is inevitably lost.
As research delves ever deeper, so the desire increases to hear the sacred
music performed within the context for which it was intended. Andrew Parrott
and his Tavener Consort have been at the forefront of this movement. On
Tuesday, at St John's, Smith Square, they gave what they claimed to be the
first performance in modern times of the 'Venetian Vespers' set within a
reconstruction of a religious service, as it might have been heard.
This is not the famous Vespers of 1610, written for Mantua. Two collections
were published of the church music that Monteverdi subsequently wrote in
Venice, the latter in 1650 after his death. Parrott has turned to that
posthumous publication and sought to fill it out with additional music to
form a full Vespers service. The extra pieces include instrumental works by
Cavalli, Fontana and Uccellini, and three diverse Monteverdi motets.
A degree of informed guesswork is necessary to put all this in place.
Suffice to say that the result is more varied than simply performing the
1650 Messa et Salmi as it stands. The concentrated thinking of the
Monteverdi psalms is dispersed by light and flamboyant violin sonatas and
the measured, restful sections of plainchant.
Ever since the Tavener Consort's memorable recording of Bach's B Minor Mass
one-to-a-part, it has been clear that Parrott favours private communing, not
public celebration in the performance of religious music. His Monteverdi is
naturally on the same lines (the music for Venice was written with small
instrumental forces in mind).
The solo singing among the Tavener Consort was modest; British singers often
fail to respond to Latin languages and barely a word of the solo 'O quam
pulchra es', for example, was intelligible. It is a shame that Italian
musicians have played so little part in the revival of their great music. St
Mark's is there, awaiting its own musical renaissance.

Three entertaining series come to an end tonight. Aside from Christmas
specials, and perhaps even the occasional non-Christmas special, we are
assured that after 15 years Minder will end today. As ever the episode title
is a cinema pastiche: 'The Long Good Thursday'. The story has Arthur Daley
(Flash Harry, 40 years on from St Trinian's) going into the restaurant
business with a nice little earner called Cosa Noshtra (8.30 ITV).
The second series of Jennifer Saunders' comedy Absolutely Fabulous also
comes to an end, with Edina, Patsy and Saffron remembering their time in the
womb. This second series has not been as good as the first, but nor has it
been as bad as some have said (9.30 BBC1). That is followed by Ben Elton's
stand-up comedy programme The Man From Auntie (10.00 BBC1).
BBC2 begins a series about Britain's most famous steeplejack, Life With Fred
(8.00). We have been watching Fred Dibnah reducing tall mill chimneys to
rubble since 1979. Now, with a new wife 20 years his junior and most of the
chimneys gone, it seems that life is changing.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Arts: An efficient Swiss pianist - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago, the young Swiss pianist Andreas Haefliger made his Wigmore Hall
debut to great acclaim. When he etched a treble line, one remembered that
his father Ernst has been a Bach tenor of fine, selflessly impassioned
finesse; but Haefliger fils has genial virtues of his own - above all, a
toughly refined lust for what his chosen instrument can be made to do, to
express.
On Tuesday his second Wigmore appearance confirmed all that, but without
striking any new sparks. It was less exciting than his first time round. His
best came at opposite ends of the evening. First, in Beethoven's A-flat
Sonata op. 26 he pursued long, lyrical sense high and low, whilst doing full
honour to the big contrasts between movements. That was a performance of
lovely, controlled warmth. At the end Haefliger flung several Rakhmaninov
preludes and etudes-tableaux at us with terrific energy and flair.
That last splash made up for some faceless playing in mid-programme. Last
year, this pianist expounded Schumann's Davidsbundlertanze with a rare,
judicious boldness, turning boudoir subtleties into more vital stuff. This
time the same composer's Kreisleriana fared less well. Though Haefliger
delivered its almost incessant etude-figurations in great sweeps, a heart
more candidly on the sleeve would have been welcome. Too much of the
sequence sounded of a smooth, efficient muchness. As a whole Kreisleriana is
super-charged, intricate and harried; we need warmer idylls when Schumann
can suspend his virtuoso machinery in favour of lean, poignant effusions.
It may be that Haefliger's cool-ish Kreisleriana, and his un-visionary Sixth
Sonata of Skryabin - expert and tremulously decadent though it was - lost
out simply through imperfect rapport with the instrument, or with the
Wigmore acoustic. One felt him loyally suppressing his own
piano-personality, when we would have liked to hear it plain.
At least his Rakhmaninov group was extrovert and exhilarating, with
rapid-fire chord-showers. Just before it, every one of Sofia Gubaidulina's 9
Pieces from 'Musical Toys' enjoyed an original half-jokey resonance of its
own. A cartoon-picturesque episode here, a laconic moral there, a touch of
grace somewhere else: genuinely creative, appealing fun, and not trivial at
all.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Technology: New tools, old-style newspaper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The convergence of the computer, broadcasting and publishing industries into
the multimedia sector has led many pundits to predict the demise of
traditional newspapers and magazines.
While this may be premature, a number of companies are already exploring
alternatives to existing news and magazine formats. Newsweek has launched a
quarterly interactive CD-Rom video magazine.
Hearst plans to launch on-line computer services tied to magazines like
Popular Mechanics, House Beautiful and Good Housekeeping. On-line electronic
news services are sprouting up everywhere.
One of the most ambitious projects is a computerised newspaper being put
together by Knight-Ridder, the US-based wire service and newspaper group.
Knight-Ridder's approach is unusual in that it attempts to incorporate new
technology into today's newspaper format, rather than vice versa. The
company's Info Design Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado has novel views on
what readers' preferences will be in the next century. While others are
rapidly discarding today's formats in the race towards the future,
Knight-Ridder's maxim is that its new electronic newspaper should resemble
an old-fashioned newspaper as much as possible.
Much of today's research into electronic newspapers, such as that of the
Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, concentrates
on filtering information. For instance, an avid sports reader might elect to
receive news electronically on that subject alone.
Knight-Ridder, however, thinks it is essential to maintain a human editor
who packages a set of articles. Roger Fidler, who is in charge of the
project, says the information age is in danger of over-filtering
information. 'We want to maintain the reader's ability to browse, and we
want to build the branded identity of the 'Daily Us'.'
The Info Design Lab plans to begin tests of its product on personal
computers by the end of the year. However, the company is counting on a new
generation of hand-held, keyboard-free computers to make its product
available to the mass market. These would be light and easily portable.
'I don't think the formula of having people read their news on the
television or a back-lit computer screen has worked,' says Fidler. 'We are
looking to use computer tablets, the size of a magazine. New resolution and
new types of liquid crystal make them easier to read. Really, they resemble
a magazine to the reader.'
In the vision of Knight-Ridder, consumers could subscribe to this newspaper
or buy it at a newsstand, as they would today. The difference is that they
would receive the newspaper electronically over the wire at night or in the
morning purchase a memory card, about the size of a credit card, which could
be inserted into the hand-held device.
This formula prevents constant news updates, a service many see as essential
to compete in the new multimedia age. Fidler, however, believes that
consumers are uncomfortable with updates throughout the day. 'It would make
people feel they're always missing something.'
The Knight-Ridder electronic newspaper will make in-depth information
available. By touching the screen, consumers will be able to reveal story
stacks, and additional information such as charts, tables and videos.
Even advertisements will be stacked in layers to entice the consumer.
Readers will be able to obtain additional information about a product,
activate video commercials and order products with a built-in device.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Technology: Patent benefit on-line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM CLAYTON

<TEXT>
From this month , it will be much easier to find patents held at the British
Library in central London. The increasing use of CD-Rom is helping to
control the largest collection in the world, with material from Europe, the
US and Japan.
The library contains 34m patents, increasing by about 1m a year. To cope
with this volume of material, plus a year's worth of scientific books and
periodicals also housed at the library, requires almost 2km of extra shelf
space each year.
Many people come in person to search the collection; more use the library's
Patent Express service which sends copies by post, courier and fax.
People search the collections for various reasons. Inventors need to be sure
their brainchild is original. Companies use searches to watch competitors or
guard against wasteful research and development.
Recently, the process of applying for a patent has become much easier. Under
the European Patent Convention only a single application is needed for a
patent to be granted in up to 14 countries. In addition, the Patent
Co-operation Treaty provides the basis for a single international
application.
Eighteen months after a successful application, a patent is published by the
Patent Office and can be anything from two or three pages in length to
several hundred, the average being 10 to 12. As well as being printed
conventionally, a copy is scanned and put on to a CD-Rom which can hold
about 1,000.
An exchange network has been set up between patent libraries around the
world which swap CD-Roms.
The development is also bringing significant benefits for both storage and
searching. Looking through an on-line database is obviously quicker than
consulting bound volumes on the shelves and makes it possible to carry out
complicated searches.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Technology: A good read on screen - Digitalisation and
CD-Rom are shaking up the publishing industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Books have changed surprisingly little since the printing press was invented
400 years ago, but a metamorphosis may soon set in. Digitalisation and
CD-Rom technology, which allow vast amounts of information to be stored on a
compact disc, are shaking up the staid publishing sector.
'A book today looks pretty much like it did a century or two ago,' says
Valerie Hyman, a member of the faculty at the Poynter Institute media
think-tank in Florida. 'But technological changes will profoundly affect
this industry over the next two decades.'
Known as electronic publishing or computerised publishing, these changes are
already calling into question the very concept of a book. One company,
Voyager, is already printing books on CD-Rom for reading on a computer
screen. Other companies are exploring book-on-demand printing, which offers
custom-designed texts.
'Publishing in the future will look more like a computer database,' says
Joseph Dionne, chairman and chief executive officer of McGraw-Hill, which is
becoming increasingly involved in electronic publishing. 'The idea is to be
able to mix up the information and give to customers exactly what they want
when they want it.'
Primis, a subsidiary of McGraw-Hill which was developed with technology from
Eastman Kodak and RR Donnelly, has put a new slant on the textbook market by
allowing for customised printing at the bookstore. A professor 'designs' a
textbook by selecting chapters, passages and other information from a
selection of materials.
The data are then digitalised and stored in Primis' computer. A student who
needs the textbook can walk into a bookstore, place an order and receive the
book through a computer link-up in a matter of minutes. (Primis' printers
put out 90 pages a minute.) So far, only a small number of bookstores have
this capability, but Primis expects the market to grow.
The computerised method offers a number of advantages. 'The professor gets a
textbook that exactly fits the course material,' says Suzanne Bedell,
publisher at Primis. 'And the students don't have to spend money for
extraneous materials.' The textbooks can also be updated easily from
semester to semester, particularly important for courses in the sciences and
politics.
Xerox also wants to enter on-demand publishing. The company introduced
high-speed Docu-Tech printers into the market four years ago and has been
building up a database. Xerox is operating on-demand printing in about 30
test sites and plans to launch the product in the general market later this
year.
'One problem for us has been binding the book on-site,' says Peter Galton,
marketing manager for Docu-Tech. 'But this year, we'll be introducing the
capability to create covers on the spot. We can do either case-bound
hardbacks or perfect-bound paperbacks.' Xerox says it will also be able to
print colour illustrations and graphics in the Docu-Tech products. 'Once you
capture the information digitally, you can print almost anything,' says
Galton.
With the move to digitalisation, the lines between fiction, film, education,
books, research and entertainment will become increasingly fuzzy. Primis
already has plans to include videos of professors' lectures with some of its
products.
Voyager has gone a step further by trying to change not only the way books
are put together but also the way they are read. It is marketing books on
CD-Rom which are meant to be read on the computer. The company's version of
Macbeth, for instance, features Shakespeare's original text, additional
annotations, and a computer-screen video of a performance of the play by the
Royal Shakespeare Company.
If a reader does not understand a word, explanations and definitions can be
revealed by putting the indicator on a word, and pressing a key. Other
annotations can be obtained in a similar way. At any point in the text, the
reader can also activate the video; this appears in the corner of the
computer screen and the pages of the text automatically turn as the play
progresses.
'As CD-Rom technology progresses to include more memory, we hope to expand
the video part of the screen and diminish the text,' says Michael Cohen,
producer/editor at Voyager.
Electronic publishing is bound to trigger profound changes in the industry.
The concept of bookshops and libraries may change completely. 'The bookstore
and library of the future will hold no inventory, just databases,' says
Dionne. The idea is that customers will make their selections from the
computer, and leave with their computer disc or on-demand book in hand.
By reducing up-front costs for the publisher, the technology may help new
authors. 'Because the publisher doesn't have to invest in printing hundreds
or thousands of books that might not be sold, this lowers the risk to
publishers,' says Paul Aiken, attorney for the Authors' Guild. 'That means
they should be more willing to take a chance on new authors, and this should
allow more titles to become available on the market.'
However, the guild is concerned about how the technology will keep track of
copyright. 'If just a chapter of someone's book is being used, how will the
payment be accounted for?' Aiken asks. 'And what if the author doesn't want
the work taken out of context like that? These are complex issues that must
be addressed.'
Another uncertainty is the extent to which the reading of books on the
computer will take the place of reading a printed book. 'I think there's
room for both,' says Galton. 'Computer screen books may be appealing in some
instances, but there's something aesthetic about a bound book, and something
comforting about curling up in bed with a book.'

FT  10 MAR 94 / People: Hodgson: resuscitating another dying brand
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Howard Hodgson (right) is starting to flex his muscles at Halkin Holdings -
formerly Hoskins Brewery - by appointing Arthur Till, 50, as managing
director of Ronson, the cigarette lighter and pen company acquired by Halkin
in December last year. The appointment is part of Hodgson's efforts to
return the Ronson brand name to past glories, when it was once almost a
generic name for cigarette lighters.
'It's interesting. Market research suggests that while Ronson is very well
known by people aged 35 and over, it's much less familiar to under-35s,'
says Hodgson, who is determined to rectify that imbalance, which is, he
feels, a strategic marketing problem.
Till has a strong marketing background, having worked for Colgate-Palmolive
before joining Johnson Wax in 1973. Before joining Ronson, Till was director
of business development and marketing services for Johnson Wax Europe, a
business with turnover of Dollars 900m. His appointment is given extra
resonance as his background in household aerosol products will be useful at
Ronson's own household products' division, Chirton.
Hodgson, who made a fortune in the 1980s with his family firm of undertakers
which he transformed into PHKI and published a book called How To Be Dead
Rich, paid Pounds 10m for Ronson and Pounds 9.5m for the gift company LGW.
'The Ronson name has not been damaged and although you might think that I am
again back in the dying business, that's not quite true,' argues Hodgson.
'In east Europe and the Far East smoking is still very popular and on the
increase. We are in the gift business, and as well as lighters and pens we
plan to bring out watches and other accessories, using the Ronson brand
name. The watch will be consistent with that brand image, which is not
Cartier but more a Marks and Spencer, value-for-money product.'

FT  10 MAR 94 / People: Clinch goes full blast into ICI in UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Australian Peter Clinch, 53, has been given the job of putting a bit more
bang behind ICI Explosives, the world's biggest supplier of commercial
explosives and blasting technology. He replaces Bob Clark, 57, as chief
executive of ICI Explosives, on April 1.
Clinch, an executive director of ICI Australia, takes charge of a company
which can trace its origins back to Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite in
1867. Nobel Industries was one of the four companies which merged to form
ICI in 1926.
ICI Explosives, which recently moved its headquarters back to Britain from
Canada, is one of ICI's five core businesses. In terms of turnover of Pounds
643m it is ICI's smallest business but last year its trading profits of
Pounds 52m accounted for nearly a fifth of the total.
Clinch, who has a civil engineering degree from Sydney University, joined
ICI in 1965 as a works study engineer at the group's plastics factory in
Botany Bay. Bob Clark, who has headed ICI Explosives since 1988, retires in
June after 33 years with the group.

FT  10 MAR 94 / People: Maxwell: new man for the Pru
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Maxwell, ousted from his job as chief executive of plasterboard
manufacturer BPB Industries after only nine months, has turned up in the
position of corporate development director for the Prudential, Britain's
largest insurer.
Chief executive Mick Newmarch says he is very pleased to have Maxwell
aboard, and that his new recruit turned down at least two other 'very
senior' jobs in favour of the Pru. Maxwell was reckoned to have done a good
job as finance director of BPB, but to have found the transition to chief
executive difficult in an industry he previously knew nothing about. He was
also criticised for spending too much time talking to the City. Between 1986
and 1992, however, he had run the Provincial Group, the UK's largest
privately-owned financial services company, and had also previously had
experience at Grand Metropolitan and Rank Xerox.
Two years ago, Newmarch brought in Laurel Powers-Freeling as head of group
strategy, but, unlike Maxwell, not on to the main board. She has, according
to her wish, recently transferred to line management, supervising the Pru's
attempts to reach higher networth, more financially aware customers, says
Newmarch. Now that the overall strategy has been enunciated, it is Maxwell's
job to monitor its implementation.
At the same time, Sir Martin Jacomb, 63, becomes a non-executive director.
Jacomb has recently stepped down from the deputy chairmanships of Barclays
Bank and Commercial Union.
A former deputy chairman of the Securities &amp; Investments Board, he was a
central architect of the City's self-regulatory structure, whereas Newmarch
is a vociferous advocate of a single tier of statutory regulation for retail
financial services. 'I concede I honestly hadn't contemplated that,' says
Newmarch, who points out that his own concerns about self-regulation pertain
to retail rather than institutional business. 'We have had a series of
conversations, but we haven't discussed that. No doubt he'll offer his
opinion, but he'll also listen to ours.'
Jim Sutcliffe, deputy md of the home service division, also joins the main
board.

FT  10 MAR 94 / People: Brady lends weight to UK funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Brady, the former US treasury secretary and designer of the Latin
American debt reduction process, is lending his weight to two UK funds
investing heavily in the region. He is to become non-executive chairman of
both Templeton Emerging Markets investment trust, which has large holdings
in Latin America, and the newly-launched Templeton Latin American investment
trust.
Brady was appointed to the US treasury by Ronald Reagan, and continued to
serve under George Bush. His name became linked to Latin America when he
came up with a mechanism for lifting the region's burden of debt by
exchanging reduced debt for bonds. Before joining the treasury, Brady's
career was in investment banking, with Dillon, Read &amp; Co. He left office in
January 1993 when Clinton took over.
Brady recently became head of Darby Overseas Investments, a Washington-based
company also investing in Latin America. Daniel Marx, the managing director
of Darby, is to become a non-executive director of Templeton's Latin
American trust. Marx was formerly a debt negotiator for Argentina, and until
recently the under-secretary of finance there. He has taken an active role
in the Argentinian privatisation process; about 20 companies are due to be
privatised within two years.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Accountancy Column: Transformation of practice not always as
easy as ABC - A look at the challenges facing management accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL BROMWICH and ALNOOR BHIMANI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the late 1980s, management accounting has faced the strongest and most
vociferous challenges ever for its transformation. The profession needs to
embrace new initiatives without throwing out all the experience of the past.
New forms of technology, 'leaner' production and organisational processes,
and demands for product quality and diversity at the lowest cost have all
encouraged more receptive attitudes to new management ideas. There has been
a greater willingness to question existing long established practices, and
to borrow ideas from other countries.
Advocates of the transformation of management accounting have urged the use
of a rich portfolio of new techniques and processes including activity-based
costing (ABC) - which allocates overheads between the different components
of the production process - and its more advanced variants, such as
activity-based budgeting and activity-based cost management.
Our new book* that coincides with the 75th anniversary of the Chartered
Institute of Management Accountants proposes various immediate needs for
change. It also warns of the pitfalls of jettisoning management accounting
approaches which have stood the test of time in favour of unthinkingly
deploying a variety of emerging accounting techniques which are not proven
to be superior.
First, it is essential to recognise that the management accountant has a
duty to go beyond fulfilling a watchdog function and needs positively to
develop mechanisms of significant use to managers.
One area of great promise is a much greater use of non-financial
information, reflecting the enormous explosion of - often real time -
information available from production processes. At present, there is a lack
of research and documented practical experience of the changes needed in
management accounting in globalised businesses.
The current fast pace of developments has created an environment generally
conducive to reform, making it far easier for the accountant to act as an
agent of change than ever before. This is especially true when working in
cross-functional managerial teams operating near to the market. Management
accountants can help mobilise managers in ways which would otherwise be
neglected.
Accounting mechanisms do not operate in isolation from organisational or
managerial factors. In exploring the potential of novel techniques in
management accounting, attention must be paid to inter-relationships between
accounting activities and other business processes. Accounting must be
grounded far more fully in the technology of the enterprises than
previously.
Many companies are experimenting with new accounting approaches, and others
have gone further. Novelty has become convention in many cases and the
change is irreversible.
However, even a combination of new techniques can neither shore up a poorly
managed organisation nor convert badly managed businesses into those on the
leading edge. Such typical problems need far more than a change in
accounting techniques.
Accounting's role often expands as enterprise activities grow. For example,
manufacturer-supplier relationships are in many industries becoming much
more partnership oriented, allowing greater contact between purchasers and
suppliers. This requires an expansion of the role of accounting in
channelling information effectively and in helping to improve the joint
efficiency of such partnerships.
It seems to be difficult to make significant changes to accounting systems,
perhaps because they reflect both informal and formal organisational
structures and may help to sustain the organisation's power structure.
For whatever reason, it can be reasonably said that only about 10 per cent
of large companies are using activity-based costing in a substantial way.
Many others are still thinking about it or are involved in fairly minor
experiments.
There is no doubt that activity-based costing is better than using simply
the volume of production units when trying to understand overheads that vary
directly as a result of clear and unique factors.
However, the conditions required to legitimately apply these approaches are
more restrictive than has been recognised. The use of ABC works best where
factors that affect costs can be identified and where each activity can be
demonstrated or assumed to be relatively unaffected by the level of the
company's other activities.
Its use in suitable circumstances helps to make understandable the behaviour
of some costs which are presently lumped together as overheads and then
allocated. It also helps to make the behaviour of some costs far more
visible, especially those which yield benefits to the consumer. These
include quality and warranty, and those associated with manufacturing
flexibility, which are more controllable and more susceptible to cost
management. By contrast, traditional management accounting methods submerge
these costs as general overheads.
A significant contribution of ABC is the strategic and management questions
it poses, making the technique a general decision-making tool rather than
purely an accounting technique.
Accounting control measures can be used in a way that sometimes induces
short termism by managers. The concern with monthly variances, many of which
are beyond the control of managers, provides one example. In many instances,
planning and monitoring performance may be improved if the emphasis is
shifted away from the specific responsibility for mistakes to using the
information for re-planning and development.
There is a strong argument for companies to introduce a strategic dimension
to accounting. They should determine the costs associated with strategies
employed by the business and monitor the cost structure of competitors.
Strategic management accounting (SMA) seeks to make such costs visible to
management and allows strategy to be forced down the organisation. A major
difficulty possibly inhibiting the use of SMA is the perception that it
makes impossible information demands. However, much of the information
needed for strategic management accounting is already collected by 'well
managed' companies.
The Japanese practice of 'target costing' has a role to play here. Target
costing takes the price of a product or service from the market, thereby
determining the maximum production cost required to support this price, and
seeks in planning to reduce existing costs to such a level.
It is not suggested that this and other Japanese techniques should be
unthinkingly introduced. But their emphasis on using accounting for
continuous cost reduction, such as 'taxing' expensive uses of components or
labour, should be considered.
Leading edge management accounting in both theory and practice is addressing
relevant modern problems tied to the search for world class competitiveness,
customer orientation and dynamic entrepreneurialism.
A major aim must be to position the management accountant to play a full
role in both the increasing number of more informally managed and
cross-functional organisations and in the full set of relationships
encountered in modern organisations.
These are key ingredients of growth, not just for the profession but for
industrial concerns and the national economy as a whole.
