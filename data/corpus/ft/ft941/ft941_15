FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (3): Roadblocks hinder free flow
 -The complicated regulatory maze on the US highway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<TEXT>
A great number of road blocks need to be removed before the information
superhighway stretches unhindered across the US.
At present, an immensely complicated regulatory and legal maze restricts
competition between the various industries trying to secure a place on the
highway. And the federal government has to establish public policy goals to
ensure reasonable access to the network for all Americans.
The central difficulty is that the framework governing America's
communications industries reflects a world which in many respects is
becoming anachronistic - where telephone lines were scarce resources and the
industry was viewed as a 'natural monopoly'.
For much of the past century that monopoly was embodied in American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which provided local telephone services across much
of the US (though other phone companies, notably GTE, provide services in a
patchwork of other regions) and linked the nation together with its monopoly
long-distance service.
This settled framework began to change in the late 1960s and early 1970s
when a small, upstart phone company called MCI Communications began to
challenge AT&amp;T's hold on the long-distance market. The conflict that
developed between them played a large part in prompting an anti-trust
investigation of AT&amp;T which in 1984 led to the court-ordered break-up of the
group. AT&amp;T was required to spin off its local operations into seven
separate 'Baby Bell' companies. Fearing that these would use their monopoly
profits to compete unfairly in other markets, the court banned them from the
long-distance market, the manufacture of equipment and information services.
This left AT&amp;T with: its long distance business, which had to compete
against rivals such as MCI on a much more level playing field; its Bell
Laboratories research arm; and its equipment manufacturing operations.
In 1991, the Baby Bells managed to get the courts to lift the ban on them
providing information services. However, they - and every other telephone
company - remain barred under 1984 legislation from owning and delivering a
cable television service in the area where they operate a conventional
telephone service.
The cable companies, which are regulated by some state agencies and many
municipal franchising authorities, have thus been able to remain de facto
monopolies until now.
Over the past few years market forces and technological change have begun
battering at this 1984 framework. State and federal regulators have allowed
small, nimble rivals to cream off a little of the Baby Bells' business
traffic, and MCI is now threatening to enter this area and bring to the
local market the same competition it introduced into long distance. Cable
television companies are also threatening to provide alternative telephone
services to domestic customers.
The Baby Bells, for their part, are getting into the cable business. In a
landmark court case, Bell Atlantic last year won the right to compete
against cable companies in its own operating area, after successfully
arguing that the 1984 cable act infringed its right to free speech. Several
other Baby Bells now have similar cases pending before the courts.
The Bell companies are also redoubling their long-time campaign to be
allowed into the long-distance market. Ameritech, the Chicago-based local
operator, is making this a quid pro quo for it opening up its entire network
in the state of Illinois to competition.
BellSouth is arguing before the courts that AT&amp;T should not be allowed to
complete its Dollars 12bn takeover of McCaw Cellular - the largest cellular
phone operator in the US, and a wireless competitor to many Baby Bells -
until the Bell companies are allowed to compete in long-distance and
equipment manufacturing.
However, this sniping on multiple fronts may be subsumed this year by
comprehensive legislation now before Congress, which has the broad backing
of the Clinton White House, though it may propose some modification to the
two bills.
Vice-President Al Gore, a long-time expert on telecommunications matters,
has made the creation of the 'information superhighway' an important plank
of government policy.
The administration does not intend to finance this itself, but it wants to
clear away the road blocks to private sector investment.
One bill, the so-called Markey/Fields legislation, would give new
competitors, including the cable operators, the right to compete with local
telephone companies and use their facilities on a non-discriminatory basis
to interconnect with consumers.
The bill would also allow the federal authorities to over-ride the myriad
state laws and regulations which govern the telephone industry and might
impede this goal. In return, the phone companies would be free to set up
video services in competition with cable, though they would still be barred
from buying local cable operators. The aim here would be to preserve two
suppliers of multi-media services, rather than creating one new and yet more
powerful local monopoly in each area.
The second bill, the so-called Brooks/Dingell legislation, would allow the
Baby Bells to escape their chains and enter the manufacturing industry after
a one-year wait and the long-distance market after five years.
But while most interested parties are agreed that this is a sensible, broad
framework for legislation, there are going to be many fierce battles over
the fine print, as the protagonists fight for advantage.
One important issue is how to fulfil a commitment to 'universal service' -
allowing anyone to have a phone service in their home at reasonable cost, no
matter how remote their location - which has been embodied in US legislation
since the landmark Communications Act of 1934.
The local telephone companies have achieved this by subsiding their
residential rates by overcharging business and long-distance customers. But
they can no longer do this when they have lost their monopoly power to
impose higher prices on business customers.
At the same time, new local competitors will not be keen to pick up the
universal service mantle, since their natural instinct will be to focus on
the most profitable customers.
There is general agreement that a mechanism has to be found which ensures
that all providers of basic services share proportionately in the cost of
subsidies.
MCI, for example, has suggested that each carrier should contribute a
percentage of its total telecommunications transmission and switching
revenue. The money would be pooled and administered by an independent third
party, which would allow customers to 'spend' their universal service
benefit with the local service provider of their choice.
But even defining what should constitute universal service in an interactive
multi-media age could prove troublesome. Simply limiting it to a basic phone
service would risk turning densely populated urban areas into information
'haves' and rural areas into 'have nots'.
Yet until it becomes clearer what consumer demand really exists for the new
services, it will be hard to decide what should be universally available.
And these ideas are bound to change as services yet undreamt-of are added to
the system.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (2): Where content will be king
 -Creative media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the world of inter-active, multi-media entertainment, content will be
king.
That, at least, is the current conventional wisdom, which argues that in an
age when households will have access to a vast array of information on
demand, some of the most profitable businesses will be those creating
popular, original entertainment and information services.
In other words, the hardware binding together the information superhighway
will be nothing without the software which encourages consumers to take a
trip on the highway.
Certainly, the coming of the multi-media age presents big opportunities and
huge challenges for the creative industries of film and television
production, publishing, video games, and advertising.
The important role film and television programmes are expected to play in
the new era has been underlined by the recent Dollars 10bn takeover battle
for Paramount Communications, owner of the Hollywood studio Paramount
Pictures.
The battle was won by cable television company Viacom, creator of the MTV
pop video music channel, which defeated QVC, the television shopping network
headed by Mr Barry Diller, a leading Hollywood executive who wanted to use
Paramount to build a multi-media empire.
Paramount was sold for more than most Wall Street analysts thought it was
worth because both bidders were gambling that the price of scarce Hollywood
assets will rise in a multi-media age as the demand for good film and
television content outstrips supply.
At the same time, the increasingly global nature of the entertainment
industry - with satellites beaming shows to homes across Europe and Asia -
offers new profit opportunities to film producers. According to Veronis,
Suhler, a New York investment bank, Hollywood's international sales will
make up just over 50 per cent of the total by 1997, compared to 38 per cent
in 1987.
But while the film and television industry's multi-media future looks
reasonably bright, there are large question marks.
First, some analysts suggest that the inter-active era may simply shift
consumption patterns - for example, from renting videos to pay-per-view TV
films - rather than increase the number of hours people spend watching
movies and films.
Second, the creation of the information superhighway could remove some of
the power of the large Hollywood studios. In a world of potentially
limitless television channels, low budget programmers, making use of cheap
digital production and editing tools, could take precise aim at market
niches, fragmenting the general TV audience.
A forerunner of this move from broadcasting to 'narrow-casting' already
exists today in the US. Cable television, which has mushroomed over the past
decade and a half, and now reaches 60 per cent of American homes, offers
viewers several dozen channels, including niche networks devoted to country
music and sports.
Cable has cut the audience for conventional, broadcast television channels -
NBC, ABC and CBS, together with the more recent Fox system - from around 90
per cent of viewership at the start of the 1970s to a little over 60 per
cent now.
The conventional broadcast networks are likely to suffer a further erosion
of their audience as fibre-optics allow many more narrowcast channels to be
pumped into the home, and as programmes are stored on servers which allow
the viewer to summon up programmes when they want them, rather than being
bound to a broadcaster's 'prime-time' schedule.
But while the future may be tough for the networks, they seem unlikely to
disappear altogether. Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, argues
that 'networks will continue to be an integral part of television because
consumers want quality, structure, familiarity . . . many consumers will
still want the networks to make their viewing choices for them.'
Despite industry talk of a 500-channel future, Mr Eisner argues that there
will be only 10 or so 'great channels' (whether their origins are in cable
or broadcasting) which earn nationwide or local recognition and affection.
However, the economics of the networks may have to change dramatically,
since most of them rely for their profitability on advertising revenues. But
in an inter-active world viewers may be even less prepared than now to sit
through repeated showings of advertisements, breaking up their TV shows.
Advertisers, for their part, are already shifting their campaigns from
broadcasting to narrowcasting, focusing much more precisely on the target
audience they want to reach.
For example, a newly-launched cable television channel, ESPN2, which covers
sports popular among the young, such as snow-boarding, allows advertisers to
target sporty young males. But the multi-media age will also mean huge
changes for the advertising industry. Some of the largest consumer
advertisers say the growth of narrowcasting means an end to the conventional
strategy of running a few mass-market, big budget commercials a year. They
now need to create many, cheaper advertisements in different styles and
moods for different audiences.
Many new advertising opportunities are also opening up. There is expected to
be strong growth in 'infomercials' - programmes which a viewer can summon up
to get information about a product.
As interactivity develops, these could allow a potential car buyer to
interrogate his TV screen about options on a vehicle and even book a test
drive, with a salesman delivering the car to his home.
At this point advertising blends into television home shopping, an industry
which is still in its infancy. At present, home shopping viewers have to
pick up a telephone to order an item they want, rather than simply pressing
a combination of buttons on a television remote control.
They are also bound to the shopping channels' programming schedules, rather
than being free to browse through televised catalogues when they want. But
as inter-activity develops, television home shopping could displace much of
the conventional printed catalogue shopping industry and some conventional
retailing.
Traditional advertising agencies could lose out if they do not react quickly
enough to this rapidly changing world. For example, new rivals, some drawn
from the world of television programming, are already experimenting with
inter-active advertisements.
But whatever the delivery method, the multi-media era will certainly not
mean the end of the advertising industry; merely its rebirth in a new and
potentially even more potent form, targeted closely at the individual
viewer.
As Mr Michael Schrage, an authority on the future of US media, points out:
'There will be billboards along the information superhighway.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (1): Debt control takes cash
flow strain - As the UK economy recovers from recession, the need for good
credit management is greater than ever. Increasingly, companies are hiring
specialists - and an explosion of IT applications is making their task
easier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not so long ago, a bank's guarded statement 'considered good' and two trade
references would have given suppliers sufficient comfort to start shipping
goods to new customers.
Credit management was frequently divorced from the sales process. The credit
controller was viewed as someone who impeded rather than the supported the
sales force. But the economic downturn has put paid to such quaint - and
arguably misguided - practices, ushering in a marked change in the way
companies manage their credit controls.
'The recession has seen company margins narrow so they cannot afford either
bad debts or very slow repayment,' says Trevor Phillips, chairman of the
Institute of Credit Management. 'There has been a push to bring in more
specialist employees to manage risk.'
Five years ago the position of credit manager might have been filled by a
company secretary, the finance director or even a clerk in the accounts
department. But in the last few years there has been a sharp increase in the
number of UK companies appointing very senior credit managers, many
reporting directly to the board.
Credit managers, both within companies and those who collate and supply
reports in the credit information industry, are also increasingly well
served by new information technology. 'A decade ago the operation was a
manual one,' says Philip Mellor, senior analyst at Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the
leading credit information supplier. 'Reports were being typed out and that
barred a lot of companies from entering the business-to-business market.'
Now companies such as UAPT-Infolink and CNN are using technology to present
information in a manner which is breaking down the barriers to better
knowledge about customers. The explosion of technology coincides with a
withering assault on prices. Dun &amp; Bradstreet and the ICM agree that prices
in the last 10 years have halved. Selective services - for example, a search
to see if potential customers have any county court judgments against them -
can cost as little as Pounds 4, says Phillips.
While Dun &amp; Bradstreet remains the dominant supplier, with about 45 per cent
of the business-to-business credit information market in the UK, Infocheck
has leapt from nowhere in little more than a decade to control nearly a
fifth of the market.
Others to enter the market include Graydon (owned by leading credit
insurance groups NCM, Hermes and Coface), CCN and ICC Information Group.
One way in which companies have tried to combat these price pressures has
been to take the expensive keying-in of information to countries which have
lower labour costs. A number of credit information companies have set up
operations in the Philippines or Sri Lanka. UAPT-Infolink, a company better
known in the consumer credit market, but rapidly growing in the
business-to-business market, has recently set up in Harare, Zimbabwe.
However, cutting costs may not be enough. As technology has taken over many
of the most repetitive manual functions it is becoming increasingly obvious
that there is huge duplication of the industry's raw material: information.
Some form of consolidation within the industry would not only make sense,
but is likely.
'It is a recognised fact that there are too many players in the market and
there will probably be mergers within the next year,' says one senior
executive of newer credit information company. Many observers of the
industry share this view. Inevitably, attention has focused on what Dun &amp;
Bradstreet might do to retake some of the market share it has lost.
But what is the size of the market pool in which the six largest credit
providers are fishing?
In spite of the marked increase in demand for professional credit managers
and the increase in sales of the leading external credit information
providers, there still appears to be a sizeable market to go for. Philip
Mellor, of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, says that suppliers only seek credit
information for one in 19 transactions before they start to trade.
It is another mark of credit management's lack of penetration that of the
955,000 or so companies which file balance sheets (most of which offer
credit terms), considerably less than 10 per cent actually use the services
of an independent credit information service.
Trevor Phillips of the ICM says these figures are too low. Many smaller
companies take up credit references using their trade organisations or the
local chamber of commerce, he says. He estimates that any business with a
credit controller will be using external credit references for 60 per cent
of accounts where there is exposure of over Pounds 500.
Nevertheless, the ICM and the government have recognised the need for better
information. A brochure on credit management called 'Making the Cash Flow,'
published with the UK Department of Trade and Industry last year, sold like
hot cakes and is being rushed into a second edition.
But if technology is rapidly bringing down the price of credit information -
and turning into something of a commodity product - how are the providers
attempting to differentiate their products?
One way is more user-friendly presentation and on-line credit referencing.
Some groups are developing specialist knowledge; others are focusing on
packaging the information in a more user-friendly manner. And at least one
group is making software packages that allow a company's own credit policies
to be mixed with raw credit data on customers to produce credit
recommendations.
One of the most exciting developments in the area is CD-ROM technology.
According to Dun &amp; Bradstreet's Philip Mellor: 'It has really been able to
provide the delivery systems and format data in a way people can understand
and at a price they can afford.'
While falling prices, static profits and overcapacity might suggest an
industry with its tail between its legs, the reality is different. One
group, Infolink, could well be seeking a stock exchange listing in the near
future. The group, which has a number of venture capital companies on its
shareholders' list, had hoped to float before 1991 but was thwarted by the
recession.
The industry as a whole has also benefited from the debate about whether
there should be a statutory right to interest on debts paid late. While
remaining agnostic about whether legislation is necessary, credit
information suppliers have jumped - rightly - at the opportunity to point
out that their services can identify persistent late payers. By arming
suppliers with this information before the shipment of goods or provision of
services, companies can decide if they really want the business or whether
they want to renegotiate payment terms.
Furthermore, the industry might be about to receive a boost from the
clearing banks. In a little-publicised move, this month the clearers will
change the way in which they give the traditional credit references.
Until now, suppliers have been able to approach their own banks for credit
references on potential customers. Sometimes the service has been supplied
free, sometimes the cost is included in bank charges. From March 28, the
same supplier will have to approach the customer's bank for a reference
which will cost over Pounds 8. Some may find requesting permission of
potential clients to seek references the equivalent of commercial suicide;
others may examine what will still be a relatively perfunctory report, and
realise that credit information suppliers provide a more detailed service
for a similar price.
But probably the industry is going to expand its market best by talking more
loudly about what credit management can offer a modern manager. 'We have a
big educational process ahead of us,' says Martin Williams, Graydon's
commercial director. 'People out there do not understand or know what they
can get with a credit reference.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: McAlpine placed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market's most active stock was Alfred McAlpine, the construction group,
which slipped 5 to 311p after news that an 11 per cent-plus stake in the
group, some 6.37m shares, had been placed in the market.
The stake, owned by Dumez, of France, was sold to stockbroker Charterhouse
Tilney at 300p a share and passed on to a number of UK institutions at 304p
apiece. By the close of business, turnover in McAlpine shares had reached
12m.
The strong performance yesterday of builders merchants shares augurs well
for this morning's market debut for Graham Group, the UK's fourth-largest
builders merchants group being hived off by BTR. Graham shares, offered for
sale at 183p, are expected by marketmakers to open around the 195p mark.
Graham is seen as a major threat to Wolseley, one of the building materials
sector's real successes over the past decade, and Travis Perkins. The latter
rose 9 to 335p and Wolseley put on 19 at 899p.
Close Brothers, one of the market's lesser known merchant banks, delivered a
sparkling performance, the shares spiralling upwards to close 83 higher at
528p after the bank announced more than doubled half-year pre-tax profits, a
56 per cent increase in the interim dividend and a one-for-one scrip issue.
Other merchant banks clawed back some of the big losses of recent sessions,
with SG Warburg closing 10 firmer at 834p.
The high street banks staged a strong rally after the recent heavy setback
in the sector. Standard Chartered, due to report preliminary numbers
tomorrow, raced up 49 to 1164p after Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker,
was said to have forecast a 24p dividend total and pre-tax profits of more
than Pounds 440m.
Talk of switching out of Barclays and into National Westminster ahead of
Barclays' figures, due tomorrow, drove NatWest shares up 13 to 495p but
restrained Barclays, which settled only 5 better at 517p.
British Petroleum figured prominently in the market's most active issues,
with a block of 4m shares traded at 370p and a further 1.1m at the same
price. The stock closed a net 4 higher at 367p after turnover of 11m.
Cadbury Schweppes declined 4 to 494p ahead of results due tomorrow. Many
observers are still convinced that they will be accompanied by a big rights
issue in order to mount a full bid for US drinks group Dr Pepper. Hillsdown,
which reports results on Thursday, edged up a penny to 178p.
Kingfisher bounced, with UBS said to be recommending the stock. The shares
put on 5 at 609p.
News that Ladbroke was considering returning to the casino business after a
14-year absence helped the shares edge ahead 1 1/2 to 200p. Demand for
Stakis following a recent round of presentations to institutional investors
saw the stock gain 2 1/2 at 89p as turnover hit 1.5m shares.
Manchester United's premier league defeat at the weekend caused the shares
to lose 7 at 693p.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo slipped 12 to 695p against the trend as some
investors took profits following Friday's sharp rise.
Media investment group MAI gained 8 at 273p after it was announced that the
offer for Anglia Television had been declared unconditional. Anglia
appreciated 5 to 639p.
Carlton Communications bounced 22 to 967p after recent sharp falls, as Hoare
Govett continued to recommend the shares.
Hickson International, the speciality chemicals and timber treatment
company, improved 4 to 204p as investors responded to a reiterated buy note
from Kleinwort Benson.
Engineering concern BBA Group fell 9 to 207p after the company announced
higher than expected provisions and indicated a reduced dividend payout for
the current year.
Confirmation that British Aerospace was in talks with French arms
manufacturer Giat over collaboration in munitions sent BAe 8 higher to 510p.
Sentiment was further boosted by reports that the ceiling on foreign
ownership of BAe shares would soon be raised by the government from its
present 29.5 per cent to 49.5 per cent.
The same sentiment, together with a squeeze, saw Rolls-Royce move ahead 6 to
180p, with volume reaching 7.2m shares.
Reports, confirmed after the market close, that British Airways was planning
to suspend further investment in USAir, in which it has a 25 per cent stake,
depressed BA shares, which receded 4 1/2 to 430p in trade of 7.8m.
Conglomerate Suter was in demand ahead of today's figures, the stock
climbing 6 to 205p.

FT  08 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters at new peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings saw its share price
jump to an all-time high yesterday. Dealers lifted their quotations and
deterred some UK fund managers who were desperate to increase holdings.
The stock jumped 81 to 2159p with the additional help of a repeated buy
recommendation from perennial bull Mr Brian Newman of agency broker
Henderson Crosthwaite.
There was also some interest ahead of a dinner in New York last night
between senior Reuters executives and US fund managers and a meeting with US
analysts today. The rise was further exacerbated by a Dollars 3 gain in the
US traded ADRs on Friday.
However, the basis for the squeeze lay in the persistent reluctance of US
investors to sell stock since the figures on February 8 and ahead of a share
split on April 18. Analysts said that because of this unwillingness to sell,
UK marketmakers were unable to get hold of the stock and were consequently
marking up prices.
Mr Alastair Smellie of Lehman Brothers said that as 37 per cent of the stock
is held in the US and a further 6 1/2 per cent by the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority, UK funds are seriously underweight. Their drive to redress the
situation has seen the Reuters share price climb by almost 13 per cent since
the February figures, against an FT-SE-Actuaries All-Share Index which has
slipped by 4.5 per cent.

FT  08 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A firm opening on Wall Street, together with a more positive performance in
bonds, helped to underpin an advance in stock index futures seen from the
outset, writes Joel Kibazo.
Early buyers for the Liffe March contract on the FT-SE 100 which opened at
3,280 sent it forward in thin trading. But for a brief mid-morning sell
order, March continued to push gently forward.
Just when a lull in trading appeared, the strong performance of Wall Street
brought renewed demand, particularly from independent traders, and a gentle
squeeze was noted in March towards the close.
Having traded at a premium for most of the session, March ended at 3,295, a
3-point discount to its fair value premium of about minus 8 points. Turnover
was 17,533 contracts. Substantial rolling forward into June saw volume in
that contract of 7,922 lots.
The FT-SE Mid 250 March futures contract on the Liffe stood at 3,950 at the
official close, with 156 lots having been traded. On the rival OMLX, the
same contract finished at 3,937.7 on volume of 9 contracts.
In the Liffe traded options, volume fell to 32,813 contracts, including
13,955 in the FT-SE 100 option. J. Sainsbury, the most active stock option,
traded 2,287.

FT  08 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 regains 3,300 in moderate
trade - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A stronger performance from bond markets across Europe, including British
government securities, sent UK equities ahead by nearly 28 points yesterday
to close comfortably above the Footsie 3,300 mark. London finished near the
best of the day, helped also by a good start to the new Wall Street session.
Trading volume remained moderate but gathered pace as gains were extended.
The renewed vigour in European bond and stock markets followed the pay
settlement in the German engineering industry which encouraged hopes that
the Bundesbank will be able to make a further reduction in interest rates
soon. The optimists hope for good news either today, when the Bundesbank
will disclose the shape of its repo tender, or tomorrow, when the result of
the tender is announced.
Share prices opened higher but were slow to extend their early gains as some
continental European markets slipped back from early peaks. But sentiment
turned stronger as the session progressed and the Footsie showed a gain of
more than 32 points before closing at 3,305.9 for a gain on the day of 27.9
points. However, London lagged behind the recovery in the German stock
market.
Several equity strategists told clients that the stock market was staging a
recovery, Kleinwort Benson Securities stressing that the financial sectors
had been oversold. Natwest Securities pointed to improving dividend
prospects. This week brings trading results from a range of leading UK
companies, including BAT Industries and RTZ, which will be scanned for the
latest indications of the pace of recovery in the domestic economy.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index added 10.4 at 3,937.7. The Mid 250 has outperformed
the FT-SE 100 Index by 7 per cent since the turn of the year, and NatWest
Securities predicts a further outperformance this year.
Seaq volume, said to have been supported in the second half of the session
by a trading programme from a UK investment bank, totalled 576.3m shares,
compared with 581m on Friday, when retail, or customer, business was worth
Pounds 1.44bn. Retail volumes, the soundest test of market activity, have
remained at relatively modest levels during the sell-off of the past
fortnight but have now begun to show signs of improvement.
There was support for the financial stocks which have been so badly hit in
the shakeout of the past fortnight. Fears that some of these active players
in global securities markets might have suffered severe losses seemed to
abate and investors focused on the dividend improvements announced recently
by some of the sector leaders.
The powerful rally in bond markets, which fuelled a strong rise in UK gilts
yesterday, soothed some of the worries over losses in these sectors. The UK
equity market, having suffered no more than moderate selling pressure during
the global shakeout, now seems ready to benefit from a recovery.
'Investors can now find good value,' commented the strategy team at Nikko
Europe. Credit Lyonnais Laing, keeping its year-end Footsie target at 3,750,
was another to maintain that the rise in bond yields does not signal any
'reversal' in the economic factors which have been driving equities higher
for the past 18 months. Lyonnais Laing believes that hopes for economic
recovery will not be disappointed by the current corporate results season.

FT  08 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Arms groups' Dollars 1.9bn
merger helps lift Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Rallying European stocks, firmer bond prices and news of a billion-dollar
defence industry merger lifted US share prices across the board yesterday,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 23.92 ahead at 3,856.22, slightly
below the high for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.17 at 466.91,
while the American SE composite was 2.59 higher at 469.06 and the Nasdaq
composite up 4.50 at 795.05. New York SE volume was 285.6m shares.
After recent wild fluctuations, equity prices opened the new week in
impressive fashion, moving into positive territory right from the opening.
Traders said several factors were behind the advance: a recovery in European
stocks, hit last week by turmoil in local bond markets; gains in US bond
prices; and news of a big merger between defence companies.
The latter was particularly welcome, given that the market had been rattled
by the collapse two weeks ago of the billion-dollar union between Bell
Atlantic and Tele-Communications. Yesterday's news involved Grumman, the
Long Island defence contractor, which has agreed to be taken over by Martin
Marietta, another defence group, in a deal valued at Dollars 1.9bn.
The announcement of the agreement sent Grumman's shares soaring in heavy
dealings. By the close they were trading at Dollars 54 1/8 , up Dollars 14
1/4 , or 36 per cent. Martin Marietta has offered to pay Dollars 55 each for
every Grumman share. Wall Street clearly liked the deal, because Martin
Marietta's shares also rose on the news, climbing Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars
46.
Salomon advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 51 3/8 as investors reacted warmly
to Friday's late announcement that Mr Warren Buffett, the billionaire
investor and former interim chairman of the securities house, had increased
his stake in the company from 14.7 per cent to 19 per cent. The move was
seen as a vote of confidence in Salomon's long term ability to generate
profits.
USAir dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 9, a 52-week low, in busy trading
after warning that it would make a pre-tax loss of Dollars 200m in the first
quarter of the year, against a deficit of Dollars 61m a year earlier. The
airline blamed bad weather and price competition for its poor earnings.
Philip Morris, which has been hit recently by concern that the government
might impose strict regulations on cigarettes, rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars
56 3/4 amid speculation that the planned increase in excise taxes may be
smaller than originally feared.
Brazil
Heavy trading took Brazil 7.1 per cent higher by the close on expectations
that the government would not raise taxes on foreign investment and amid
optimism on constitutional reform. The Bovespa index was finally 799 points
ahead at 11,939. Turnover came to Cr216.1bn (Dollars 314.1m).
Trading picked up amid reports of proposals to end all state monopolies.
Canada
Toronto closed solidly higher after fairly active trading, with most sectors
posting gains as fears of an imminent rise in US interest rates appeared to
ease.
The TSE 300 index rose 38.1 to 4,436.6 and advances led declines by 472 to
313 after volume of 69.6m shares.

FT  08 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Malaysia and Singapore tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the biggest global equity markets, early weakness based on suspect or
poor economic data in the US and Germany was evened out later last week by
nervous recoveries in America and Europe, and an extension of this year's
relative strength in Japan. The FT-Actuaries World Index finished just 0.1
per cent down on the week in local currency terms.
Asian shares were another matter entirely, Malaysia weakening 6.1 per cent
after a 5.2 per cent advance in the week before, and Singapore taking a 4.5
per cent tumble. This left them 14.1 and 11.1 per cent lower respectively on
the year so far, compared with gains of more than 120 per cent and nearly 70
per cent in 1993.
Mr David Bates of Asia Equity in London says that Singapore, having fallen
earlier this year along with other markets in south east Asia, had seen some
feverish speculation in advance of the national budget on February 23 -
which turned out to be conservative, although positive, rather than a
giveaway budget when corporate and personal taxes were concerned.
'The market was certainly discounting a 2 percentage-point cut in
corporation tax,' says Mr Bates, 'and it did not get it.'
Malaysia, comments Mr Bates, was run up after the elections in Sabah which
the ruling party lost, but only by a very narrow margin. However, there was
no follow-through: 'The retail investor has become very cautious,' says Mr
Bates, 'and it was the retail investor who was driving this market.'
He adds that the Kuala Lumpur market is highly priced on fundamentals
compared to its neighbours, but he also tends to link recent volatility in
equities with the reduction in activity seen during the Moslem holy month of
Ramadan, currently in progress.
Last week's outperformer was South Africa, whose stock price gains, in the
end, owed nothing to a weak gold bull-ion price. Above all, indust-rials
were moved by initial confidence in talks between the African National
Congress and the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party; then disillusioned; and finally
encouraged again as hopes rose at the end of the week.

FT  08 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei fails to sustain
early rally as Manila rebounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A fall in government bond prices eroded early equity gains to leave the
market lower, although foreign investors continued to provide support,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average relinquished 154.12 at 19,811.88 on arbitrage linked
selling and profit-taking by institutional investors. The index hit a high
for the day of 20,279.13 and fell to a low of 19,768.68 in the afternoon.
Active demand from foreign investors and arbitrage buying supported shares
in the morning session, but most domestic investors remained inactive ahead
of the March stock futures and options settlements on Friday. A fall in the
bond market triggered heavy arbitrage selling based on the Topix index in
the afternoon. Traders said that while investors have been rolling over
their positions in the Nikkei 225 futures, much of the Topix positions had
been liquidated.
Volume totalled 340m shares, down from 414m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks slipped 14.19 to 1,608.10 and the Nikkei 300 shed 2.83 to
296.47. Declines led rises by 678 to 366, with 141 issues unchanged. But in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.44 to 1,336.16.
Profit-taking hit Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, pushing the issue down
Y10,000 to Y948,000. Financials, heavily weighted in the Topix index, lost
ground. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y60 to Y3,250, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
Y40 to Y1,930 and Nomura Securities Y30 to Y2,260.
Real estate companies were lower on profit-taking. Mitsui Fudosan retreated
Y60 to Y1,190 and Mitsubishi Estate Y30 to Y1,020.
Growing concern over the current rice shortage supported rice traders.
Although foreign rice has been imported to fill the gap, reports of shoppers
fighting for bags of rice prompted buying of Yamatane, which gained Y60 at
Y1,040.
Bakeries and flour millers drew buying on expectations of a rise in demand
for bread due to the lack of rice on the shop shelves. Yamazaki Baking rose
Y50 to Y2,140 and Nitto Flour Milling Y65 to Y540.
Motor shares were firm on foreign buying. Toyota Motor climbed Y40 to Y2,080
and Nissan Motor Y11 to Y884.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 116.95 to 21,952.21 in volume of 61.1m
shares. Aoki International, the men's suit retailer, put on Y140 at Y3,540
on bargain hunting.
Roundup
The region saw mixed performances, while trading volume was thin in many
centres.
MANILA rebounded after more than a week of steep declines, although low
turnover suggested that the market was still testing a new base. The
composite index moved forward 47.46, or 1.8 per cent, to 2,654.28 as PLDT
added 45 pesos at 1,910 pesos.
HONG KONG strengthened, the Hang Seng index adding 143.36, or 1.5 per cent,
at 10,061.55, although thin volume of HKDollars 4.48bn indicated that there
were still nagging doubts about the market's direction.
AUSTRALIA mustered a firm performance, moving the All Industrials index up
42.1 to 3,299.5.
Futures helped the underlying market benefit from consolidation, and the
majority of the leading stocks were able to enjoy the upward journey. BHP
rose 20 cents to ADollars 17.42, News Corp put on 23 cents at ADollars 9.97
and CRA gained 34 cents at ADollars 17.30.
SINGAPORE failed to sustain an early rebound as investors remained cautious
pending clearer directions in US interest rates. The Straits Times
Industrial index lost a net 4.89 at 2,243.74 after an intraday peak of
2,275.89.
SEOUL saw widespread selling in the year's lowest volume on a full trading
day and the composite index declined 7.15 to 895.62. Volume amounted to
17.15m shares, against 13.20m in Saturday's half-day session.
KUALA LUMPUR fell 1.7 per cent as investors liquidated positions amid
worries about the direction of overseas markets and US interest rates. Fears
of trade retaliation by Britain also discouraged buying interest and the
composite index shed 18.62 to 1,045.72.
NEW ZEALAND ended with moderate buoyancy after a session beset by confusion
over how the readjustment of Telecom's shares affected the NZSE-40 index.
The index was quoted 13.4 higher at 2,195.34 following an upward adjustment
of 24 points, after the market closed.
THAILAND saw a retreat of the bears as concern over rising interest rates
and political uncertainty began to ebb. The SET Index finished 17.43, or 1.3
per cent, better at 1,376.68 in moderate turnover of Bt7.6bn.
TAIWAN's weighted index receded 23.87 to 5,647.59, with Saturday's
confirmation that the authorities were raising the ceiling on foreign
investment already discounted.
JAKARTA encountered foreign selling, although domestic investors gave some
support, making for a mixed day's trading. The official index edged up 0.99
to 522.37.
BOMBAY weakened in nervous trade in a continuation of the downward movement
which left the market with a drop of 11.3 per cent last week in the wake of
the budget statement. The BSE 30-share index closed 56.99 lower at 3,744.61.

FT  08 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourse recovery accelerates on
IG Metall deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The weekend settlement of the German metalworkers' wage dispute lifted bond
and equity markets around Europe in the morning, and healthy gains on Wall
Street brought further strength to the afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT got an IG Metall wage deal that it would have been happy with some
weeks ago. The June bund future reacted, rising by a full percentage point
to 97.42 by the evening; equities responded with the Dax index 48.82, or 2.4
per cent higher on the session at 2,108.91, and closing the post bourse at
an Ibis-indicated 2,132.12.
Turnover rose from DM6.8bn to DM9.4bn. There was speculation about interest
rate prospects; Allianz produced a 4 per cent gain during hours and a
further DM22 rise to DM2,595 in the afternoon.
Carmakers were more striking, their gains led by Volkswagen which rose
DM16.50 to DM454.50 on hopes of a modest 1993 dividend, and another DM8 to
DM462.50 afterwards. There was interest in chemicals in their results week:
Hoechst, tipped by Goldman Sachs ahead of today's figures, put on DM6.60 to
DM308.60, and another DM6.40 to DM315 in the post bourse.
PARIS, too, majored on a surging bond market and gains in mid-morning
trading in New York. The CAC 40 Index ended 41.2, or 1.9 per cent higher at
2,219.89, in turnover of FFr4bn.
Among the winners, Club Med rose FFr21.20 to FFr407.20 on news that it would
be selling some of its holiday villages to raise cash, rather than making
another rights issue; and Eurotunnel's rights issue terms left it FFr2.70
higher at FFr52.10 on the feeling that one uncertainty was now out of the
way.
The losers included Peugeot, down FFr12 to FFr881 before announcing a
convertible issue after the close; Mr John Fordyce of Ferri International
reckoned that the shares would rise on relief today.
Remy fell FFr13.30 to FFr234 on Hong Kong's tax increases on spirits and
champagne. Here, Mr Fordyce conceded that Remy was very strong in the
colony, much more so that LVMH, and at the top of the range where the tax
imposts would hurt most; but it was not so strong, he said, as to deserve a
near 4 per cent drop in share price.
MILAN's foreign investors returned and the Comit index rose 8.44, or 1.3 per
cent to 660.99. Stet rose L236 or 5 per cent to L4,675 after Mr Paolo
Savona, the industry minister, said that a plan for its privatisation,
timetabled from late 1994, should be ready soon. Sip put on L183 or 4.6 per
cent to L4,194.
Fiat added L128 or 2.7 per cent to L4,899. Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito
Italiano said that while sales were down in Italy, the group's ability to
recover strongly over the medium term was strengthened by its recent
impressive performance elsewhere in Europe, where it was helped by the
combination of the new, successful Punto model and the undervalued lira.
Benetton advanced L279 to L25,829 after a high of L26.600: the chairman
revealed that the group hoped to pick up around 1 per cent of BCI in the
institutional offering of shares. Ciga, the hotel group, added L130 or 15.9
per cent to L950: the shares were readmitted to the exchange last week after
a deal was struck for its sale by creditor banks to ITT Sheraton.
ZURICH rose 1.9 per cent although trading volume dipped, indicating
continuing nerves among investors after the market's recent volatility. The
SMI index added 53.5 to 2,918.7.
CS Holding rose SFr13 to SFr660 ahead of preliminary figures today and UBS
put on SFr19 to SFr1,294.
Among firm cyclicals, Holderbank, planning a joint venture to build a plant
in Vietnam, put on SFr45 to SFr975 and Sulzer, finding favour with analysts,
added SFr35 to SFr955. Brown Boveri, due to report tomorrow, added SFr36 to
SFr1,110.
AMSTERDAM was in optimistic spirits with many dealers forecasting a move
soon into record territory. Most shares closed near their day's high and the
AEX index rose 10.51, or 2.5 per cent to 424.76.
The Dutch bourse was riding the generally positive mood sweeping European
markets, with dealers buoyed by firmer bond markets and hopes of a cut in
German interest rates.
Financials were a strong feature with an average rise in the sector of 3 per
cent.
Philips, the electronics company, stirred up investor interest after
presentations in the UK following well-received results. It edged up Fl 1 at
Fl 52.60 with a strong volume of 3.14m shares traded.
Hunter Douglas, the blindmaker and aluminium trader, set a new 12-month high
at Fl 93.50 before easing back to close at Fl 90.80, a rise of Fl 1.80 on
the day.
Grolsch bounced on news of a distribution deal in Germany and put on Fl 1.50
to end at Fl 50.50.
KLM traded actively and added Fl 2.60 to reach Fl 50.50.
MADRID rose 1.8 per cent as strong bonds and the performance of other
European markets encouraged buyers. The general index added 5.94 to 341.10.
Telefonica, the most active stock, rose Pta25 to Pta1,975 while Banco
Central Hispano put on Pta105 at Pta3,015. Construction stocks continued to
forge ahead on government approval of an infrastructure plan: Asland added
Pta115 or 4.4 per cent to Pta2,735.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Markets Report: D-Mark moves lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The weekend settlement of the wage dispute in the German engineering sector
set the tone for foreign exchanges yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
The pay deal - effectively a wage freeze - was at the lower end of market
expectations and renewed hopes that the Bundesbank might quicken the pace of
monetary easing.
The central bank is expected today to announce a further easing in the repo
rate - the indicator it uses to set the level of money market rates.
The D-Mark finished lower in London against most European currencies, but
was slightly firmer against the dollar and sterling.
Analysts said President Clinton's political difficulties, arising from the
Whitewater scandal, still remained of only minor concern to markets.
The engineering industry wage settlement was widely interpreted as improving
the outlook for lower German interest rates, but this reaction was tempered
with caution.
The March Euromark futures contract was only four basis points higher at
94.19 yesterday afternoon, indicating a fairly modest view of where rates
are heading.
Although the longer contracts reacted more positively - the December
contract rose by 13 basis points to 94.98 - Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury
economist at ABN-Amro, said even these levels revealed 'continuing
scepticism' about the prospect for lower rates.
While most observers are anticipating an easing in the repo rate today,
nothing dramatic is on the cards. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser
at Bank of America, said he did not expect a cut of more than five basis
points; but Mr Brian Martin, senior economist at Citibank, said the market
seemed to be looking for a 10 basis-point reduction.
Mr Martin went on to say that the relative strength of the D-Mark and the
fact that the bund market had recovered its poise - added to a fairly benign
inflationary outlook - suggested that the Bundesbank had room for a cut of
this order.
The picture yesterday was of uneven D-Mark weakness: it finished lower
against the Belgian and French francs, and the Spanish peseta, but was
firmer against the Italian lira. The lira finished in London at L982.8, from
L981.7 on Friday and a low yesterday of L984.3.
Mr Hawkins said the weaker Italian currency appeared to be the product of
recent opinion polls showing that a centre-right coalition government might
now be more likely than a centre-left coalition. Italy faces a general
election on March 27.
International investors are said to favour the centre-left option because it
improves the prospect of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister,
staying in government. He was previously the highly respected governor of
the Bank of Italy.
The weaker D-Mark lent a firmer tone to the dollar, which was also supported
by the continuation of its recent recovery against the yen. The US currency
closed in London at a high for the day of Y105.850, from Y105.515 on Friday.
It ended in New York at Y105.545.
Rumours that the Federal Reserve might tighten credit policy yesterday
proved unfounded. Mr Norfield said the next move from the Fed would probably
come after the meeting of the policy-making Federal Open Markets Committee
on March 22.
Mr Hawkins said the fact that the dollar had made so little headway, in
spite of the heightened prospect of a move on German rates, 'says something
about the political wariness now in the market about Whitewater'.
Having been very much on the periphery of the market's focus, he said the
financial scandal dogging the Clinton administration was 'starting to
gravitate more towards the centre'.
Mr Martin from Citibank, however, said Whitewater had not yet been much of a
factor in the market's thinking.
Mr Hawkins said a closer look at last Friday's employment report could also
have contributed to uncertainty about the dollar. He said the important
earnings growth and hours worked factors were, if anything, on the soft side
and could have delayed the prospect of further Fed tightening.
The appreciation of the dollar against the yen flows from the US
administration's decision to reactivate the Super 301 measures allowing
trade sanctions to be implemented - in this case against Japan. The market
appears to have taken the view that, with Super 301 in its arsenal, the US
will be less tempted to talk up the yen as a means of curbing its bilateral
trade deficit with Japan.
Liquidity conditions in the UK money markets were easy yesterday. The Bank
of England put Pounds 1.8bn of liquid-ity into the system, equal to its
revised estimate of the shortage.
Sterling traded in a fairly narrow range to close marginally lower against
the D-Mark and the dollar at DM2.5615 and Dollars 1.4906 respectively.
Weaker than expected credit growth in January, a decline in housing starts
and the German pay deal, all lent support to a further fall in interest
rates.
The June short sterling contract rose by four basis points to 94.94.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU offers hope to eastern
Europe's farmers - The prospect of an end to subsidised competition from the
west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect that the European Union might stop subsidising its farm exports
to eastern Europe will be welcomed by the hard-pressed agricultural
industries of the former communist bloc.
EU export subsidies were strongly criticised at a conference in Budapest
last week by speakers from Hungary, Poland and the Czech republic, which are
struggling to restructure their farms and food businesses as part of their
drive towards EU membership.
The subsidies will come under the spotlight at a European Commission session
later this month. It will examine how the Common Agricultural Policy and
other EU systems can be modified to help eastern Europe progress towards the
market economy and faster integration with the west.
Export aids, together with ad hoc EU trade barriers, were blamed for
preventing east European produce from competing on world markets and for
damaging the few remaining healthy sectors of agriculture in these
countries.
'One of the main reasons for our present problems is that our expectations
of retrieving east European markets have not been fulfilled so far because
we are regularly beaten in the competition on export subsidies, mainly by
the exporters of the European Community,' said Mr Andras Zam, managing
director of Terimpex, a leading Hungarian meat trading company.
Speakers at the Agra Europe conference - on agriculture, agribusiness and
the food industry in central and eastern Europe - gave graphic accounts of
the plunge in production and farm employment that had followed the collapse
of communism and the old Comecon trading system.
In Poland, a fall in real income and the freeing of agricultural and input
prices has led to a halving in agricultural income compared with 1989.
Poland is no longer a net exporter of meat, milk products and eggs and only
fruit and vegetable exports have held steady.
The collapse of state farms, which exceptionally in Poland covered only
about 20 per cent of arable land before the reforms, has pushed up the
proportion of idle arable land from 1 per cent to 9 per cent.
In Hungary, 20 per cent less land was sown to crops last year than in 1991
because of a lack of finance and the uncertainty surrounding land ownership
and privatisation. Drought made things worse, causing a 40 per cent fall in
the cereal harvest compared with the average for 1986-1990. The average
wheat yield was 3 tonnes a hectare, the lowest for more than 20 years.
A drop in meat consumption and a rise in input costs have led to large-scale
slaughtering and a sharp fall in livestock numbers. In Hungary, the
once-important pig sector has declined to just over 5m animals compared with
a peak of 10m in 1983. The number of cattle is less than half that of 20
years ago. In Poland, cattle numbers have dropped by 24 per cent and pigs by
15 per cent in the past three years.
Rural employment has been battered. In Hungary, about 150,000 people had
lost their jobs by September 1992, representing 14 per cent of employment in
the food and agriculture sector, because so many state farms and food
processing enterprises went bankrupt.
Mr Rene Steichen, European agriculture commissioner, said there were signs
in some countries last year of a recovery in crop production, but the
livestock sector was still in decline. None the less, those countries had
the potential to be 'significant exporters of food.' The EU had to help them
by going beyond its recent association agreements with six central and east
European countries and speeding up the opening of its markets.
The current review of the EU's Phare aid programme for eastern Europe should
look at 'how one could help change farm structures, in particular in
relation to the development of co-operatives, in order to rationalise
production and domestic distribution networks', he said. That should
overcome some of the difficulties caused by the fragmentation of farmland
and assets.
Mr Steichen also highlighted the paradox facing eastern Europe's
agricultural policy-makers.
In order to be accepted into the EU and to make a smooth transition into
world trade, they must shun some of the core measures of the CAP.
That theme was developed by Prof Stefan Tangermann, a leading agricultural
economist who advises the European Commission, the World Bank, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation on agricultural strategy.
Prof Tangermann said Poland and Hungary in particular had opened their food
markets fully to international competition after the collapse of communism,
but that the plunge in farm prices had led to pressure from farmers for
protectionist measures.
'There is a trend towards introducing more protective agricultural policy
instruments which have a certain similarity with those of the EU, in
particular variable levies and export subsidies,' he said.
Shadowing the CAP could present these countries with an intolerable
financial burden, warned Prof Tangermann. According to one economic model,
Hungary, Poland, the Czech republic and Slovakia would be spending more than
Ecu3.5bn (Pounds 2.65bn) on export subsidies by 2000 if they tried to match
EU farm prices.
That scenario assumed that their farm output recovered, domestic consumption
expanded only slightly and net exports thus rose significantly.
Prof Tangermann predicted that by 2000 central Europe could have an
exportable grain surplus of about 10m tonnes, a sugar surplus of 2m tonnes,
the potential for net exports of 800,000 tonnes each of beef and pork, and a
butter surplus of about 400,000 tonnes.
'Governments in central Europe should consider whether their current
tendency to adopt 'CAP-like' agricultural policies is in their best
interests,' he said.
'The optimal policy would be to be cautious about the level of support they
provide to their farmers until the time they accede (to the EU).'
The argument found an echo among speakers from Poland and the Czech
republic. Mr Andrzej Kwiecinski, head of the agricultural policy analysis
unit that advises the government, said Poland could not afford to finance an
EU-style system of protection.
'The focus should be not on the present CAP, which in coming years will be
significantly modified due to the MacSharry reforms and the Uruguay Round of
the Gatt, but rather on the probable model that will take shape in the
European Union in 10 or even 15 years,' he said.
Mr Tomas Doucha, head of the Czech agriculture policy unit, said his country
had to avoid the danger of land being abandoned and rural areas depopulated
by adopting a policy of 'sustainable agriculture in accordance with the
progressive elements and tendencies of the CAP'.
In a striking parallel to the current debate in western Europe, he said
farming in eastern Europe would have to concentrate not only on food
production, but also 'the environment, natural resources, the landscape, and
the social and cultural traditions of our rural regions'.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar rise 'may run out of
momentum'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent upturn advance in sugar prices may run out of momentum, says
London trade house E. D. F. Man, because of a lack of 'prompt physical
offtake'. But it expects prices to be maintained by 'a background of tight
fundamental (supply/demand) balance and the expectation of offtake later in
the year.
In its latest Sugar Situation report Man says the 'much anticipated upward
trek in prices has started despite persistent uncertainty surrounding import
demand prospects'.
It notes that import demand has languished, 'plagued by political
procrastination and administrative delays'. But, 'surprisingly', market
interest in potential Russian, Chinese and Indian demand 'show little sign
of fatigue'.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile issues copper plan
ultimatum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Cyprus Amax/Lac Minerals consortium, which last year offered Dollars
555m for 51 per cent of the El Abra copper deposit in Chile, has been given
until May 15 to sign documents. The ultimatum, delivered by Codelco, Chile's
state copper company and the prospective joint-venture partner of the
US/Canadian consortium, carries with it the possibility of legal action.
If the consortium backed down on its original offer, 'Codelco has the
possibility to reject it. . . and to use the courts to get compensation for
any losses suffered', said Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's vice-president for
development. The consortium last month postponed the agreement after
discovering that ore grades might be lower than originally estimated.
Ms Patrice Merrin Best, vice-president corporate and investor relations at
Lac Minerals, said the 'due diligence process' had begun. This gave the
consortium the right to make further tests, which would be completed by
mid-May, she said.
Asked whether statements from Codelco had soured negotiations, Ms Merrin
Best said: 'We have goodwill and good faith and both parties hope that this
can go ahead.' She pointed out that Mr Bande had expressed confidence that
an agreement could be worked out.
A mining executive in Santiago said the public jostling between the
joint-venture partners did not augur well. 'It's a bit like getting married
when you've started fighting even before you've got to the altar,' he said.
Mr Jorge Rodriguez, acting Codelco president, said that if negotiations with
the consortium broke down, Codelco would probably call a second round of
bidding.
Under Codelco's original rules, failure to conclude a deal with the highest
bidder was to have resulted automatically in the start of negotiations with
the under bidder. An executive at BHP Minerals/Magma, second in last year's
bidding, said he thought the consortium would still be interested in
developing El Abra.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cominco in CDollars 145m plan
to replace Trail smelter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Cominco, the Vancouver-based metals producer, will spend CDollars 145m
(USDollars 106.5m) to replace the lead smelter at Trail, British Columbia,
which has failed to meet expectations since it was installed four years ago.
Cominco has abandoned the German technology, known as QSL, on which the
troubled facility was based. Instead, it has turned to a process known as
Kivcet, which is in use at a smelter in Kazakhstan.
The QSL technology was supplied by Lurgi, a subsidiary of
Metallgesellschaft, the German metals and industrial group. Cominco has
demanded compensation for the failed technology. An official said
negotiations with Lurgi were continuing.
Cominco also announced a CDollars 25m plan to expand zinc production at
Trail, which is one of the world's largest metallurgical complexes. The two
projects will increase Trail's annual lead smelting capacity from 100,000 to
120,000 tonnes, and zinc capacity from 290,000 to 320,000 tonnes.
The Kivcet lead smelter, which is expected to be commissioned in 1996, will
reduce lead emissions by 70-80 per cent and alleviate another pollution
concern by consuming large stockpiles of residues.
The expansions have been delayed by wrangling between Cominco and the
British Columbia authorities over indirect taxes and the ownership of two
hydro-electric dams near Trail owned by Cominco.
As part of the decision to go ahead with the Trail expansion, the province
will pay Cominco CDollars 51.5m for the rights to expand the dams'
generating capacity. Cominco will retain a 15 per cent interest in income
from the dams, starting once the lead and zinc expansion projects have been
paid off.
The QSL smelter operated briefly after it was completed in late 1989, but
has been idle since March 1990.

FT  08 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee futures break resistance to
reach three-month highs - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures climbed to the highest levels since
mid-December yesterday and some traders suggested a test of resistance at
last year's highs might be on the cards.
The May position broke through resistance at Dollars 1,250 a tonne early on
and that attracted fresh speculative purchases, notably by investment funds.
'The buying came from all over this afternoon,' said one dealer. 'It's all
looking quite positive.' He did not rule out an assault on the Dollars 1,300
level. Others were less bullish, confining their short term projections to a
test of the next band of resistance between Dollars 1,280 and Dollars 1,288
a tonne, where fresh producer sales of coffee were thought likely.
COCOA futures also ended the day firm, although they still showed little
sign of breaking free of the recent trading range.
Base metal prices were largely on the defensive at the London Metal
Exchange. Sellers had the upper hand, dealers said, and downside chart
points were coming under threat by the close.
COPPER'S retreat from Dollars 1,920 in the morning left the market
vulnerable after lunch, and although signs of nearby supply tightness
remained the three months delivery price closed Dollars 6.25 down at Dollars
1,908.50 a tonne.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Bund prices lead widespread rally in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German government bonds opened sharply higher on news of last weekend's wage
settlement in the German engineering sector, pulling the rest of Europe up
with them. While some of those gains were eroded by intra-day profit-taking,
bonds firmed again in the afternoon on the back of buoyant US Treasuries to
close up to a point higher on the day.
Again, activity was mostly futures-driven, with long-term investors still on
the sidelines. 'The market remains very fragile and nervous,' said a London
bond salesman.
Bunds opened sharply higher on the engineering wage deal, which was widely
seen to facilitate further cuts in German short-term interest rates. This
feeling was reinforced by comments from Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance
minister, who said that if the wage situation stabilises further, there
would be more room for interest rate cuts.
All eyes are now on the Bundesbank, which is due to call for bids today on
its latest round of securities repurchase agreements, for allocation
tomorrow. While some traders are hoping for a fixed-rate repo significantly
below last week's minimum rate of 5.97 per cent, most expect another
variable-rate repo, where banks bid the rate they are willing to pay.
In the likely event of a variable-rate repo, 'the German banks will probe
the downside on rates,' predicted Mr Stephen Dulake, bond strategist at
PaineWebber, who expects the minimum rate to fall by around five basis
points.
However, some say cuts in German short-term rates are unlikely to give the
longer maturities a big boost.
'The long end of the (bund) market has decoupled from monetary policy,' said
Mr Kirit Shah, international market strategist at First Boston. 'Bundesbank
easing may prompt brief rallies at the long end, but nothing sustainable.'
Moreover, he says rallies are likely to trigger more selling from investors
still holding long bund positions. 'I think there's still quite a bit of
selling yet to materialise.'
The June Bund futures contract stood at 97.24 in late trading, up 0.96 point
on the day.
French bonds staged a strong rally, triggered by the rise in bunds and
further fuelled by strong overseas buying in the futures pits.
The March notional bond future ended at 126.68, up 1.46 point on the day.
UK gilts were also pulled higher by bunds, with traders reporting some
cautious investor buying.
However, some participants said the rally could be short-lived. 'I'm not
sure I trust this - it all seems a bit too easy,' said a gilt salesman. 'If
we don't get a decent cut in the (German) repo rate, it could all go sour
again.'
The June long gilt future rose 1 1/4 points to 112 25/32 , off slightly from
its intra-day high of 112 31/32 .
Europe's high-yielders, Spain and Italy, also posted gains but slightly
underperformed their core counterparts.
The Italian March bond futures contract on Liffe rose by 0.56 points to
112.74.
The Spanish March bond future, traded in Madrid, rose to 102.40, up 0.57
points.
US Treasury prices firmed across the maturity range yesterday in the wake of
stronger overseas bond markets and lower crude oil prices.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was below its high
for the day, up  11/32 at 93 1/16 and yielding 6.793 per cent. The two-year
note was only slightly firmer, up  1/32 at 99 17/32 , to carry a yield of
4.859 per cent.
In the absence of fresh US economic statistics, the market took an early
lead from European markets. There, bond prices had rebounded following the
news that a strike by German metal workers had been averted by a last-minute
wage settlement with employers.
Prices advanced further later in the morning as the market reacted to a
notable decline in oil prices. Some short-covering also contributed to the
upward move. Later in the day, however, the market struggled to hold on to
its gains and bonds gradually eased back off their earlier highs.

FT  08 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Australian SE to set up Asian
board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian Stock Exchange is keen to set up an 'Asian board' of perhaps
two dozen Asian-based stocks, which could form a recognisable sub-sector of
the Australian stock market.
According to ASX officials, this could become a reality in as little as 12
months, although the initial number of stocks might be half the targeted
sum. In the medium term, an ASX 'Asian index' based on these stocks, and
even some derivative products, could be feasible extensions.
Mr Ray Schoer, head of operations in the ASX's companies department, says
the exchange is currently talking to some 20 Asian companies about listings.
Assuming no sudden dive in share prices, perhaps half of these could join
the market this year.
Such companies, he carefully stresses, are not just casual inquirers. Nor
are they interested in a secondary listing. In all cases, the Australian
market would be the place where the bulk of the trading in their shares
would be conducted.
According to the ASX, the geographical spread within this group of potential
market newcomers is fairly wide, although Guangdong province in southern
China dominates. Of the 20-odd interested candidates, 15 come from China,
including 11 from Guangdong. One emanates from Singapore; two from Papua New
Guinea; one from Malaysia; and two from Korea. The business activities
involved range from manufacturing to finance. The list includes one bank.
Why should any Asian company choose to have its shares traded in Australia?
Melbourne-based Sino Securities, which handled the first China listing on
the ASX last year, has two explanations. The first is to raise new capital,
and attract a 'diverse book' of shareholders in the process. The second is
to acquire the 'status' of a Western quote.
In both regards, Australia has something to offer. It houses a sizeable
Western investment community, and a fund management industry which has grown
significantly as private pension money has surged. Yet it also sits within
the Asian time zone and has an expanding Asian population.
The ASX is also fairly accessible to Western investors. It only came into
existence when the state exchanges merged in 1987. It lagged badly in terms
of transfer and settlement systems, but, having updated these and introduced
a Flexible Accelerated Security Transfer process offering investors a
statement of shareholdings rather than certificates, it can fairly claim to
be user-friendly, especially for non-locals.
The downside is that it lacks the clout and kudos of a market like New York.
Companies seeking large funds for expansion, for example, would not find
Australia very suitable. The nation seems capable of ploughing only some
ADollars 20bn (USDollars 14.3bn) of new money into the stock market
annually. 'The total market capitalisation of the first dozen entrants might
be around ADollars 500m,' says Mr Schoer.
If expectations are realised, the Asian influx will mean a significant
change to the ASX's profile. At present, the market houses just 50 overseas
stocks, out of a total of 1,155 companies, most of which emanate from other
English-speaking nations. Business in a few shares, such as Hong Kong's
Dairy Farm, is brisk. But for many of the US and UK multinationals, these
listings are largely cosmetic.

FT  08 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Irish Treasury may launch global issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRELAND'S National Treasury Management Agency is considering the launch of
the first ever global bond issue denominated in Irish punts.
Syndicate officials believe such a deal would meet with considerable
interest from international investors, given that they are significant
holders of Irish government bonds and that the availability of Eurobonds
denominated in the Irish currency is fairly limited.
Mr Michael Horgan, deputy director of domestic debt at the National Treasury
Management Agency, said gross new issuance is expected to be IPounds 2.25bn
in 1994, covering the government's borrowing requirement and redemptions.
He added that the Treasury is considering whether to launch a global bond
issue, and is looking at the possibility of borrowing at the long end of the
yield curve, but would not be drawn on the size of the deal, which is
rumoured to be about IPounds 500m.
The devaluation of the punt earlier this year scared off many foreign
investors, who had held as much as 30 per cent of the Irish gilt market. Mr
Horgan said foreign ownership fell to about 15 per cent just after the
devaluation but has returned to earlier levels.
Nervousness in the world bond markets continues to preoccupy borrowers and
investors and syndicate officials had few other prospective deals on which
to comment.
The Republic of Turkey recently completed roadshows for its global offering
in the US, and market participants are waiting to see whether it goes ahead
with the launch, given the market background.
The deal is expected to be at least Dollars 500m in size, and possibly as
large as Dollars 750m, according to Salomon Brothers, which is joint lead
and book-runner with Merrill Lynch for the issue. Turkey is apparently still
considering a whole range of maturities.
Australia Post, which is facing increased competition from private carriers
following a cabinet decision last autumn, is raising ADollars 235m through
an issue of five-year notes, Nikki Tait adds from Sydney.
The government-owned business said that the fund-raising would provide
around ADollars 200m of new investment, as well as refinancing maturing bank
loans.

FT  08 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Liffe mulls move to bigger
premises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange is considering
moving to larger premises, just over two years after the completion of its
Cannon Bridge headquarters at a cost of around Pounds 35m.
If trading volume continues to grow at the current rate of 100 per cent a
year, 'the probability is that we will need to find a larger trading floor,'
said Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's chief executive.
Its growth rate has further accelerated this year, as the recent sharp falls
in government bond prices have spurred activity in the futures markets.
Liffe's most active contract, the Euromark future, trades around 300,000
lots a day, compared with 500,000 contracts a day for the Eurodollar and
T-bond contracts traded in Chicago, the world's biggest contracts.
Mr Hodson stressed that any decision will be made by Liffe's board and its
members. The exchange could increase floor space at Cannon Bridge from
25,000 to 35,000sq ft but if the decision is taken to look for a new site,
the exchange will aim for 100,000sq ft of trading space.
Mr Hodson said that, given the size requirement, a new site would probably
have to be built from scratch, at an estimated cost of around Pounds 100m.
He added that, while other options would be considered, 'Liffe is at the
very heart of the City of London' and would be unlikely to move outside the
Square Mile. A decision is expected some time this year but no specific site
is being considered at present.

<TEXT>
The bid battle over Aztec Mining, the diversified Australian mining group,
was stepped up yesterday when PosGold Investments, part of Mr Robert
Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, announced it was raising
its cash offer to 74 cents a share.
This compared with a previous bid of 68 cents a share, and values Aztec at
ADollars 287m (USDollars 206m).
Aztec, which last week found a white knight in the shape of Pancontinental
Mining, said it did not intend to make any statement immediately. The
recommended merger with Pancontinental was an all-paper deal and Aztec
shareholders were offered a mixture of Pancon shares and options in return
for their Aztec stock.
When the deal was announced, Pancon traded at about ADollars 1.85, and that
deal was said to be worth 76 cents per Aztec share. However, the stock
market's weakness last week lowered Pancon's offer to below 70 cents.
The revised PosGold offer is now free of certain conditions, meaning that
the bidder can acquire Aztec shares in the market, where they were trading
yesterday at 68 cents.

first-quarter earnings dip

<TEXT>
Westinghouse Electric, the US conglomerate, issued a profits warning last
night, confirming recent comments by chairman and chief executive Michael
Jordan that the company would perform worse in the first quarter of 1994
than a year before.
In a statement after the market closed, Mr Jordan said earnings per share
for the period were likely to be 10 cents, down from 14 cents in the first
three months of 1993. Higher pension costs and a lower income from licensees
were behind the fall, along with a one-time gain from the sale of two radio
stations in 1993. Operating profits for the period would be down 10 per
cent, he added.

FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Goldman Sachs profit estimated
at Dollars 2.7bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Goldman Sachs, the private US investment bank, earned a pre-tax profit of
Dollars 2.7bn last year, according to an industry newsletter. The firm is
believed to have earned Dollars 1.5bn before taxes in 1992.
The firm would not officially comment on the figures, which were obtained by
Investment Dealers' Digest from a prospectus for a recent Goldman Eurobond
offering, but sources close to the firm say they are accurate. The data
confirms that Goldman is the most profitable firm on Wall Street, and its
150 partners, who share a good deal of the profits, are the most highly
rewarded professionals in the business.
However, last year may prove to have been the peak in the earnings cycle for
both Goldman and Wall Street. Since US short-term interest rates were
increased by the Federal Reserve on February 4, US and European financial
markets have been in turmoil, exposing some of the biggest players in the
capital markets to substantial trading losses.
Goldman is rumoured to have incurred large short-term losses, although the
firm insists its operations are profitable for the year. Over the longer
term, rising interest rates will make it harder for investment banks to
match the extraordinary profits earned between 1990 and 1993, when US
interest rates declined to record lows.
According to the IDD figures, Goldman's revenues in 1993 totalled Dollars
13.2bn, up from Dollars 9bn the year before. That makes the firm's profit
margin 20.1 per cent, which analysts say is the best among large Wall Street
investment banks. The record-breaking year lifted Goldman's capital to
Dollars 5bn from Dollars 3.7bn.

FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hong Kong SE proposes broad
reform
</HEADLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong stock exchange, now the sixth biggest in the world, yesterday
unveiled its blueprint for the next three years and beyond, with proposals
including greater self-regulation among market players and tougher
disclosure requirements in line with its bid for increasing
internationalisation.
The consultative paper, which follows more than 50 meetings with market
professionals and the relevant government and private-sector bodies,
proposes to switch from a common law-based regulatory system to one which
relies more on disclosure enforced by sanctions, conforming with US and
international market practice. There are also calls to remove the onus for
vetting listing documents and disclosures from the exchange and place it
directly on the issuers and their professional advisers.
According to its proponents, self-regulation would speed the processes of
listing approval and disclosures, now considered too slow.
A company listing in Hong Kong typically waits three to four months for the
go-ahead; in the US this can be as short as six weeks.
The document warns that as the domestic market is approaching saturation in
terms of companies seeking listings, the exchange must look to China and
beyond both for new issues and investors, and position itself to meet their
needs.
The exchange was also urged to look at ways of extending market automation -
especially in terms of trading, settlement and registration - and to speed
up plans for developing the listed debt market.
Other issues on the agenda include:
Putting a cap on the Compensation Fund, which now stands at more than
HKDollars 280bn (USDollars 36bn), and using excess levy receipts for other
initiatives to help the market community;
Looking at creating Hong Kong depository receipts on regional blue chip
companies;
More exhaustive disclosure, and the introduction of annual valuations of
assets;
Abolishing the board lot system and scrapping share certificates - possibly
along with the rules for spreads;
Reduction or removal of stamp duty;
Development of further indices on the Hong Kong market.

FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Record exports for South Korea
car companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea's four main motor vehicle companies reported increased sales for
1993, although two remain in the red.
Exports reached a record 639,000 vehicles, benefiting from the depreciation
of the Korean won against the Japanese yen. Increased sales in the
developing world, including south-east Asia, the Middle East and Latin
America, were largely responsible for the rise in exports.
Domestic sales were helped by low-interest financing as car companies
competed to increase their market share.
Hyundai Motor, the nation's largest car company, reported a 39 per cent
increase in net profits to Won58.2bn (Dollars 72m), as sales rose 18 per
cent to Won7,180bn. It predicts a 18 per cent jump in sales to Won8,500bn
for 1994.
Exports rose 19 per cent to 337,640 vehicles, and this year are expected to
rise 14 per cent to 385,000.
Domestic sales increased 9 per cent to 443,600 vehicles and Hyundai predicts
18 per cent growth to 525,000 this year.
Last year the company had a 46 per cent share of the Korean motor market.
Kia Motors reported net profits increased 24 per cent to Won18.7bn in 1993,
while sales rose 25 per cent to Won4,110bn. It predicts a 33 per cent
increase in sales to Won5,600bn for 1994.
Exports grew 54 per cent to 158,415 vehicles and are expected to expand 64
per cent to 260,000 this year, as Kia increases its US presence by
establishing a dealership network.
Domestic sales increased 18 per cent to 520,000 vehicles last year, giving
it 27 per cent of the Korean market.
Daewoo Motor narrowed its loss to Won60bn in 1993 from Won90bn in 1992, and
predicts a profit this year as exports increase 40 per cent. Sales rose 29
per cent to Won2,200bn and are predicted to jump 45 per cent to Won3,200bn
in 1994.
Ssangyong Motor reported a Won37.1bn loss in 1993 against a Won8.8bn loss in
1992. But sales rose 12 per cent to Won382bn. The results reflected
increased competition in the market for sports utility vehicles, the
company's main product.

FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: PosGold raises bid for Aztec
Mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The bid battle over Aztec Mining, the diversified Australian mining group,
was stepped up yesterday when PosGold Investments, part of Mr Robert
Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, announced it was raising
its cash offer to 74 Australian cents a share.
This compared with a previous bid of 68 cents a share, and values Aztec at
ADollars 287m (USDollars 206m).
Aztec, which last week found a 'white knight' in the shape of Pancontinental
Mining, said it did not intend to make any statement immediately. The
recommended merger with Pancontinental was an all-paper deal and Aztec
shareholders were offered a mixture of Pancon shares and options in return
for their Aztec stock.
When the deal was announced, Pancon's shares were trading at about ADollars
1.85, and that deal was said to be worth 76 cents per Aztec share. However,
the Australian stock market fell back last week, lowering Pancon's offer to
below 70 cents. Yesterday, Pancon's shares closed five cents up at ADollars
1.70.
The revised PosGold offer is now free of certain conditions, meaning that
the bidder can acquire Aztec shares in the market, where they were trading
yesterday at 68 cents. Ahead of yesterday's announcement, PosGold controlled
less than one per cent of its target's equity.
The other key is Alumax, the US company which owns 37 per cent of the target
company's shares. It had thrown its support behind the agreed merger, but
said only that that it intended to accept Pancon's offer 'unless a better
offer materialises'.

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norske Skog, one of Scandinavia's biggest pulp and paper producers,
announced a return to profit in 1993, helped by a successful cost-cutting
programme and despite lower prices for the Norwegian group's main products.
The group achieved a pre-tax profit of NKr4m (Dollars 536,800) in 1993
against a pre-tax loss of NKr662m the previous year, due to increased
production and lower finance costs.
The board proposed a dividend of NKr1 for 1993, after passing the payout in
1992, and forecast higher profits for 1994 in spite of expected higher
financial items.
Last year revenue fell by NKr219m to NKr7.34bn due to lower prices for
sulphate pulp, printing paper and building materials, which had also caused
a decline in revenue of NKr2.2bn between 1990 and 1993. Increased volume
compensated for lower prices.
The group achieved an operating profit of NKr299m in 1993, against a loss of
NKr47m in 1992 when restructuring costs of NKr200m were charged against
accounts.
Norske Skog said that it met its goal to cut costs by NKr700m between
1991-93.

group

<TEXT>
Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group, achieved a FM297m (Dollars
53m) profit before extraordinary items in 1993, ending a three-year run of
losses despite weak market conditions.
The result, a sharp turnround on 1992's FM360m deficit, was helped by the
weaker Finnish markka, restructuring, reduced exchange losses and lower
interest rates.
However, the group will again pay no dividend, partly because of the
uncertain market outlook. Mr Jyrki Juusela, chief executive, warned
conditions would remain difficult in early 1994 although 'demand for metals
and metal prices are expected to improve moderately during the next few
months'.
He promised further restructuring of the group's copper products division,
which remained in the red in 1993 with a FM502m loss before extraordinary
items.
The group's three other divisions, base metals, stainless steel and
technology, all reported profits, although low metal prices meant the base
metals surplus sank to FM152m from FM404m. Best performer was the stainless
steel division which lifted profits before extraordinary items to FM708m
from FM349m.
Group sales expanded to FM15.8bn from FM15.1bn, thanks to the improved trend
within stainless steel and technology. Operating income amounted to FM846m,
against FM604m, while net financial expenses fell to FM644m from FM1.06bn.
Group debt has fallen and equity has risen following the disposal of OM
Group of the US and two share offerings.
The Finnish government is looking to reduce the state's 50.1 per cent
ownership of Outokumpu as part of its broader privatisation programme.
Parliament has already authorised a reduction in the state holding to 33.4
per cent.
Metra, the Finnish world leader in diesel power units, yesterday reported a
profit after financial items in 1993 of FM472m, a sharp rebound from a loss
in 1992 of FM 40m.
The group also announced the launch of two convertible capital note issues
of up to FM300m each to reduce borrowings. Net debt stood at FM4.6bn at the
end of 1993, down from FM5bn, and the gearing ratio stood at 2.05.
Metra, which has its main businesses in diesel engines, sanitary ware and
security products, said it was raising the dividend to FM2.80 per share from
FM2.00.

FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Statute change makes sale of
Ascom stake likely

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ascom, the troubled Swiss telecommunications equipment group, was
effectively put up for sale yesterday.
The Swiss government approved a change in the statutes of the Hasler Works
Foundation, enabling it to sell any or all of its 54 per cent voting stake
in the group.
Mr Heinz Frey, chairman, said there was now nothing preventing anyone from
taking over the troubled group, although he doubted that the foundation
would sell part or all of its shares without the approval of the Ascom
board.
Ascom has a number of successful product lines, including payphones,
cordless telephones and corporate network systems, but it has been unable to
develop a successful overall strategy or unified management since its
creation through the merger of three Swiss telecoms companies in 1987.
In 1992, it fell into the red, losing SFr46.4m (Dollars 32m) on sales of
SFr3.37bn. Last year, it is believed the group lost over SFr300m. Mr
Leonardo Vannotti, former chief executive, was sacked in December, Mr Klaus
Rutschi, finance director, resigned in January and Mr Frey said he and two
more of the 12 directors would stand down in May.
Mr Frey said that the change in the Hasler Foundation statutes also made
possible equity-supported joint ventures with other companies in specific
sectors. Yesterday, the group announced an intensification of Ascom's
existing co-operation with Ericsson of Sweden. The two have signed a
memorandum of understanding to set up an Ericsson-controlled venture in
public telecom equipment in Switzerland.
Mr Fred Sutter, Ascom's new chief executive, outlined a new group strategy,
concentrating on three core business areas: telecom terminals, corporate
networks and service automation. Peripheral activities, such as cable
television, hearing aids and microelectronic components, would be sold off
or put into joint ventures.
He said the group would break even this year and return to profit in 1995.

FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bond fund managers heave a sigh
of relief - Tracy Corrigan, Conner Middelmann and Sara Webb find modest
signs of a recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN, CONNER MIDDELMANN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The agonies of the past month are finally easing for those bond fund
managers who clung to economic fundamentals, while selling by hedge funds
and proprietary traders drove prices further and further down.
After giving up as much as six months' worth of gains in the past four
weeks, European bond prices are staging a modest recovery.
'We have become much more optimistic over the last few days that we have
seen the worst,' said Mr Paul Abberley, head of fixed income at Lombard
Odier. 'The main thing is that the hedge funds seem to have stopped
selling.'
Unlike hedge funds and proprietary traders, traditional fund managers tend
to take a long-term view on their investments, based on economic
fundamentals. From their viewpoint, European bond markets appeared
attractive at the start of this year, even after disappointment over the
Bundesbank's slow pace of interest rate easing set in.
Logically, then, the  1/4 point increase in US short-term rates should not
have caused a turnround. The economic cycle in the US is well ahead of
Europe, and further easing of European interest rates is still widely
expected.
'In the big picture, we do feel the correction and bloodbath (in European
bonds) has been overdone. In the last week we've been adding to our
positions,' said Mr Jonathan Kelly, manager of Fidelity's Global Bond Fund
in Boston, with about Dollars 750m under management.
Investors have been particularly encouraged by the fact that European bonds
rallied last Friday, while the US market fell in the wake of a substantial
drop in US unemployment. This rekindled hopes that the European market is no
longer tracking the US market.
Not surprisingly, though, investors are adopting a cautious stance, even to
the prospect of this decoupling.
'It is probable that we will now see a phase of decoupling from the US, but
I don't think we'll go in the opposite direction,' said Mr Karl-Wilhelm
Knigge, senior portfolio manager responsible for international bonds at
Union Investment Gesellschaft, which manages a total of DM37bn.
Mr Udo Behrenwaldt, managing director of DWS, Deutsche Bank's fund
management subsidiary, agrees: 'I don't think Europe will totally decouple
(from the US), but further rate cuts by the Bundesbank will help European
bond markets achieve greater independence from the US Treasuries market.'
Given the lack of support from the US market, the rebound in European bond
prices is likely to be somewhat constrained.
Another check on the rally could be the number of long positions still in
the market.
'The 'conventional' fund management community is still very long (on
European bonds) and will take the opportunity to reduce exposure as the
market moves up,' said Mr Abberley.
Further, Mr Kirit Shah, international strategist at First Chicago, points
out that 'the pool of investors has shrunk significantly; hedge funds and
trading houses won't buy as madly as they did in the past'.
Nevertheless, many bond fund managers say they are now cautiously increasing
their exposure to European bonds.
Mr Nick Henderson, head of fixed income at Gartmore, said he was extending
the maturity and putting new money to work in the European government bond
markets as it was a good buying opportunity.
'We have done some selling but have remained long throughout; given that we
are driven by market fundamentals, we had to stay long,' said Mr Abberley.
He adopted some more protective positions by outright selling and by
switching from high to lower yielding bond markets, but now favours the
high-yielding bond markets.
Fidelity also increased its position in Europe last week. 'All we've done in
the (bond market) sell-off is reshuffle our positions . . . we've placed
renewed emphasis on France and Italy by adding to our positions and going
along the curve.'
There are still some black clouds on the horizon, though. The European bond
market could well prove vulnerable to a further rise in US interest rates or
US inflationary fears, political disruption in the former Soviet Union, or
the US/Japan trade dispute.
And without the heavy inflow of capital from speculative investors, the
return to last year's peaks could take some time.

The Italian government last night announced a clawback in shares available
to institutions investing in Banca Commerciale Italiana in response to heavy
demand from private investors.
IRI, the state holding group, will place 192m shares with institutions,
compared with the 240m originally earmarked. However, a further 30.7m shares
held back for possible market stabilisation purposes is likely to be added
to the institutional tranche.
IRI is selling its entire 54 per cent stake in the bank, raising L2,900bn
(Dollars 1.71bn). Mr Romano Prodi, chairman, sought a wide spread of
ownership, but about three-quarters of the 1m-plus private investors who
applied for shares will be disappointed.
The group said it would only be able to meet applications - on a first-come,
first-served basis - from 280,000 private investors, with the allotment of
1,000 shares each. There will be a further 28m bonus shares for investors
holding their stake for three years and another 40m shares are set aside for
bank employees.
BCI shares rose 5 per cent last week on reports that companies linked to
Mediobanca were buying stakes. One of these, the insurance group Generali,
has said it has 2.6 per cent and intends to obtain the maximum 3 per cent
stake carrying voting rights.
New rules implemented last week require the names of companies holding more
than 2.5 per cent of either BCI or Credito Italiano, the other bank
privatised recently, to be declared immediately. However, one analyst said
it was likely that a Mediobanca grouping was already close to acquiring
upwards of 20 per cent of BCI and thus have a blocking syndicate.
The identity of the big stakeholders may not become clear, however, until
BCI holds a shareholders' meeting.

Rogers Communications was yesterday considering a delay in the expiry date
for its CDollars 2.8bn (USDollars 2.08bn) bid for Maclean Hunter, the
Canadian publishing and cable TV group, from March 15 to the end of the
month because a US regulatory ruling will probably not be received by next
week.
Rogers, Canada's biggest cable TV distributor, applied on March 3 for
fast-track approval by the Federal Communications Commission of its proposed
acquisition of Maclean Hunter's US cable TV business and licences. This is a
key step in Rogers' plan to acquire all of the group, including the US and
Canadian cable interests and Canadian publishing businesses.
Rogers has said it would eventually sell the US cable licences to help pay
for its overall bid for Maclean Hunter. But the FCC indicated it could not
process Rogers' application in time for the March 15 expiry date. It
promised to disclose its timetable late yesterday.
The extension of the expiry date would give Maclean Hunter more time to
organise a counterbid.
Shares deposited under the Rogers offer cannot be withdrawn after March 8
unless the offer is subsequently amended. Rogers was to hold its annual
meeting in Toronto today.
Rogers and Shaw Communications, Canada's third biggest cable TV company,
have now agreed to swap some of their cable systems. The result would be
that Rogers would take control of the key Toronto area in return for selling
two western Canada systems.

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In a significant pre-privat-isation restructuring within Finland's
state-controlled industry, Valmet, the paper machinery and engineering
group, is to sell its transportation and tractor business to Sisu-Auto,
maker of heavy trucks, military vehicles and freight-moving equipment, for
FM600m (Dollars 107.8m).
Both companies are on the list of state-owned groups which the centre-right
government intends to at least partially sell, although no timetable has yet
been specified.
The sale is designed to narrow further the focus of Valmet, which is 73 per
cent state-owned, on forestry industry processing machinery before
implementation of the government's plan to lower its stake to between 30 and
50 per cent.
Valmet said the move would have a neutral effect on profits - which reached
FM100m last year - while strengthening its equity-to-assets ratio.
At the same time, the deal will transform Sisu-Auto, now 98 per cent
state-owned, from a company with sales last year of FM918m to a group with
combined 1993 sales of FM4.26bn and production plants in Finland, Sweden,
Germany, Portugal, the US and Brazil.
The merged businesses last year produced profits after financial items of
FM82m. The government plans to lower its holding in Sisu-Auto to between 50
and 65 per cent.
Valmet is to retain a 24 per cent stake in the new company worth FM185m.
This stake was part of the net purchase price of FM600m, Valmet said.

profits double

<TEXT>
Carrefour, the largest French food retailing group, yesterday announced that
it continued its recovery last year by more than doubling net profits to
FFr3.01bn (Dollars 500m) in 1993 from FFr1.33bn in 1992.
The group, which in 1992 suffered a sharp fall in profits, last year
benefited from a steep increase in its exceptional gains. It made a windfall
profit of FFr1.36bn from the FFr1.8bn placing in March of a large minority
stake in Castorama, the largest French do-it-yourself chain.
However, Carrefour also had to make provisions to cover the closure of two
hypermarkets in Philadelphia. As a result it made total profits of FFr1.34bn
on non-recurring items, against a compar-able loss of FFr4m in 1992.
The group, like the rest of the French retail sector, last year experienced
difficult trading conditions. Consumer spending throughout France was
depressed by the combination of high interest rates and fears about rising
unemployment, although sales of food and other basic items were less badly
affected than other sectors.
Carrefour mustered a 5.2 per cent increase in sales to FFr123.2bn in 1993
from FFr117.14bn in 1992 while profits before exceptional items rose by 24.3
per cent to FFr1.66bn from FFr1.34bn.
The board proposed a dividend of FFr42 a share for the 1993 financial year,
an increase over its FFr35 payment in the previous year. It also yesterday
announced plans for a one-for-one scrip issue.

FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Worries cast shadow over
Canadian banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worries over interest rates and continuing property problems are
overshadowing Canada's six largest banks after a strong first quarter.
Earnings for the three months to January 31 were generally higher than
expected. Led by Royal Bank of Canada, the six reported net profit of
CDollars 1.13bn, up 43 per cent from a year earlier.
The gains were driven mainly by the banks' brokerage subsidiaries,
reflecting booming stock markets and mutual fund (unit trusts) business.
Also loan losses declined and non-performing loans eased.
Return on assets and on equity generally improved and costs were held in
control.
Mr Al Flood, chairman of the Canadian Imperial of Commerce, said he sees
clear signs of economic recovery in North America and Mr Allan Taylor,
chairman of the Royal Bank, foresaw a return to a solid level of
profitability in the fiscal year to October 31 1994.
But brokerage and investment banking may not keep up the torrid pace of 1993
and 'there's nothing in the fundamental economy to make banking more
profitable,' said Mrs Donna Toth, bank analyst with Nesbitt Thomson in
Toronto.
The commercial property crisis is still severe and like a millstone around
most banks' necks, said another analyst, 'and it's not getting much better'.
Loan losses would linger, said Mrs Susan Cohen, of Deacon Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, but the kay variable is the course of short-term interest rates.

cash call
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two French companies will today announce plans to raise capital through the
bond market. Peugeot, the motor group, launches a FFr3.96bn (Dollars 671m)
convertible issue and Finaxa, a subsidiary of the Axa insurance concern, is
staging a FFr1.9bn convertible issue.
Peugeot, which last summer raised FFr1.5bn from a bond issue by its car
subsidiary, said it had decided to go ahead with the exercise to take
advantage of favourable market conditions following recent reductions in
interest rates.
Peugeot said it planned to use the issue to restructure its borrowings.
The timing of the transaction, which will involve the issue of 4m bonds at
FFr990 each, coincided with indications from the French government that it
might slow down its privatisation programme possibly by postponing the
proposed sale of Renault, the other large French motor group. Peugeot, like
Renault, has had a difficult time over the past year due to the intensely
competitive condition of the European motor market.
It fell into the red with a net interim loss of FFr1.12bn in the first half
of 1993, against a deficit of FFr2.3bn in the same period of 1992.
Its 1993 results are due to be published in late April. In the meantime Mr
Jacques Calvet, chairman, has consistently declined to comment on its
performance for the full financial year. Meanwhile Finaxa, which is
controlled by Axa, but also has the Paribas financial group as a sizeable
minority shareholder, is today issuing 1.44m convertible bonds at FFr1,370
each.
Neither Axa nor Paribas will subscribe to the Finaxa issue thereby reducing
their holdings.
Axa will retain control but with a stake reduced to 54.2 per cent from 61.4
per cent.
Paribas's holding will be reduced to 23.6 per cent from 26.7 per cent.

stake
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Central Hispano (BCH) is to place 13.49 per cent of the equity it owns
in Aumar, the toll motorway operator, via a global offering worth about
Dollars 104m.
The share sale, which will commence next week with Salomon Brothers acting
as global co-ordinator, provides a rare opportunity for institutions to
break into the tightly-controlled Spanish motorway sector.
Aumar is Spain's second largest toll operator and its concessions, which are
centred mainly along the Mediterranean coast, account for 25 per cent of the
domestic toll motorway network.
According to James Capel, the London stockbroker, Aumar's internal rate of
return of 10.7 per cent is attractive against the long-term government bond
yield.
BCH, which controls 67.39 per cent of Aumar, will remain the majority owner
with 53.9 per cent of the stock. Under the terms of the bank's agreement
with Salomon Brothers, 9.37 per cent of the equity to be sold will be
offered to international institutions and the balance will be placed on the
Spanish markets in an allocation that will be split evenly between domestic
institutions and small retailers.
The Aumar offer is likely to be the first of several disposals by BCH from
its industrial portfolio in order to strengthen its 1994 balance sheet.

FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Grolsch plans to sell German
brewery
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grolsch, the Dutch brewer with UK links, yesterday announced plans to sell
Wickuler, its German brewery, only three years after acquiring it.
Wickuler is to be sold for an undisclosed price to Brau und Brunnen, the
large German brewer, in exchange for handling the distribution of Grolsch
lager throughout Germany.
Grolsch said the partnership with Brau und Brunnen would allow it to lift
its beer distribution in Germany more quickly than using Wickuler to gain
gradual access for the Grolsch brand. It expects more than 6,000 cafes in
Germany to stock Grolsch within the next few years.
News of the deal comes less than two weeks after Grolsch announced an
agreement with Bass, the UK's largest brewery, to set up a joint venture
company to market and distribute Grolsch lager in Britain and Ireland.
Grolsch's 1991 acquisition of Wickuler was hailed at the time as a bold but
rare attempt by a foreign brewer to capture part of Germany's severely
fragmented beer market. Grolsch restructured Wickuler and reduced its range
of 20 local beers to three main regional beers that are popular around
Germany's Ruhr region. It halved the workforce to 400 people and closed the
Wuppertal operation in favour of the main brewery in Cologne.
However, the company said yesterday the trend towards concentration in
German brewing had placed it in a dilemma - either match the pace of
acquisitions by bigger German brewers or find a German partner for
distribution.
Grolsch, which owns Ruddles in the UK, declined to give the sale price for
Wickuler or comment on earlier reports that it paid about Fl 100m (Dollars
52.6m) for it in 1991.
In Amsterdam, Grolsch's shares rose by 3 per cent to close up Fl 1.50 at Fl
50.50 after an earlier high of Fl 51.50.

FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: ANA posts first loss for 22
years and cuts payout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
All Nippon Airways (ANA) yesterday said it would post a loss for the year
ending this month - its first loss for 22 years - and cut its dividend.
The Japanese carrier, hit by the continuing weak demand, expects a pre-tax
loss of Y3bn (Dollars 28m), compared with a previously forecast pre-tax
profit of Y6bn.
Operating profits are revised down to Y769bn from an earlier forecast of
Y782bn. The dividend is to be reduced to Y3 a share from the Y4 paid for
1992-93 when pre-tax profits totalled Y13.3bn.
The airline said international and domestic businesses were down nearly 3
per cent, but it had been hurt most by the slump in the domestic market.
Greater deregulation had enabled rival JAL to eat into the domestic market,
ANA's stronghold, while the airline faced growing competition from other
forms of transportation, such as fast-speed rail.
Competition on international routes, where ANA has been building its
presence since 1986, was fierce in the face of the spreading popularity of
discount air fares.
ANA's gloomy outlook reflects the pressures on Japanese airlines, which have
been struggling to maintain profitability after a slowdown in air travel and
increased competition from lower cost foreign airlines on international
routes.
In particular, the high costs of financing airports and airport development
have been a large burden on Japanese airlines, which face some of the
highest personnel costs in the world.
ANA faces paying a high price for its ambitious expansion plans in the late
1980s, when Japan's economic prosperity seemed everlasting.
In a reversal of those years, ANA, in common with other airlines, has been
restructuring to achieve profits with lower growth.
Japanese employment practice makes it difficult to make large cuts in costs
through wide-scale redundancies. Instead, it is scaling back unprofitable
routes and reducing maintenance costs. Capital investment in hotels and
airport facilities is being cut back. The company was forced to sell
aircraft in order to raise cash last year and may have to repeat that
exercise this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investor, the main holding company of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family,
yesterday reported a sharp fall in profits in 1993 as reverses at
Saab-Scania, the vehicle and aerospace group, and a fall in capital gains
left profits after financial items at SKr410m (Dollars 52m), down from
SKr1.48bn in 1992.
However, the group painted a brighter picture for 1994. It said income in
the latter part of the year surged, mainly due to a strong recovery at
Saab-Scania, Investor's chief offshoot, producing a fourth-quarter profit of
SKr194m, compared with a loss in the same 1992 period of SKr147m.
The dividend was unchanged for the second year running at SKr5.25 per share
and Investor's most-traded B share rose SKr5.00 to close at SKr191. Investor
said its net worth rose over the year to SKr37.5bn from SKr30.1bn.
The value of its strategic portfolio at the year-end was up 41 per cent at
SKr27.96bn - lagging a 54 per cent rise in the Affarsvarlden general index.
But sales from the industrial portfolio, positive cash flow from Saab-Scania
and a reduction in working capital tied up in Saab-Scania saw group net debt
fall sharply to SKr4.85bn from SKr8.7bn.
Income from capital gains fell to SKr1.4bn from SKr2.27bn as portfolio sales
fell.
Profits at Saab-Scania fell to SKr1.66bn from SKr2.13bn, with the truck and
bus and aircraft divisions reporting lower income, and a fifth successive
loss for Saab Automobile, jointly owned with General Motors of the US.

FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Carmakers gamble on small
concept - The unveiling of the micro compact cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Geneva motor show, which gets under way today, will see a number of new
concept cars unveiled.
The joint venture between Mercedes-Benz, the German luxury carmaker and SMH,
the Swiss pioneer of cheap and cheerful watches, to develop a micro compact
car is the most striking sign yet of the determination of carmakers in
Europe to develop a new market for minicars for use in congested, densely
populated cities.
For several years carmakers have flirted with ideas for two-seater city cars
with a length well below even the 3.05 metres of the British Mini, now in
its 35th year of production. Their appetites are whetted by the prospects of
new growth offered by opening up a new segment at the bottom of the car
market.
However, they have fretted over the economics of such car programmes. Small
cars often threaten small profits, and at the same time the customer
research has been confusing. The concept cars may look cute, be
environmentally friendly, and statistics may prove that cars in cities are
only occupied on average by 1.2 persons, but will people buy two-seater city
cars?
Professor Ulrich Seiffert, research and development director of Volkswagen,
Europe's leading volume carmaker has a small model of the VW Chico concept
car on a cabinet in his office in Wolfsburg. The Chico has been exhibited at
many international motor shows, and it was to be VW's city car of the second
half of the 1990s. But it will never be built. It allowed only 2+2 seating
rather than room for four adults and VW has decided that the concept was not
viable.
Instead it is backing the idea of a cheap small car to be sold for under
DM15,000 (Dollars 8,823), but which will carry four adults and some luggage.
It is due for launch in 1996. It will be shorter than the new Polo
supermini, to be unveiled later this year, but it will share many basic
chassis platform components with the Polo.
Volkswagen was the first carmaker to join SMH to study the concept of the
so-called Swatchmobile micro car, but it pulled out of that project last
year in the face of mounting financial problems.
Mr Nicolas Hayek, chairman of SMH and the man credited with masterminding
the rescue of the Swiss watch industry in the 1980s, claims that he did not
lack for suitors for his Swatchmobile project, when it was abandoned by VW.
By the end, the main rival to Mercedes-Benz was General Motors, the US
carmaker. Like all its rival volume carmakers GM has long been studying the
potential of the so-called sub-B segment of the European car market beneath
the B-class superminis such as the Opel/Vauxhall Corsa, the Ford Fiesta, the
Renault Clio and the Nissan Micra.
It was intrigued by the Swatch marketing expertise, and by SMH's ideas for
hybrid propulsion systems combining electric power and internal combustion,
but like VW it has struggled to stand up the business case for a purely
two-seater urban car. It was also troubled by the safety issues raised by
such a small car.
The traditional volume carmakers are still experimenting and hovering on the
brink, and at the Geneva motor show, Ford will unveil today its latest
concept for a sub-B car, the Ka, to further assess the reactions of
potential buyers.
The ebullient Mr Hayek has never been plagued by the big carmakers' doubts.
He says he has been driven by the conviction that there is a gap at the
bottom of the market for 'a high quality, environmentally friendly, low
price car'. The success of the concept will be supported, he says, by the
classless image of the Swatch brand, as well as by SMH's experience in
micromechanics, microelectronics and in the assembly of a high quality
product using fewer parts.
For Mercedes-Benz the joint venture with Swatch is the most tangible sign
yet of its earnest to jump over its own shadow as it transforms its
strategic product policy in the search for new markets.
Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes-Benz chief executive, claims that its traditional
customers are on the move into new markets, and the executive and luxury
carmaker wants to be there to meet them.
Behind closed doors, Mercedes-Benz has worked for more than a decade on
concepts for urban micro cars, and it believes that the time has come to
roll the dice.
'We intend to create a market segment which has hitherto not existed in this
form yet provides substantial growth potential,' says Mr Werner boldly.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cautionary tale for investors - Porton
International's disappointing record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Porton International, the biotechnology company with a disappointing record
which provides a cautionary tale for potential investors in the sector, is
close to a decision to put itself up for sale.
The privately owned company has engaged merchant bankers Kleinwort Benson to
examine whether other pharmaceutical businesses might be interested in
buying it.
A stock market flotation is another option likely to be considered.
The aim of the initiative is to provide a possible escape route for
institutional investors which put Pounds 76m into Porton during the 1980s on
the basis of profits projections which the company has failed to deliver.
In its last full year in 1992 Porton turned in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3m
on sales of Pounds 49.1m.
Several of the investors have expressed disappointment that the company
failed to live up to early expectations. But following management changes at
Porton the investors now say they are relatively confident about its
immediate future.
One investor said: 'There has been a sea change in the way the company is
being run. There is a much greater willingness to tell shareholders what is
happening and it's got much better credibility with customers.'
Another investor said: 'There's no doubt that collectively a lot of
institutions made a mistake in backing this company in the way we did but we
are generally more hopeful now.'
Porton was set up in 1982 by Mr Wensley Haydon-Baillie, its former chairman.
He stepped down from executive responsibilities nearly two years ago after a
series of discussions with shareholders and other executives.
Mr Haydon-Baillie's replacement as chairman is Lord Chilver, who is chairman
of English China Clays and is the former head of the Cranfield Institute of
Technology.
Mr Haydon-Baillie, who still owns about a third of the company, raised the
finance for Porton from several big institutional investors including Legal
and General, Sun Alliance, Lloyds Bank and the pension funds of British
Telecom, Imperial Chemical Industries and the Post Office.
He raised eyebrows by selling some of his shares in Porton to other
investors in 1986 for Pounds 24m. In 1987 and 1988 he obtained dividend
payments from the company totalling some Pounds 1.1m, in addition to drawing
a salary of about Pounds 95,000 a year.
Porton was considered unusual among biotechnology companies in the UK and US
for the large amount of cash which it raised early in its life and the fact
that the founder was able to make a lot of money out of the company before
the company had proved itself.
The company placed much store in its early financial projections on an
anti-herpes medication which took longer than expected to develop and then
four years ago failed to prove effective in clinical trials.
Partly as a result of this setback, the company failed by a long chalk to
achieve the profit of Pounds 140.6m in 1990 which investors had been told in
a planning document issued in 1985 might be achievable.
The company became a byword for spending large sums of money on its opulent
office in Mayfair and also on salaries.
Mr John Burke, the company's former chief executive who left last August,
was paid Pounds 450,000 in 1989, putting him among the top 50 UK
manufacturing executives that year in terms of salary.
As part of his settlement with the company on his departure Mr Burke
received a payment of Pounds 650,000 which will be charged to the accounts
in the second half of last year.
Mr Haydon-Baillie also caused a stir by employing a personal security
adviser, a former member of the Special Air Service, to ward off inquiries
from journalists.
This dislike for publicity meant that several shareholders in the mid 1980s
accused the company of excessive secrecy.
They said this made it hard for them to find out details of the company's
progress.
Mr Tony Gover, a long-time business associate of Mr Haydon-Baillie who
helped him set up Porton and is the company's vice chairman, says the
company is trying to put such problems behind it and adopt a more
conventional management style. 'We are in a different era now,' he says.
Mr Alistair Stokes, brought in as chief operating officer in 1992 from
Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals group, says: 'We may not have such a big
future as we thought at one time, but it's still a bright future.'
One of the changes is that the company has established quarterly meetings
with its shareholders in London and Edinburgh to keep them informed.
As for its products, rather than emphasising the development of new
medicines, the company is concentrating on cranking up sales of its
portfolio of drugs mainly aimed at hospital use for treating relatively rare
conditions.
These include Dysport, a medicine used to treat neuromuscular conditions,
and Erwinase for leukaemia.
The company also makes a range of vaccines, for use mainly in the defence
industry for protection against certain kinds of chemical warfare agents,
and has research agreements to exploit scientific advances at St George's
Medical School in London and the Centre for Applied Microbiology and
Research near Salisbury in Wiltshire.
Kleinwort Benson is due to finish its review this spring. Among the options
likely to be considered for Porton are a merger with another drugs group or
a flotation on the stock exchange.
One person close to the discussions said he would 'be surprised' if a bigger
pharmaceutical company failed to express some interest in bidding for the
group.
A pharmaceuticals analyst said: 'As a small vertically integrated
pharmaceuticals operation, with a range of facilities from research
laboratories to tried and tested production plants, Porton has been quite
successful.
'It's a different image to the one Porton was trying to project at one stage
as a developer of world beating medicines, but it's probably more
realistic.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hartons losses reduced to Pounds 4.52m in
depressed market conditions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hartons Group, the Sheffield-based distributor of semi-finished plastics,
yesterday reported a Pounds 1.73m reduction in pre-tax losses to Pounds
4.52m for the year to December 31.
Mr Charles Lenox-Conyngham, chairman, said 'considerable strides' had been
made to resolve the main areas of concern at a time when markets remained
depressed by the recession.
He said the 1993 deficit was mainly because of poor performances in France
and Spain where attributable losses amounted to Pounds 3.57m and Pounds
605,000 respectively.
In the UK, trading activities produced higher profits. In the Benelux
countries, a profit was achieved in the second half after a weak start to
the year.
Turnover of continuing operations totalled Pounds 47m (Pounds 51.3m),
generating operating profits of Pounds 548,000 (Pounds 544,000). Losses per
share were cut from 8.5p to 5.9p. The preference dividend has again been
deferred.
Hartons will concentrate all of its resources on the development of its
distribution businesses in the UK and the Benelux countries following the
sale of its French subsidiary. Completion is expected this month.
The group continued to generate cash and reduce borrowings throughout 1993.
The sale of the French offshoot will improve the position further, leaving
bank borrowings at about Pounds 7.5m against Pounds 13.1m at the beginning
of 1993.
Noting a recent rise in the share price the directors said proposals were
being considered which might or might not lead to a substantial acquisition.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lyonnaise sells stake in McAlpine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, one of Europe's biggest construction companies,
yesterday severed a five year link with Alfred McAlpine, with the sale of
its 11.3 per cent stake in the UK group for an estimated Pounds 19m.
Lyonnaise is believed to have placed the 6.4m shares with about six UK
institutions at a price of between 300p and 304p. McAlpine's shares closed
down 5p yesterday at 311p.
The stake dates from 1989 when Dumez bought 4.7 per cent of McAlpine.
Mr Oliver Whitehead, chief executive of McAlpine, said the share sale did
not mean that the original joint venture plans would be scrapped. He was
pleased with the broader shareholder base, which the company had been
seeking.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Decline in furniture division cuts Cornwell
Parker to Pounds 1.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp decline in the furniture division's contribution helped to halve
pre-tax profits at Cornwell Parker, the furniture and fabrics group, from
Pounds 2.92m to Pounds 1.26m for the six months to January 31.
Group turnover eased to Pounds 43m, against Pounds 43.1m, which included
Pounds 1.18m from discontinued operations. Earnings per share fell from 4.6p
to 1.8p, but the interim dividend is being maintained at 1.7p.
Mr Martin Jourdan, chairman, described the opening six months as extremely
difficult. However he believed that the worst was behind it for the
furniture division 'so long as the imminent increases in personal taxation
do not seriously affect demand.'
Operating profits from the furniture division, which includes Parker Knoll,
fell from Pounds 2.32m to Pounds 426,000 on turnover of Pounds 22.7m (Pounds
23.6m). Mr Jourdan said the over-50s target market for Parker Knoll chairs
had been affected by lower interest rates, which had reduced older people's
disposable income.
An attack on a younger market had not been 'as successful as we had hoped',
however, in reverting to the core market Parker Knoll now had significantly
higher orders than a year ago.
The fabrics business turned in a strong performance, with operating profits
up 19 per cent from Pounds 923,000 to Pounds 1.1m on turnover up from Pounds
18.3m to Pounds 20.3m.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Perkins Foods down sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oversupply in the pizza market, a move to a new factory and losses in canned
mushrooms contributed to a Pounds 2.5m fall in 1993 pre-tax profits to
Pounds 19.6m at Perkins Foods before exceptional costs of Pounds 3.9m.
As promised, the final dividend is being held at 2.7p to give a 4.45p (4.4p)
total. The shares rose 1 1/2 p to 76 1/2 p.
Perkins grew rapidly through acquisition in the late 1980s. Mr Howard
Phillips, chief executive, said the emphasis now was on cost reduction and
productivity. The group had won some significant new supermarket customers.
Mr Ian Blackburn, finance director, said the group was protected from the
competition between UK supermarket groups as only about a quarter of its
sales were in the UK, with the Netherlands accounting for more than half.
Group turnover rose 8 per cent to Pounds 382.1m, with volume growth of 6 per
cent in the group's manufacturing activities. Operating margins fell from
7.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent.
In the frozen food division, which now includes mushrooms, operating profits
fell from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds 13.6m. The division suffered the problems
in the pizza market, but also had the benefit of a Pounds 1.2m insurance
gain in 1992 from a fire at a pizza plant. Perkins has closed Sunbird, its
lossmaking frozen vegetable business, treated as a discontinued business.
Chilled foods profits fell from Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 3.4m, largely because
of extra costs, of up to Pounds 1m, at Baxter meat products when production
was moved. Fresh produce recovered ground lost in 1992 when bumper crops hit
prices. Profits there were up from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 7.8m.
Interest charges took Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 1.7m). Earnings per share were
4.9p (9.5p) after exceptionals.
COMMENT
If 1992 was billed as a year of consolidation for Perkins, 1993 was one of
rationalisation. The acquisition record is now shown up to be mixed at best,
with companies bought now being closed. With earn-outs coming to an end some
vendors are heading for the door, not that Perkins is sorry to see them go
as new management is being brought in. Another Pounds 1.7m of deferred
consideration could be due in 1994, of which perhaps half will be taken in
shares. Then in 1997 redemption of the first D-Mark convertibles loom,
although Perkins now has the facilities in place to cope. Interest cover may
look good at 9 times, but that ignores preference dividends of around Pounds
3.7m after tax. After two down years, a yield of 7 1/4 per cent says more
about the shares than a prospective p/e of 9 1/2 on tentative forecasts of
Pounds 20m for 1994.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Polythene rises 28% - Disposal
profits boost outcome by Pounds 1.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Polythene Industries, Europe's largest polythene film producer,
increased its profits by 28 per cent to Pounds 15.4m in 1993 helped by a
Pounds 20.6m rights issue which reduced interest charges and Pounds 1.1m of
disposal profits.
Underlying earnings on a fully diluted basis edged up from 24.75p to 25p.
Turnover rose by a fifth to Pounds 212m and Mr Cameron McLatchie, chairman,
predicted it would top Pounds 250m this year. 'Our business is growing, and
with considerable success, in difficult conditions,' he said.
Half of group sales go to British food retailers, either as plastic bags or
transit packaging, and British Polythene's shares have underperformed on
worries about a potential squeeze on margins from the hard-pressed
supermarkets.
Operating margins slipped from 8.19 per cent to 7.84 per cent, with profits
from con-tinuing operations up only 2 per cent to Pounds 14.8m on turnover 9
per cent higher at Pounds 193m.
Mr McLatchie said that excluding Pounds 500,000 of reorganisation costs
there was an improvement in margins between the two halves. But this was
partly because of a reduction in raw materials costs.
'Retailers are being very difficult, but they have been difficult for a long
time,' he said.
Mr McLatchie said that some retailers had defected after the Pounds 8.4m
acquisition of a rival plastic bag manufacturer from Sonoco a year ago.
'They are not comfortable with sole suppliers.' But he stressed that the
loss of customers had been expected. 'We have kept half of the real business
and moved the spare equipment to China.'
British Polythene has formed a joint venture in China which will start
producing small, thin retail bags towards the end of the year.
The company will offer retailers the choice of UK or Chinese-made bags, but
Mr McLatchie warned: 'If retailers end up buying everything from China there
will no customers left for their shops.'
The final dividend rises to 7.75p for a total up 15 per cent to 11.5p.
COMMENT
The largest supplier in a mature commodity market, British Polythene has
shown it can generate good profits growth by hoovering up its smaller, often
struggling, rivals. This cannot go on for ever - though with 25 per cent of
the market there appears enough scope for the next few years - and Mr
McLatchie is not optimistic that the frustrating search for good
acquisitions in Europe will bear fruit. But the more immediate worry is the
threat to margins from cost-cutting supermarkets. The shares have picked up
over the past month, and on forecasts of Pounds 17.5m are now trading on 16
times forward earnings. Until the trend in margins is clearer that looks
high enough.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bristol &amp; West expands to Pounds 41.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bristol &amp; West building society, the UK's tenth largest, yesterday announced
pre-tax profits of Pounds 41.3m for the year to end-December 1993, a rise of
5.6 per cent on the Pounds 39.1m for 1992.
It also restated its 1992 profits as Pounds 14m in the light of new
accounting standards which affect how the sale of some freehold property is
presented.
The society's provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell by 14.6 per cent,
to Pounds 63.3m against Pounds 74.1m.
Mr John Burke, chief executive, said that the provisions charge underlined
the fact that until a relatively recent change in approach, the society had
sought to reach arrangements with borrowers in arrears rather than moving
more quickly to repossession.
The society said that the volume of residential mortgage arrears fell by 45
per cent to Pounds 71m.
Mortgage advances rose by 11.6 per cent to Pounds 1.11bn (Pounds 997m),
while net receipts of retail savings more than doubled to Pounds 230m
(Pounds 101m).
B&amp;W's wholesale funding fell to 25.1 per cent of shares and deposits,
against 27.8 per cent in 1992. Total assets rose to Pounds 8.14bn (Pounds
7.73bn).
Mr Burke said that the society was pressing ahead with the sale of 46
branches in estate agent chains Hamptons and Bristol &amp; West Property
Services. The remaining branches - about 70 in Hamptons and about 30 in BWPS
 -will be retained.
The group's cost/income ratio was 56 per cent, down slightly from 57 per
cent in 1992. The society's cost income ratio was 44 per cent (45 per cent).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Portland Estates, the property investment and development group, has
acquired the freehold of Guild House, Swindon, for Pounds 5.9m cash.
The 53,000 sq ft office building, developed in 1980, is the headquarters of
Book Club Associates, the Reed International/Doubleday joint venture.
The current lease runs until 2005, at an annual rent of Pounds 570,000,
subject to review in 1995 and 2000.
Mr Patrick Hall, deputy managing director, said: 'Since the commencement of
our rights issue in June last year, we have now invested a total of more
than Pounds 82m in new acquisitions, which in a full year should add more
than Pounds 7.4m to rental income.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Candover Investments optimistic on
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Candover Investments, an investment trust specialising in management
buy-outs, increased net assets per share by 16 per cent in 1993 but pre-tax
profits fell by 19 per cent to Pounds 3.3m.
Mr Roger Brooke, chairman, said that although 1993 had been 'a relatively
quiet year, both for investments and realisations' there had been several
encouraging new developments towards the year-end 'which should herald a
period of greater activity.'
In particular, he said, the profits of many of Candover's investee companies
had benefited sufficiently from the improved economic environment to enable
them to plan a listing for their shares this year or next.
About eight portfolio companies are currently planning flotations which, if
completed successfully, could lead to a strong uplift in Candover's net
asset value.
Net assets rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 69.4m (Pounds 59.8m) while net
assets per share rose to 310p compared with 267p at the end of 1992 - a
smaller increase than the 23 per cent gain in the FT-SE-A All-Share Index.
However, net assets have shown compound growth of 21 per cent in the nine
years since Candover was listed. The FT-SE-A All-Share Index has risen 12
per cent a year over the same period.
The decline in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 4.1m in 1992, was due partly to
the impact of lower interest rates, which reduced the return on Candover's
cash balances. The company had cash of Pounds 22.6m at the year end. In
addition the group earned fewer financing fees.
In a quiet year for transactions Candover, together with its funds under
management, invested in two larger buy-outs - Gardner Merchant and Economic
Insurance - three smaller buy-outs and a number of follow-up investments in
portfolio companies.
The main realisation during the year was the flotation of Motor World in
February 1993. Since the year-end Midland Independent Newspapers has also
applied for a listing.
Fully diluted earnings per share fell by 24.4 per cent to 10.33p (13.67p)
but, because of the 'good prospects for further growth of both assets and
profits,' the final dividend is being increased by 8.5 per cent to 7.05p
(6.5p) making a total of 11p (10.25p).
The shares closed up 2p at 337p.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Intrum Justitia falls 13% to Pounds 13.9m -
Adverse currency movements and problems in Swiss office behind the decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intrum Justitia, Europe's largest debt collection group, yesterday announced
a fall in profits for 1993 because of the impact of currency declines on
Nordic profits, and problems in its Swiss office.
Pre-tax profits fell by 13 per cent to Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 16m) on turnover
of Pounds 83.6m, down from Pounds 88.9m. The fall in Nordic currencies
reduced operating profit by Pounds 1.2m, and the company said that in
constant currency terms, pre-tax profit increased by 6 per cent during the
year.
Mr Bo Goranson, chief executive and the company's largest shareholder, said
Intrum Justitia was aiming to increase the number of cases handled by 20 per
cent during 1994, from the year-end level of 2.82m. These cases had a gross
value of Pounds 1.4bn.
The company said it would expand through organic growth rather than by
acquisition. Mr Goranson described Europe as a 'virgin market' for debt
collection, offering significant potential for existing and new offices.
Operating profits fell by 21 per cent to Pounds 14.2m despite stable
operating expenses. However, the net interest charge fell to Pounds 910,000
(Pounds 1.73m) because of lower interest rates and cash generation, which
reduced gearing from 72 per cent to 43.5 per cent.
Intrum Justitia performed strongly in the early stages of the recession,
when companies are forced to improve cash management. But as economies have
contracted, growth in new business and the collection success rate have
slowed.
The company was adversely affected by management problems in its Swiss
operation, which resulted in a Pounds 2m drop in operating profit in 1993.
These have been resolved.
Mr Goranson said Intrum Justitia had increased market share in most of its
markets. The UK, which accounts for about one-third of profit, France and
Germany all performed strongly, and further growth is expected in the
current year.
Earnings per share rose marginally to 9.3p (9.2p) and the directors have
recommended a final dividend of 2.2p, lifting the total pay-out to 3.3p, a
10 per cent increase.
COMMENT
Intrum Justitia has been viewed with some suspicion by investors, due to the
slightly dark reputation of the debt collection industry. Its latest results
provide little cheer, but the future holds more promise. Profits should rise
to about Pounds 17m in 1994, boosted by a turnround in Switzerland. This
puts the shares on a prospective p/e of 10.7. Impending government
initiatives on late payment should help broaden demand for debt collection
services in the immature European market. Lord Hollick's MAI owns 19 per
cent, and has for some time been rumoured to be keen to increase its stake.
The current share price reflects little of this, and offers significant
potential upside in the longer term.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Badgerline more than doubles to Pounds 6.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Badgerline Group, the Avon-based bus company, yesterday reported profits
broadly in line with the forecast made when it came to the market in
November.
The group's shares, floated at 115p, closed 5 1/2 p higher at 125 1/2 p.
The year to end-December saw pre-tax profits more than double to Pounds 6.9m
(Pounds 3.2m) from a turnover Pounds 5m higher at Pounds 132m.
Mr Trevor Smallwood, executive chairman, said all the group's operating
companies had performed well.
He expected last month's Pounds 23m acquisition of PMT Group, the
Staffordshire-based bus company, to be earnings enhancing. The purchase
pushed Badgerline's gearing above 150 per cent, but this was expected to be
reduced significantly by cashflow during the current year.
The group said a recent Office of Fair Trading report into the activities of
its Thamesway subsidiary at Southend had cleared the company of
anti-competitive practices. Its main competitor in the town had been sold by
the local council, which would stabilise the market.
Thamesway had made a meaningful contribution as a result of improved trading
conditions in the Southend area in the second half of the year, and
full-year benefits were expected to continue into 1994.
Badgerline expects a decision soon on the public inquiry concerning its
Kensington depot in Bath, where Safeway wants to build a supermarket. Should
the planning application be blocked, Badgerline would write down the depot's
value in its balance sheet by Pounds 5.2m.
If the plan goes ahead, the group will relocate to a new depot and gain
Pounds 7.5m in free cashflow.
Mr Smallwood said that while it was too early to make any predictions about
trading during the current year, he was satisfied that the policies
Badgerline had pursued would enable the group to continue the progress of
the past few years.
Earnings per share rose to 8.6p (4.1p) compared with the prospectus forecast
of 7.9p.
The group said it would start paying dividends in the current year. Had it
been listed from the beginning of last year, the board would have
recommended a notional net dividend of 4.1p.

expectations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The directors of Country Casuals Holdings, the women's wear group, are
confident that pre-tax profits for the year ended January 31 1994 will be in
line with market expectations.
Although over the last two weeks the trading pattern had been adversely
affected by poor weather, the core business was currently running 4 per cent
above last year, with the Koto chain showing a 31 per cent rise.
The directors said that year-end sales in the core Country Casuals brand
were 5 per cent higher at Pounds 36.1m while gross margins 'significantly
improved' over those achieved in the first half.
The shares were unchanged at 167p.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Guinness Peat holds near 10% stake in
Premier Investments
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Ron Brierley's Guinness Peat Group has emerged as the holder of a
near-10 per cent stake in Premier Investments, a small quoted Australian
investment and wholesaling company previously headed by Mr Solomon Lew.
Mr Lew, who announced yesterday that he was stepping down as a director of
Premier, is better known as the chairman of Coles Myers, one of Australia's
largest retailers.
Last year, Premier was the focus of much controversy - and an Australian
Securities Commission inquiry - over a deal in 1989 which involved Premier
in buying a block of 9.22m Coles Myers' shares.
Originally, a private Lew family company called Etiket had undertaken to buy
these shares for ADollars 8.12 (Pounds 4) each. But Premier offered to
purchase the same block for ADollars 9 each, allowing Etiket to pocket the
balance of 88 cents a share in return for cancelling the ear lier purchase
agreement.
The ADollars 9 paid by Premier matched the price it paid for a block of
institutionally-held shares in Coles Myers at the same time. However, the
market price for Coles Myers' shares when the deal closed was ADollars 8.62.
Certain disclosure requirements were also breached.
Yesterday, Premier said that it had offered UK-based Guinness Peat a seat on
the board, and that its new shareholder had nominated Mr Gary Weiss as its
representative.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Parkdean Leisure just ahead of forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parkdean Leisure, the holiday park operator which floated last October, just
beat its Pounds 1.4m prospectus forecast with operating profits of Pounds
1.41m, against Pounds 1.3m, for the year to November. The shares, issued at
120p, closed unchanged at 163p.
With the benefit of the Pounds 7.5m net proceeds of the float for six weeks,
interest charges fell from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 600,000 and pre-tax
profits were up 61.6 per cent at Pounds 811,000 (Pounds 502,000).
Mr Graham Wilson, managing director, said in spite of the worst summer
weather he could remember and weak consumer confidence, Parkdean had sold 13
per cent more holidays in 1993 and had increased occupancy rates from 74.7
to 75.1 per cent on top of a 5 per cent rise in capacity.
This year had started better with bookings up 6 per cent by volume and 10
per cent by value. Capacity for the 1994 season would be up less than 3 per
cent, and like-for-like prices were about 3 per cent higher.
The float had cut net debt from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 1.35m, and gearing was
13 per cent at the year end. Mr Wilson said it should peak in March at about
25 per cent.
He said he was now looking at acquisitions, but had turned some down as
being too expensive. The prospect of an enlarged group had helped Parkdean
improve discounts from suppliers, partly offsetting the extra costs of being
a quoted company, he said.
Turnover was 8.5 per cent up at Pounds 9.22m. Touring income fell 10 per
cent as caravan owners stayed at home in wet weather, but hiring income rose
8 per cent. The two contributed 40 per cent of group sales. Retail sales
made 43 per cent of the total, with bar sales up 6 per cent. Caravan sales
rose 25 per cent, although gross margins were lower.
Earnings per share were 6.9p (6.1p) but on a pro forma basis were 8.9p
against a prospectus forecast of 8.7p. A dividend of 1.3p is proposed.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BBA restructures management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBA, the engineering and motor components group, yesterday unveiled a new
management structure aimed at returning the company to profit.
For the year to December 31 BBA swung from profits of Pounds 47.4m to
pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.8m.
The diversified group has reorganised its businesses into three divisions
comprising automotive activities, aviation services in the US, and a single
industrial and engineering unit.
The scheme has been implemented by Mr Roberto Quarta, chief executive, in an
attempt to refocus the company on core activities and to identify peripheral
activities for disposal.
In the 12 months to end-December, that strategy contributed to a Pounds
17.8m exceptional loss on plant closures and disposals - most notably on the
closure of its friction materials plant in Belgium.
The group also wrote off a Pounds 3.8m investment in United Industries, the
precision tools and springs manufacturer, in which it has a 21.23 per cent
stake.
The exceptional provisions were offset only by an Pounds 18.4m gain on the
sale of Pacific BBA, its partly owned Australian subsidiary.
Mr Peter Clappison, finance director, said the disposals - including the
Pounds 25m sale of three business since the year end - were part of an
on-going restructuring programme which would enable BBA to exploit any
revival in its core businesses.
He warned, however, that there were few signs that such a revival was
underway.
In the automotive division, for example, operating profits fell to Pounds
21.5m (Pounds 37.6m) on sales down 7.6 per cent at Pounds 574.1m.
'There's been extreme price pressure in continental Europe, and we
anticipate a further 10 per decline in volume output next year,' Mr
Clappison added.
Profit margins in the division fell to 1.5 per cent in the second half of
last year, compared with 5.6 per cent in the same period of 1992.
Initial signs, meanwhile, of a recovery in the aviation business were
undermined by 'extreme overcapacity and reduced demand in the US airline
maintenance market'.
Its second half margins also fell sharply, down to 1.6 per cent from 4.2 per
cent in the last six months of 1992.
The performance of the two divisions was offset by an improvement in the
industrial and engineering division, which enjoyed a 42 per cent increase in
operating profits to Pounds 55.3m.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists advances 16%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Chemists, the UK's second largest pharmaceuticals retailer, yesterday
promised to step up dividend growth as it announced a 16 per cent increase
in interim pre-tax profits and a 35 per cent rise in the first half pay-out.
The dividend, up from 2p to 2.7p, is covered more than five times by fully
diluted earnings of 13.96p (12.4p). Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman, said the group
intended to increase the payment until cover approached the stores sector
average of more than twice.
The decision reflected the board's confidence in the group's less
acquisitive future, he said. It had been two years since the last large
acquisition - that of Macarthy in 1992 - but Lloyds 'continued to show good
rates of growth'.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to December 31 were Pounds 26.2m (Pounds
22.6m) on sales up by 17 per cent to Pounds 460m (Pounds 394.7m).
The largest sales advance came from the pharmaceuticals division, which
increased net external sales by 44 per cent to Pounds 123.2m (Pounds 85.7m).
This included an 80 per cent improvement in external sales to Pounds 94m at
Barclay Pharmaceuticals, the wholesaler. However, the wholesaling
environment continued to be very difficult, Mr Lloyd said.
The flu season, which was earlier than expected, helped boost sales in the
retail division from Pounds 284.5m to Pounds 307.7m. The company said
like-for-like sales were 9 per cent higher in the chemists shops, 1 per cent
up in the Supersave Drugstores, and 3 per cent ahead in the Holland &amp;
Barrett healthfood chain. Margins had improved, partly due to the
introduction of electronic point of sales systems, from 7.6 per cent to 8
per cent over the 12 months.
On debt of Pounds 31.6m (Pounds 32.4m) gearing fell to 25 per cent from 31
per cent. The group announced a seven-year loan facility of Dollars 100m
(Pounds 68m) at 7 per cent interest.
COMMENT
Lloyds is stressing its organic growth record in order to prove that the
lingering doubts about accounting practices and quality of earnings are
unfounded, While some concerns may have been allayed, others are beginning
to appear.
These include the potential for the wholesaling division, which is suffering
some margin pressure in a competitive environment. There is also the
question of a replacement for Mr Dick Steele, the departing finance
director.
These issues may well explain why the company continues to trade at a
substantial discount to the stores sector. Forecasts are for between Pounds
55m and Pounds 57m, putting the shares on a prospective p/e of about 12.
Their attraction may be enhanced by an improved yield of 3.7 per cent.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Vita shows sharp fall to Pounds
33.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Vita, the foam and fibre group, saw profits drop from a restated
Pounds 52.3m in 1992 to Pounds 33.7m last year as the recession in
continental Europe took its toll.
The figures also bore Pounds 10m of trading and disposal losses relating to
the group's withdrawal from Spain.
However, Mr Bob McGee, chairman, said that early indications for the current
year were 'heartening'.
'Across Europe conditions appear to have stabilised, albeit at 1993 levels.
Some recovery is showing through in the UK while North America continues to
exhibit steady improvement.'
Earnings per share fell from 15.6p to 9.6p, but dividends are up from 7.15p
to 7.4p with a final payment of 3.75p.
Mr McGee said that while volumes in most areas, apart from Germany, had
remained 'reasonable', there had been increasing pressure on margins.
Excluding acquisitions and disposals, sales rose 2.5 per cent to Pounds
712m.
Germany, which accounts for more than a fifth of group sales, bore the brunt
of a cost reduction programme which has reduced staff in continental Europe
by 9 per cent.
Total rationalisation costs more than doubled to Pounds 5m.
Mr Kanak Bhatt, finance director, said that price pressure had been
particularly intense in automotive products, which account for some 15 per
cent of group sales.
Icoa, the Spanish foam manufacturer acquired in 1988, had been 'losing a
fortune' on automotive components while the group's Spanish plastics
business was badly hit by the construction downturn. Both have been sold to
management for nominal sums.
Thanks to a Pounds 73m rights issue two years ago the balance sheet is
strong, with gearing of 14 per cent.
Mr McGee said the company was particularly keen to expand in the US and
eastern Europe where its Pounds 6m foam plant in Poland will be commissioned
next month.
Favourable exchange rate movements boosted operating profits by Pounds 1.4m
and the group has switched to translating figures at average exchange rates,
restating the 1992 results.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pict Petroleum drops to Pounds 1.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pict Petroleum, the small exploration company, yesterday announced a 35 per
cent drop in interim net profits from Pounds 2.92m to Pounds 1.87m because
of the absence of currency gains following the devaluation of sterling last
year.
Currency gains fell sharply from Pounds 1.38m to Pounds 85,000.
Mr Peter Everett, chairman, said the currency effect and net profits decline
masked a strong underlying performance, with the operating return for the
six months to December 31 77 per cent higher at Pounds 1.65m.
The return was achieved in spite of a marked weakening of oil prices from an
average of Dollars 18.76 per barrel to Dollars 15.13.
Turnover rose by 57 per cent to Pounds 7.52m.
The increase was largely due to an early contribution from the Scott field
in the North Sea, which came on stream in September. The company reached
record production levels of 737,400 barrels of oil equivalent, of which some
220,847 had been produced by the Scott field.
Pict was determined to continue its exploration programme, and had budgeted
about Pounds 8m for projects this year.
The company also said it intended to pursue further acquisitions abroad.
Pict ended the first half with cash of Pounds 15.5m against Pounds 14.8m
last year. Net debt was Pounds 13.5m, equal to 29 per cent of shareholders'
funds.
As in previous years, there is no dividend. Earnings per share fell from
5.66p to 3.62p.

Process Systems, the North Carolina-based maker of electronic monitoring,

pre-tax profits by 68 per cent from Dollars 226,776 to Dollars 380,300
(Pounds 260,500) in 1993.
The turnover advance to Dollars 15.1m (Dollars 12.4m) was mainly
attributable to continued market penetration by the QUAD4 solid-state meter

Net profits were Dollars 405,300 (Dollars 226,776) for earnings of 0.73

IMI, international engineering group, saw pre-tax profits nudge up in 1993,
but its advance was held back by losses in its computer business and by the
restructuring of its fluid power division.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end December were Pounds 70.2m against
Pounds 68m.
Earnings per share came out ahead at 13.8p (13.6p). A same-again final
dividend of 5.8p is recommended, to maintain the total payment at 10p.
The figures were in line with expectations, but the promise of further
recovery, implicit in the results and carefully indicated in the formal
statement of the chairman, Sir Eric Pountain, helped the share price rise 7p
to 347p.
Turnover increased to Pounds 1.06bn (Pounds 1.01bn).
Three of the four main business groups - building products, drinks
dispensers and special engineering - had significant increases in operating
profits.
Only the fluid power division, where there was a decline in operating
profits to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 16.9m), broke the pattern.
Mr Gary Allen, the chief executive, reported a 3 per cent increase in
trading volume in the US last year and a 2 per cent increase during the
second half in the UK, but falls in Germany, Italy and Spain.
The troublesome titanium operations were in and out of profit during 1993,
falling back into loss during the last quarter. Mr Allen expects the
business to be in profit by the second half.
With losses at the group's copper tube plant eliminated by reductions in the
cost base and a Pounds 30m investment programme, the group's problem area
has been computers.
Losses at Brook Street Computers led to the sale of the company, acquired in
1990, at a loss of Pounds 5.9m, shown in the accounts as an exceptional
item.
COMMENT
Computers replaced titanium and copper as the gremlins in the IMI figures,
which showed the group poised for, rather than actually enjoying, recovery.
The computer problems should sort themselves out this year as new products
from the division come on the market. Like other engineering groups, IMI has
been honing both manufacturing and financial efficiency during the recession
and an improvement in market conditions would rapidly come through to the
bottom line. But the prospects for that look patchy, suggesting a steady
advance for the group this year, perhaps towards Pounds 90m pre-tax, and a
much stronger move in 1995. With earnings going up to 19p a share, this
would put the shares on a multiple of 18, more keenly priced than some of
their peers but demanding of their holders patience as a virtue.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Royal Ordnance comes into the firing line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost seven years after the government sold Royal Ordnance to British
Aerospace for Pounds 190m, a question mark has once again been placed over
the future of the arms and munitions manufacturer.
BAe confirmed at the weekend that it had been in talks for some weeks with
Giat which could lead to some form of collaboration between the French
state-owned arms manufacturer and its Ordnance subsidiary.
The acquisition in April 1987 not only strengthened BAe's already
substantial defence business but appeared to ensure a stable future for
300-year-old Royal Ordnance following aborted plans for its stock market
flotation a year earlier. At that stage Ordnance was a sprawling
organisation employing 16,000 workers spread across 13 factories and two
research and development sites.
With the Ministry of Defence as it biggest customer by far it had annual
sales of Pounds 440m and a forward order book of Pounds 800m. Sir Austin
Pearce, BAe chairman at the time, said of the deal: 'We feel strongly we can
increase the business of Ordnance.' However, he added more ominously:
'Clearly there are areas where we can improve its efficiency.'
Four months later, following a detailed study, it became clear what Sir
Austin had meant when plans were announced to close the Enfield plant -
source of the 2m .303 Lee Enfield rifles used during the First World war -
with the loss of 1,200 jobs.
The job cuts at Enfield were to be the first of many as the 1980s drew to a
close and defence spending was cut in the wake of the dramatic event in
eastern Europe and the disintegration of the Soviet empire.
Since then Ordnance's UK-based workforce has been reduced to 6,500. Some
2,100 jobs have gone in the last two years and another 300 are to go at the
company's ammunition factory in Chorley, Lancashire, under the latest round
of cuts announced in January.
BAe, which last month reported a Pounds 273m pre-tax loss despite recording
a Pounds 345m profit before interest and tax in its defence operations, does
not break out figures for Ordnance.
However, BAe describes Ordnance's operations today as 'very competitive' and
says it is 'cash generative and broadly profitable' excluding the ongoing
costs of rationalisation.
Ordnance, which has annual sales of about Pounds 400m, has been trying to
build up overseas orders to help offset declining MoD expenditure. As part
of this drive it acquired Heckler &amp; Koch, a German small arms manufacturer,
in 1991.
In October the company won a crucial MoD five-year contract worth about
Pounds 250m to supply ammunition types ranging from small arms to tank
shells.
The contract, delayed after coming under Treasury scrutiny, was won against
fierce competition.
However, highlighting the effect of defence cuts, the new ammunition order
was worth only about half the previous five-year deal agreed in 1988 and
further job cuts and rationalisation measures have not been ruled out.
Even without the profit and loss figures it is clear that Royal Ordnance has
not been the bargain some suggested it was at the time of the government
sale.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: D&amp;G increases 30% to Pounds 4.45m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Domestic &amp; General, the domestic appliance insurer, yesterday reported
pre-tax profits up 29.6 per cent to Pounds 4.45m for the six months ended
December 31. The interim dividend goes up by 23.3 per cent to 9.25p.
Despite depressed conditions, sales of extended warranties and annual
policies increased by 24.2 per cent to Pounds 32.58m (Pounds 26.23m).
Other income fell by 9.8 per cent to Pounds 239,000 (Pounds 265,000) but
after claims and commissions D&amp;G's trading activities yielded a surplus of
Pounds 8.09m (Pounds 6.29m).
Expenses increased to Pounds 6.53m (Pounds 5.55m) and net investment income
rose to Pounds 3.12m (Pounds 2.86m).
Mr Colin Honey, managing director, said that it was 'too early to comment'
about the Office of Fair Trading's investigations into extended warranties
on electrical goods. The company is expected by analysts to emerge unscathed
from the affair.
This is largely because the majority of its income is from direct mail or
through manufacturers' schemes, rather than through sales of extended
warranties through shops. Analysts suggest that D&amp;G's policies are, on
average, between 30 per cent and 50 per cent cheaper than its competitors.
Earnings rose to 43.51p (33.55p) per share.
COMMENT
D&amp;G produced another good set of figures yesterday and with the OFT's
interest in extended warranty business likely to work in the company's
favour, there are no obvious clouds on the horizon. D&amp;G looks set to make
pre-tax profits of between Pounds 9.3m and Pounds 9.5m for the full year,
continuing its strong earnings growth of recent years. A prospective yield
of about 2 is half the market's average, but - by contrast - the multiple of
about 20 looks undemanding.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wembley sells 50% of Pacer Cats in Pounds
17m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wembley, the leisure group which owns the national stadium, is selling a 50
per cent stake in Pacer Cats, its computer ticketing subsidiary, in a bid to
comply with a banking deadline to cut borrowings by Pounds 40m, writes Tim
Burt.
Ticketmaster, the US computerised ticketing service, is paying Pounds 11m
cash for the stake and will be forming a joint venture to develop the
company. Sir Brian Wolfson, Wembley chairman, said the joint venture would
assume Pounds 6m of Pacer Cats' debt. 'The transaction is worth Pounds 17m
to Wembley and brings us close to the Pounds 40m demanded by our lenders.
The banks are very comfortable with the position.'
The sale follows the disposal of several assets last year, including
National Leisure Catering, Yankee Doodle, another catering group, and the
Needles Hotel.
It is understood the disposal programme is now within 5 per cent of the
total repayments due by March 31.
Although the moves will significantly reduce Wembley's net debt, put at
Pounds 139m at the interim stage last year, lenders, led by Barclays, have
also demanded repayment of a further Pounds 10m by the end of the year.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Close Brothers significantly ahead of
forecasts at Pounds 16.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Close Brothers, the merchant banking and financial services group,
rose 83p to 528p yesterday when the company announced interim profits
significantly ahead of forecasts.
The company reported pre-tax profits up by almost Pounds 10m to Pounds 16.7m
for the six months to January 31. Analysts had been predicting figures in
the region of Pounds 12m.
Winterflood Securities, the smaller companies market maker acquired for
Pounds 19m last April, was a large contributor to the increase, accounting
for about 40 per cent of profits.
The remaining Close Brothers' businesses also put in a strong performance,
recording a 45 per cent advance.
Winterflood benefited from the increased activity in the stock market, and
made record profits during the period. The company now makes a market in
1,150 stocks and is moving to larger premises.
The merchant bank's loan portfolio grew by 23 per cent to Pounds 349m, and
the group reduced the percentage of bad debts.
Corporate finance operations are geared to small and medium sized companies,
and Close Brothers has benefited from a surge in corporate activity among
the smaller listed companies.
Prompt, the company's insurance premium financing subsidiary, saw a 32 per
cent increase in volume in the period, while the asset leasing business also
performed strongly.
The interim dividend is raised to 5p (3.2p), payable from earnings per share
up from 11.9p to 22.2p. A 1-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed.
COMMENT
Close Brothers' shares fell 11 per cent last week, in part because of
concerns that the company might be affected by a less confident stock
market. It has provided a powerful defence at the interim stage. Brokers
expect pre-tax profits to exceed Pounds 33m (previous forecasts had peaked
at Pounds 25m), which puts the shares on a p/e of 12, even after the shares'
meteoric performance yesterday. The momentum of the company's market making
business may slow, but Close Brothers has a broad spread of businesses,
which should perform strongly in the economic upturn; the shares should do
likewise.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Gates scorns most multimedia trials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Gates, founder and chairman of Microsoft, the world's largest
personal computer software company, yesterday poured cold water on the value
of most of the 'multi-media' trials in the US and Europe.
Describing the current flush of interest in multimedia as a form of
collective mania, he predicted that trials based on home entertainment would
prove to be dead ends and would be counter-productive to the establishment
of a viable multimedia industry.
Multimedia and 'information superhighway' are descriptions of developments
expected to lead to the delivery of a range of interactive services and
information to the office and the home through a single channel - a
telephone line, for example.
Multimedia has generated considerable attention over the past six months as
companies in the entertainment, communications and computer sectors have
formed expensive alliances to exploit the possibilities.
Mr Gates, believed to be the richest man in the US and with a record as a
technology forecaster, said many of the companies experimenting with
multimedia were misguided in concentrating on single services, such as
'video-on-demand', rather than a broad range, and on the home rather than
business. 'Video-on-demand' implies that customers will be able to select
videos of their choice from an electronic library and have them delivered to
their television sets.
'The first place for widespread usage of this technology will be in
business. It will involve low-cost video conferencing, electronic mail and
group networking. Once business is using multimedia, then we can move to the
home environment.'
'He expected early pilots to be disappointing. 'The revenues generated and
the usage will not justify the huge infrastructure costs.'
Mr Gates, in the UK to talk to British Telecommunications among others about
multimedia collaboration, was speaking only a week after the start of
largest video-on-demand trial, organised by Time Warner, the US cable
television organisation, was postponed until the autumn.
Mr Gates' comments must be seen in the light of Microsoft's ambitions to set
the agenda in multimedia, in which it is investing some Dollars 100m a year.
It has announced that it will test its software in collaboration with
Tele-Communications, the largest US cable operator. Mr Gates said Microsoft
would begin testing home multimedia services in the US and Europe in 1995.
He did not expect substantial returns on the investment for five years.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Risks give rich uncle pause for thought: The biggest test of
British Airways' international strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has USAir become the Achilles' heel of British Airways? The answer will
depend on the success or failure of the latest restructuring plan proposed
by the sixth largest US carrier.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman and architect of the UK airline's
globalisation strategy, yesterday insisted that BA would not withdraw from
the initial Dollars 400m (Pounds 265m) investment it made last year to
acquire and maintain a 24.6 per cent stake in USAir. But in the same breath
he conceded that he was not prepared to invest any additional money in the
US partner until it had secured approval for its recovery strategy. 'It is
not right for us to commit our shareholders' funds until the outcome of the
discussions between USAir, its unions and employees become clear.'
Of all the investments in other airlines made by BA during the last 18
months - at a cost of around Pounds 630m - the equity stake in USAir has
been by far the most ambitious. The rationale was to give BA access to the
world's largest aviation market.
The partnership, fiercely opposed by big US carriers such as American
Airlines and Delta, has given BA the opportunity to pick up and deliver
passengers in the heart of the US market through a ticket code-sharing
agreement with USAir. BA also expects that the partnership will eventually
provide important cost savings.
But the partnership has always been seen by City of London analysts as a
calculated gamble, hinging on USAir's ability to put together a recovery
strategy while BA helps to keep it afloat. BA is partly insulated from
USAir's losses because its 24.6 per cent stake consists of preference shares
yielding 7 per cent.
However, Mr Chris Avery, aviation analyst at Paribas Capital Markets, says
BA's investment in USAir 'is possibly the greatest area of risk for
investors in BA over the next few years'.
Other analysts warn that there is still a risk that USAir will be forced to
seek protection from creditors, under the US Chapter 11 bankruptcy rules,
unless it can secure the backing of unions and employees for sweeping
restructuring. Should this happen, BA could find itself in the same boat as
other European carriers, such as KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Scandinavian
Airlines System which have been forced to make heavy write-offs on their
investments in financially troubled US airlines.
To complicate matters, BA's investment in USAir has also become embroiled in
a long running transatlantic aviation dispute which threatens to reach a
climax in the next few days. American Airlines and Delta have pressed the US
government to revoke the existing bilateral aviation agreement between the
US and the UK and withdraw BA's ticket code-sharing rights with USAir on
March 17, unless Britain grants US carriers more open access to London's
Heathrow Airport.
Should the US carry out its threat to withdraw BA's code-sharing rights, the
UK government is likely to retaliate by cutting the number of US airline
services to Heathrow. 'Not to renew our code-sharing would constitute a
violation of the UK-US treaty agreement,' Sir Colin said. Code-sharing was
one of the main reasons for the investment in USAir.
Although some analysts have suggested that an all-out UK-US aviation war
could provide BA with an elegant opportunity to disentangle itself from
USAir, Sir Colin said a withdrawal was 'not on the cards'. Nor, he added,
had BA underestimated the challenges at USAir. 'What has happened is the
emergence during the last three to four months of widespread, very low price
competition in the US - particularly in the east, mid-Atlantic and
north-east, which have traditionally been USAir's strongholds.'
USAir has been hit harder than its bigger US rivals by increasing
competition from low-cost airlines - such as Southwest and CALite,
Continental's low-cost subsidiary - because of its reliance on the domestic
market.
But Sir Colin said he remained confident that USAir would resolve its
restructuring challenge to face the new competitive forces. Both he and Mr
Robert Ayling, BA's managing director, also said they were satisfied with
the progress the UK airline was making with its other international equity
partnerships with Qantas of Australia, TAT of France and Deutsche BA.
'TAT is becoming a bit of a success story,' said Mr Ayling. The French
carrier was successfully restructuring itself, reducing costs by about 30
per cent. Deutsche BA was also showing encouraging passenger load factors of
more than 60 per cent on its busiest routes. Both European airline
partnerships were part of BA's strategy to invest in the new European single
aviation market which, according to Mr Ayling, 'will be our domestic market
of the future'.
Sir Colin confirmed BA was still searching for a partner in the North
Pacific region to complete its global jigsaw. But 'at present we are
concentrating on the partnerships we have done in the last 18 months'.
The immediate priority was for USAir to get its house finally in order. The
message yesterday from BA, the world's most profitable airline, was loud and
clear. Although Sir Colin said relations between the two airlines remained
'very good', USAir's rich British uncle has placed on ice any plans to
invest a further Dollars 450m in the troubled carrier.

FT  08 MAR 94 / USAir warns of deepening losses in low-cost battle: The
biggest test of British Airways' international strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USAir, the beleaguered US carrier in which British Airways holds a 24.6 per
cent stake, yesterday shocked the airline industry by announcing that
competition from low-cost carriers would drive it even more heavily into
losses this year.
Analysts had been looking for a recovery after five years of losses. But
USAir said pre-tax losses in the first quarter alone were likely to rise
from Dollars 61m to Dollars 200m (Pounds 137m), while for the year as a
whole the deficit was expected to be even worse than last year's Dollars
349m.
USAir confirmed that BA would not invest any more money in the airline until
it was clear that an effective cost-reduction programme was in place and the
company's financial performance improved.
Late last night the company said it had asked its four labour unions to
begin 'substantive talks' on cost cutting and productivity improvements as
part of a plan to return USAir to profit. The plan is expected to involve
drastic cuts in jobs, wages and conditions of employment.
USAir shares tumbled Dollars 1 1/8 to close at Dollars 9.
Mr Seth Schofield, the airline's chairman, president and chief executive,
said one reason for the first-quarter loss was that unusually severe winter
weather in the north-east - USAir's main market - had forced it to cancel
about 8 per cent of its flights in January and February.
But the main reason for the company's grim financial outlook, Mr Schofield
said, was USAir's need to cut fares in response to the steady expansion of
low-cost carriers in many of its east coast markets.
Last month USAir said it was cutting business fares indefinitely by up to 50
per cent on routes between 96 cities in the eastern US. The move was in
response to competition from Southwest Airlines and Continental Airlines,
two low-cost carriers which have begun to make significant inroads into its
markets.
Other large US carriers have responded to low-cost competition by cutting
jobs and increasing productivity, so enabling them to match competitors'
fares without worsening their financial performance. But USAir has so far
made little progress in reducing costs, so lower fares will translate into
bigger losses.
BA has invested nearly Dollars 400m in USAir and was due to invest another
Dollars 450m between now and 1998. But yesterday it said it would not commit
any more funds 'until the outcome of the restructuring is known.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / BBA falls into red and plans payout cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBA, the engineering group, yesterday warned it was planning to cut its
dividend and shed 2,000 jobs as part of a rationalisation programme.
The moves have been forced on the company by a slide in profits in its motor
components business and shrinking margins in its aviation arm.
After charges related to rationalising the businesses, BBA incurred a Pounds
12.8m pre-tax loss, compared with a Pounds 47.4m profit in 1992.
Mr Roberto Quarta, chief executive, said the losses reflected Pounds 76.8m
(Pounds 9.7m) in rationalisation costs for ongoing businesses, of which
Pounds 59.7m has been set aside for redundancies and plant closures this
year and next.
The results were also hit by Pounds 17.8m of exceptional losses on selling
or closing non-core businesses, while the group also wrote off a Pounds 3.8m
investment in United Industries, the precision tools and springs
manufacturer. These charges were offset by a profit of Pounds 18.4m on the
sale of Pacific BBA, its partly owned Australian subsidiary.
Faced with heavy provisions and depleted earnings, Mr Quarta warned that the
1993 dividend - unchanged at 7.5p - would be cut by up to 3p next year.
'Earnings are not growing fast enough to maintain current dividends - that
is unacceptable,' he said.
The announcement prompted a 9p fall in BBA's shares, which closed at 207p.
Mr Quarta said up to 2,000 jobs would have to go as the company cut costs.
Most of those job losses, on top of 1,000 redundancies last year, would be
in the automotive division, where operating profits fell 42.8 per cent to
Pounds 21.5m. 'We must go further and cut deeper to reduce our cost base to
a point where we can deliver sustainable market improvements.'
The company is understood to have identified nine companies which it would
like to sell, reducing the total number of subsidiaries to about 40.
Overall operating profits inched ahead to Pounds 89m, from Pounds 87.3m,
while turnover increased 7.2 per cent to Pounds 1.42bn.
Despite increased sales, Mr Quarta said: 'The recovery, where it is
apparent, remains extremely fragile and we anticipate no meaningful
improvement in Europe for some time.'
Fully diluted losses per share were 6.6p before exceptional items and 5.1p
afterwards, compared with 4.9p and 8.1p respectively.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Giordano back in BOC chair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC Group surprised the market by appointing Mr Richard Giordano as
non-executive chairman - only two years after the American stepped down as
chairman and chief executive of the UK-based industrial gases and healthcare
company.
Best known during the early 1980s as Britain's most highly-paid executive,
Mr Giordano, 59, started work in January as the Pounds 450,000-a-year
non-executive chairman of British Gas. His other non-executive directorships
include Grand Metropolitan, RTZ, Lucas and Reuters, although he intends to
reduce this number. BOC said his principal activities and office would
remain at British Gas.
BOC has appointed Mr Giordano, who had continued on its board as a
non-executive, because of next month's early retirement of Mr Patrick Rich,
62, due to health problems. Mr Rich, who had intended to stay on for two
more years, recently gave up the post of chief executive to Mr Alexander
'Pat' Dyer, a 61-year-old American with 30 years' experience of the
international gases industry.
Analysts said Mr Giordano 'knew BOC inside out', but the appointment looked
stop-gap and did not answer longer-term questions about the succession.
While at the helm of BOC, Mr Giordano improved productivity and expanded
into the Asia-Pacific region, but also made two acquisitions which proved
expensive mistakes.
BOC last month reported first-quarter losses as a result of an Pounds 85m
restructuring provision. The group said pressures on industrial gas profit
margins would remain intense until recovery gathered strength. Healthcare
profits also suffered.
BOC said Mr Giordano's salary 'would entirely reflect the non-executive and
part-time nature of the appointment'.

FT  08 MAR 94 / SIB chief urges enhanced role for City regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes to the law should be made to enable City regulators to play a much
greater role in dealing with misconduct in the financial services, Mr Andrew
Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, said yesterday.
Mr Large, who heads the chief financial watchdog, called for new approaches
to co-operation between regulators and the criminal authorities to ensure
more effective investor protection.
In a speech to the Chancery Bar Association, he urged a change to the law to
enable the SIB and the department of trade and industry to investigate
allegations of insider dealing and market manipulation.
He also called for the SIB and the stock exchange to be given statutory
powers to fine members.
One of his most radical suggestions was that defendants who have pleaded
guilty to crimes coming within the remit of the financial regulators should
be allowed to undertake plea bargaining in open court.
Resisting the argument that plea bargaining would compromise the
independence of the judiciary, Mr Large said it should be possible to devise
a fair and open system for such negotiations.
The overall message of his speech was that once regulators proved they could
enforce the rules they would be in a better position to handle more matters
relating to misconduct and to dispel fears that they might be 'soft on white
collar crime'.
Mr Large cited the agreement which the SIB has reached in principle with the
Serious Fraud Office, about which cases should be dealt with by the
regulators and which by the criminal courts.
In general, the regulator would deal with more technical offences, where the
victim was less obvious, and the element of fraud or theft harder to explain
to a jury. There was a place, he said, for much greater reliance on
regulators to deal with potentially criminal cases involving those they
regulated.
Mr Large's comments came in the wake of a new emphasis on enforcement by
regulators. Last week the SIB exercised for the first time its powers to ban
an individual indefinitely from investment business in the UK, and Lautro,
the self-regulatory organisation for the life insurance industry, said it
would impose heavier penalties.
His speech underlined his belief that effective investor protection rather
than rules lay at the heart of financial regulation.

FT  08 MAR 94 / UK set to take initiative over strengthening force in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government said yesterday it intended to take the initiative in
international efforts to provide more troops for the United Nations
peacekeeping forces in Bosnia.
In spite of the misgivings of several members of his cabinet, Mr John Major,
the prime minister, all but committed Britain to providing extra troops.
Mr Major said that Sir David Hannay, Britain's ambassador at the UN, had
last night begun a series of meetings in New York with other potential
contributors to co-ordinate the effort.
Ambassadors of the countries with troops in Bosnia and Croatia, including
the UK, France, Canada and Spain, will be at the meetings, along with the
US, which has a few troops in Macedonia.
General Sir Michael Rose, UN commander of the forces in Bosnia, called last
week for an additional 10,000 troops to consolidate the UN's recent
successes in establishing truces between Bosnian Serb, Moslem and Croat
forces in Sarajevo and other Bosnian areas.
In what amounted to a sharp reversal of policy, Mr Major said: 'What we are
seeking to do is to try to reinforce the UN's own efforts by promoting a
coherent and urgent and positive response to their appeal for more troops.'
He indicated that he expected France and the US to be represented at the New
York talks, adding: 'I think there are a wide range of countries that may be
able to help. We have been in contact with a lot of them.'
Senior Whitehall officials said the change of heart had been in response to
the rapidly changing situation on the ground in Bosnia. The ceasefire in
Sarajevo needed consolidation and the UN wanted to build on its more recent
successes in Srebrenica and Tuzla.
The officials said that Britain would be able to provide an additional
battalion - between 900 and 1,200 soldiers - if its international allies
agreed a concerted move to bolster the UN forces.
Mr Major accepts that the US administration is unlikely to drop its fierce
opposition to the early commitment of US ground troops. But Sir David will
be pressing France and Britain's other European partners to increase their
effort significantly. The UK's efforts to increase the number of troops in
Bosnia coincides with a push by the US to try to involve Serbia in talks
between Bosnian Croats, Moslems and Croatian government officials in Vienna.
Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy to former Yugoslavia, will travel to
Zagreb, Sarajevo and Belgrade, the Serbian capital, where he is expected to
meet the president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic.
'Everybody know that there can be no overall agreement without the Serbs,' a
western diplomat close to the Vienna negotiations said yesterday.

Yesterday's 4 per cent rise in Reuters' shares to a new all-time high
illustrates how the media company remains hot news. Since reporting its
annual results last month, Reuters has risen 10 per cent while the FT-SE-A
All-Share index has slid by 5 per cent. Some of the buying stems from
technical factors. With about half the shares being held overseas, UK fund
managers have been scrambling to re-weight their portfolios. That demand has
squeezed the price higher in thin volumes. The risk is that the surge may
tempt US investors to take profits, turning the UK's current drought of
Reuters' shares into a deluge.

FT  08 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: British Vita
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years on from its last rights issue British Vita still has a large
portion of the proceeds in its back pocket. Even through the depths of
recession, cash flow has been strong enough to finance capital spending well
ahead of depreciation and a string of small deals. Given the dwindling
returns on cash - and the fact that the shares have underperformed the
equity market by 20 per cent since the rights issue - shareholders might
feel disappointed on both counts.
With 60 per cent of turnover in continental Europe, the outlook for sales
growth should be brighter from here on. The snag is that Vita finds itself
sandwiched between chemicals suppliers looking to increase prices and
customers in the automotive industry and elsewhere trying cut costs. Margins
may suffer further if the giants of the chemicals industry make annual price
rises stick in April. With its shares on a price earnings multiple well
above the market average, a well-judged acquisition would not go amiss.

FT  08 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's disappointing consumer credit figures are meat for the bears of
the UK economy. Taken with lower mortgage lending by banks and building
societies in January, the statistics point to consumer confidence falling
away in the early weeks of the year. Belated appreciation of the extent of
April's tax rises may be to blame, or simply renewed caution following
unusually high borrowing in December.
Either way, the figures are at odds with the strong retail sales recorded in
January. It may be that seasonal adjustment over the Christmas and New Year
periods made the sales data less reliable than usual. The December sales
figure was, after all, perplexingly weak.
Other evidence - such as yesterday's report from the Finance and Leasing
Association - suggests that demand for big-ticket items such as cars is
holding up well enough. February's retail sales figures, expected next week,
may help clear up the confusion.
On that basis the lowest level of consumer lending since August should not
cause too much alarm just yet. The three-month rolling average remains
healthy enough, in what can be a highly erratic series. Still, any further
fall in the savings ratio - which will be necessary to sustain consumer
spending when tax increases start to bite in earnest - should show up
clearly in future consumer credit figures. If low borrowing in February
establishes a downward trend, there will be reason to worry.

<TEXT>
Over a 10-year spell, shareholders have little reason to think kindly of
their investment in BBA. Equity shareholders' funds are barely equal to the
amount that they have subscribed in rights issues. Total returns  -
including dividends - are somewhat shy of what might have been earned in the
building society. A year ago the company raised Pounds 128m on the basis of
a maintained dividend, yet investors now find that the promise is valid for
a single payment. After a decade of frenetic dealing and fund raising, only
merchant banks and lawyers have reason to rub their hands at the mention of
BBA's name.
With a new chief executive, Mr Bob Quarta, investors must decide whether the
future will be different from the past. The company gamely argues that its
new-found zeal for cost cutting will produce margins in excess of 10 per
cent. And while the reduced dividend leaves a sour taste in the mouth, it is
probably the right pragmatic decision. It is certainly a marked contrast to
Lucas, which continues to fund its excessive payout in increasingly
convoluted ways.
Rationalisation and slow recovery in the continental European car market
will improve returns. Some of the industrial operations are already up to
the mark. Aviation, however, faces a longer struggle to justify its place in
the portfolio. Investors will have to decide whether they trust Mr Quarta to
knit a coherent whole from disparate parts. He has a good reputation, but it
is not an enviable position from which to start.

FT  08 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: BA's special relationship
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone believing that British Airways would act as USAir's sugar daddy now
knows that it will be sparing with the financial lollipops. But given that
BA did not plan to invest any more money until 1996, that reassurance is
somewhat superfluous at this stage. It rather suggests BA is playing to
three broader galleries. BA's reticence will help USAir talk tough to the
trades unions in its efforts to cut costs. It will also help calm
shareholders' fears that it will throw good money after bad. BA comments may
also be an attempt to take some sting out of the current controversy
surrounding future UK-US aviation arrangements.
USAir is certainly in a sorry state having lost Dollars 1.1bn over the past
three years. The winter weather has caused severe disruption. But more
worrying is the impact that low-cost rivals are having on USAir's main
routes. It will take time and drastic action to address that threat.
BA is relatively protected from USAir's losses given it receives a fixed 7
per cent coupon on its Dollars 400m of preference shares. That, though, will
provide little comfort if USAir is forced to seek protection from its
creditors. But BA's exposure to USAir is not just financial. The alliance
forms a central strut in its global strategy and its collapse would badly
tarnish its expansion plans. That makes it all the more unnerving that BA
appears to have little control over its destiny in the US.

FT  08 MAR 94 / White House begins fightback against Whitewater allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The White House yesterday began a fully fledged assault on the Republican
party, charging that it was exploiting the Whitewater affair to cover up its
own political shortcomings.
Mr George Stephanopoulos, the senior presidential adviser, said on breakfast
television of the Republicans: 'They can't run on the economy, they can't
run on healthcare, they can't run on welfare, they can't run on crime, so
they're trying to exploit this issue.'
However, picking up arguments used by vice-president Al Gore on Sunday, Mr
Stephanopoulos conceded that the White House damage control team 'created a
lot more damage than it controlled'. The leading member of that team, Mr
Bernard Nussbaum, the White House legal counsel, announced his resignation
at the weekend.
But Mr Stephanopoulos added that the president had ordered full co-operation
with the independent Whitewater counsel, Mr Robert Fiske, and had created
'fire walls' to prevent even the appearance of improper consultation between
the White House and departments of government.
'We're going to get back to work on the big issues, and let the special
counsel do its work,' he said. This message was also conveyed on television
by Mr 'Mack' McLarty, the White House chief of staff, and Mr Paul Begala,
another presidential adviser.
Yesterday, one prominent Republican, Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa, also
warned his colleagues about loose talk of forcing President Bill Clinton
from office, implicit in a weekend interview by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas.
Mr Leach said: 'I think it would be very inappropriate to put forth the
notion that the presidency is in jeopardy.'
Mr McLarty said he did not think either the president or Mrs Hillary Rodham
Clinton were aware of the controversial meetings between officials from the
White House and the Treasury at which the investigations into the failed
Madison savings and loan institution, at the heart of the Whitewater affair,
were reportedly discussed.
Mr Stephanopoulos insisted these briefings were perfectly routine. Mr Roger
Altman, the deputy Treasury secretary, had previously held similar sessions
with congressional staff and the media, he said. These sessions was first
disclosed by Senator Al D'Amato, the New York Republican, members of whose
staff attended Mr Altman's meetings, Mr Stephanopoulos said.
Mr Joel Klein, Mr Nussbaum's deputy, has ordered White House officials to
destroy nothing related to Whitewater until it is determined what is
relevant to Mr Fiske's inquiries.
But Mr Stephanopoulos conceded that a 'heavyweight', preferably with
extensive governmental experience, was being sought to succeed Mr Nussbaum.
A frequently mentioned name is that of Mr Charles FC Ruff, a former federal
attorney.

FT  08 MAR 94 / The mogul is the message: Potential conflicts of interest
for a political mould-breaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely has someone entered democratic politics and achieved such rapid
success as Italian media magnate Silvio Berlusconi.
The sheer energy and audacity of his plan to become Italy's next prime
minister at the head of his four-month-old Forza Italia movement has
wrong-footed his opponents. From mid-January onwards, when he announced he
intended to fight the March 27 general election, the other parties have
watched dumbfounded the seemingly unstoppable ascendancy of Mr Berlusconi.
His own polls give Forza Italia 37 per cent of the vote; other polls show
large numbers of undecided voters but still give him the lead over his
nearest rivals, the left-led Progressive Alliance, with 25 per cent support
or more.
But as the election campaign gathers pace, chinks are appearing in the
armour of the 57-year-old owner of the Fininvest media empire. The strict
laws governing the use of electoral propaganda deprive him of his principal
instrument - exposure on his commercial television channels.
Politically, his alliance with the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto
Bossi, essential to launch Forza Italia in the north, is under strain. In
the centre and south the National Alliance, the rebaptised neo-fascist MSI
movement of Mr Gianfranco Fini, is ever more closely linked to Forza Italia
and pulling Mr Berlusconi away from his preferred centre-ground to the
right.
Mr Berlusconi is running a presidential-style campaign, encouraging the
electorate to vote for him as the personification of a new force in Italian
politics. But the number of Forza Italia candidates likely to win seats is
unclear, and his supporters could choose either of his two main allies, both
established parties.
Whatever the outcome, Mr Berlusconi's entry into politics has transformed
the election into a genuine contest between the social democrat model of
government proposed by the Progressive Alliance and a conservative rightwing
preaching the virtues of business.
The advent of the businessman-politician also raises serious questions. Mr
Berlusconi is no ordinary businessman. He has created Europe's
second-largest media empire after Bertelsmann of Germany in 25 years.
Fininvest is Italy's third-biggest private group with a provisional 1993
turnover of L11,600bn (Pounds 4.7bn). Mr Berlusconi owns three national
television channels. These, plus advertising and programme links with
regional stations, give Fininvest control over 85 per cent of Italian
commercial networks and a 45 per cent share of the national audience. His
companies also account for 20 per cent of the domestic publishing market.
In every venture so far he has come out on top - not least in his
high-profile 1986 purchase of AC Milan football club, which he has turned
into the most successful Italian team of all time.
Can a man who wields such influence in politically sensitive sectors
insulate himself from a conflict of interest once in high political office?
The question is all the more relevant in a country where the dividing line
between business and politics has long been blurred for mutual benefit. The
incestuous relationship between the two fostered the all-embracing
corruption that has so discredited Italy's postwar political system.
Moreover, Mr Berlusconi is himself a product of this system. He made his
first fortune in the rough and ready world of the Milan construction
business, and was subsequently a member of the powerful secret masonic lodge
P2 that symbolised the shadowy parallel system of power in the Italy of the
1970s.
Mr Berlusconi is one of the few top businessmen not to have been directly
touched by the corruption scandals. Nevertheless, his brother Paolo, who now
runs the family property business, has admitted to paying bribes to local
Milan politicians to secure development projects. Four of Mr Berlusconi's
senior aides have been caught up in magistrates' investigations into illicit
party financing: the Fininvest group, for example, is alleged to have given
the main political parties substantial undeclared discounts in the 1992
general elections.
'Having been freed from the corrupting situation where politics controlled
business, we now risk falling into the opposite trap of politics being under
the thumb of business,' commented Professor Luigi Spaventa, the budget
minister and the candidate of the left's Progressive Alliance who is
fighting Mr Berlusconi in a Rome constituency.
Since his campaign started, the nearest Mr Berlusconi has come to conceding
a potential conflict of interest was his move in January to distance himself
from management of the Fininvest group. He resigned from all his managerial
positions, appointing a chairman, Mr Fidele Confalonieri, his faithful aide
and friend since student days. This followed a management shake-up last
October, when he created the post of chief executive for Mr Franco Tato, a
professional manager who had been running the Mondadori publishing
subsidiary.
However, Mr Berlusconi retains ownership of Fininvest. According to
Fininvest officials, he and his family own 51 per cent of the group via 22
'box' holdings (Holding Italiana numbers 1-22) and the remainder indirectly
through two trust companies, Servizio Italia and Saf, set up by the big
state commercial bank, BNL. This structure reflects the traditional Italian
concern to limit tax liabilities and to conceal the precise individual
stakes held by family members.
Mr Berlusconi has used the Fininvest infrastructure as the core from which
to organise Forza Italia. The national network of the movement's 'clubs'
(modelled on AC Milan supporters clubs) is liberally sprinkled with
Fininvest employees. Some 40 executives from the group are devoting
themselves to the campaign. At the same time an undisclosed amount of
Fininvest money has been ploughed into propaganda and organisational
activities over the past four months.
The state's Media Watchdog Committee, the ombudsman, has few teeth to
control this sort of corporate involvement in a political campaign, or
indeed corporate ownership by a politician running for office. 'There is no
precedent for this kind of situation,' said a committee spokesman. 'The
existing law does not envisage any trustee arrangement for the proprietary
and beneficial interests of a media owner if and when they take public
office. It is sufficient that he relinquishes an executive role.'
Mr Berlusconi has a lot riding on his campaign. It is far from clear that he
would continue as a professional politician if he lost. This perception has
prompted sceptics to conclude that Mr Berlusconi is running for office in
part to protect his business interests. Mr Luciano Benetton, head of the
Benetton leisure wear group, said as much last week: 'Silvio Berlusconi's
love of politics is motivated by a fear of losing his television interests.'
Mr Tato, Fininvest chief executive, says quite openly: 'If Berlusconi loses,
and the left wins, we risk losing one television channel immediately and a
second within two years.' This could mean the loss of as much as a quarter
of Fininvest's total revenue base.
Mr Berlusconi's grip on the media has become a principal focus for his
opponents' fire, which he has cleverly countered by claiming that the
state-run RAI broadcasting channels are biased against him.
He cannot disguise the fact, however, that no other European government has
allowed one individual to accumulate such television power. The Italian
press irreverently refer to Mr Berlusconi as 'Su' Emittenza' (a pun on the
address for a cardinal which literally means 'his transmitter-ship').
His exceptional dominance of commercial television reflects the highly
politicised world of the Italian media. As a result of complex horse-trading
among the political parties the haphazardly devolved structure of national
television networks was formalised in the 1990 'Mami law'. The law confirmed
the presence of three state-run RAI channels and six national commercial
channels, of which three were for Fininvest, confirming its dominant market
position. The only other network of note was Telemontecarlo, in the hands of
the Ferruzzi group.
Mr Berlusconi got away with his near monopoly because the Christian
Democrats and Socialists controlling parliament were obsessed with retaining
their manipulative hold of the RAI and its news programmes. At the same time
both parties, and especially the Socialists through their leader, Mr Bettino
Craxi, were repaying Mr Berlusconi for his political support. Mr Craxi's
Socialist connections also helped pave the way for Mr Berlusconi to take a
stake in Spain's Telecinco and in France's first commercial television
station.
Efforts to reform the law have consistently been blocked because the main
parties refused to surrender control of RAI. 'Everyone recognises the Mami
law reflected the position of the political parties at a particular time and
this situation of course no longer applies,' said a spokesman for the Media
WatchDog Committee.
Mr Berlusconi has already experienced pressure over his media ownership.
Under a 1992 law limiting cross-holdings of newspapers and television
interests media, he was obliged to offload a majority stake in his
newspaper, Il Giornale, to his younger brother Paolo. This did not stop him
this January ejecting the editor in a very public row, in a clear defiance
of the spirit of the 1992 law.
Now, with the RAI in desperate financial straits and the links with the old
political parties severed, a rearrangement of television licences has become
an important item on the agenda of the next government. The Progressive
Alliance, dominated by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left
(PDS), has said it will limit ownership of television channels to one per
group. Even Mr Bossi, Mr Berlusconi's electoral ally, has suggested a
curtailment of his television power.
Thus, even if Mr Berlusconi comes on the winning side, the question of
Fininvest's television power cannot be ignored. If he loses, more than just
his political ambitions will be under threat.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Brazil's inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time in years, there is a real chance for Brazil to put an end
to its chronically high inflation. Much must still be done to ensure that
this occurs, but important groundwork has been laid for a deep and
sustainable reduction in an annual inflation rate now accelerating past
2,500 per cent.
After six unsuccessful anti-inflation plans in eight years, why should
anyone take the latest seriously? The reason is twofold: the plan makes
economic sense and politicians, through a chance combination of
circumstances, may be disposed to back it.
First, the politics. Brazil's president and its Congress - both potential
obstacles to economic stabilisation - are currently weak. President Itamar
Franco is content to let his finance minister, Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
handle the economy. Legislators have been shaken by corruption scandals and
their puppet-masters - the state governors - are scared of the popularity of
the left-wing presidential candidate, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva ahead of
October's elections.
The plan is a credible attempt to tackle the underlying cause of inflation -
the budget deficit. It also attacks the inflationary psychology and
indexation mechanisms which make last month's inflation rate the effective
base for next month's inflation.
Erasing Brazil's chronic budget deficit is the harder part. The country's
1988 constitution earmarked such a high percentage of federal government
revenues that it virtually guaranteed deficits.
According to Mailson da Nobrega, an economist and former finance minister,
about 98 per cent of Brazil's tax revenues are earmarked for specific
expenditures - most of it goes straight to the states - or for wages for
government employees whose jobs are legally protected. This leaves the rest
for current and capital expenditures, and paying debt interest.
A constitutional change passed last week will reduce for a two-year period
the proportion of funds earmarked and provides, in the best case, a
temporary basis for erasing the budget deficit. The big risk is that in an
election year, the government will give in to pressures to spend money.
Even if all this works, it is unrealistic to think that Brazil's inflation
will be brought down to international levels in one shot. The best that can
be hoped for is that the plan buys time to allow the government that takes
over next year to complete the task.
To do this, it will need the tools. Congress can provide those during the
current constitutional revision process. This might include, for example,
devolving more functions to the states, which should allow the centre to be
placed on a sounder financial footing. It can also reform the political
system - with the aim of reducing the fragmentation of Congress and
eliminating gridlock. This is a rare opportunity for a discredited Congress
to raise its stock with the Brazilian public. It should grab it with both
hands.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Whitewater blues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's headlines suggesting that the Clinton White House is now
seriously embroiled in the Whitewater affair will have caused groans in many
foreign ministries. Not that Mr Bill Clinton's administration is universally
admired abroad. On the contrary, it has been the subject of much
hand-wringing and eye-rolling over the past year. But the main charges
against it were inexperience, and lack of sustained attention to foreign
policy issues. The former defect is now beginning to be healed, in the
nature of things, by the passage of time. The latter may not be wholly
curable, but there have lately been signs of improvement. Nothing could be
more certain to cause a relapse than for the president to get bogged down in
a prolonged scandal.
The heartiest wish of all those foreigners who depend on or have to deal
with the US must be that the affair could be got quickly out of the way.
Alas, that is one thing that will certainly not happen. The special counsel
appointed in January, Mr Robert Fiske, has an open-ended brief to look into
a broad range of matters concerning the business dealings of Mr Clinton and
his wife Hillary when Mr Clinton was governor of Arkansas. His
investigations are expected to take about 18 months, which would be a
miracle of speed compared to the inquiry into the last big political
scandal, the Iran-Contra affair. That was recently completed after seven
years.
A better hope is that while Mr Fiske is burrowing his way through a mountain
of obscure evidence, public attention will move elsewhere and the
administration will be able to concentrate on its political agenda. That was
certainly what Mr Clinton and his advisers hoped would happen when Mr Fiske
was appointed. So far the opposite has occurred, thanks to the clumsiness of
some of those advisers, including the president's own legal counsel, Mr
Bernard Nussbaum, who resigned on Saturday. He and nine other officials -
five from the White House, four from the Treasury - have been subpoenaed by
Mr Fiske to explain a series of meetings at which they discussed the scope
of a federal regulatory inquiry into Madison Guaranty, the failed savings
and loan institution at the heart of the Whitewater affair.
Those meetings may have been entirely innocent, but their purpose is not
clear. Inevitably suspicions have been aroused of a cover-up, or conspiracy
to obstruct the course of justice. No one in Washington has forgotten that
it was such a cover-up, rather than the original misdemeanour, that led to
the downfall of President Nixon 20 years ago.
There is as yet no reason to suppose that this affair will have any such
dramatic denouement. But its latest twist only reinforces the Watergate
lesson. A president accused of wrongdoing, however trivial or implausible,
must not only allow the matter to be independently investigated, but must
bend over backwards to avoid any appearance of seeking to influence the
outcome.

<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi's entry into politics coincides with a delicate phase
in the Fininvest empire. The group is burdened by debts and has lost its
identity as a result of rapid expansion in the 1980s boom, writes Robert
Graham.
In 1992, the last year for published accounts, Fininvest profits were down
to L21bn (Pounds 8.5m). The accounts would have been in the red but for
exceptional gains of L334bn, reflecting a mark-up on the transfer to his
brother Paolo of his newspaper and Cantieri Riuniti Milanesi building
interest.
Arthur Andersen, the auditor, qualified the accounts last May, making
observations about tax provisions of L172bn, and L437bn of funding extended
to buy television rights for use in the Spanish market. The 1993 results are
likely to be depressed by stagnant advertising revenues, the effects of
recession, the cost of debt service and greater tax provisions.
'Fininvest is a typical product of the 1980s boom,' observes Mr Franco Tato
of Fininvest's Mondadori publishing arm. 'It didn't want to become a
conglomerate, but became so with a policy of expansion at all costs. The
original thread linking all the activities was advertising. But it has been
lost and all this expansion now has to be digested.'
The group has spread itself into four areas: stores (Standa and
Euromercato); publishing (Mondadori and Silvio Berlusconi Editore);
television and cinema, known under the heading Big tv; and financial
products. Almost without exception Fininvest has a good asset portfolio.
However, many assets were bought at very high prices with expensive debt in
an expanding economy. Real interest rates remain high and Italy has been in
a recession for 18 months.
Mr Tato considers all of these to be mature business areas with clear limits
on growth imposed by anti-trust laws on expansion in publishing and the
threat to TV licences.
The group is carrying L3,800bn of debt, high by Italian standards,
reflecting the purchase of Standa and Mondadori in the 1988-91 period.
Fininvest's debt has leapt 12-fold since 1988 from L293bn. Concern over the
size of Fininvest debt among the group's creditor banks was one reason for
Mr Tato's appointment last October.
Some L600bn should be raised by the flotation of Mondadori-SBE later this
year. But even if it proceeds as planned, it may not be enough to tide
Fininvest over the recession. Although Standa provides almost half
Fininvest's cash-flow, it carries much of the debt and is the most marginal
to the media/multimedia interests.
Apart from considering asset sales, Mr Tato is restructuring the debt out of
the Fininvest holding and into the operating companies. He also believes the
ownership structure will have to be reworked. This has been tax efficient,
but is increasingly clumsy to manage. Also, in the light of the Ferruzzi
group's collapse last year, the demand by the financial community for
greater transparency in family holdings has increased.

One of the more innocent cross-border activities between Ulster and Eire,
the monthly exodus by northerners in search of the nearest southern
newsagent to buy lottery tickets, is looking sickly.
The republic's national lottery organisers handed out 139m punts in prize
money last year and northern punters alone bought 27m punts of lottery
tickets, about 10 per cent of the total. The Eire lottery boys are worried
about a big drop in takings, once the UK lottery starts up next year.
But a half-empty bottle is also half full: Lotto fans north of the border
are looking forward to two chances of striking lucky.

So BOC has finally found a new chairman, or rather an old one. The news that
Richard Giordano, who headed the group for more than a decade, is
re-occupying the BOC chairman's suite may be good for BOC's shareholders,
but some British Gas shareholders might feel a bit miffed.
When British Gas recruited its new Pounds 450,000 a year chairman, Giordano
undertook to reduce his other non-executive commitments. Now Giordano is
adding the non-executive chairmanship of another company which is going
through a bit of a rough patch, but promises that 'his principal activities
and office' will remain at British Gas. Presumably, this means that he won't
be paid the Pounds 305,000 a year he commanded the last time he was BOC's
chairman.
If Giordano was the natural successor to Pat Rich, who announced his
surprise early retirement over six weeks ago, why didn't BOC nominate him at
the time?

in London and the south east.
Having failed to win support for a strike, the union is rolling out its
secret weapon, an 'Admobile'. It's a lorry with a sign on the back telling
Barclays, in no uncertain terms, that it must stop its sacking plans at
once.
It will circle Parliament Square several times next Thursday before making a
ceremonial drive past Barclays new head offices. Managers had better duck

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whereas John Major's predecessor used BBC Radio's Jimmy Young show to boost
her loyal following among Britain's housewives, the main impact of Mr
Major's appearance yesterday was to confuse the financial markets. An alert
Reuters hack picked up the PM's comments that Britain's GDP growth was
currently 2 per cent, with 2.5 per cent forecast for 'next year'. In fact,
the government is predicting 2.5 per cent growth for this year and the
Treasury confirmed that there was no change in its forecast.
So did the Prime Minister get the figures wrong, or is he simply confused
about which year it is?

<TEXT>
Speculation about Michael Heseltine's intentions are threatening to get out
of hand; his every move is now being interpreted as a bid for John Major's
job.
What will his rivals make of his latest bid for the headlines - an exclusive
and exhaustive interview in the French financial newspaper La Tribune? The
gushing article, spread across the centre pages, concludes that Heseltine's
political renaissance has been nothing short of miraculous.
With the odds on Hezza taking over from Major shortening to three to one,
Hezza has told friends that he does, indeed, have his heart set on higher
office. But it is Francois Mitterrand's job he is after.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Observer: Polymorphous polytechnic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Everything in yesterday's edition of the FT's sister publication - Les
Echos, the French financial daily - seemed normal, but for the prominence of
the bylines.
What was Jean Peyrelevade, the head of Credit Lyonnais, doing writing about
the French economy? Or Jean-Louis Beffa, the head of the St-Gobain glass
company, writing about German wage rows? Or Serge Dassault, the jet-maker,
writing about devaluation of the French African franc?
The answer is that they are all graduates of the Ecole Polytechnique. To
help celebrate that elite institution's 200th anniversary, Les Echos invited
60 of them to put their master-of-all-trades training into practice by
producing the entire issue.
Ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing was not required actually to turn up
at the office to pen his editorial on 'full employment'. But 54 other
polytechniciens were called in to work at Les Echos' Paris headquarters. 'We
selected the subjects for them, but they chose the angle of the articles,'
said a real Les Echos journalist.
Five of those absent abroad on business were converted into special
correspondents, with Jean Gandois, the boss of Pechiney, filing a story from
Chicago on the new US threat of 'Super 301' trade retaliation.
And what about taking the role reversal the other direction, letting the
hacks run some companies for a day? The businessmen's response was not
overwhelming . . .

FT  08 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Air logjam
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ambitious plans for creating an open skies regime on air traffic between the
US and the UK have run into difficulties. The two governments and their
airlines are now bickering about who is to blame and there is a real risk of
a trade war over the issue.
How far yesterday's decision by British Airways to suspend further
investment in its associate USAir is connected with this dispute is not
clear. Commercial considerations on their own are probably explanation
enough: until USAir has a viable restructuring programme in place, further
investment will be money down the drain.
Nevertheless, the inter-governmental wrangle can hardly have helped. An
essential part of BA's strategy is to link its trans-Atlantic flights with
USAir's domestic US services through 'code-sharing'. But the US has
threatened to cancel this code-sharing arrangement, which comes up for
renewal on March 17th, unless its airlines secure greater access to British
airports, especially Heathrow. Britain, in turn, has threatened to retaliate
by cutting the number of US flights to Heathrow.
What on earth are two governments which profess to want a completely liberal
air traffic regime between their countries up to? Unless they smarten up
their act pretty sharply, they will damage the interests of trans-Atlantic
passengers and lose their authority to lecture third countries about opening
up their markets.
The snag is that both governments' negotiating agendas have been hijacked by
their national airlines. This is damaging because the airlines, quite
rationally, are lobbying for their own narrow interests not their country's
broader national interests.
Each country's airlines would clearly prefer the other country's market to
be opened while keeping their own closed. BA wants to be free to expand in
the US but is determined to slow the growth of competition at its valuable
hub at Heathrow. Similarly, US airlines such as Delta and American Airlines
want greater access to Heathrow and other UK airports but are anxious to
stall BA's growth in the US.
If one airline cannot secure such unilateral opening of another country's
market, they may well calculate it is better to keep both markets closed
than press for an open skies regime. Partially closed skies provide them
with some monopoly protection.
Such an outcome, though, would not be in the broader national interest of
either the US or the UK. Abolishing the current restrictions would lead to
more flights between a wider range of airports in both countries. Greater
competition would also drive down air fares and the consequent increase in
trans'Atlantic travel would boost trade and tourism.
For an open market to be negotiated, the governments will need to gain a
wider perspective than that of their airlines. The prize of doing so is
great and should be enthusiastically grasped.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pollution costs catch up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MALLEN BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your section on Europe and the environment focused heavily on the costs
of environmental legislation to industry (Can Europe Compete?, March 3).
This is only half the story, because doing nothing about the environment is
not a low-cost option.
Pollution created by one company lands extra costs on to others, or society,
often at a level far higher than the cost of prevention. The damage being
done to buildings, monuments and forests by acid deposition from sulphur
pollution, for example, probably runs into billions of Ecus.
This is a bill that will have to be picked up sooner or later. It will be a
great deal cheaper if the bill is paid by preventing emissions at source,
and fairer if this is charged to the polluter. It is only because such costs
have been missing from the balance sheets of companies and governments that
skimping on the environment has ever created the illusion of economic
commonsense.
In many sectors, improvements in environmental practice are about increasing
efficiency in a way that assists economic performance. Worries about
competitiveness in sectors where this is not so should be pursued through a
new Gatt round designed to build a global framework for pollution control.
The need for such a step was widely identified during the tortuous and
flawed progress of the Uruguay Round. It will be disastrous for us all if
the global nature of many environmental problems puts a brake on progress
because of narrow national interests.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Personal View: Two may be a crowd - Does the UK need a stock
market for entrepreneurs? Sir Andrew Hugh Smith offers his views
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Sir ANDREW HUGH SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For more than 200 years, the London Stock Exchange has been the main source
of equity funding for UK companies. That function is still its central role.
Yet recently, concerns have been expressed about the capital-raising options
open to smaller companies, which are the motor of economic recovery.
City investors, company directors, politicians and venture capitalists all
have different solutions to the problem of improving capital availability
for small businesses.
The stock exchange is committed to playing its part in providing all
suitable companies with access to capital. The question is how that can best
be achieved.
The stock exchange has to balance its statutory obligation to ensure
investors are adequately informed about companies with the unavoidable
regulatory cost to the businesses themselves.
It is often assumed that the cost of a listing on the stock exchange,
typically between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 500,000 - mostly paid to legal
and other advisers - could be greatly reduced in an alternative market. But
this could be done only by decreasing the level of investor protection. The
readiness of investors to commit funds might then be correspondingly
reduced.
Last year the stock exchange set up a working party to investigate whether
the closure of the Unlisted Securities Market would create a gap in the
funding arrangements for small companies and, if so, what might be done. The
working party proposed replacing the USM with an 'enterprise market' that
would have a regulatory regime similar to that of the Official List and the
USM.
The working party's contribution was valuable, but its report adduced little
hard evidence of the demand for an alternative market of this kind, or of
the needs it should meet. Nor did it solve the problem of initial costs.
Recent press comments suggest that the stock exchange has rejected the
enterprise market proposals. This is untrue. Like any business planning a
new venture, the stock exchange has commissioned research into the needs and
concerns of small listed and USM companies, unquoted companies which may be
considering a flotation, professional advisers and investors.
The stock exchange also wants to find out whether investors would accept
less detailed disclosure in the listing particulars and a lower level of
regulation. If not, it would be difficult to make any new market
substantially different from the Official List. An additional question is
how far regulation could, in practice, be reduced within the European Union
regulatory environment.
It is worth recalling that the stock exchange established the USM in 1980 to
provide young, entrepreneurial companies with the means of raising equity
finance. It offered access to public capital to companies which could not
qualify for a full listing, at much lower cost. It was a great success for
some years, because of those qualities.
But the distinction between the USM and the Official List was later eroded
as a result both of EU legislation and of lower costs arising from changes
in the official listing procedures of the stock exchange. These changes
coincided with the downturn in the UK economy, and interest in the USM fell
away rapidly.
Other distinctions between the Official List and the USM - and indeed the
working party's recommendations - are, in practice, illusory.
For instance, the Official List is open to companies prepared to release 25
per cent of their shares into public hands, with a market capitalisation of
as little as Pounds 700,000. In fact few, if any, companies of this size
would find public capital a cost-effective way of raising finance. The total
cost of listing makes this option uneconomic for most companies valued at
only a few million pounds. Although USM companies need release only 10 per
cent of shares into public hands, many have chosen to release 25 per cent or
more to avoid illiquidity.
The stock exchange has already taken steps to broaden the types of companies
which can join the Official List. The revised Yellow Book rules, published
last year, extended access to research-based scientific companies without a
three-year trading record.
Several companies have used these particular rules successfully, and a
working group is considering further refinements to the mutual benefit of
companies and investors.
The record shows how the stock exchange already supports smaller companies.
Of 180 new businesses listed last year, 58 were capitalised at Pounds 50m or
less - a widely accepted delineation of a smaller company. There are now 860
of these on our main market, nearly half of all domestic listed companies.
The stock exchange is committed to providing access to publicly subscribed
capital to the broadest range of UK companies. We are actively examining how
that range can be increased. In doing so we have to consider not only the
interests of companies seeking capital, but of those who can provide it, not
least so that they can have the confidence to invest.

Sir, Your report 'Channel tunnellers aim for Alpine projects' (March 3)
suggests that there may be things for the tunnellers to do much nearer home.
Why not build an inner ring road round London, inside the infamous M25 and
deep underground?
The construction could include large car parks with escalators or lifts for
upward connections to the main London tube stations.
Such a project could keep the tunnellers going for years at a steady rate,
and it would get the cars out of London, enabling the city to breathe again.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competitive tendering still holds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From KATE TAYLOR and MARK COOK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We should like to comment on the suggestion inherent in your reports
'Rules on public contract tendering to be eased' (March 1) and 'Conflict
alleged on tendering rules' (March 2) that new Treasury guidelines on the
tendering of public-sector contracts will imply widespread and radical
changes to the current practice.
Your report of March 1 acknowledges that the guidelines 'will not involve
cases covered by European Union rules requiring competition'. These rules
catch most contracts for construction works exceeding Pounds 3,743,203 in
value, supplies contracts exceeding Pounds 96,403 and contracts for a wide
range of services where the contract value exceeds Pounds 149,728.
It can be seen, therefore, that the vast majority by value of central
government procurement contracts will fall outside the new guidelines and
will remain subject to a requirement of competitive tendering, in which the
suppliers from across the EU may participate.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Swiss toll system could resolve lorry
ban objections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From CHRISTIAN CARL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Anyone who has hiked in the Alps will share the Swiss and Austrians'
environmental and aesthetic concerns about the growing volume of lorry
traffic through their valleys.
The approach chosen in the recent Swiss referendum, however, raises
important questions as to how the problem should be remedied.
Much editorial space has already been given to the political costs of
antagonising Switzerland's European Union neighbours as well as Austria by
closing Swiss roads to lorries by 2004. There has been less debate over the
economic costs.
It is a well-known fact that quotas introduce unnecessary distortions by
failing to separate users at the margin from the rest.
A system of toll points at the borders and within the country, with fares
linked to distance travelled, weight per axle and emission, presents several
clear advantages:
By reflecting the marginal costs of environmental and road-damage, the fares
would push marginal freight transit towards alternative forms of transport
(eg: rail);
Revenue raised from the tolls could be used in financing the development and
expansion of trans-Alpine rail networks, thus capturing a greater proportion
of actual lorry cargo (and demonstrating the applicability of the system to
Austria);
Although the scheme would involve imposing fares on domestic traffic
(removing one of the major sticking points with Switzerland's over the
present discriminatory proposal), it may nevertheless be acceptable to Swiss
voters, in view of fare structure described above which would primarily hit
long-haul international traffic;
From a practical point of view, the region, by nature of its geography, will
not suffer from the diversion of lorry traffic onto minor roads, as is the
case in France;
A toll system might be more acceptable than a quota system to the EU with
respect to existing transport agreements and within the framework of
potential EU membership by the Swiss.
By installing a toll system, the Swiss could not only limit political
objections and solve their environmental problem, they could also set the
example and the pace for their immediate neighbours with the same concerns,
as well as for those nations toying with the idea of road-pricing as a means
of reducing congestion.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN O'BRIEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In order to attract overseas investors to London, as well as relieve
the misery endured by Londoners on a daily basis, we must have greater
investment in London's public transport system. The private sector has a
real opportunity to take a leading role in achieving this, under the
government's Private Finance Initiative.
Accordingly, we are concerned that one of the first proposals to follow the
initiative - to replace the desperately old tube cars running on the
Northern Line - is still awaiting a decision in principle by the Treasury.
Not only does a deal of this type make sound commercial sense, but it also
meets Treasury guidelines for the realistic transfer of risk to the private
sector - or at least, as the private sector has to date understood the
guidelines.
This straightforward, imaginative project must be allowed to move ahead
without further delay.
If new cars for the Northern Line cannot be secured, what future is there
for private finance in public-sector projects?

FT  08 MAR 94 / Personal View: Special care for young companies - Does the
UK need a stock market for entrepreneurs? Ronald Cohen offers his views
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the next few months, the London Stock Exchange is due to decide whether a
separate market is needed, alongside the main 'official list', to replace
the Unlisted Securities Market, which the exchange plans to close. The
debate can be reduced to a simple question: can one market cater for both
large, stable companies and smaller, more innovative, faster growing, but
less stable entrepreneurial ones? Experience in the US and UK suggests that
the answer is no.
Entrepreneurial growth companies can be defined in this context as
greenfield ventures, and companies with a short trading record, management
buy-outs or buy-ins and companies in high-growth and high-technology
sectors.
In the US, the Nasdaq exchange opened in 1971 in response to the burgeoning
'over the counter' market for unlisted shares. By the end of 1993, Nasdaq
had 4,600 companies trading on it, double the number trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. Traditionally the market has been for entrepreneurial
companies, especially those focusing on growth sectors such as electronics
and biotechnology. But 60 per cent of today's most actively traded stocks in
the US are listed on Nasdaq.
During the US recession, the number of 'initial public offerings' - the
first time a company's stock is offered to the public - fell from 570 in
1986 to 135 in 1990. Since then it has risen rapidly to 520 in 1993, the
third-highest number since the market's opening. Nasdaq clearly has a
distinct identity which appeals to entrepreneurial companies.
In contrast, the NYSE caters solely for larger, more stable companies. The
average market capitalisation of the 2,331 companies traded on it at the end
of 1993 was Dollars 457m, against Dollars 216m for Nasdaq.
In the UK, the USM was established 10 years later than Nasdaq, also largely
in response to a growing over-the-counter market. It was cheaper and easier
to access than the Official List, and its companies were typically smaller,
younger and more entrepreneurial than those on the Official List. The fall
in the number of new issues during the recession, from 103 in 1988 to seven
in 1992, was more extreme than Nasdaq, but the volume of shares traded
almost doubled between 1992 and 1993 (despite only five new issues last
year) as interest in smaller companies revived.
The fall in new issues was exacerbated in 1990 by EC directives on the
regulation of financial markets which eroded some of the differences between
the regulations and costs of the USM and the Official List, and by the
announcement of the USM's impending closure, due in early 1996.
The stock exchange, instead of anticipating the EC directives and
maintaining a gap with the Official List by eliminating the requirement for
a trading record on the USM in line with Nasdaq, interpreted the drop in the
number of companies wishing to float as evidence of insufficient demand for
such a market.
Two pieces of evidence are often used to justify the claim that the Official
List caters effectively for all companies. First, the recent rush of new
issues on the Official List - 180 during 1993, many of which were regarded
as entrepreneurial companies which would in normal circumstances have gone
to the USM. In fact this was partly because the market did not function as
it should have in recession while, with a recovery in sight and a bull
market, enthusiasm to invest in these companies has returned as investors
know that they generally perform better than larger, more stable ones at
this stage of the cycle.
Second, the stock exchange's recent decision to relax its entry criteria for
the Official List and allow access to healthcare companies with no trading
record. But why should biotechnology companies be singled out? Will the
rules also be relaxed for other sectors such as electronics, special
materials or interactive media?
In fact it is possible that the decision to relax the rules will be reversed
as soon as some of these companies fail, as they inevitably will. The
exchange may view such failures among entrepreneurial companies as a taint
on its position as a leading market for the largest companies. Its board,
drawn from those primarily interested in large companies, may seek to
protect the image of the Official List by adding new restrictions.
Already, by closing the USM, it has effectively raised the minimum trading
record for companies seeking a listing from two to three years. It has also
introduced rules for biotechnology companies which state that directors and
promoters of these companies cannot sell shares for two years when the
equivalent lock-up period imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission
in the US is six months.
The risk is that, in the next recession, these companies will find that
access to equity through the Official List is again restricted to large
companies.
So a specialist market for high-growth entrepreneurial companies is
essential. A particular management and marketing focus is needed to run a
market that directs attention to the activities of entrepreneurial companies
and attracts entrepreneurs.
Nasdaq has succeeded, not because of the trading system it employs nor its
rule book, but because it is managed independently of the NYSE and the
American Stock Exchange. It has a dedicated management team whose objectives
are to sustain it through both the good and the bad times in the economy, to
exploit opportunities and to defend it from external threats.
Nasdaq has developed and sustained an image as the market for
entrepreneurial growth companies, attracting new companies in new sectors as
new technologies evolve.
It is this focus which attracts specialist marketmakers, bankers, brokers
and institutional and private investors, who are primarily interested in
entrepreneurial companies. Their involvement strengthens the market's
ability to finance companies in recession and recovery.
This specialist market should be as highly regulated against fraud, as the
Official List should cater for both institutional and private investors, and
should be independently managed by a team with a specialist knowledge of
entrepreneurial companies. In order to maximise liquidity, it should be seen
as the first constituent of a pan-European market which would link national
markets for entrepreneurial companies across the European Union.
It is clear, in the light of US experience, that the stock exchange cannot
cater for all types of companies through a single market. If it wishes to
provide an effective marketplace for entrepreneurial companies, in bear and
bull markets alike, it can only do so through a separate market,
independently managed and enjoying a distinctive identity.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Arts: 'No Man's Land' on Broadway - New York Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The appearance on Broadway of a play by Harold Pinter is a rare enough
occurrence to be worthy of mention; the current revival of No Man's Land,
now playing at the Roundabout Theater, deserves little more than that.
Meaning and menace burble beneath the elusive surface of this, and indeed
all, of Pinter's works, but surface, in this production directed by David
Jones, is just about all we get - save a remarkable performance by
Christopher Plummer.
It is little wonder that No Man's Land was, until recently, one of the
least-produced of Pinter's plays. Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud's
performances in its 1975 London premiere (which then played New York) were
reportedly so memorable as to be called consummate, and other actors have
been reticent to step into their shoes. No Man's Land did not receive
another London production until 1992, when Pinter himself appeared as Hirst,
the ageing, alcoholic writer who lives in a Hampstead manse with two
thuggish minders, with Paul Eddington as Spooner, the bedraggled and equally
aged poet who weasels into Hirst's house - and, perhaps, his consciousness.
This production features Jason Robards as Hirst and Plummer in the showman's
role of Spooner - which he digs into with considerable skill and aplomb. His
Spooner is pathetic, but strangely dear, a faded dandy in a grimy grey suit
and silly, narrow wool scarf that he tucks compulsively into his lapels.
Quick - desperate - to please, he has a nervous giggle and a bizarre gait
somewhere between a mince and a shuffle. Plummer's characterisation hints at
an intriguing layer of homoeroticism in the text - let us not forget that
Hirst met Spooner on the Heath and brought him to the house where he lives
with two men who exist to please him - that is, sadly, not further
exploited.
While Pinter's play is surely about (at least in part) the unbreachable gulf
between people, that 'no man's land . . . which never moves, which never
changes, which never grows older, but which remains forever, icy and
silent,' Jones' production takes this idea too literally and too far - the
almost total lack of connection between Hirst and Spooner keeps the audience
from engaging in their wordplay.
Robards, though physically commanding, seems mentally and emotionally
absent. His declamatory Hirst is oblivious to Spooner from the start, and
when, at the end of the first act, he does let down his guard ('Tonight . .
. my friend . . . you find me in the last lap of a race I had long forgotten
to run') his confidences seem to come, if not from nowhere, then probably
from alcohol - certainly not from any growing relationship between himself
and Spooner.
The onstage atmosphere becomes even less charged with the entry of Hirst's
servants. Fresh-faced Tom Wood plays Foster as an immature braggart, while
the role seems to call for a darker-hued approach. The usually reliable John
Seitz as Briggs has the right bulky, hooded-eyed look for the role, but his
throwaway demeanour and lazily executed Cockney accent bring with them not a
touch of danger.
No Man's Land is full of mysteries about these men and their relation to one
another, which will probably never be solved. It is a musing on the
tenuousness of memory and the delicacy of human relations, and its pleasures
lie in the ever-shifting suggestions of meaning and counter-meaning that
accumulate as it unfolds. But performed as it is here, sans texture or mood,
it seems less potent ambiguity than wilful obscurity.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Arts: Dali, the myth unmasked - A revealing exhibition at
the Hayward Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Salvador Dali: The Early Years is one of those comparatively rare
exhibitions which properly challenges one's established view of its subject,
and does so positively. If it does nothing for Dali the older man - that is
to say Dali the poseur, self-publicist, self-mythologiser - it makes him, at
least at first, more interesting, substantial and credible a figure.
He was born at Figueres in Catalonia in 1904 and died not far away, at the
little port of Cadaques, in 1989. This exhibition leaves us with Dali in
1931, at the age of 27 just teasing himself into his mature persona as an
artist and on the brink of his brilliant, preposterous career. Of all the
artists of our century, he alone stands with Picasso, the patronymic alone
enough to summon up the very idea of modern art to a popular public,
innocent of Matisse or Pollock or Andy Warhol. Yet while Picasso, for all
his fame, remains still to a great extent an object of controversy and
scepticism, Dali has always been truly popular, accepted and familiar quite
as much in his work as in his gleefully public personality.
Such is the nature of true celebrity, and it says a great deal indeed for
the imaginative power of Surrealism that Dali should still be every
schoolboy's favourite modern artist.
Oh yes: but then, you say, he was always so brilliant a draughtsman and so
wonderfully meticulous a painter. Just look at that immaculate technique,
those soft watches and flaming giraffes, and that vertiginous Christ on the
Cross. Clearly he was a genius, whatever that is, and we do respect a
genius. Such is the myth of himself that Dali was so assiduous in promoting,
and is here so usefully exploded.
What we discover is no precocious and preternatural talent, but only a
normally interested and sensitive, if unacademic, adolescent. Far from
demonstrating any exceptional ability, the pages shown here of schoolboy
illustration, based on the graphic conventions of contemporary comic
journals, show the difficulty he had with anything but grotesque distortion
and exaggeration - the staple of every school magazine there ever was. But
the interest is certainly there, as well as a certain inventive energy and
ambition.
So from the schoolboy to the student painter at the local art school in
Figueres, and again we find at first nothing exceptional, the work being
fairly standard student stuff. Sometimes it is clumsy and ill-formed, but
intelligent and engaged in its response to impressionism and symbolism and
the more decorative aspects of expressionism. He begins to write a novel. He
paints a number of self-portraits, romantic, self-dramatising images, long
hair, broad hat, pipe in mouth, as moody as only a self-conscious
17-year-old can be.
At 18 he wins a place at the Academy of Fine Art in Madrid, where he spends
the next four years, for one of which he is rusticated for riotous
indiscipline. And now emerges not yet the brilliant artist, but certainly
the brilliant student. In a remarkable sequence of paintings we follow him
as he comes to terms with the currency of the international avant-garde. He
does so not with any profound originality, but with a steadiness and
intelligence that does him credit. The paradox is that in his
unselfconsciousness he is never less than true to himself.
Picasso is his commanding interest at this time, and Picasso in all his
aspects - cubist, proto-surrealist, the neo-classicist of the nudes on the
beach and the realist of the portraits of his wife. And yet Dali is also
looking elsewhere, and in a remarkable painting of a basket of bread, of
1926, the year of his final expulsion from the Madrid Academy, he pays
direct homage to the great Spanish realist tradition and to Zurbaran in
particular. He also looks to the modern Italian metafisici, to de Chirico,
Sironi and, in one huge schematic still-life especially, to Carra.
Most impressive of all are the portraits and figures - his sister, Anna
Maria, at Cadaques; a girl in a white dress that may well be her, seen from
behind; his father. All are solid, simple and unaffected in their
realisation, rich in the paint and bold in the drawing, and yet seen with
that febrile clarity that already hints at the obsessively microscopic
precision of the work to come.
And then, from around 1927, begins the slide, slow at first but speeding up
over the next few years, into the mannerism, self-consciousness and
formulaic eccentricity alike of imagery as of behaviour, upon which his
global reputation still rests. Other surrealists, such as Bunuel, with whom
Dali was associated, stand as considerable artists by the work they did. But
for Dali it was the open embrace of Surrealism that did for him, with its
essentially arbitrary and literary imagery, and infinite scope for more of
the self-indulgent same, and same again. The irony is only that it was Dali
the student who was the more interesting and truer artist.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Arts: 'Pearl Fishers' revived - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The imperishable 'friendship' duet for the leading men in Bizet's Les
Pecheurs de perles (1863), which is the one bit of the opera that everybody
knows, comes early in the first act. While it got its vociferous applause at
Saturday's ENO revival, somebody behind me remarked, 'Well, we can all go
home now]'
Not fair: amidst all the shapely, dewily original music that follows, the
duet returns often enough (in frank reprise or thinly disguised) to delight
its most besotted devotees. Besides, in Philip Prowse's refurbished, campily
elegant staging, the opera - virtually an opera comique - offers one of the
most appealing musical evenings in town.
Sung here in very plain English without poetical pretensions, The Pearl
Fishers is set in a never-never-land Ceylon, an exotic French-colonial dream
a la Pierre Loti. There is ample excuse for mock-Eastern pomp, which might
submerge the real charms of the opera altogether; instead Prowse opts for
airy space and light, reserving decadent splendour for a few prominent
objects like the central altar, and for some of the costumes.
Beyond those there is only the wreck of a ship, and a giant awning with
hanging lamps, and a large, knowingly tacky circle of light-bulbs in the
sky. They serve very well - as does Prowse's extra addition to the
cast-list: Imogen Claire as an omnipresent priestess (or something: maybe
the High Priest's concubine), coiling and arching balletically throughout
like a malign fin-de-siecle spirit, silently manipulating the action.
Against that tongue-in-cheek background, the romantic triangle can stand and
deliver with unaffected candour.
Of the two sworn friends in love with the virgin priestess Leila, Jonathan
Summers makes a vehement Zurga, the baritone loser who eventually does the
decent thing, and as the luckier Nadir - tenor, of course - young John
Hudson offers enough sensitive feeling to compensate for some imperfect
suavity in Bizet's vocal line.
Leila herself is Gillian Webster, a bright soprano: lovely liquid depths in
her middle range, mature artistry in her dramatic pleas. Easier top notes,
securer pitch and less of a petulant Hollywood starlet's manner would make
her an ideal heroine, but she is already a vivid and fascinating one.
As the high priest Nourabad, Andrew Greenan wields his doughty bass-baritone
to menacing effect. The keen ENO chorus achieves an almost French crispness
(better than most echt-French choruses can manage nowadays), and the
Viennese conductor Alexander Sander paces the score with clean style and
despatch. Bits of Wagner's Tannhauser and even Tristan surface here and
there, the more disarming because Bizet adapted them so coolly to his chaste
Gallic idiom.
All in all, only a stony heart could fail to respond to this artful,
ever-fresh music; if anything, the ridiculously dated terms of the 'drama'
set it off in enhanced relief.
Co-production with Opera North. In repertory at the Coliseum until April 28,
with a new conductor and principal singers in the later performances

<TEXT>
In Assignment Julian Pettifer reports on the trade disputes between Japan
and the US which are damaging relations between the two economic super
powers, and on Japan's search for a more independent role in the world (7.45
BBC2).
Suddenly the motor car is the most popular subject for television series.
After Alexei Sayle's 'Drive' on BBC1, and before 'Tales Of Modern Motoring'
which starts later this month on BBC2, the Channel 4 culture series Without
Walls offers a three-part series called 'Carnography'. They begin today by
comparing a Ferrari with the Dodge Viper (9.00). In the second half of WW
Craig Raine defends the poet Rudyard Kipling from the politically correct
lemmings who mindlessly attack him (9.30).
Hidden under television's most forgettable umbrella title, Network First, is
a documentary about the Central School Of Ballet in London (10.40 ITV). BBC1
screens the long and inferior version of Spielberg's 1971 television drama,
Duel about a car driver (played by Dennis Weaver) who is pursued by an
articulated tanker (11.45).

FT  08 MAR 94 / People: Racal chooses Richardson for data
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Racal Electronics, which has been dogged by bid rumours for months, is
attempting to turn around its problem data communications operation by
bringing in Martin Richardson, right, from elsewhere in the company to
become chairman and chief executive of Racal Data Group.
Tim Holley, the previous incumbent, was last October named chief executive
of Camelot, one of the bidders for the National Lottery.
Since then, Racal's chief executive David Elsbury says he has spent several
months 'reviewing and validating the new-product pipeline and sharpening the
focus of the research and development programme'. Richardson now has until
May to produce for the board 'a detailed report on progress and plans for
the business'.
While Holley was based in the UK, Richardson has moved out to Florida, where
much of the data group's business is located. Holley had spent more of his
time on the other, newer, side of the division, the UK-based Network
Services. Peter Blair, 56, previously in charge of the company's advanced
development activities, has also transferred to Florida as technical
director of the data group.
Richardson, 49, a former Plessey executive who has been on the main board of
Racal Electronics since 1985, earned his spurs recently by repairing the
fortunes of Racal's specialised businesses, in particular turning software
subsidiary Racal-Redac's large losses into respectable profits. He will have
plenty of scope for action at Racal Data Group, where pre-tax profits in the
year to March 1993 were just Pounds 12.6m despite sales of Pounds 370m.
As Mike Styles, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing puts it: 'Richardson's

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
From specialist publishing to roof tiles, bricks and concrete - Paul Hewitt,
37, is moving from being finance director of Euromoney to be finance
director at Redland, one of Europe's biggest building material groups.
Hewitt has been appointed to succeed Gerald Corbett who at the end of last
year was announced as the new finance director of Grand Metropolitan the
food and drinks group.
Corbett, who leaves Redland at the age of 42, had managed the company's
financial affairs for six years and had been particularly adept in
minimising the company's tax and interest liabilities. He will be a
difficult act to follow.
Robert Napier, Redland's chief executive said yesterday: 'Over the last six
years Paul Hewitt has played a key role in the successful growth of
Euromoney including its international growth.'
Euromoney Publications, 75 per cent-owned by the Daily Mail and General
Trust, lifted pre-tax profits by 28 per cent from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds
17.7m in the year to September 30. Redland in the first six months of last
year increased pre-tax profits by 22 per cent.
Hewitt, who will commence duties at Redland this summer, was educated at St
Paul's school and Cambridge University before qualifying as a chartered
accountant at Arthur Andersen. He has been finance director at Euromoney
since 1988.

Septuagenarians need not fear that their chances of landing directorships

Telspec has just added its second venerable non-executive director,
70-year-old Paul Skey, having turned to the services of ex Cable &amp; Wireless
chairman Lord Sharp, 77, just before the December flotation.
Skey, also an old C &amp; W hand, has been a member of the board of Telspec
Europe for some while. Chief executive Garth Riley said that at the time of
the listing he didn't want to upset BT, one of its principal customers, by
having two C &amp; W types on the main board. 'They were proof-reading the
prospectus and it would have made their hair stand on end.' Now the company
is safely public, he reckons he has more room for manoeuvre. What does BT
say now? 'I haven't asked them,' says Riley.

A more systematic approach needs to be taken to the reform of tort law
worldwide, according to a review of the economics of law reform published by
the Oxford Review of Economic Policy.
The movement towards strict product liability in the US and Europe, for
example, will have little impact on product-related accidents, it says. Tort
reform should be seen in the wider context of public policy towards
regulating the quality of products, workplace safety and environmental
damage, rather than as a response to events where victims are seen to be in
need of compensation.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Appeal dismissed in nail-gun fight -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice has dismissed the final appeal by Hilti, a
nail-gun and fastenings manufacturer, against an Ecu6m fine imposed by the
European Commission in 1987 for abuse of its dominant position in the
market.
Upholding the Court of First Instance's judgment in favour of the
Commission's decision, the ECJ rejected Hilti's claims that the CFI had not
applied the correct legal tests in defining the relevant product market for
the purpose of determining Hilti's dominant market position.
The Court's decision confirms that the scope of an appeal from the CFI to
the ECJ in competition cases is strictly limited to appeal on a point of law
only. The ECJ said an appeal may rely only on grounds relating to the
infringement of rules of law, to the exclusion of any appraisal of the
facts.
In the course of its judgment, the ECJ explained that the appraisal by the
CFI of evidence put before it does not constitute (except where the clear
sense of that evidence has been distorted) a point of law which is subject,
as such, to review by the ECJ.
Hilti had appealed to the ECJ against the CFI's judgment of December 12
1991. The CFI dismissed Hilti's application for the annulment of the
Commission's 1987 decision imposing a fine for abusing its dominant position
by conduct intended to hinder entry or penetration of the market for
Hilti-compatible nails by independent producers of nails for Hilti nail
guns.
Hilti manufactures a range of products used for fastening materials in
place, and in particular nail guns, cartridge strips, cartridges and nails.
These products are referred to collectively as 'powder-actuated fastening
systems' (PAF systems).
The main dispute between Hilti and the Commission concerned the definition
of the relevant market in which Hilti operated. The Commission found there
were three separate markets for nail guns, cartridge strips (and cartridges)
and nails.
Hilti claimed there was a single market comprising all the fastening systems
which can be substituted for PAF systems. Since the three components of the
PAF systems made up an indivisible whole, Hilti said, these competed in one
market, which included drilling and screwing systems.
The CFI held on the contrary that the relevant product market in relation to
which Hilti's market position must be appraised was the market for nails
designed for Hilti nail guns.
In its appeal, Hilti challenged the grounds on which the CFI arrived at this
definition of the market, enabling it to conclude Hilti was in a position of
dominance. The ECJ rejected all the grounds relied on by Hilti, finding that
the CFI had adequately dealt with issues such as the interchangeability of
PAF systems with other fastening products.
Hilti also challenged the appraisal of certain economic evidence and claimed
that the CFI had failed to take into consideration all the evidence
presented by Hilti. Since no claim was made that the CFI distorted the clear
sense of that evidence, the ECJ said the submissions relating to the
appraisal of facts were inadmissible.
In dealing with Hilti's claims that certain reasoning relating to the
discharge of the burden of proof by the Commission was defective in the
CFI's judgment, the ECJ found that the Commission had based its reasoning in
its decision on precise factual evidence, rather than supposition as alleged
by Hilti.
The ECJ said the CFI had not required any proof beyond that normally
required of applicants in order to establish that their pleas in law were
well founded by requiring Hilti to demonstrate its view was well founded.
The Court also rejected a claim by an intervener, Bauco, that the ECJ
increase the fine imposed on Hilti in view of the delay caused by Hilti's
behaviour. Since Bauco had not brought a similar claim before the CFI, the
ECJ said it was not open to an intervener to request a form of order from
the ECJ different from that sought at first instance.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Overthrow of ancien regime - Jean
Thibaud explains changes to French banking and company laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN THIBAUD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year, the newly elected French conservative parliament modernised its
banking and company laws, signalling a new pro-business attitude in France.
By a law of December 31 1993, a number of changes were made affecting the
Bank of France and the credit and financial markets. Action was taken to
bring the French law on the netting of derivative products, such as swaps
and options, into line with the UK and the US.
At its simplest level, netting involves the set-off of transactions against
each other. When it works effectively, is recognised by the counterparties
to a transaction and is designed to reduce insolvency exposures, it allows
capital requirements to be greatly reduced, since the credit and liquidity
exposures of participants are also reduced.
England has recently accepted netting as a basic principle of insolvency law
and the US has also passed legislation permitting it, so that it can bring
its capital adequacy rules into line with the recommendations of the Basle
committee of the Bank for International Settlements.
France has now followed suit. The law of December 31 provides that, in the
event of the bankruptcy of a French counterparty, French law fully
recognises, and gives effect to close out, netting provisions included
either in regulations applicable to official markets, or in master form
agreements published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association
or by the French Banking Association (AFB) for over-the-counter
transactions.
The practical consequences of the new law are, first, that a French
counterparty to such a derivative transaction will not be charged an extra
premium for counterparty risk; and second, banks will be able to show their
net position with a French counterparty, thereby reducing their capital
costs.
The December 31 changes also clarify the law on repurchase agreements -
instruments by which securities are sold on a short-term basis with an
agreement to repurchase. Until the law was passed, there was some doubt
among the legal community about the enforceability in a French court of a
pension livree (repurchase agreement).
This was because the legal bases of this instrument were weak, the first
being a memorandum of understanding (accord de place) approved by the Bank
of France in co-operation with the Association of Banking Treasurers and the
second, purely for the tax aspects, a simple letter from the Ministry of
Economy and Finance to the AFB.
The invaluable contribution of the new law is that it offers a safe legal
framework for such transactions, and it defines the large number of
instruments which may be subject to repurchase agreements ('repos') and the
institutions which are authorised to enter into such transactions: banks,
securities houses, brokerage firms, mutual funds, financial institutions,
institutional investors, insurance companies, non-profit corporations and
unit trusts.
The law also sets out the tax and accounting treatment of 'repos', thereby
creating the conditions required for the development of a real international
'repos' market in Paris, such as currently exists in London and New York.
The law of December 31 also abolished stamp duty on securities transactions
entered into with a non-French tax resident on the Paris bourse. This
measure is expected to suppress one of the big incentives for large French
stockholders to sell blocks of shares on the London Stock Exchange through
the electronic automated quotation system (Seaq).
This measure, together with the success of the current privatisation
programme, is expected to boost the volume and liquidity of the market on
the Paris stock exchange.
On the corporate side, the changes are designed primarily to provide a more
flexible and modern company law and to restore some of the rights of banks
and other secured creditors in the event of the bankruptcy of a French
company.
The law of January 3 1994 has created a new form of joint stock company, the
so-called 'simplified joint stock company' (or 'SAS' in French), which
allows for much greater flexibility in, among other things, the
decision-making process, management and the exclusion of shareholders than
previously permitted under company law.
The essential difference is that the shareholders, subject to only a few
restrictions, can organise the company as they wish. This type of company is
particularly suitable to both domestic and cross-border joint ventures
between medium and large-sized companies.
French companies had been lobbying for such a simplified joint stock company
for some time. Previously they had no alternative but to go into other
European jurisdictions, in particular the Netherlands, to find the level of
legal flexibility appropriate for certain types of joint ventures between
large companies.
For the first time in the history of French company law, the law of December
31 1993 expressly permits the forcing out ('squeeze-out') of minority
shareholders in a listed company.
The issue was hotly debated in the parliament, and the French squeeze-out is
subject to strict requirements. First, the majority shareholders should hold
either together or 'in concert' no less than 95 per cent of the capital and
voting shares of the company.
Second, the squeeze-out may occur only after a tender offer or a request for
delisting of shares has been made in accordance with the rules issued by the
CBV, the regulatory authority for the French stock exchange.
Eventually, the minority shareholders should receive fair compensation that
is 'the appropriate combination in each case of the value of the assets of
the company, the profits of the company, the market capitalisation for the
shares, the existence of subsidiaries and the financial prospects for future
business'.
The national assembly also passed on January 10 this year a draft bankruptcy
bill, amending the 1985 Bankruptcy Act. If approved by the Senate, it would
significantly alter the rights of banks and secured creditors of a company
either under administration or in bankruptcy.
The 1985 act favoured employees, and was aimed primarily at keeping the
company alive and saving jobs by precluding banks and other secured
creditors from enforcing their security and selling off the assets of the
company.
The principal consequences of the draft bill for the banks and the other
secured creditors would be: that in the event of liquidation, the secured
creditors would rank before the creditors who granted new money after an
administration judgment; the tax authorities and social security would not
be given preferential rank in respect of all their claims; and that, in the
event of a bankruptcy, the secured creditors would be permitted to enforce
their security by selling off the assets of the company.
For political and historical reasons, the French deregulation movement took
place later than and was not as brutal as in other western countries, such
the UK or US.
Even if these changes do not appear to be that spectacular from a UK or US
perspective, they illustrate a clear departure from the ancien regime. They
show a clear political will decisively to integrate France into the
worldwide economy, and to offer to participants on the French markets the
same types of legal instruments available in the most industrialised
countries.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): It pays to be precise -
Exporting Letters of credit are examined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mike Warwick-Smith found out about the perils of letters of credit - the
means by which payment is guaranteed for many exports - the hard way. He is
managing director of Elsan, a Sussex company best known in the UK as a
supplier of chemical toilets and healthcare chemicals.
Elsan was shipping disinfectants to a new customer in the Middle East and
one word was mis-spelt in a document. The ship was loading. Correcting the
error might mean having to send the consignment on a later ship - and
risking losing the order. He decided to let the shipment go, but his new
customer's bank refused to honour the letter of credit because the
documentation was not 100 per cent correct. Elsan stood to lose about Pounds
11,000 - no small sum for a company turning over Pounds 2m, about 10 per
cent of it in export markets.
Everything worked out in the end because the customer came back for more.
Buyer and seller agreed for the cost of the initial consignment to be paid
off in instalments of cash, and Warwick-Smith never made that mistake again.
But many other people still do. Ian Campbell, director-general of the
Institute of Export, says at least half of all letters of credit and their
associated documentation have to be amended before payment can be made.
Steve Beresford, NatWest's export finance specialist in Manchester, says:
'Compliance with credit terms and conditions is never easily achieved. About
65 per cent of documents presented to us in Manchester in 1993 were
discrepant on first presentation.'
In theory, letters of credit should be easy. An export customer opens one
with his or her own bank. It amounts to a promise by the customer's bank to
pay the exporter's bank when the goods have been delivered.
To ensure delivery and payment, various questions must be settled, such as
currency, method of shipment, port of delivery, inspection certificates
prior to dispatch - proving the goods are what they are supposed to be - and
correctly descriptive accompanying bills of lading during shipment. Time
limits are set for delivery and the letter of credit's validity.
If the details do not match exactly on all documentation, or specified
procedures are not followed, the letter of credit may not be honoured.
Details do not necessarily have to be 'correct' - such as through
mis-spelling or typing errors in the letter of credit - provided they are
consistently wrong in all the documentation.
'It's mind-boggling,' says Campbell. 'You have to check every word to make
sure documents match each other and completely satisfy the conditions in the
letter of credit. It's the exact match that counts, not the intention,
meaning or even spelling. You can forget all this 'My word is my bond
stuff'.'
Nor are all letters of credit what they seem. Michael Palmer is export
director of Tenby Electrical, a Birmingham manufacturer of light switches
and connectors. The company turns over about Pounds 24m a year and exports
are now at Pounds 8m. He received a Pounds 100,000 order in Nigeria, but had
never heard of the bank issuing the letter of credit. Also, it specified
shipment by air freight, which enables goods to be shifted - and stolen -
faster at the receiving end.
'We asked our UK bank to confirm the letter of credit. It turned out the
bank in Nigeria did not even exist. It was a straightforward fraud,' Palmer
says. Other companies have been caught out in similar scams.
Banks charge for confirming letters of credit. If checking leads to
amendments, there will be a further fee. Mark Runiewicz of the Bank
Relationship Consultancy, which tries to get clients better deals with their
banks, urges caution.
'If bank charges work out at Pounds 120 and the transaction is only worth
Pounds 2,000 - and that's not untypical as an export order for a small
company - you may be wiping out the profits of the sale anyway,' he says.
He also cites the example of an international bank which acted for both an
exporter and his customer. The London branch charged Pounds 250 for
confirming a letter of credit from the Hong Kong branch - in effect for
confirming its own paper.
Runiewicz says exporters need to think more carefully about letters of
credit. Banks may like them because they offer security, but they are not
always best, he says, for clinching an export sale and they add cost. Their
complexity also increases the risk of things going wrong.
'The exporter should assess country risk and bank risk,' he says. He thinks
trade within the European Union will increasingly be done on open account,
as in the UK.
Both Warwick-Smith and Palmer say the basic marketing principle of knowing
your customers and markets is what really matters. In some countries,
payment in advance may be the only safe way of doing business. Letters of
credit and export credit insurance may be necessary in others, but regular
customers who pay on time can earn the right to trade on open account
wherever they are.
Barclays now offers an on-line system for letters of credit and export
documentation, useful for companies with many transactions capable of
standardisation. There are also several stand-alone software packages
available. Generally, however, these systems are more useful for importers
wanting to open letters of credit in the UK.
For smaller businesses, simple checklists of what to do when a letter of
credit arrives in the post may be more useful than anything else. UK
clearing banks have their own versions, some better than others, so it is
worth collecting them. Sitpro, the Simpler Trade Procedures Board, an
independent agency supported by the Department of Trade and Industry, also
offers a checklist, which the Institute of Export is adopting under its own
logo to offer members.
Runiewicz recommends the human brain. 'Software and gizmos are all very
well, but they don't solve the fundamental problems,' he says. 'Giving
credit or not is a matter of judgment. Exporters can help themselves a lot
more. Letters of credit are like the instructions for making model aircraft.
They only work if you follow them properly.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Go east, young company -
The opportunites offered by the Polish privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and eastern Europe was opened to western
investment, not one of the world's biggest computer makers has set up or
bought manufacturing plants in the region.
Yet a small British company is on the verge of taking just such a step,
attracted by the low manufacturing costs and the quality of available
engineers. Metric Components, which makes electronic point-of-sale (Epos)
cash registers, will this week take management control of Temed SA, a
medical equipment factory based in Silesia, southern Poland, and owned by
the state.
The deal is high risk. Apart from anything else, Metric might find that
being removed from its main market makes it less responsive to its
customers, costing it more in lost sales than it gains from lower
manufacturing costs.
But Metric's deal does show that other smaller companies, which would
benefit from a lower manufacturing cost base, can join the largest companies
in buying privatised assets in eastern Europe.
Metric's Epos cash registers are akin to small computers, not only recording
transactions but helping the management of inventory and re-ordering. The
machines are designed in Basingstoke, England, the electronics come from Far
Eastern suppliers such as Lucky Goldstar, and the finished product is sold
mainly in the UK. Until this week the machines were manufactured under
contract in Poland.
Job Maats, Metric's Dutch chief executive, says the attraction of Temed  -
which is being sold through the Polish Privatisation Through Restructuring
programme - is the opportunity of cutting the cost of innovation.
About 90 per cent of the cost of making a mould for the plastic casing of
the cash tills is the cost of engineers. With Polish engineers costing 10
per cent of their western counterparts, the saving is substantial. As a
result, the risks involved in changing the design of a product are reduced
because smaller batch runs become economic, he says.
While the big computer companies have chosen not to move to eastern Europe,
Maats is not alone is extolling the attractions of the region. David Thomas,
director of Schroder Polska, the Polish subsidiary of merchant bankers
Schroders, says he is puzzled why more companies have not yet adopted the
approach.
'The Privatisation Through Restructuring programme is specifically focused
on the medium-sized companies in Poland,' he says. Under this programme, a
management group restructures and then privatises small and medium-sized
enterprises in return for a fee, profit sharing and a commission on the
transfer of shares to investors.
It contrasts with the Mass Privatisation Programme - in which 33 foreign and
domestic fund managers are being selected to run 600 state-owned companies.
'I have spoken at several conferences to try to open potential investors'
eyes to the possibilities of investing in Poland,' Thomas says. 'Poland has
had a reputation of being dominated by large industry.'
One reason for the relative lack of interest in smaller Polish companies is
a shortage of support for investors. The most comprehensive government
investment guarantee scheme for eastern Europe is provided by Germany. But
most of Germany's Mittelstand companies have been more interested in
manufacturing plant in the Czech Republic, on the doorstep of their domestic
market.
There are other obstacles in the way of buying a manufacturing base in
eastern Europe. Maats says it took at least 20 visits to negotiate the
purchase of Temed. He says no one should underestimate the demands such
deals make on top-level management time. 'It has taken me a year to do the
deal. I spent three years restructuring the Brazilian debt so I know
something about negotiation.'
The financial structures are often complicated. A similar deal to buy Elzab,
another Silesian state-owned company that makes mainframe computer monitors
for the Russian market, fell through because Metric could not get the banks
to agree the restructuring terms.
Maats eventually agreed a deal with the Ministry of Privatisation in which
Metric first takes management control and an option to buy Temed for Dollars
1m (Pounds 600m) within two years. Central to the deal was agreement from
Temed's banks that they would write off half their debt and waive the
substantial interest charge on the balance for a year.
Any company considering this route must contend with cultural differences
arising out of a history of central planning. Maats says this message came
home when Metric was developing a plan with Elzab's management, a team that
was once in charge of 2,500 people. 'It took us six weeks to realise the
people had only ever implemented a plan coming down from the central plan.
They had never initiated.'
Metric had one big advantage that many unquoted companies could not turn to:
a pile of cash. Last year, Maats reversed three companies, including the
Epos till company, into a quoted shell, raising more than Pounds 700,000 in
the process. But much of the leg-work was done before this cash was raised.
Nevertheless, buying a manufacturing base in eastern Europe is a route more
intrepid smaller companies might consider if they are well enough structured
to allow senior managers the time to negotiate deals. 'If someone has the
vision and a plan then Poland is ideal because the people are used to
implementing a prepared plan,' Maats says.
He says many factories, particularly in what is becoming known as Silesia
Valley, own large amounts of technology and sophisticated
computer-controlled machining centres. And because the factories were hugely
over-staffed, they have plenty of manufacturing space.
'The real advantage is that there is highly qualified manpower with a
historic infrastructure which you can use for making new things in new
ways,' he says. 'What was done in the Far East can now be done in eastern
Europe. There is better training, it is closer to market, no investment
problems and the finance is available more easily across the region.'
That is the theory. Time will tell whether Metric was right to go to Poland
or the big companies were right to eschew the region.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Technology: Bookmakers have a flutter - The betting industry
is trying out computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX GLASKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British bookies are having a flutter with new technology in an attempt to
win customers. Although the 9,800 off-course betting shops in the UK handle
a substantial part of the gambling industry's Pounds 8.5bn turnover, they
have been slow to become computerised. Bookmakers are not gamblers
themselves and their customers are conservative.
Interactive touch-screen bet vending machines are being tested in two shops
run by the small Hampshire chain of Betpoint and in two of Ladbroke Racing's
2,000 shops - in Dudley, West Midlands and Newcastle. Ladbroke's financial
director Paul Usher says that if they prove popular he could spend Pounds
10m 'quite easily and quite quickly' to install them throughout the country.
The Betpoint customer terminal is a touch-sensitive video screen, on-line to
a network of computers at the company's headquarters. The screen shows all
the sports for which betting is available; the user touches a sport option
to list all the relevant events. By choosing and touching, customers can get
down to a list of runners in a specific race. They can even read form detail
about horses, riders and trainers in race meetings.
Next, they choose the type of bet and the stake. Coins or notes go into a
slot and the machine prints out a betting slip. A human cashier pays out to
winners.
Betpoint managing director Chris Latter was a systems designer and formerly
head of computer services for commodity broker Philip Brothers. He believes
his customer touch-screens will cut staff and other costs. Combined with a
behind-the-counter computerised settling system, which ensures accurate
payout and helps the managers to assess their liabilities in real time, the
Betpoint package costs Pounds 150 a week. The average betting shop in the UK
turns over about Pounds 7,000 a week.
Usher does not see automation as a route to cutting staff: 'We are primarily
interested in improving customer service.'
Ladbroke is testing a modified version of the Betpoint system in two shops.
It also has a second, similar system, Form Challenge, that allows the
customer to enter his own knowledge of racing into the touch-screen terminal
and see a race simulation before placing a bet.
Form Challenge has been developed by UK software company ISP and uses form
data from CNS of Hull. It is partly aimed at attracting younger punters, who
are more familiar with video screens.
Bill Hagarth, IT director at William Hill, which has 1,700 shops, is
cautious about luring younger customers. 'The existing bet capture and
settling operation is extremely efficient,' he says. 'And we must not
alienate any of our customers.'
The most computerised betting organisation in the world is Britain's Tote,
the body responsible for managing on-course pooled betting at race meetings.
It must pay out winnings immediately, based on the total of all stakes
received right up to the race start. All of its 160 off-course shops, 64
on-course shops and its 160-strong operator telephone betting service are
networked to a Stratus mainframe in Wigan.
It has installed optical mark readers in 1,000 betting shops. Punters mark a
pre-printed multiple choice card, which the cashier feeds into the reader.
Within a second the data are in Wigan.
The Tote's IT manager Bob Cubitt says the organisation has dabbled with bet
vending machines but again there is caution about upsetting loyal customers:
'We all want to make betting exciting and fun. The technology is there but
the customer interface must be right.'
Will the punters even need to go into a betting shop? Already Betpoint sells
software for Pounds 20 that turns any PC with a modem running Windows into
an on-line betting terminal. Macintosh and Dos versions come out this
summer, as well as a hand-held console that does the same thing as a
domestic television set. Technology could make betting so easy that betting
shops disappear.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Technology: Apple launches second Newton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer, which missed the target with its first Newton hand-held
'personal digital assistant', is taking a second shot. Last week the company
launched a cheaper version that corrects some of the shortcomings of the
original product.
The Newton MessagePad 10 is a pocket-sized electronic pad on which users can
jot messages, diary entries, contact notes and the like, using a special
stylus.
Like the original, however, this product fails to live up to the
expectations created by Apple. Apple have made only incremental
improvements.
The new model is narrower and longer than the original, and has a cover to
protect the screen. It also has more memory, for data storage, and longer
battery life. The US price has dropped to Dollars 599 (Pounds 410) from
Dollars 699.
Most significantly, Apple has attempted to overcome Newton's notoriously
unreliable handwriting recognition capabilities.
Because users of the original Newton complained that they could not simply
jot down notes without having to correct misunderstandings, the new Newton
includes 'deferred handwriting recognition'. The user can scribble away and
then later go back to make corrections.
The new Newton can, when requested, attempt to recognise letters rather than
matching handwritten words with those in its dictionary. This is
particularly useful for names, acronyms, technical terms and abbreviations.
Still to come, however, are wireless communications facilities for the
Newton. Apple is working with Ardis and Ram Mobile, two US providers of
wireless data communications services.
The third Newton, due in September, will be a tablet-sized (approximately 14
in by 8 in) device with a screen twice as big as the pocket versions.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Technology: Drivers on the right track - A better sense of
direction will soon be widely available with electronic car navigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Japan's many mysteries is how to avoid becoming lost in Tokyo. The
characterless and poorly sign-posted Tokyo street plan, full of tangled
alleys and dead-ends, occasionally punctuated by raised expressways, is a
navigational nightmare for both locals and foreigners.
Help may be at hand, however. A satellite network launched by the US defence
department looks set to produce a consumer product revolution. Electronic
car navigation systems promise to help people who find it difficult to read
maps not only in the Japanese capital but throughout the world.
The network, known as the Global Positioning System (GPS), is based on 25
satellites which cover the globe. They were launched to help military
aircraft, ships and vehicles locate their position. A side benefit is that
they can be used to locate civilian vehicles.
The satellites, equipped with a precise atomic clock, transmit both the time
and their orbital position at regular intervals. A receiver in the vehicle
calculates its position by measuring the time it takes for the satellites'
signals to arrive. An on-board computer needs to receive data from three
satellites simultaneously to calculate the vehicle's position to within 30m.
A liquid crystal screen then displays a map of the local area and the
vehicle's position. The details for the map of Tokyo are taken from a CD-Rom
that supplies geographical details of the whole of Japan. As the car moves,
so its position is constantly updated. Some systems can show the
destination, the direction being taken, and the distance left to travel.
The driver can use a remote-control device to make the display zoom from
individual streets to a bird's-eye view of entire cities, regions and
highway networks. A talking help feature can even indicate when to change
direction.
The GPS system is not perfect. Jun Ichi Shibata, general manager of the new
media division at Pioneer, the Japanese electronics group, admits that in
heavily built-up areas tall buildings create reception problems. In the
worst cases, says Atsushi Matsuda, general manager of the mobile electronics
group at Sony, the receivers can obtain a fix only half of the time.
One way of improving accuracy is to use dead reckoning. A combination of
geomagnetic sensors or gyros can be used with speed sensors to determine the
distance and direction travelled by the vehicle.
Another system is to use beacons installed along the road to fix the car's
location. Some manufacturers have also developed software that uses the
premise that cars only drive on roads, and tries to match the road pattern
against the possible location of the car.
In spite of these other systems, both Sony and Pioneer, which dominate the
sector with more than 90 per cent market share, expect GPS to become the
dominant technology, not least because of its relatively low cost. The
cheapest retrofit systems can be installed for as little as Y145,000 (Pounds
923) including a 4 in liquid crystal display. Top-end equipment costs as
much as Y600,000.
Sales growth of car navigation systems has been explosive, though from a low
base, says Shibata. Only 9,000 units were installed in 1991, but sales could
reach 250,000 this year. His company reckons the market was worth about
Y50bn during the 12 months to March 31 last year.
Sony and Pioneer control most of the retrofit market, but the original
equipment market - supplying navigation systems to vehicle manufacturers -
is much more fragmented. Suppliers include Alpine, Kenwood, Clarion, Nippon
Denso, Aishin, Mitsubishi Electric, Sumitomo Denko, Toshiba and Matsushita.
Although the Japanese Navigation Association has set up two standards, few
of the competing systems are compatible. Without economies of scale, the
cost of developing software remains high, says Matsuda. This could limit
market growth, he warns.
Both Pioneer and Sony believe that navigation systems could become extremely
significant consumer products if adequate software can be developed.
'In Japan we have high hopes for a large market to develop, given the
success of navigational systems already. Adding value to the maps will make
all the difference,' says Matsuda.
The Japanese government is sponsoring a beacon-based technology, the vehicle
information communication system (Vics), which could give the market a big
boost.
The system, which uses high frequency radio signals, is designed to provide
details of accidents, traffic conditions, weather, route recommendations and
even parking availability. The idea is that such information could be
incorporated on the digital maps.
Shibata says Vics will give a huge push to the market, although exactly when
the infrastructure will be completed remains unclear. Installation is under
way in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, and a nationwide system is being considered.
However, implementation is bogged down in discussions between the various
ministries involved. An alternative system based on personal communication
networks is being sponsored by the Tokyo police.
Vehicle navigation systems will soon be available outside Japan. Sony is
launching a system with Etak, a US-based group owned by Rupert Murdoch's
News Corporation which has supplied the digital maps. Pioneer expects that
it will launch navigation products in the US and Europe in 1995, although
the exact timing depends on the availability of software.
Sony says it is looking at how best to protect such expensive hardware from
theft. This is not a problem in the Japanese market, but could limit growth
in the US and Europe.
The prospects for 'gaijin' (foreigners) lost in Tokyo remains bleak,
however. Sony and Pioneer say the market for maps of Japan using roman
script is simply too small for software manufacturers to justify the
investment.

HOW TO ADVERTISE TO OLDER PEOPLE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Don't use models that are too young (not credible) or too old - people
  see themselves as 10-15 years younger than they are.
 -Show older people interacting with younger generations in real
  situations, active and enjoying what they are doing.
 -Information and facts are appreciated: cute puns and obscure
  abstractions are not.
 -No hype, no loud music, no quick cuts - but don't cut out genuine
  emotions and feelings.
 -Adopt an adult-to-adult tone of voice - people tend to acquire
  wisdom with age, not lose it.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
20 POINTS ABOUT AGEING IN EUROPE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1.  Two out of three over-65s who have ever lived are alive today.
  2.  There are around 330m people aged 65 or over alive today. By 2050
      there will be 1.4bn.
  3.  The world's oldest country is Sweden: 18 per cent of Swedes are
      65 or over.
  4.  The average European woman of child-bearing age produces 1.7
      children. Around 2.1 children are required to replace the
      population.
  5.  If Germany's fertility rate remains at its current level (1.3)
      its native population will be extinct within 300 years.
  6.  Ireland and Iceland are the only western European countries with
      fertility rates high enough to sustain their populations.
  7.  The country with the lowest fertility rate in western Europe is
      Italy.
  8.  Europeans currently account for almost a tenth of the world's
      population. In 2050 they will be less than a fifth.
  9.  The number of over-65s in Europe will outstrip the number of
      children aged 14 and under around 2020.
 10.  More than 50m western Europeans are aged 65 or over - almost 15
      per cent of the population.
 11.  Of these, almost a quarter are aged 80 or over and 1 1/3m are
      90-plus.
 12.  By 2050 there will be 70m western European aget 65-plus - over 20
      per cent of the population.
 13.  A man living in the European Union aged 60 can expect to live
      until 78; a woman until 82 1/2.
 14.  Almost half the over-80s in the EU live alone.
 15.  There are roughly equal numbers of men and women aged 60 in
      western Europe. But women outnumber men two-to-one between 80 and
      84 and three-to-one between 90 and 94.
 16.  Less than 5 per cent of EU people in their sixties are severly
      incapacitated. Almost one in three in their eighties is
      incapacitated.
 17.  Over-60s in the EU would prefer to be called 'senior citizens' or
      'older people', according to a Eurobarmeter survey. They do not
      like to be called 'elderly', 'pensioners' or 'golden oldies'.
 18.  Real economic growth rates of up to 1.5 per cent a year are needed
      to pay the increasing bill for pensions over the next 15 years -
      more if pensions are to rise with earnings.
 19.  Public health spending for people aged 65 and over is more than
      four times higher per capita than for the under-65s.
 20.  Almost 80 per cent of EU citizens believe that that those in
      employment have a duty to ensure, through contributions or taxes,
      that older people have a decent standard of living.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Seaside break or whale watching at Cape
Cod - Saga holidays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four decades ago, a Kent hotelier called Mr Sidney De Haan decided the way
to fill rooms in the off-season was to offer cheap holidays to retired
people.
From this idea grew Saga, a group with a turnover in 1992-93 of Pounds 130m,
offering holidays, financial services and magazines to the over-60s.
Saga understood that the special needs of older customers could be a market
opportunity rather than a deterrent. Other hoteliers also struggled in the
off-season and they were prepared to offer Saga cheap rates for the package
holidays it began to sell.
On the customer side, no one was looking at what retired people needed on
holiday. They did not want to climb steep hills to get to their hotels and
they wanted someone to carry their suitcases.
Mr Roger De Haan, the founder's son, started out in the business carrying
older guests' luggage to their rooms at his father's hotel. He is now
chairman of the company.
Retired people are far wealthier than when the company started, he says.
They are also more experienced travellers. Saga still offers one-week
holidays at UK seaside resorts for as little as Pounds 100. But it also now
sells trekking holidays in the foothills of the Himalayas, whale watching
from Cape Cod and round-the-world cruises. Its most expensive round the
world trips sell for Pounds 30,000.
Saga has a holiday business in the US, as well as the UK. American over-60s
are richer than their UK counterparts and prefer to stay in hotels whose
names they know, such as Hilton and Holiday Inn. Older British travellers
prefer local hotels, Mr De Haan says.
The group tried to offer Australian over-60s similar holidays, but that
venture failed. The Australian population is too small to support a mass
senior travellers' business.
Northern Europe is a better prospect, Mr De Haan says.
Saga is in discussions which could lead to it offering its services on the
Continent.
Saga's offerings now include financial services as well. It acts as an
insurance broker, finding motor, home and health insurance for the over-60s.
It is not often realised older people are a lower risk for insurers, Mr De
Haan says. They drive fewer miles and have fewer accidents. Because they are
at home more, they are less likely to be burgled. And when they make
insurance claims, they are usually more honest than young people, he says.
About half the 750 staff at the group's Folkstone's headquarters now work on
the financial services side.
Recession has had little effect on business. A more serious threat is low
interest rates, hitting the bank and building society income of retired
people.
Saga says sales of its low-cost UK holidays have been most affected. The
over-60s who go on expensive trips around the world still appear to have
money to spend.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Extending the price of dignity - Case
study: St. Bruno home / Growing old in Cologne is a genteel affair. But can
it last?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the occupants of the St Bruno home for the elderly in the German
Rhineside metropolis of Cologne, growing old is a relatively genteel affair.
Electronic doors whir open to ease wheelchair access. When the annual
carnival show took place in the packed dining room at the end of January,
the spectacle was transmitted to 70 bedridden residents by in-house
closed-circuit television.
The 180 elderly people receive exemplary attention from a roughly equal
number of well-qualified staff, including 59 nurses and five with a diploma
in sports education.
The centre, run by the Catholic charity organisation Caritas, boasts its own
pottery kiln, a cafe called Oasis and a spacious chapel where Mr Fritz
Einck, the 87-year-old resident priest, holds daily mass. Mr Einck helped
set up the home 10 years ago and is its most eminent resident.
'We don't want to be either a hospital or a ghetto,' he says. 'We offer a
real culture of growing old.'
It is a culture with which Germany as a whole is becoming distressingly
familiar. The country with Europe's most serious 'greying' problem is ageing
faster than it is developing the means to pay for the consequences.
Fees at the home range from DM2,700 a month for basic residential care to
DM4,600 for the 130 occupants needing intensive nursing. The most acute
cases pay DM860 on top of this. For most, payments are made directly from
social security. St. Bruno has no financing difficulties at present. In 10
years, that may be different. The inmates are shielded from the pressures of
financial arithmetic. Some have no idea of the degree of care lavished on
them. More than 60 are registered as mentally 'confused'.
The home was built for people aged between 65 and 75. In the last decade,
according to Mr Siegfried Apolinarski, the director, the average age has
risen to 84. The oldest is 102. Ten years ago, most occupants came to St
Bruno as part of a transition from life at home. Now, most occupants make
their entry from hospital. Originally, 80 patients were acute nursing cases;
now the figure is 60 per cent higher. Each year between 40 and 45 die.
The centre, one of seven Caritas homes in Cologne, lays on an ambitious
programme of lectures and entertainment. 'We have to offer a wide range of
activities,' Mr Apolinarski says. 'We've got some people here with
doctorates.'
However, over afternoon coffee in the dining room, Mr Robert Kaulbarch, a
fit- and irritable-looking 85-year-old, laments the lack of intellectual
stimulus: 'Many people here are round the bend.' Mrs Katharine Buschwald, a
93-year-old ex-bookkeeper, takes a more charitable view: 'I never thought
about getting old . . . Now I am content.'
St Bruno's residents are living out their last years, at best, in dignity,
at worst, without being aware of the decay of their bodies and minds.
Maintaining this service depends on increasing resources flowing from the
active sectors of the population. The pain of growing old will soon be
shared by those for whom a move to St Bruno's is decades away.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Can Europe Competer: Tensions on health care and pensions -
Welfare State
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The greatest impact of the ageing of Europe will be felt on the welfare
state, the cost of which is already putting pressure on the public finances
and international competitiveness of much of western Europe.
The OECD estimates the pension burden could double over the next 50 years,
through a combination of an ageing population and the increasing coverage of
pension schemes.
Over the same period, the number of western Europeans of working age will
drop by more than 15 per cent, leaving fewer people to generate the wealth
to pay for pensions.
The tensions will be most acute in Germany, where there will be barely more
than two people of working age for each person over 65 by 2040. Under
current arrangements, social costs would climb from 33 per cent of GDP to
more than 50 per cent, says Mr Heino Fassbender of the Frankfurt office of
McKinsey, the management consultants.
Mr Fassbender predicts such increases will strain the inter-generational
contract under which those in work pay taxes to finance the welfare state
for those who have retired.
'We are heading towards the point when it will be impossible for our
pay-as-you-go system to finance pensions and health care for the elderly,'
he says.
The social security contributions paid by German employers and employees
have already risen steeply to almost 40 per cent of the wage bill. Resultant
higher employment costs are now widely seen as a factor in the country's
declining competitiveness.
Some steps have been taken to curb increases, including limiting the rate at
which pensions rise and raising the retirement age. Pensions are already 20
per cent lower than they otherwise would have been, says Professor Jens
Alber of Konstanz university.
But there is little chance of winning support for more radical measures,
says Prof Alber: 'The present system is endorsed by 80 to 90 per cent of
people in opinion polls, even if it involves much higher contribution
rates.'
And the government has recently agreed to a potentially costly extension of
the welfare state with the introduction of a scheme for care of the elderly.
Until now, this has been the responsibility of families.
'While people know about the demographic trends, they don't yet appreciate
the costs,' says Ms Stephanie Wahl of the Bonn-based Institut fur Wirtschaft
und Gesellschaft. 'The government is reluctant to enlighten them, because it
would raise fears in the electorate in the run-up to October's general
election.'
The Institut advocates a switch away from the current earnings-related
pension scheme. Instead it recommends greater private savings for
retirement, with a flat-rate pension as a safety net for those unable to
support themselves.
This solution is backed by Mr Fassbender: 'Sooner or later, people will
realise the need to increase the amount they set aside to live on in
retirement,' he says.
Similar pressures will be felt across much of Europe as the population ages.
Most countries are pruning their welfare states in ways that will encourage
greater private provision.
Countries such as the UK and the US which have already encouraged private
pension provision will find it easier to promote a continuing switch away
from public provision.
And countries like the US and Australia, which are more open to immigration,
face less serious demographic problems as younger migrants arrive and start
families. Until the current recession, immigration has reduced the rate of
Germany's population decline, bringing over 3m new inhabitants in the last
three years.
'There would be resistance to the arrival of more immigrants with current
levels of unemployment,' says Prof Alber. 'But as the economy recovers and
there is again a shortage of labour, further immigration might be
acceptable.'
But countries imposing the lowest welfare costs on businesses stand to gain
most from a decline in Europe's competitiveness as the population ages.
These will include the rapidly industrialising countries of Latin America
and Asia with their young and growing workforces.
But it could also include the more mature economies of east Asia, which are
emphasising the responsibility of families in caring for older relatives.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Fresh thinking needed on old labour
problem - Employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the more dramatic demographic projections are to be believed, European
employers will have to perform a U-turn in their attitude towards older
workers in the next 10 to 15 years. Companies which have been trying to
persuade 53-year-olds to take early retirement will be trying to persuade
70-year-olds to stay on a few more years.
One issue is 'eldercare' - allowing older employees to fit their work around
caring for elderly relatives. Others include introducing a 'flexible decade
of retirement' (allowing people gradually to reduce their working time) and
redesigning jobs for the older worker.
Curiously, European companies have been doing little to reform their
recruitment and retention practices with a greyer future in mind. The
overwhelming trend is still towards early exit for the older worker,
according to most analysts of ageing and employment.
One exception is the UK Do-It-Yourself retailer B&amp;Q, which has deliberately
targetted older people as employees. It has found a big improvement in
performance, with better customer service, less time off sick and less
pilfering.
Eurolink Age, a European network concerned with older people, says that
employer thinking about older workers is driven more by short-termism than
by ingrained prejudice. When labour markets were tighter in the late 1980s
some companies did start to think about holding on to older staff for
hard-headed business reasons. 'But that interest went on the back-burner
during the recession, when labour supply was not really an issue,' says Ms
Dorothy Berry-Lound of the Host Consultancy.
As for eldercare policies, Ms Berry-Lound says very few European companies
have thought much about them, comparing poorly with large US companies in
this respect. Notable exceptions include car companies Ford and
Daimler-Benz, which offer career breaks of up to 12 months and flexible
working time to carers. In the UK, the BBC has established a support group
for employees caring for older relatives, and the big clearing banks are
also now offering carer packages.
People who have to combine work with caring for an elderly person often
suffer from stress which may affect productivity and performance at work.
Such employees may also need to take days off work at short notice, leave
work early (or arrive late), and may need time during working hours to talk
on the telephone. Much of this is a cost to companies, which many feel they
do not need to bear at present.
On job redesign and career development, continental European companies seem
to be leading the way. Madame Francoise Doppler, a personnel manager at
France's Aerospatiale, says that the company has analysed its workforce in
terms of age, health and career structures. It has redesigned the content of
certain jobs and is using more workers in a training/teaching capacity.
Renault, where the average age of the workforce has risen recently to nearly
45, is taking a similar initiative.
The flexible decade of retirement is more talked about than practised,
although the privatised utilities in the UK have been taking some steps in
this direction. The inflexibility of pension arrangements, especially with
pay-as-you-go pension schemes in countries like Germany, can make this a
complex option. There are fewer problems with funded schemes such as
employers' pensions in the UK.
Despite growing exhortation by government and lobby groups, however, the
activity rate of older workers in Europe is likely to continue falling until
companies are again hit by a shortage of labour. Early retirement of older
employees, often near the top of the earnings ladder, will always look
tempting as long as there is a continuing supply of younger, cheaper
workers.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: With a greyer picture of the future in
mind - The ageing of Europe's population poses big challenges for the state
and the marketplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While there are few trends which can be forecast with confidence over
decades, there is one prediction that can safely be made about the countries
of western Europe. Their populations will grow much older over the next 40
years.
In the 18 western European member states of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, the number of people aged 65 and over will
rise from 50m to more than 70m between 1990 and 2030.
During the same period, the number of people of working age will fall. The
result is that, by 2030, there will be fewer than three people of working
age in these countries for each person over 65, compared with five now.
Similar trends can be seen in other leading world economies, such as the US
and Japan. The populations of the tigers of the Pacific Rim, such as
Singapore and Taiwan, are also ageing fast.
But newly industrialising countries, such as China, India and Brazil, will
have a much lower share of elderly people in their populations over the next
40 years.
Economists predict the ageing of the population in European countries will
have an enormous impact on their economies and their international
competitiveness. But there is little agreement over what the impact will be,
according to Dr Paul Johnson of the London School of Economics.
'Demographic restructuring could alter patterns of consumption, production,
employment, savings, investment and innovation,' he says. 'But because of
the interactions between these separate elements, it is impossible to be
sure of either the scale or, in some cases, the direction of the economic
impact. Our understanding of the processes of economic growth and of
innovation is too primitive to make long-term predictions.'
This uncertainty extends even to the question of whether an ageing
population will save more (to provide for old age), or save less as the
elderly cash in their nest-eggs in retirement. A trend towards lower savings
rates could threaten economic growth in countries with more rapidly ageing
populations.
A series of theoretical studies has suggested that there will be a decline
in the savings rate as the population ages. Yet, according to Professor
Claus Zimmermann of Munich university, there is clear evidence from all over
Europe that the ageing population is saving more.
'We are not clear why older people save so much,' he says, 'but they do.'
The economic consequences of ageing will be felt unevenly in Europe, as some
countries face more radical demographic change than others.
The greatest impact will be felt in Germany, where the population will
decline by about 15m between now and 2030. Today, a fifth of the population
is 20 or younger and another fifth 60 or over. By 2030, only 16 per cent
will be under 20, 46 per cent will be between 20 and 60, and 38 per cent
over 60.
If ageing leads to any sort of competitive disadvantage, then demography
could favour the economic performance of countries such as the UK and the
US, where ageing will be less radical.
But globally it would be the newly industrialising countries, such as China
and Brazil, which would gain the greatest competitive advantage from
demographic change. For the first half of the 21st century, they will have
much younger populations than the economies of Europe, Japan and north
America.
Whatever the uncertainty over the overall economic impact of ageing,
predictions can be made about its consequences in some economic sectors.
One is the much tighter labour market which will result as the number of
people of working age shrinks. Employers will no longer be able to count on
a flow of young people to meet their staff needs.
They will have to hold on to existing staff longer, rather than letting them
go at retirement age or discharging them early as is now common. There will
be pressure to increase the percentage of working age people actually in
work - notably women who have left work to have children.
Business will have to cope with changes in demand patterns as older
consumers become more significant in their markets and younger people less
so. Mintel, the UK market research organisation, says 'third age consumers'
are emerging as a distinctive group keen to spend more on leisure, holidays
and healthcare.
This group will increasingly want to make individual provision for their
pensions as cuts in welfare benefits reduce state support. That will boost
financial services companies offering personal pensions and other suitable
savings products.
'The European advertising industry is just beginning to think about
addressing the older consumer,' according to Ms Danielle Barr of 3rd Age
Marketing in London. 'There are phenomenal opportunities for companies which
recognise the growing importance of this market and can succeed in it.'
If European businesses do not recognise the opportunities, many US
competitors will. American businesses have long recognised the importance of
selling to older people, says Ms Frankie Cadwell of Cadwell Davies Partners,
a New York advertising firm.
Cadwell Davis, a subsidiary of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group,
specialises in selling to the over-50s, among the wealthiest consumers in
the US.
'We are interested in bringing expertise on products and services in the
mature market to Europe,' Ms Cadwell says. 'European companies haven't begun
to address their ageing home markets as we have in the US.'
Why that should be so is hard to explain. For, while there are many
uncertainties in longer-term planning of business strategy, one fact is
certain. The customers will be much older in 40 years than they are now.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Maxwell pension ruling fought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 235m legal dispute between the Maxwell pensioners and the
administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation was taken to the Court
of Appeal yesterday.
The liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the former manager of
the Maxwell pension funds, are arguing that the pensioners should have the
right in principle to receive all proceeds up to Pounds 235m resulting from
the sales of businesses that were part of MCC.
MCC was the largest of the quoted companies run by Robert Maxwell.
If successful, the challenge would lead to a significant change in
insolvency case law and could fundamentally alter how the MCC administrators
repay creditors.
A further hearing would be necessary for BIM to prove its entitlement to the
Pounds 235m. If this were successful, it would reduce the amount available
to other unsecured creditors.
At present, the administrators propose treating BIM in the same manner as
other creditors, through the payment of dividends raised by the sale of MCC
businesses.
Total assets available for distribution to unsecured creditors was said by
the administrators last month to exceed Pounds 680m. Unsecured claims exceed
Pounds 2.1bn. The bulk of unsecured creditors are banks and other financial
institutions.
In December, a High Court judge sitting in closed court rejected the
arguments of BIM lawyers and ruled that the scheme proposed by the
administrators could continue. Yesterday, Mr Philip Heslop QC, for BIM,
argued for the decision of Mr Justice Vinelott to be overturned.
Although BIM was unable to fully trace the pension fund money concerned, it
should still have a proprietary claim to the MCC assets that would have to
be met before those of other unsecured creditors, he said.
He argued that since MCC benefited from the alleged misappropriation of
pension fund assets, unsecured creditors had benefited from a 'swelling' of
the company's assets and that any payments to them would amount to
'windfalls'.
The hearing is due to end this week. Judgment is expected to be reserved. It
is thought the issue may go to the House of Lords for a final decision.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Unions may sponsor Lib Dems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidates may one day accept sponsorship
from trade unions, Mr Alex Carlile, the party's employment spokesman, said
yesterday. The party and the Trades Union Congress are to hold their first
official meeting today.
'I would not want candidates to be beholden to a union but sponsorship by
unions is certainly on the agenda,' he said.
The meeting between the two organisations follows an invitation from Mr
Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, but builds on several months of
informal contact.
The meeting is important to both organisations more for the signals it sends
to others, rather than for the substance of the discussion.
The TUC has shifted in the direction of the Liberal Democrats on many
industrial relations issues during the past five to 10 years.
'Ten years ago we would still have opposed strike ballots, works
council-type bodies for representing workers' views, and the European
Community - now we join the Liberal Democrats in embracing them all,' said a
TUC official.
The Liberal Democrats have won TUC approval for strongly supporting the
social dimension of the European Union and the restoration of union rights
at GCHQ, the government's communications monitoring base at Cheltenham.
Some TUC officials have even suggested that the party has better policies on
full employment and employee involvement than Labour.
But some union leaders - in particular Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe of Unison, the
public services union - have expressed reservations about an official
meeting so close to the local elections.
The TUC has impressed Liberal Democrats in its attempt to distance itself
from the Labour party. 'The organisation has been trying to de-politicise
itself and has made some progress,' Mr Carlile said.
The meeting helps the TUC's attempt to become a more politically neutral
lobby organisation for those at work. Its links with Labour have won it
little influence in the past 15 years. The TUC is also aware that about 25
per cent of its members voted Liberal Democrat at the last election.
Differences remain over such issues as the minimum wage policy and union
recognition rights, but it is in the interests of both organisations to
maintain friendly relations. A new Liberal Democrat employment policy paper,
due soon, will be closely scrutinised in Congress House.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Coal chief warns bidders of risk: Claim that sell-off will
cause casualties angers private-sector mining groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Potential bidders for British Coal were given a stark warning by the
corporation chairman yesterday that some producers seem certain to be
'squeezed from the market' after the industry's privatisation.
Mr Neil Clarke said there would be fierce competition on supply between the
buyers of the five regions of British Coal, the leasors of pits already
closed by British Coal and importers. The scope for expanding existing sales
outside the electricity supply market was only about 3m tonnes.
'This is not likely to be a war without casualties,' he told a monthly
meeting of the Coal Industry Society. 'It would seem inevitable that
ultimately some producers will be squeezed from the market.'
Mr Clarke also said that reductions in British Coal's capacity brought
supply and demand far closer to a sustainable balance. This suggests such a
balance has yet to be achieved and will reinforce fears that there will be
more closures among the 17 remaining pits before privatisation.
Mr Clarke's comments were greeted with surprise and anger by private-sector
miners. Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining, which has already
re-opened one pit closed by British Coal and may bid for one of the five
regions, said private-sector mines were well used to competition.
Another private-sector miner described Mr Clarke's speech as churlish. 'If
British Coal had got its costs down as it should have done the market now
would be much bigger.'
Separately, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said the government
would have to adopt a more commercial approach to the privatisation of
British Coal if taxpayers were to get value for money from the sale.
It criticised proposals that bidders for coal rights should pay a lump sum
rather than a royalty on each tonne of coal extracted. The institution said
that the freehold of coal and colliery land should remain with the coal
authority.
In his speech, Mr Clarke defended British Coal's marketing, saying it was
recovering business by, for example, supplying coking coal for British Steel
in south Wales. British Coal expected to maintain its market share this year
in spite of colliery closures.
Outside the electricity industry and coking coal, sales of coal in the UK
next year would be about 13m tonnes of which British Coal would supply at
least 9m tonnes. Some imports could not be displaced because of quality
factors, so the maximum scope for expanding sales would be about 3m tonnes.
Production from up to 10 pits being leased out could be more than 3m tonnes
a year, he said. Most of this is being aimed at the non-electricity and
coking coal markets.
Mr Clarke said the expansion in British Coal's range and volume of products
would continue.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Brown hits at Tory policy on jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, yesterday said that Britain would be the
only country at the jobs summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations next week to press a policy of industrial de-regulation.
'The philosophy toward the unemployed of 'pile them high and sell them
cheap' - the exclusive reliance on de-regulation dogma - has not worked and
will not work,' Mr Brown said. He said the government was still 'trying to
export de-regulation at the moment - at a time when even America has
rejected it'.
Mr Brown accused the government of behaving like 'wreckers' in opposing
proposals for co-ordinated action on economic growth and job creation across
the western world. He said British ministers were 'negative and carping'
towards an investment strategy to reduce unemployment, and were pandering to
the free-market policies of the Tory right wing.
Mr Brown was commenting on the government's jobs strategy before a G7 summit
in Detroit next week hosted by President Bill Clinton.
The summit - which will be attended by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
and Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary - reflects the Clinton
administration's determination to look for concerted solutions to the rising
level of unemployment in the developed world.
The shadow chancellor plans to be in Washington on the eve of the summit to
promote Labour's ideas for a G7-wide approach to unemployment problems. In
particular, he will be calling for:
A pan-European cut in interest rates and the creation of a European Recovery
Fund.
The rejection of de-regulation as a 'miracle cure' and the adoption of
policies to increase employer and employee investment in training.
A series of fresh jobs initiatives, including the waiving of National
Insurance con-tributions for employers who take on the long-term unemployed
and the creation of a transnational University for Industry.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Anti-smoking aids on NHS urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anti-smoking aids should be available on National Health Service
prescriptions and some of the money raised by tobacco tax should be used for
community-based health education, the Policy Studies Institute argues in a
report published today.
The independent think-tank argues for a link between tobacco control
strategy and family welfare policy.
It says the government's policy of raising tobacco tax at twice the rate of
inflation is likely to reduce cigarette consumption among the majority but
has no effect on those least able to afford to smoke.
Smoking is greatest among the most disadvantaged families, the report says.
Nearly three-quarters of council tenants receiving means-tested benefits
smoke, spending Pounds 16 a week - or Pounds 1 in every Pounds 7 of their
net disposable income.

<TEXT>
More than 170 of the Bank of England's 185 computer staff are to be balloted
on whether to hold a series of one-day strikes after the Bank proposed a new
pay structure for computer staff and a 1 per cent pay increase.
The ballot follows the decision by computer staff to reject management
offers for restructuring pay scales, which Bifu, the banking union, says
will mean that some people will not get a pay rise this year. The Bank,
which also wants to introduce performance pay, said two-thirds of the
workforce had accepted the offer.

FT  08 MAR 94 / College lecturer wins race bias case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A technical college carried out institutional discrimination and
victimisation 'in the truest sense' against a black lecturer, an industrial
tribunal has ruled, Lisa Wood writes.
The Commission for Racial Equality said yesterday that Mr Stanley Jenkins'
complaints of racial abuse from students were disbelieved by Thanet
Technical College in Broadstairs, Kent. When Mr Jenkins started industrial
tribunal proceedings under the Race Relations Act the college started an
inquiry into his teaching performance.
The tribunal said: 'It was a manifestly unfair attempt to put pressure on Mr
Jenkins to curtail his proceedings.'
The award for damages to Mr Jenkins, who is still employed by the college,
has yet to be set.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Consumer credit drop signals belt-tightening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tentative evidence that consumers are tightening their belts before April
tax rises was provided yesterday by figures showing a sharp drop in consumer
credit in January. Net lending to consumers fell to a seasonally-adjusted
Pounds 235m, from Pounds 425m in December.
The Central Statistical Office said the main reason for the drop was a
decline in net lending by finance houses from Pounds 384m in December to
Pounds 255m in January. Consumers also repaid Pounds 6m of credit card debt
in January, after borrowing Pounds 36m in December.
Ignoring debt repayment, new credit advanced to consumers in January was
Pounds 4.74bn, down from Pounds 4.93bn in December.
However, this finding appears to contradict Finance and Leasing Association
figures, also released yesterday, which showed a 37 per cent year-on-year
rise in gross credit (ignoring repayments) in January.
The association's figures are taken from a wider base than those provided by
the CSO.
Mr Tony Mallin, chairman of the association, said: 'The tax increases
scheduled for April have not yet dented consumers' willingness to make
financial commitments for several years ahead.'
The association's figures do show a 6 per cent fall in lending between
December and January, but unlike the CSO statistics, its totals are not
seasonally adjusted.
A number of recent economic statistics covering December and January have
been erratic, indicating the problems of monitoring activity over the
Christmas period. If the figures over the three months to January are
aggregated, net lending is Pounds 980m, compared with Pounds 993m in the
previous three months.
Mr John Major, interviewed on BBC Radio yesterday, said that UK inflation
was likely to stay at around 3 per cent. The most recent figure for headline
inflation was 2.5 per cent in the year to January, while underlying
inflation (excluding mortgage payments) was 2.8 per cent.
Mr Major said: 'On almost any measure, we have inflation around 3 per cent.
It has been there for a year and there's no significant likelihood of that
materially changing in the near future.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Multimedia sewer trip offered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A computer company is offering 'surrogate' trips into dirty, difficult and
dangerous environments as its contribution to the multimedia revolution.
The Rothwell Group of Hampshire is offering the service on standard personal
computers. The company, which has an annual turnover of more than Pounds
20m, is expanding into providing applications for business.
Under the title BeingThere, Rothwell is offering tailor-made interactive
packages costing between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 70,000. Possibilities
include detailed visual tours around oil rigs for new employees, an
introduction to Wembley stadium for special constables, and detailed guides
to the London Underground and sewer system for emergency workers.
BeingThere, produced in a partnership with CyberGraphics, offers the user
the choice of, for example, which way to 'walk' around an oil rig, or which
piece of machinery to zoom in on.
CyberGraphics, which specialises in surrogate travel, has produced trips
around oil rigs and a destroyer for the Royal Navy as well as geographical
profiles of border areas in Germany for the British army.
The company uses a former BBC producer, Mr Don Selwyn Gilbert, whose work
includes documentaries on the Tudor ship the Mary Rose, to carry out
detailed filming before his work is turned into digital software.
Mr Mark Compton-Hall of Rothwell admitted that so far the sale of multimedia
products in the UK had been 'singularly unspectacular'.
He said the main reason was that 'suppliers have spent too much effort
demonstrating how technically clever their products are and failing to focus
on pragmatic business solutions'.
BeingThere, which so far has attracted expressions of interest rather than
sales, is the first of what Rothwell hopes will be a series of multimedia
applications for business.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Councils in Wales divide over reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the reform of local government in England is in disarray, the bill to
reorganise councils in Wales is proceeding through its parliamentary stages.
The principle of unitary authorities to replace the existing two-tier
structure has been broadly accepted in Wales, but the means of creation is
arousing fierce disagreement.
'A fundamentally flawed reorganisation,' says the Assembly of Welsh
Counties, echoing demands that first there should be an elected all-Wales
assembly.
Unlike the Scottish reform bill, now at its Commons committee stage, the
local government (Wales) bill was introduced in the Lords, which gave it its
third reading yesterday.
The government hopes it will have its first Commons reading this month and
become law before the summer recess. If so, the eight county councils in
Wales and 37 districts will be replaced by 21 unitary authorities in April
1996.
This is a year later than proposed a year ago by a white paper - like
Scotland, but unlike England, no commission roved the principality to
ascertain local views. But the bill has survived the Lords almost unscathed;
the most exciting moment was when the Lords defeated the government by
voting to keep the name Powys, rather than Mid Wales.
The financial benefits of the reform are highly uncertain. Estimates of the
transitional costs by consultants for the government range from Pounds 65m
to Pounds 150m over 15 years. Whereas district councils believe there could
be eventual savings of Pounds 17m a year, the counties estimate additional
annual costs of Pounds 6m.
The initial costs, and potential savings, will depend largely on
redundancies. Welsh councils have nearly 100,000 full-time and 60,000
part-time staff, and predictions of between 10,000 and 30,000 job losses
have been made. The Welsh Office white paper made no redundancy estimates,
although Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, has said the 'vast majority' of
staff will transfer to the new authorities.
The county councils are predictably pressing for fewer than 21 authorities
and the districts for more. A more neutral note is struck by Mr Graham Hall,
chief executive of Wales Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry: 'Business people
are happy to have unitary authorities, but the general view is there should
be no more than 15 to provide a strategic view for economic development.'
The Confederation of British Industry in Wales shares the view that
authorities need to be large enough to carry clout, and supports a campaign
for a greater Cardiff, rather than splitting South Glamorgan into separate
authorities for the city and Vale of Glamorgan.
In spite of the arguments about size and boundaries, accusations of
gerrymandering have been limited, mainly because no reorganisation could do
much to improve the Conservatives' mandate in the principality. An analysis
of last year's county elections by the Cardiff Institute of Higher Education
showed Labour would control or be the main party in 16 of the new
authorities, and the Tories in none.
The bill's main effect has been to rally support for a Wales assembly to
counter further centralisation of power in the Welsh Office and the quangos.
Mr Redwood opposes an assembly as another tier of government, but a Labour
move to create one was only narrowly defeated in the Lords.
'We take the view it is a bad bill - a prerequisite is that there should be
an elected tier at regional level,' says Mr Hugh Thomas, secretary of the
Assembly of Welsh Counties. Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party also pressing
for an assembly, says: 'The powers of the local authorities are to be
drastically reduced in all sorts of ways - reduced to being an agent rather
than an executive authority.'
The government has made a concession over the reserve powers of the Welsh
secretary to appoint members to a joint authority. The members would now
come from the authorities concerned. Mr Redwood also conceded there could be
about 1,250 councillors, 150 more than first mooted (compared with 1,900
today).
In geographically large authorities, he proposes the management of local
services could be delegated to area committees although this has been
described by the Council of Welsh Districts as 'a recipe for confusion'.
Opponents of the bill are taking a pragmatic view to seek more concessions.
Mr David Jenkins, general secretary of Wales Trades Union Council, says: 'We
remain strongly critical of the proposals. We think they are seriously
flawed with no provision for an all-Wales tier, but also because the
councils will become enabling authorities as opposed to providing
authorities.
'However, we equally recognise that the reform of local government was
necessary.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Housing starts increase by 16%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of new homes started by builders is still well ahead of the
levels of 12 months ago, according to figures published yesterday by the
Department of the Environment.
Builders, started work on 41,000 houses and flats - allowing for seasonal
adjustments - during the three months to the end of January. This was 16 per
cent more than the corresponding period a year earlier.
The rise is from a very low base and compares with a deeply depressed
housing market at the end of 1992 after Britain's withdrawal from the
European exchange rate mechanism. Since then there has been a steady rise in
house building although the increase in general house sales has been less
marked.
Private and public-sector house starts last year rose by 18.5 per cent, the
first annual increase since 1988.
Private-sector starts for the three months to the end of January fell by 1
per cent compared with the previous three months but were 27 per cent higher
than the corresponding period a year earlier.
Work began on 31,900 private-sector homes - accounting for three-quarters of
all starts made by builders.
Starts made on housing association homes - most of the rest of the market -
were marginally higher than the previous three months but 8 per cent lower
than the corresponding period 12 months ago.
Spending by housing associations is expected to fall this year following
public-spending cuts announced in the Budget.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, one of Britain's biggest
housebuilders, said yesterday: 'The environment department figures confirm
the uplift we are currently witnessing which we expect to continue on the
basis that affordability in real terms is at its lowest for at least a
decade.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Watchdog seeks views on power pool proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Offer, the electricity regulator, has started formal consultations on making
what would be the most significant changes to the power trading system in
England and Wales since privatisation four years ago.
It is seeking the industry's views on changing the bidding mechanism by
which prices are determined in the electricity pool, where virtually all
electricity is traded. Offer also wants opinions on allowing electricity
companies to trade outside the pool for the first time.
Either change would have significant implications for power companies'
profits and, to a lesser extent, for their customers. Some industrial users
have suffered significant power price rises since privatisation, although
the industry insists that they are a minority.
Progress of the changes would be closely monitored by the dozens of other
countries that are following the UK's example in privatising power, albeit
in different ways in almost all cases.
Consideration of change in the England and Wales trading system follows
criticism that it is too complex and open to manipulation by National Power
and PowerGen, the two largest generators.
In a consultation document Offer says that in many respects the pool has
worked well, ensuring that electricity demands have been met and bills paid.
Yet it notes that if trading were allowed outside the pool, individual
generators and customers could develop more efficient or less uncertain
patterns of running plant and pricing electricity.
Trading outside the pool could be less complex and time-consuming. Giving
participants a choice of trading arrangements would also give the pool
greater incentive to reform and cut costs to a minimum, Offer suggests.
The document also notes that it could be argued that this change would make
it easier for generators to influence prices. A thinner market might lead to
greater uncertainty for the market as a whole, it adds.
In the pool itself, Offer wants the market to consider a system by which
generators would be paid the prices they bid for each generating plant.
Under existing arrangements generators are paid the marginal price - the
price bid for the most expensive plant needed to run the system.
Supporters of the suggested bid system argue that prices would be less
dependent on the bidding strategies of a few generators and less sensitive
to the pool's price-setting software. Offer notes, however, that the
suggested system could lead to flatter pool prices. This could reduce
incentives to manage demand.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Heseltine wants Channel 5 decision delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has written to the
Department of National Heritage calling for a delay in the decision on
Channel 5's approval.
Mr Heseltine, it is believed, has argued that the decision should be
postponed until a government review of cross-media ownership rules has been
completed. This is unlikely before the summer.
Supporters of a fifth television channel, which would use existing analogue
technology, fear that the DTI wants to kill the idea of the channel and
reserve all the available frequencies for the development of digital
television services.
However, it was Lord Young, a predecessor of Mr Heseltine at the DTI, who
championed the idea of the channel to increase competition in the television
advertising market.
Last month the Independent Television Commission came out in favour of
re-advertising the franchise for the channel, which could reach
three-quarters of the UK population provided the government guaranteed that
the necessary frequencies would be available.
A number of large media groups are interested in the channel including NBC,
the US network company; CLT, the Luxembourg-based international broadcaster;
and a consortium which groups Time Warner of the US, MAI, the company that
controls Meridian, the ITV broadcaster for the south of England, and
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.
Later this week Mr Gary Tonge, controller of engineering at the ITC, will
argue that there is no real conflict between launching a conventional
Channel 5 and developing digital services over normal land-based
transmitters as opposed to satellite or cable networks.
Mr Tonge and the ITC will point out that the existence of Channel 5 would
have a minimal effect on digital television.
Support for a conventional Channel 5 ranges from advertising organisations
to independent producers.
Mr David Puttnam, the film producer, is among those who support the channel.
It would, he believes, help to develop a secondary market for programme
makers in the UK.
The heritage department says it will decide in the next two or three months.
Last week Mr David Mellor, the former heritage secretary, suggested
broadcasting policy was now being made in the trade and industry department
rather than in the Department of National Heritage.
'The poor old DNH is being dragged along behind like Winnie the Pooh, being
bumped up the stairs on his head, in the wake of a resurgent Christopher
Robin,' Mr Mellor wrote.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Rethink urged in counties review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two politics professors have called for a pause in the English local
government review due to be finished by the end of this year, because the
process is now 'fundamentally flawed'.
They say an all-party conference should discuss how to change track.
In England, the Local Government Commission is recommending that the current
two-tier structure of counties and districts be changed into all-purpose
authorities.
But Professor George Jones, of the London School of Economics, and Professor
John Stewart of Birmingham University's Institute of Local Government
Studies, argue in the Local Government Chronicle that the way ahead should
be unitary status for large towns and cities, with slight revisions to the
two-tier system of responsibilities elsewhere.
Several districts are trying to arrange mergers so that they will be big
enough for unitary status. Formal announcements have already been made on
merger proposals for Devon, Cambridgeshire and Surrey, while several other
areas must make submissions by the end of this month.
Mr Martin Easteal, chief executive of the commission, has recommended that
new unitary authorities should have populations of between 150,000 and
250,000.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Monopolies probe on Independent less likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry is increasingly likely to allow the
consortium that includes Mirror Group Newspapers to take over The
Independent newspaper without a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
But a waiver on the grounds of economic urgency is expected to be
accompanied by conditions designed to protect the editorial independence of
The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, both owned by Newspaper
Publishing.
The consortium, which is bidding for the shares in Newspaper Publishing that
it does not already own, brings together MGN, Mr Andreas Whittam Smith and
the principal founders of the paper, and two existing shareholders, El Pas
of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy.
Meanwhile, further details emerged yesterday of the consortium agreements
and the service deal under which MGN would handle all the operations of
Newspaper Publishing apart from editorial.
The Spanish and the Italians have an agreement to vote as one on the NP
board which they will therefore control with four of the seven board seats.
MGN will operate Newspaper Publishing's bank account and have a veto over
board decisions on new lines of business such as the launch of titles.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Brussels warns on foreign curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has threatened European Court action against the UK
if it does not scrap rules which allow the government to set a limit on
foreign shareholdings in certain companies.
The move seems likely to add to the tension between London and Brussels. It
follows a long-running wrangle between the commission and the UK over the
limits on foreign shareholdings set for British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce
following their privatisation in 1987.
It emerged yesterday that the EC had opened infringement proceedings against
the UK over the rules, which are designed to protect companies deemed to
have a strategic or security role.
The commission says limits on shareholdings can sometimes be justified on
national security grounds, but it feels the current UK legal structure is
too flexible.
'This isn't just aerospace - it could be applied to a whole lot of sectors,'
explained one commission official. 'What we are unhappy with is the fact
that the minister is able to prohibit investments on the grounds of national
interests.'
British ministers also argue that scrapping the limit would allow EC
companies to take over UK companies without extending the same rights to
British shareholders. They say complex regulations in some EU countries,
such as Germany, effectively prevent takeovers.
But the Department of Trade and Industry said it would consider the request
from British companies affected by the limits to raise the cap on foreign
ownership from 29.5 per cent to 49.5 per cent.
The commission says the UK law infringes single market legislation,
including laws on establishment and the freedom of circulation of capital,
since it makes distinctions between British and other EU shareholders.
The commission yesterday acknowledged that Britain was unlikely to be the
only country in the EU which infringed community law, and said it had raised
concerns over French and Portuguese curbs.
The commission's formal letter of protest to the UK government was sent at
the end of December, and commission officials say they have not received a
response.
Under EU infringement proceedings, the commission would usually respond to a
formal reply by issuing a 'reasoned opinion' on the case. Where cases cannot
be resolved by diplomatic pressure, the commission may then proceed to take
the government to the European Court.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Life companies pressed over pension survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading life insurance companies have been put on the spot by a committee of
MPs about whether they took part in the survey on pension transfers that
caused widespread public concern about mis-selling.
Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons social security
committee, has written to the six largest providers of personal pensions
asking if their pensions business was included in the sample studied by
accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick.
If some companies now declare that they did not take part in the study, as
the Prudential has already done, attention will focus on the others.
As part of the committee's inquiry into aspects of personal and state
pensions, Mr Field has also written to the Securities and Investments Board,
the City's chief watchdog, which commissioned the study, asking what further
steps it intends to take in response to the survey.
SIB has set up an inquiry into how to ensure higher standards in the sale of
pension transfers, and is due to publish a report on that by the end of this
month. It will then turn its attention to how people who suffered as a
result of following poor advice should be compensated.
The KPMG study suggested that in only 9 per cent of cases was there evidence
of substantial compliance with the regulators' rules on selling pensions to
people transferring a lump sum out of an occupational pension scheme.
The six organisations contacted by the committee are Pearl, TSB Group,
Prudential, Legal &amp; General, Allied Dunbar and Abbey Life.
This demand for information will put greater pressure on those companies
which have been unwilling to reveal their participation in the study, even
though regulators have emphasised that the findings were representative of
the industry as a whole. At least one of those Mr Field has written to is
understood to have taken part in the survey.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Hurd tells EU to drop grand plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd yesterday called on Britain's European partners to drop
grand ambitions for further institutional change in the European Union and
commit themselves to making the present administration work.
In a speech directed as much at the warring factions in his own party as at
EU members, Mr Hurd said the 12 should set as its first priority 'the
integrity and effectiveness of administration in Europe'. The EU should do
less but do it better.
He called for less legislation, better value for money, a fight against
fraud and the even application of EU law. He said governments 'have for too
long concentrated on designing future stages of European co-operation'.
He told the Belgian Institute of International Affairs in Brussels: 'The
people of Europe have the right to expect those charged with the
administration of Europe to concentrate not just on the historical
importance of the European endeavour but on the nitty-gritty which will
decide whether it works.'
Mr Hurd called for other EU justice and home affairs ministers to back a new
British initiative designed to combat criminal fraud against the Union's
institutions. He urged the European Commission and parliament to impose
stricter standards of financial control, and asked other governments to
'control the instinct to throw legislation at problems'.
The voters of Europe expected mistakes and abuses to be put right. 'The true
European vision in 1994 lies in making a success of what we have already
agreed and extending that success to other parts of Europe,' he said.
Mr Hurd's aides emphasised that the speech was not intended to provide a
complete picture of the government's approach to the next stage of European
development. The foreign secretary will take up a number of other themes in
the approach to the June elections for the European parliament.
But the emphasis on pragmatism and the distinct scepticism about European
'vision' were interpreted at Westminster as part of a series of concerted
moves to unite the Conservative party around a common stance for June's
poll.
It was reinforced by Mr John Major who insisted yesterday that the
Conservatives would be the only British party in the June elections to fight
on a platform opposing greater centralisation of powers in Brussels. He told
BBC Radio: 'There is no appetite in the Conservative party whatever for a
centralist Europe.'
Distancing Conservative MEPs from their alliance in Strasbourg with members
of the pro-federalist European Peoples Party, the prime minister added: 'We
will fight the election on a distinctly British Conservative manifesto for
the future of Europe.'
But there were clear signs last night that the attempts to assuage Tory
Euro-sceptics had annoyed leading members of the party's pro-European wing.
Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, won the support of a number of
leading backbenchers in taking Mr Hurd to task for attacking the
institutions of the EU. Sir Edward asked: 'What is the point of the foreign
secretary being so critical of the Union of which we are members when he has
to work with all the other 11 members of the Union?'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Prejudice denied over union post at Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political prejudice did not motivate Mr John Major, the prime minister, in
his decision not to re-appoint a trade unionist as non-executive director of
the Bank of England, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury,
told the Commons yesterday.
Trade unionists had never been appointed to serve a 'constituency interest',
he said.
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical
union, has already served two terms of office on the Bank's court of
governors.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour spokesman on the City, attributed the prime
minister's failure to re-appoint Mr Laird to 'weakness or prejudice'. He
said it would be the first time since the Bank was nationalised in 1946 that
there would be nobody representing unions on the court of governors.
Mr Alan Beith, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the break with
the long-established practice of appointing someone from a union background
to the court of governors was widely felt to be 'undesirable'.
Mr Nelson praised Mr Laird's contribution to the Bank and insisted that no
reflection had been cast on him by the prime minister's decision. He said:
'There is no intention to be partisan in this matter. It is far too
important for party politics to play any part.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Prescribing practices in NHS attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Health Service could save up to Pounds 500m a year on
pharmaceuticals if doctors adopted better prescribing practices, the Audit
Commission says in a report published today.
The savings would be enough to pay for an additional 80,000 hip-replacement
operations a year, according to the commission, which audits local
authorities and health service bodies.
More than Pounds 45m a year is wasted on prescribing medicines of limited
clinical value such as appetite suppressants, nasal decongestants and
anti-diarrhoeal drugs. Some general practitioners prescribe four times as
many of these pharmaceuticals as others, the commission found.
The commission says immediate savings of up to Pounds 425m a year would be
possible if every general practitioner prescribed to the average standard of
50 good practices selected from around the country for the report.
The highest-spending areas of the country spent 50 per cent more than the
lowest-spending areas, even after adjusting for the different ages of the
populations covered.
In the longer term, savings could rise to Pounds 500m a year if doctors
followed a 12-point plan set out in the report. The recommendations include
greater use of unbranded, 'generic' medicines and regular reviews of repeat
prescriptions and practice prescribing policies.
Over-prescribing by family health services (the non-hospital part of the
NHS) costs the health service Pounds 275m a year, it is estimated.
The report also identifies additional spending on drugs that could save
money for other parts of the health service budget. An extra Pounds 75m on
inhaled steroids, for example, would improve the health of asthmatic
patients and reduce hospital admissions.
The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry welcomed the
acknowledgement that prescribed medicines could reduce total healthcare
costs. But it said that the commission appeared to have fallen into the trap
of looking at the pharmaceuticals bill in isolation from the rest of the
health budget.
It said: 'The report's 'headline' figures on allegedly potential cutbacks
will have a damaging effect on confidence among both British and overseas
companies who supply the health service and use the UK as their base.'
The Pounds 3.6bn a year spent by GPs on drugs accounts for 10 per cent of
the NHS budget.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Departments battle to run jobseeker's allowance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials at two Whitehall departments - social security and employment -
are locked in battle over who will control the new jobseeker's allowance,
which will replace the system of unemployment benefit.
The allowance, to be introduced in April 1996, has been jointly promoted by
both departments. A final decision on which of them is to administer
payments has yet to be taken and could involve the transfer of a budget
worth several billion pounds from social security to employment.
With departments in the process of deciding what legislation they will push
to have included in the 1994-95 parliamentary session, the DSS has included
the bill introducing the allowance on its list of submissions.
But the Department of Employment is understood to be keen that it should be
the lead department in steering the bill through parliament - putting it in
pole position to administer the new allowance afterwards.
Winning the argument - described by one official recently as 'quite a scrum'
 -would have a dramatic impact on the employment department's annual budget
of Pounds 3.7bn, probably more than doubling it.
The dispute is given added piquancy because of the ministers at the heads of
the two departments involved. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary,
and Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, come from opposite ends of the Tory
party's political spectrum.
At present, however, the row is said to be confined largely to officials.
The Budget outlined plans for unemployment benefit to be merged into a new
jobseeker's allowance. The new allowance - the level of which has not been
set - would be paid for six months, after which recipients would switch to
income support.
Under the present benefit system, most people over 18 who become unemployed
receive weekly unemployment benefit of Pounds 44.65 in the first 12 months
before switching to income support.
In 1992-93, the government spent a total of Pounds 9.3bn on the unemployed,
with a large proportion being paid out in the form of unemployment benefit
and income support.
Both unemployment benefit and income support currently come out of the
Pounds 80bn DSS budget.
It has long been accepted in Whitehall that the unemployed should be served
by one department rather than two as at present. One factor in the
employment department's favour is that the DSS's main legislative priority
is likely to be pensions reform.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Companies win big share of civil service work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The private sector has won more than three-quarters of the Pounds 1.1bn of
civil service work put out to tender so far, according to figures given to a
committee of MPs by Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister.
Private companies have won contracts worth Pounds 850m to provide a wide
range of services to the government, including estates and facilities
management, financial support and computer services.
Savings on contracting-out are running at about 23 per cent of the value of
work tested, Mr Waldegrave said. The programme is expected to have covered
Pounds 2.3bn of civil service activities by the end of September.
The figures have been submitted to the Commons Treasury and civil service
committee which will question Mr Waldegrave today. The committee is
investigating concerns over the impact of civil service reforms on the
quality of public services and probity in handling public money.
Market testing has so far put the jobs of 25,000 civil servants up for
competition. The contracts so far completed will reduce civil service
numbers by 14,500, with just over 12,000 civil servants transferring to the
private sector.
More than 7,000 of these transfers will be covered by the Tupe regulations
which preserve the pay and conditions of staff in transfers of employment.
The Cabinet Office estimates that the total cost of the market-testing
programme so far has been less than Pounds 20m. This is much lower than the
Pounds 100m the civil service unions allege has been spent.
More than 400 activities have so far been reviewed under the programme
launched with the Competing for Quality white paper. Three have been
privatised, 25 abolished and another 20 withdrawn after restructuring or
unsolvable problems were encountered.
More than 230 activities were market tested, with the staff currently doing
the job competing against outside bidders. In-house teams won 150 of these,
with the rest going to contractors.
The remaining 113 cases were put out to tender without a bid from the staff
currently doing the work. Ministers believe that departments and agencies
are increasingly following business in making strategic decisions to
withdraw from non-core activities.
Savings total Pounds 136m on the Pounds 590m of work in the programme where
firm figures are available. The figures for two large contracts - the Inland
Revenue's information technology services and the Atomic Weapons
Establishment at Aldermaston - cannot be quantified until negotiations with
contractors have been completed.
Information technology services are the largest group of activities
contracted out under the programme, affecting more than Pounds 300m of
business. These include the partnership agreement under which the Inland
Revenue will transfer its IT work to EDS-Scicon, the US contracted-services
group, in a deal worth almost Pounds 2bn over 10 years.

FT  08 MAR 94 / PM sets up inquiry on Ulster talks leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major has launched an inquiry into how details of his private
meeting with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, at Downing Street on
Wednesday evening were leaked to a Sunday newspaper.
The prime minister said yesterday he had put inquiries 'in hand', the talks
on tomorrow's debate for the renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act
'should not have been leaked'. It was important that such meetings could be
held in private, he said.
Mr Smith welcomed the move. In a letter to Mr Major which officials
described as a 'nudge' at the prime minister's elbow, the Labour leader said
he trusted the inquiry would be 'both thorough and comprehensive'.
Downing Street said the prime minister was satisfied the leak did not
emanate from Number 10 and had instructed the Home Office and the Northern
Ireland Office to hold similar inquiries.
Labour regularly votes against renewal of the act but had wanted to see if
its disagreement with the government over two specific measures could be
bridged before tomorrow's debate, timed to coincide with a vote on whether
to set up a select committee on Northern Ireland.
Mr Major told BBC radio: 'We looked very carefully at what John Smith
proposed. I decided it was not in the interests of the proper working of the
Prevention of Terrorism Act to adopt the proposals he put forward.'
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said yesterday he was still
confident of resuming all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland in
spite of unionists' repeated refusal to take part.
Mr Spring and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, are to
make a more detailed assessment of the prospects for negotiations when they
jointly chair a session of the UK-Irish intergovernmental Ulster Conference
in London on Thursday.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Names defeat agents' appeal for delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's Names on the lossmaking Gooda Walker syndicates yesterday defeated a
bid by the agents they are suing to adjourn a court case scheduled to begin
next month.
The case by 3,000 Names - the individuals whose assets support the insurance
market - is due to come to court on April 26.
Agents had applied to adjourn the case on the grounds that a key witness had
refused to co-operate with them. Mr Justice Cresswell rejected the
application, awarding costs of the hearing to the Names.
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said the courts
were 'showing commendable and consistent determination to deal with all the
Lloyd's litigation with despatch and efficiency'. He deplored agents'
efforts to delay the action by 'every legalistic, pettifogging device'.
A Lords ruling in a separate appeal by agents on an issue which has a
bearing on the case will be held later this month. The Lords are to consider
whether members' agents, which handle the affairs of Names, can be
vicariously liable for the default of managing agents, which administer
syndicates.
The Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents about 9,000 Names, has
urged Lloyd's to eliminate 'double counting' from its accounts.
Double counting occurs because the same losses are registered by the
syndicates that pay claims, as well as syndicates specialising in errors and
omissions insurance and personal stop loss insurance.
Errors and omissions insurers cover Lloyd's agents against legal awards for
negligence, while personal stop loss insurers provide Names with a kind of
personal reinsurance policy.
Indemnity Insurance Services, a broker which administers the Integer Stop
Loss scheme, estimates that the double count may amount to as much as Pounds
400m. The company said that given some additional information it would be
able to calculate a special credit for all Names that would effectively
remove the double count.
Mr Valentine Powell, chief executive of the association, said: 'This is a
step Lloyd's could and should take.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Change planned on unit trust errors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New minimum standards on how unit trust managers should deal with pricing
errors and compensate investors significantly affected were proposed
yesterday by financial watchdogs.
The proposals seek to mitigate the cost and complexity for the unit trust
industry of rectifying mistakes made in pricing units, for example as a
result of doing calculations on the basis of the wrong stocks or at the
wrong prices.
Under present regulations, no matter how small the error, the unit trust
manager must go back and re-price the units for every day since the original
mistake occurred, and establish which investors need to be compensated for
the wrong pricing during the time before the error was uncovered, no matter
how slight the disadvantage.
Yesterday's consultative document is published jointly by Imro, the
self-regulating organisation for the fund management industry, and the
Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator.
It aims to enable managers to disregard the smallest mistakes, provided they
have proper control systems in place to try to prevent errors.
Managers would have to correct the error from when it was discovered and for
the future, rather than having to go back and re-price units for every day
since the mistake occurred.
The new rules would also introduce a de minimis rule, so that where the
disadvantage to an investor was less than Pounds 10, the unit trust manager
would not necessarily have to provide compensation. Current best practice is
to round up such small sums to Pounds 10.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Malaysia aid probe will focus on earlier decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs probing the UK's offer of aid for Malaysia's Pergau dam project will
increasingly focus their investigations on decisions taken before the
signing of a protocol in March 1988 which linked arms and aid.
In recent weeks ministers have admitted that the protocol, which was signed
by Lord Younger, then defence secretary, contained an 'entanglement' between
the sale of Pounds 1.3bn of defence equipment to Malaysia and an offer of
about Pounds 200m in aid. Both the prime minister and Mr Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary, have repeatedly said that this link was 'disentangled' in
correspondence between the Malaysian and British authorities in June and
August 1988.
But members of the foreign affairs committee investigating Britain's
decision to agree to the project will ask Lord Younger today why he felt he
was able to give any assurance on aid to the Malaysians in the first place.
They will want to know whether the Overseas Development Administration had
been involved in the original offer of aid in the March 1988 protocol or
whether the entire deal had been approved under the auspices of Baroness
Thatcher, the then prime minister.
One prominent member of the committee said yesterday: 'It looks to me like
an independent foreign policy was being run from Number 10 Downing Street.'
Mr John Major yesterday reiterated that ministers had acted properly in
offering the aid package to Malaysia in parallel with the defence deal.
He said that efforts to 'disentangle' the two packages after they had been
linked showed that the government of the day was one 'with high standards
not low standards'.
However Mr Geoffrey Bindman, a senior partner of Bindman &amp; Partners and a
well-known constitutional lawyer, said evidence already put before MPs
established an 'overwhelming probability' that, in deciding to authorise the
grant of aid for the dam, Mr Douglas Hurd had 'acted ultra vires (beyond his
authority) and therefore unlawfully'.
His legal advice is contained in a five-page document prepared for the World
Development Movement, the pressure group that has been lobbying Parliament
over the affair.
Mr Bindman says Mr Hurd has personal responsibility for the 1980 Overseas
Act which covers the provision of aid. He says that evidence before the
Commons points 'very strongly' to the conclusion that the government may
have breached the act.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Drug companies face cuts in sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The suggestion in the Audit Commission's report that doctors should change
their prescribing practices could mean sharp cuts in UK sales for several
drug companies.
The largest single saving would be the Pounds 100m which the report says is
wasted by giving patients unnecessary anti-ulcer drugs when they have milder
complaints such as dyspepsia.
Ulcer drugs Zantac, made by the UK's Glaxo, and Losec, from Sweden's Astra,
are the two top-selling drugs in the UK with combined sales of more than
Pounds 300m a year, according to figures from analysts at Lehman Brothers.
With other conditions which require drugs treatment, substitution of
alternative or unbranded drugs could achieve annual savings of Pounds 75m,
the report says. Some Pounds 8.8m a year could be saved on one SmithKline
Beecham drug alone: heart treatment Tenormin is the 12th most prescribed
drug with sales of Pounds 30m a year. It costs up to four times as much as
its unbranded alternative.
The drugs companies argue that the report is flawed in detail and
conception. Glaxo said that Zantac can legitimately also be prescribed for
conditions other than ulcers, and added that some 4,500 people in the UK die
from ulcer disease each year which 'suggests an under-treated, not
over-treated, area'.
However, Glaxo is among the companies which could benefit from the Audit
Commission's recommendation for increased spending on steroids to ward off
asthma attacks. It has the three top-selling asthma drugs in the UK with
sales of almost Pounds 200m a year, almost two-thirds of which are steroids.
Substituting generic drugs for branded versions would affect some companies
disproportionately. The NHS would save Pounds 2.7m a year by substituting
the generic ibuprofen for Boots' Brufen, one of the company's biggest
selling pharmaceuticals. Almost all of Boots' UK drug sales of about Pounds
33m have generic alternatives and would suffer if more generics were
prescribed.
Fisons, and to a lesser extent Reckitt and Colman, are in a similar
position. Of non-UK companies operating in the UK, American Cyanamid's sales
could be hit most if generic substitution of branded products were
increased. Its antibiotic Minocin, which is the 19th best seller in the UK
with sales of Pounds 26m a year, has several generic alternatives.
Most non-UK companies put their selling efforts into patent-protected drugs.
Even here the report says that money could be saved because a new generation
of anti-depressives, which include Seroxat from SmithKline Beecham and
Prozac from Eli Lilly, are up to 10 times as expensive as older drugs but no
more effective.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Scottish poll puts Tories on 13%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party has sunk to its lowest level ever in opinion polls in
Scotland, a System Three poll in today's Herald newspaper based in Glasgow
says. The poll puts Tory support in Scotland at 13 per cent, the party's
lowest rating since since the poll began 20 years ago, James Buxton writes.
The Tories' standing is only half the 25.7 per cent it won at the 1992
general election and is three points down on its showing at the end of
January. It puts the Tories in fourth place for only the second time in the
poll's history.
Labour support is unchanged at 47 per cent while the Scottish National party
has risen three percentage points to 25 per cent. The Liberal Democrats are
unchanged at 14 per cent.
Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, said the poll showed the nationalists were in a
position to challenge Labour in the forthcoming local and European
elections.
News of the poll, based on interviews with 1,035 people between February 24
and March 3, came on the day Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, launched
the Conservatives' spring offensive, saying the party would fare well at the
elections.

<TEXT>
Morteo, Europe's largest manufacturer of containers, has agreed a joint
venture with India aimed at increasing India's food exports.
The company, which is based in Genoa, Italy, signed a deal at the weekend
with the Indian conglomerate, Dalmia-Mittal, to produce 10,000 refrigerated
containers a year at a Bombay factory due to open next year.
Morteo said it would invest a total of Dollars 20m in the container factory
which will be the biggest in India and have an annual turnover of about
Dollars 70m. Forty per cent of the new company, Morteo Transfreight Reefer
Container, will be quoted on the Bombay stock exchange from October.
The venture will receive government aid through the Industrial Development
Bank of India.
The project is the first in India for Morteo, which was privatised by the
state holding group Iritecna a year ago, and has a strong presence in China.
India is a big exporter of vegetables and fish and aims to increase its
annual usage of refrigerated containers from 15,000 units to 50,000 over the
next two years. Until now industry has relied on containers arriving empty
at Indian ports.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US fish industry reacted warily to a preliminary agreement reached last
Friday between Washington and Paris over French government inspection delays
of US fish exports.
'If you look at the history of French actions over the past few weeks there
is reason to be concerned,' said Mr Dick Gutting, a vice-president of the
National Fisheries Institute.
In response to angry protests by French fisherman, France placed an embargo
on US fish early last month. Bowing to US pressure, it lifted the embargo,
but instituted an inspection system which had the same effect and left fish
rotting in storehouses near French airports.
A US food inspection team arrived in France yesterday to ensure that the
delays are at an end.
Washington is prepared to retaliate immediately if the hold-ups continue.
'They said product will be detained and subject to inspection if you are on
a list of exporters who have had problems,' said Mr Gutting. 'We don't
understand how you get on that list or how one gets off the list.'
Meanwhile, a number of French importers of US fish have hired a lawyer to
file a suit for damages, and the US industry has begun to estimate its own
losses for legal action.

FT  08 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Making the telephones work in Russia -
Efforts to bring order to the market free-for-all of initial telecoms reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is due to offer 22 per cent of Rostelekom, its telecommunications
giant, to Russian and foreign investors next week in the latest evidence of
the change shaking up its telecommunications sector.
Rostelekom, which controls much of Russia's international traffic and
practically all long-distance domestic traffic, is embroiled in a bitter
debate over how much of a monopoly it should be allowed to restore after
disenchantment in some quarters with a market free-for-all.
Feverish, if piecemeal, foreign investment has meant the creation over the
last few years of dozens of joint ventures with foreign companies and the
provision of a range of services, at least for hard-currency paying clients,
which simply did not exist before.
The result is that making an international telephone call in Moscow has
become easy rather than almost impossible - as it was under the old
communist system, which discouraged free communication between its own
citizens and between itself and the outside world.
The new investment plans have ranged from a grand international project to
build a fibre optic cable network snaking across the Russian Federation from
Denmark in the west to South Korea in the east - vastly expanding the number
of international telephone lines available to ordinary Russian citizens - to
a private telecommunications system using cables in the Moscow metro.
Mr Edouard Altenhoven, the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development's team leader for telecommunications, says that until the
Russian authorities can come up with a clear vision of where they want to
go, 'there's a good case to be made for chaos'.
Chaotic development has at least brought some real improvements in service,
which cannot be said about Belarus, for instance, which has only one foreign
joint venture and little to show for it.
To combat some of the chaos, the Russian telecommunications ministry
recently signalled a change in its policies over mobile telephones. It
threatened to deprive operators of licences unless they implemented their
terms on deadline and it is insisting on compatibility between regional
systems.
'This is the first clever idea and the first step towards civilisation in
three years,' said one Russian telecommunications expert who is an ardent
supporter of market reforms. But he said that the chaotic, and sometimes
corrupt, distribution of 70 licences around Russia to dozens of foreign
companies - many of which either just sat on their licences or planned to
build networks which were incompatible with each other - was leading to
'disaster'.
The main challenge is to find ways of financing the upgrading of less
profitable local infrastructure in a country where it is still impossible in
some places to make a local call.
Rostelekom, together with a number of western companies, is working to
finalise a Dollars 1bn project known as '50 times 50' to link 50 Russian
cities with 50,000km of fibre-optic cable. The American telecommunications
company US West has launched a financial vehicle, the Russian
Telecommunications Development Corporation, into which it and other
investors plan to reinvest profits and through which they hope to raise more
capital.
Mr Stan Cramton, of US West in Moscow, believes Russia should have a
telecommunications monopoly to 'cross-subsidise' the less glamorous services
with revenues from the more profitable international traffic.
'There isn't a single country in the world which did not develop its
telephone infrastructure on the basis of a monopoly,' he said. He admitted
that a monopoly would benefit large companies such as his which are
accustomed to working long-term and want certainty about the future.
Mr Gordon Muir-Carby, responsible for emerging markets at London
stockbrokers Smith New Court, says there will be some institutional interest
in the Rostelekom offering.
'People have determined that at least in telecoms and consumer industries
things will reach rock bottom this year but then pick up,' he said. But
although many would consider any risk would be discounted in the low stock
price, he believed that others would be put off by the lack of transparency
in a company such as Rostelekom.
According to many western executives, there is a need for local telephone
services to reflect more closely their true cost. But Russians warn that
this would be politically difficult in a nation used to talking on the
telephone for free, or close to it.

<TEXT>
Davy International, part of Trafalgar House of the UK, said yesterday it had
won a contract worth about Pounds 75m to design and supply a blast furnace
for China Steel in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.
The contract was awarded after more than two years of technical and
commercial discussions with China Steel, in the face of intense competition
from Japan and Germany.
The work will be handled by Davy's office in Stockton, northern England, and
includes supervision of erection and commissioning and training services.
Davy said a key factor in its selection was its track record in South Korea,
where it supplied five blast furnaces to Posco, the steel producer.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Keidanren, Japan's influential business federation, yesterday joined
leading businessmen and politicians in urging the government to adopt
voluntary targets to reduce Japan's surplus in the medium term.
The move reflects increasing public frustration in Japan over the
government's inability to deal with mounting friction with the US.
Among the measures called for by the Keidanren is the adoption of future
targets to cut Japan's current account surplus.
In a paper it said the Japanese government needed to reformulate its US
policy as soon as possible.
The 'period of reflection' was not long, it said, referring to a cooling-off
period agreed between Tokyo and Washington after failure to reach agreement
on key issues in framework trade negotiations.
To improve relations 'the government must carry out its promises to the US
in a reliable manner,' the Keidanren said. On the macro-economic side, the
government should adopt voluntary medium-term targets for 'a highly
significant reduction in the surplus,' as agreed between the two countries.
This is the first time the business federation has specifically asked the
government to adopt such targets and goes against stated government policy
of not adopting targets it cannot guarantee it will achieve or which could
lead to managed trade.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, said on Sunday that Japan could adopt a
mid-term voluntary target to help create a better environment in
negotiations with the US after recent talks ended in deadlock. While
emphasising that it would be dangerous to set such targets at a
micro-economic level, Mr Hata said it would be possible to calculate what
part of GDP would be served by domestic production over the medium term.
The Keidanren's position and Mr Hata's remarks reflect a growing feeling
that Japan must send a clear signal to the US of its intent to reduce the
current account surplus.
In the immediate aftermath of a US-Japan summit last month, Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, won acclaim for resisting US pressure
to impose targets.
But as the US has tightened the screw with its revival of the Super 301
trade act, which provides Washington with ammunition to retaliate against
what it considers unfair trade practices, the Japanese public is becoming
increasingly frustrated with the government's failure to smooth tensions.
The Ministry of Finance, however, has staunchly opposed the setting of
targets on the country's current account surplus.

The US Commerce Department yesterday took a step towards a US 'information
superhighway' by announcing that Dollars 26m (Pounds 17.8m) in federal
matching grants is available for telecommunications technologies for
schools, hospitals and libraries.
Mr Ron Brown, secretary of commerce, said his department would target those
who needed help, thus avoiding pockets of 'information haves and have nots.'
The department will provide up to 50 per cent of the cost for demonstration
projects, which use diverse technologies and can serve as models for others,
and planning grants. The funds could, for example, spur 'telemedicine,'
allowing hospitals swiftly to exchange information, and 'remote learning' by
making data available to rural schools.
Mr Brown also attempted yesterday to head off a Republican assault on the
National Competitiveness Act.
The legislation funds two other Commerce Department schemes; the advanced
technology programme, allowing grants for research and development of
generic technologies, and the manufacturing extension partnership, to
disseminate manufacturing advances in the country.

Rap music won out over country rock yesterday when the Supreme Court decided
a landmark copyright lawsuit in favour of rappers 2 Live Crew.
The Court ruled unanimously that 2 Live Crew's raucous version of the 1964
Roy Orbison hit 'Oh, Pretty Woman' was a fair parody that could not be
blocked by Acuff-Rose Music, holders of the copyright.
The case, which makes clear for the first time that commercial parody may
constitute 'fair use' under the copyright laws, has pitted not just rappers,
whose music often uses samples of well-known rock hits, but also satirists
and free speech advocates against a galaxy of famous song writers.
Mr Luther Campbell, 2 Live Crew's lead singer and song writer, had
originally sought permission to use 'Oh, Pretty Woman' and offered to pay
royalties to Acuff-Rose. That permission was refused.
Justice David Souter, ruled that it made no difference whether the parody
was in good or bad taste. 2 Live Crew used the bass riff of the Orbison
original, as well as its first line: 'Pretty woman, walking down the street
 .' It continues in a more bawdy vein, however.
More than Dollars 13m in royalty payments was at stake in the case. The
Supreme Court rejected the copyright holder's absolute right to refuse
permission for the parody, but it sent the case back to a lower court for
further evaluation of how much of the original song was used, and the extent
to which the parody might harm the market for the original.

FT  08 MAR 94 / NY spurns bizarre toilet plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There is some good news and some bad news for those feeling the call of
nature on the streets of New York.
The good news is that the city council has come up with an ingenious, if
bizarre, plan to encourage the private sector to build and operate public
toilets in the metropolis. Companies will be allowed to erect two giant
advertising pillars for every toilet built, so giving them the opportunity
to profit from the advertising revenues they collect.
The bad news is that the scheme has become so mired in controversy that the
council last week backed away from full implementation, instead opting for a
small-scale experiment that will take at least a year to complete.
New York is notorious for its lack of public lavatories. There used to be
hundreds - in parks, public buildings, subway stations and open spaces - but
they became the domain of drug addicts and vagrants when the city ran out of
money to pay for attendants in the 1970s, and nearly all were closed.
Apart from causing inconvenience to New Yorkers and visitors, one
side-effect has been intense irritation for proprietors of bars and
restaurants who find their toilets performing a public function. Many
express their annoyance with strident warning notices, such as: 'Bathrooms
are for the use of today's customers only.'
The shortage has also spawned an unusual literary sub-genre. A widely
available book called 'Where To Go: A Guide To Manhattan's Toilets' lists
little-known lavatories that can be used without embarrassment.
Some require considerable tenacity: the entry for the Mormon visitors'
centre in Lincoln Square warns that people wanting to use the rest room are
expected to sit through an introductory talk, a videotape presentation and a
question-and-answer session lasting 40 minutes.
The city council's proposed remedy was a plan to award a private sector
franchise for the construction and operation of 200 automatic, self-cleaning
public toilets similar to the ones that have become widespread in London.
Admission would cost 25 cents, but the operators' main source of income
would be the revenues from Paris-style advertising pillars measuring 22ft
6ins high and 5ft 6ins in diameter - two of them for every toilet.
The originality of the scheme, however, has failed to impress New Yorkers.
Community groups and local politicians have reacted with horror at the
proposed afforestation of the city with 400 pillars, while the private
sector is concerned the revenues from two pillars per toilet will not be
enough for them to make a profit.
Opting for caution, the city council has cut the number of toilets to 100
and the height of the pillars to 17ft. But even these may never appear,
because the council has decided not to go ahead without first inviting
would-be operators to conduct an experiment with a maximum of three toilets
and six pillars each.
Given the level of public hostility to the pillars, the experiment seems
unlikely to win many converts. If it fails, the city will either have to
find the money for the toilets out of its own resources: or, more likely
given the continuing budgetary constraints, remain a lavatorial wilderness.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling
Institutional Revolutionary party, has begun the difficult task of
distancing himself from the present incumbent, President Carlos Salinas.
Mr Colosio, who was selected last November by Mr Salinas to be the party's
candidate in August's election, chose to dwell on his differences with
current administration policy on the 65th anniversary of the PRI's hold on
power on Sunday.
'The only continuity that I offer is change,' claimed Mr Colosio, who has
previously been so closely identified with the current president that he is
known as 'Mr Salinas with hair'.
For the first time Mr Colosio seemed to criticise the president. 'We know
that the origin of many of our ills lies in an excessive concentration of
power, a concentration that leads to wrong decisions, the monopoly of
initiatives, abuses and excesses,' he said. 'The reform of government will
require a president who is subject - strictly - to the limits of our
republican and democratic constitution.'
PRI presidential candidates traditionally move away from the incumbent as
the election draws closer. Even more than his predecessors, Mr Colosio is
under pressure to draw up his own platform, partly because of a general
perception that he is a weak candidate.
Mr Colosio's campaign has suffered from the peasant uprising in the state of
Chiapas, and from the prominent role played by Mr Manuel Camacho in peace
negotiations between the rebels and government.
Mr Camacho, who had been Mr Colosio's rival for the presidential nomination,
may still launch himself as a candidate of one of the opposition parties.
While this is unlikely, he may decide to run if support for Mr Colosio
declines. A Mori poll gives Mr Colosio 37 per cent public support.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Killings cloud El Salvador poll: Democracy is threatened as
a nation struggles to escape its past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the run-up to much-vaunted national elections in El Salvador this month,
the political violence which was a feature of the country's past continues
to cast a cloud over its future.
The vote on March 20 for presidential, parliamentary, and municipal offices
has been called the 'election of the century,' as it will include candidates
from conservatives to communists for the first time in more than 60 years.
But dozens of killings, particularly of former left-wing guerrillas, and
accusations that the government is failing to implement fully a peace
agreement signed with guerrillas in January 1992, after 12 years of civil
war, have led to concerns over whether the elections will consolidate
democracy.
Human rights groups in El Salvador say the killings have had a chilling
effect on the campaign of the former left-wing guerrillas of the Farabundo
Mart National Liberation Front (FMLN), and the left in general.
The most recent report by the UN's human right monitoring division, released
at the end of December, pointed to a 'grave deterioration' in the observance
of human rights.
FMLN leaders have complained that the government has not met its commitment
to provide land to former fighters, and has tolerated the re-emergence of
right-wing death squads.
'People are worried about what is going to happen once Onusal (the United
Nations monitoring group) leaves - that the violations will return,' says Mr
Hector Dada, a political analyst.
The front-runner for President is Mr Armando Calderon Sol of the right-wing
governing Nationalist Republican Alliance party, who comfortably leads Mr
Ruben Zamora, leader of an alliance between the Democratic Convergence, a
centre-left umbrella group, and the FMLN.
A distant third is Mr Fidel Chavez Mena of the Christian Democrat party,
whose popularity has plummeted as Mr Zamora's has grown. Mr Chavez remains
tainted by the failures of a disastrous Christian Democrat administration in
the mid-1980s.
But about half of potential voters either remain uncertain about who to vote
for or unwilling to state their preference.
Mr Calderon was picked to succeed the current president, Mr Alfredo
Cristiani, by the late Mr Roberto D'Aubuisson, a sponsor of right-wing death
squads who founded the party in 1981 to defend the interests of the business
and land-owning elite against the perceived advances of communism.
Mr Calderon was formerly a popular mayor of San Salvador.
But he reportedly does not enjoy the full confidence of his party,
particularly among modernising businessmen. He lacks the smooth public
relations skills of Mr Cristiani.
Mr Calderon has benefited from an expensive government campaign on
television proclaiming its achievements, which makes little attempt to
distinguish itself from party advertising.
But he is thought unlikely to secure the more than 50 per cent of the vote
required for an outright victory. A run-off in April, probably with Mr
Zamora, looks likely.
Mr Zamora, who is vice-president of the Salvadorean Congress, spent most of
the last decade in exile, and is considered one of the most able left-wing
politicians in Latin America.
By securing the backing of the FMLN, he has emerged as the country's leading
opposition figure.
Since becoming a political party last year the FMLN has been racked by
internal divisions and has been unable to maintain the cohesion in peace
which it achieved during the war.
Senior party officials admit the organisation is likely to split after the
election, as some of its member groups have embraced social democracy while
others are still ostensibly Marxist.
The end of the war has brought the Salvadorean government considerable
foreign aid and soft loans to rebuild infrastructure damaged during the
conflict. Last year saw 5 per cent growth, following 4.8 per cent in 1992,
the highest rates in more than a decade. The growth was mostly fuelled by a
large influx of repat-riated capital and external financing.
With inflation down to 12 per cent, record foreign reserves, and one of the
lowest foreign debt burdens in the Americas, the economy is in relatively
good shape although highly dependent on remittances from compatriots in the
US, who sent home more than Dollars 800m (Pounds 547.9m) last year.
But Salvadoreans are still not sure if the bad old days are really over. As
Mr Dada says: 'The psychology of terror has not finished.'

<TEXT>
Mr Bill Brock, former US trade representative, announced yesterday he would
challenge Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland in November's mid-term
elections.
Mr Brock, who served one term as senator for Tennessee in the 1970s, would,
if elected, become the first senator since 1879 to have represented two
states in Congress.
Credited with rebuilding the Republican party apparatus after the Watergate
debacle as chairman of the Republican National Committee, Mr Brock was
appointed US trade representative and later labour secretary by Ronald
Reagan.
Mr Sarbanes, who has been expected to take over as chairman of the Senate
banking committee after the retirement of Senator Donald Riegle of Michigan,
has won more than 60 per cent of the vote in his last two campaigns. His
voice has been heard most often on macroeconomic and budgetary issues.
Nevertheless, he maintains a low profile, and could be vulnerable to a
Republican challenge.
In Maine, meanwhile, Congresswoman Olympia Snowe, a Republican representing
the state's northern congressional district, announced she would run for the
Senate seat left empty by the retirement of Senator George Mitchell, the
Democratic majority leader.

The cabinet of Bophuthatswana, the nominally independent black homeland
which forms part of South Africa's right-wing Freedom Alliance, said
yesterday it would not register for April's all-race elections, joining the
white right wing in boycotting the poll, Patti Waldmeir reports from
Johannesburg.
Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, whose Inkatha Freedom party has registered
for the poll, said yesterday his participation was far from guaranteed, as
it depended on the result of international mediation of the country's
constitutional dispute. He said the poll should be delayed, a demand which
the African National Congress adamantly rejects.
Bophuthatswana's cabinet decided against registration yesterday, and though
it said a final decision would be made by the homeland parliament, the
assembly is unlikely to go against the cabinet's wishes.

Banks in Hong Kong yesterday hit back at a damning report from the Consumer
Council - which claimed the colony's cartel on interest rates helped banks
earn an extra HKDollars 5bn (Pounds 434m) in 1991 to the detriment of small
depositors - by insisting the 30-year Interest Rate Agreement creates
stability and that banks themselves lose a total of HKDollars 2.7bn serving
the small savings customer, Louise Lucas writes from Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong Association of Banks said the Interest Rate Agreement fostered
stability by keeping interest rates in line with market forces and the
government's economic policy - a need further underlined by the peg with the
US dollar, which means Hong Kong interest rates must track those set by the
US. However, the agreement pre-dates the peg by some 19 years.

<TEXT>
Singapore and US authorities have become involved in a heated debate over a
caning and jail sentence handed out to a US teenager.
Michael Fay, 18, was convicted last week of spray painting cars and being in
possession of Singapore flags and road signs. The teenager, a student at the
Singapore American school when the offences were committed, was sentenced to
six strokes of the rotan (a heavy cane), four months jail and fined SDollars
3,500 (Pounds 1,480).
Mr Ralph Boyce, acting US ambassador in Singapore, said there was a large
discrepancy between offence and punishment. Mr Boyce said the paint was
removed from the cars with thinner. However 'caning leaves permanent scars'
said the diplomat. 'In addition, the accused is a teenager and this is his
first offence.'
Fay's stepfather is the Singapore-based regional executive of Federal
Express, the US courier company. The American Chamber of Commerce in
Singapore said it could not understand how the government could condone the
permanent scarring of any 18 year old - American or Singaporean - for such
an offence.
'It is impossible to predict how this will affect American business activity
but it is likely to cast a cloud over Singapore's international reputation,'
said the chamber. The US is the biggest investor in Singapore.
Singapore's ministry of home affairs said that unlike some other societies
which may tolerate acts of vandalism, Singapore had its own standards of
social order as reflected in its laws.

Ten officials of Nippon Shoji, an Osaka-based drug manufacturer and
wholesaler listed on the Osaka Securities Exchange's second section, are
being investigated by the exchange over alleged sales of 50,000 shares in
the company, before the Health and Welfare Ministry announced the deaths of

British investors led the flow of new foreign direct investment into the
Philippines last year, according to government data released at the weekend.
Of the total foreign investments of Dollars 327.9m (Pounds 182m) registered
in 1993, Dollars 108.6m or 33 per cent was from British investors.
Early last year, Shell Petroleum, the Anglo-Dutch energy group, increased
its investment in its Philippine oil refining and marketing subsidiary. It
was from this that other companies in Britain had apparently taken their
cue, officials said.
British investments in 1993 exceeded those from Japan and the US,
traditionally the largest sources of foreign capital for the Philippines.
Investments from Japan totalled Dollars 46.2m, down 70 per cent from the
year before, while the US total reached Dollars 35.6m, some 37 per cent
lower than in the year before.
Foreign investments recorded in 1993 represented a slight decline from
Dollars 328.01m in 1992, according to data released by the Bangko Sentral,
the country's central monetary authority.
It was the second con-secutive annual decline. In 1992 the level was off 21
per cent from 1991's Dollars 415.3m. The National Statistics Office
announced that the average year-on-year inflation rate in February was 10.5
per cent.
The highest in two years, the month's accelerated inflation rate was fuelled
by higher petroleum product prices and power rates.
Annual average inflation in 1993 was 7.6 per cent; forecasts for 1994 point
to 8-10 per cent.

of independent trade unions, Russian and Kazakh national groups and
journalists, from registering for the elections.
It was unclear, however, whether the strong-willed Mr Nazarbayev would
emerge with the kind of majority he would need to enact his moderately
reformist economic programme.
The government said the turnout in most regions exceeded the 50 per cent
mark needed to validate the elections. Vote counting will be completed on
Thursday.
The elections for a 177-member parliament, Kazakhstan's first since the
Soviet collapse two years ago, seemed certain at least to weaken some of the
regional and national bureaucratic forces that have so far resisted him.
But they also appeared to inflame relations with the republic's ethnic
Russian population and with Moscow because of a perceived government attempt
to produce a parliament with more Kazakhs and fewer ethnic Russians. Critics
in Kazakhstan say that while Kazakhs outnumber ethnic Russians 43 per cent
to 36 per cent, on the list of candidates Kazakhs had a majority of 75 per
cent to 18 per cent.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Moves afoot to lift politician's immunity: Construction
industry inquiry widens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese public prosecutors are considering whether to lift a former
construction minister's parliamentary immunity after his refusal to answer
questions on alleged bribery.
Mr Kishiro Nakamura, a lower house member of the opposition Liberal
Democratic Party, yesterday defied investigators seeking fresh evidence in a
widening inquiry into corruption in the building industry.
This will test whether investigators are determined to arrest Mr Nakamura.
So far, more than 30 construction company executives and local politicians
have been arrested in what has become the biggest corruption scandal since
the second world war. But the prosecutors have so far stopped short of
seizing a national politician or bureaucrat.
To obtain Mr Nakamura's arrest, the public prosecutor's office would have to
ask parliament's permission to lift his immunity, a tactic last employed 26
years ago. Prosecutors want to question Mr Nakamura about allegations that
while construction minister he had received Y10m (Pounds 64,100) from a
leading contractor in return for persuading the Fair Trade Commission to
drop a 1991 investigation into bid rigging.
The FTC subsequently announced it would file no complaints against any of
the 66 companies involved, fuelling US anger over covert barriers to foreign
competition in the building industry. This is the latest sign the purge
against corruption is being stepped up, following the appointment of a new
prosecutor-general, Mr Yusuke Yoshinaga, head case officer on the Lockeed
scandals of the 1970s.
His office announced yesterday it had assigned seven extra staff to the
construction case, enlarging the team to 35.

FT  08 MAR 94 / China's reforms 'weakened centre'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's economic reforms have caused a dangerous decentralisation of power
and contributed to social decay and rising crime, a paper published by the
London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies says.
'To borrow the jargon of the European Community, Beijing first adopted
'subsidiarity' as a means to achieve economic growth, and now finds that
once power has been transferred to the most logical and efficient level, it
is hard to retrieve.'
The paper, 'China Changes Shape: Regionalism and Foreign Policy', written by
Mr Gerald Segal, an IISS senior fellow, argues other countries need to
recognise the decentralisation of power and develop policies for dealing
with regional powers in China.
But it 'neither predicts nor advocates' China's dissolution. 'Such dramatic
dislocation would damage the prosperity of a fifth of mankind, wreck East
Asian stability and lead to massive migration.
'Power has been devolved to a range of actors, including township and
village enterprises, individuals and even overseas Chinese and other
outsiders. Thus there is no simple struggle for control between centre and
province.'
The paper traces the impact on Beijing of the shift of decision-making power
to the provinces. Revenue to the centre as a proportion of the economy has
fallen sharply as richer provinces have gained muscle to rebuff successive
attempts to redress the balance; the latest is now under way.
At the same time, the central government failed to develop financial
institutions which could exercise macroeconomic control. 'Beijing could no
longer impose austerity measures on the national economy, and rich provinces
could raise funds from local investment and abroad.'
Provinces increasingly squabble among themselves on economic issues,
sometimes seeking to exclude each other's products from their markets, with
Beijing apparently powerless to prevent such internal protectionism.
Regionalism, the paper argues, could become a more serious political problem
following the death of Deng Xiaoping, China's 89-year-old paramount leader.
'Perhaps the one certain thing about the succession to Deng is that no
successor will be able to don such a strong mantle of leadership.'
Mr Segal finds a 'fin-de-siecle feeling' of which the result is social
decay, corruption, criminal activity and 'the increasing prominence of
secret societies and cult practices'.
Some of these features would be diminished if a strong leader were to
emerge.
Central control of the People's Liberation Army appears secure, but it is
increasingly involved in money-making ventures closely linked to the
development of individual regions.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Japan companies to slash capital spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese companies are planning to cut capital spending even more steeply
this year than last, leading to the longest investment decline in the
post-war period.
A respected survey of corporate borrowers by the Industrial Bank of Japan
predicted that capital investment will fall by 6.1 per cent in the year to
March 1995. Japan's economic gloom has for the first time spread from
manufacturing into service industries, according to the survey of 3,689 IBJ
clients.
This comes after a 5.6 per cent decline in the current fiscal year, already
the biggest since the IBJ started taking the survey in 1969. The bank found
'extreme bearishness' in most sectors for the first time in this recession.
Service companies say capital spending will fall 0.4 per cent this year and
4.6 per cent in the coming 12 months. Manufacturers expect spending to fall
17.7 per cent in the current year and 10.3 per cent next.
This suggests that recent increases in industrial machinery orders, one of
the few bright spots in the economic gloom, are only a weak indicator of
recovery. Machinery orders rose 31.8 per cent in January from the same month
the previous year, the third monthly increase running, the Japan Society of
Industrial Machinery Manufacturers said yesterday.
Corporate demand for credit continues to be weak, according to separate
figures from the federation of bankers' associations of Japan. Outstanding
loans by Japan's 11 city banks fell 0.7 per cent last month, from February
1993, for the second month running. The lending balance dipped in January
for the first time since the federation began collecting records 40 years
ago.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Fear of heights grips HK property market: Investor concern
but no apparent let-up in fast-rising prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since Mr Robert Ng, the youthful chairman of Sino Land, a Hong Kong
property developer, paid HKDollars 4.4bn for two pieces of land for
residential development in the New Territories last week, market observers
have had the feeling they had seen it all before.
In September and October 1987 Mr Ng was one of the biggest players on the
colony's futures exchange. It seemed he had the Midas touch. Black Monday
came and Mr Ng - and many others - was all but wiped out.
Mr Ng has returned to ride Hong Kong's bull market in residential and
commercial property. At the luxury end of the residential market, prices
have risen 350 per cent since 1989; for commercial property, values have
increased by 150 per cent over the same period.
Sino Land's purchase of the two sites at prices 20 to 30 per cent above
expectations suggests to some that Hong Kong's property market is becoming
overheated.
'The higher the prices paid the more you have to think of risk,' said Mr
Archie Hart, head of research at Crosby Securities, a local Hong Kong
brokerage. 'The Sino deal makes sense if you think interest rates will
continue to remain low, income growth will remain strong and there will be
no crises. In a perfect world it looks like a clever deal, but is the world
perfect?'
Since the US Federal Reserve Board raised short-term interest rates last
month Hong Kong's stock market has been trading uneasily in anticipation of
a rise in Hong Kong interest rates. Analysts believe it is only a matter of
time before Hong Kong's interest rates follow those in the US because the
colony's currency is tied to the dollar.
Such fears have already taken their toll on share prices; the Hang Seng
Index, having touched 12,000 earlier this year is now hovering around
10,000. Last month, Hong Kong had the worst performing stock market of the
22 large markets surveyed by Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment
firm. Since the beginning of the year the Hang Seng Index has fallen by 15.4
per cent.
Investors have been particularly savage in marking down property and bank
shares. Since the beginning of the year the property sub-index of the Hang
Seng Index has fallen by 17 per cent; and the finance sub-index has fallen
15 per cent.
The weakness in property shares has been enough to cause companies to
postpone planned capital issues. Great Eagle, one of Hong Kong's leading
property stocks, has postponed a Dollars HK3bn (Pounds 274m) flotation of a
subsidiary. The underwriters doubted whether there would be sufficient
interest in the deal.
Investors have not been the only ones to be concerned about banks' exposure
to the property market. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the
colony's quasi-central bank, which has been tracking banks' exposure to the
property market for more than two years, is also concerned.
Recent data show that by the end of last year property lending by Hong Kong
banks accounted for nearly 38 per cent of bank loans made for use in the
colony. Overall, lending for property rose by 19.4 per cent; within that
total, lending for residential mortgages was up 15 per cent, while lending
for property development and investment was up nearly 26 per cent.
Two weeks ago Mr David Carse, deputy chief executive of the HKMA, wrote to
the Hong Kong Association of Banks calling on its members to review their
exposure to the property market and ensure that it is being contained within
prudent limits. Mr Carse said that banks should try to restrain the growth
of their lending for house purchases to around 15 per cent a year - the pace
at which Hong Kong's nominal gross domestic product is growing.
In general, he said, banks should aim to keep their total exposure to the
property market at around 40 per cent of their loans in Hong Kong. Those
whose lending exceeds 40 per cent 'should consider how that percentage can
be stabilised and if necessary reduced'.
Mr Carse said his letter was intended as general guidance for banks. A large
part of bank lending goes to property 'and it keeps going up and up', he
said. But he added: 'I am not worried about a collapse in the property
market; it is still underpinned by strong demand.'
This view was echoed by Mr Paul Selway-Swift, general manager for Hong Kong
and China with Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. He said the bank was comfortable
with its exposure to residential and commercial property. But he was less
certain about prices being paid for development land. 'Only time will tell
if recent prices paid for land prove to be reasonable or far too high,' he
said.
The supply and demand outlook for residential property suggests that prices
are likely to remain under upward pressure. Hong Kong's developers released
on to the market 27,670 flats last year, 10 per cent fewer than forecast and
well below the average of 33,000 that was typical in the latter half of the
1980s.
The end-of-year vacancy rate for residential property had declined to 3.9
per cent from 4.2 per cent in 1992, suggesting that Hong Kong entered 1994
with a tight market. Relief for Hong Kong's home buyer, however, seems some
way off with the forecast completion of 33,000 flats this year and 31,800 in
1995.
Mr Hart of Crosby said it was difficult to judge accurately at what point in
the residential property cycle Hong Kong currently was. 'I believe we are
nearer to the top of the cycle than the bottom.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Cambodia acts to attract 'good' foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PHNOM PENH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Cambodian government has completed a draft investment law which it hopes
will help its efforts to change the country's image from the home of the
killing fields to an investment opportunity.
The law, which will be presented to donor countries at an aid conference in
Tokyo later this week, provides a wide range of incentives to what Mr Sam
Rainsy, finance minister, calls good investors. 'What I hope is that the
good investors will drive out the bad,' he said.
Mr Rainsy, who has acquired a reputation as a fighter because of his
outspoken criticism of his predecessors, wants to encourage investors
interested in the long-term development of Cambodia. He wants to keep out
those who are only interested in making a quick profit and then leaving.
Many of his criticisms are directed against Thai investors, who have gained
a reputation for short-term interest. Mr Rainsy complains about a Thai
'mafia' operating in Cambodia, which he says did corrupt deals with the old
government.
Mr Rainsy insists that he is not saying good investment depends on the
origin of the investor: 'I don't want to say that good or bad depends on the
nationality. So far, we have seen many bad investors from neighbouring
countries and many good investors from Europe and Japan, but I can give some
examples of bad investors coming even from Europe and America.'
Nonetheless, he has made bitter enemies among the Thai community, especially
in one company which he says is the centre of the Thai 'mafia' in Cambodia.
Mr Rainsy alleges that he is the subject of at least one murder contract.
He says his efforts to improve the investment environment will soon make
Cambodia more of a magnet to foreign investors than Vietnam: 'People talk a
lot about investment in Vietnam but in five or six years, Vietnam has
attracted only Dollars 1bn in foreign domestic investment, which is very
little compared to its size.'
'In Vietnam, there are many problems for foreign investors,' he says.
'First of all, Vietnam is still a communist country, with no political
freedom. In a country where there's no political freedom, it doesn't create
the right environment for the private sector to prosper.
So far, Cambodia has attracted very little foreign investment and the
projects which have been started have largely been in Mr Rainsy's 'bad'
category, buying up the country's natural resources for sale at a quick
profit. There is also no sign of foreign companies setting up offices in
Cambodia at anything like the speed they are arriving in Vietnam.
Nevertheless, given three to five years, the hyperactive finance minister
insists he could turn the economy around. Some of his hopes rest on this
week's donors meeting So far, the international community has poured nearly
Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) into Cambodia - including one of the largest United
Nations operations the world has ever seen.
Mr Rainsy believes the new government will show the world that its
investment has been worthwhile. 'We will show the international community
that Cambodia is worth helping. In order to show that, we have to
demonstrate our will and our ability to help ourselves first,' he said.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Greek consumer price rises slow: Economic watch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Greek consumer price index was up by just 0.2 per cent in February, from
the previous month, bringing the annual inflation rate down to 11 per cent,
from 11.1 per cent in January. The slight reduction was due to a fall in the
price of clothing, shoes and consumer durables in the winter sales. However,
in 1993, the consumer price index rose by 0.3 per cent between January and
February. Inflation in Greece fell to 12.1 per cent in 1993 from 14.4 per
cent in 1992 and is expected to fall below 10 per cent in this year.
Provisional new passenger car registrations in the European Union fell by an
estimated 1.8 per cent in February compared with a year earlier. The
strongest growth was in Denmark, where registrations rose by 56.5 per cent.
The greatest decline was in Greece, where registrations fell by 34.5 per
cent.
German wholesale sales in January climbed a real 4 per cent from a year
earlier and rose a seasonally and calendar-adjusted 1 per cent from
December.
The European Union issued its first figures on renewable energy production,
which was equivalent to 43.6m tonnes of oil in 1992, or 6.7 per cent of EU
primary energy production.

Moldovans overwhelmingly rejected a 50-year-old nationalist aspiration to
reunite with Romania in a national plebiscite on Sunday. Moldovans were
asked whether they supported 'an independent Moldova within its 1990
borders, which maintains neutrality, establishes ties with other nations and
provides equal rights for all citizens.' Of the two-thirds of the electorate
who voted, 90 per cent voted Yes to the question. President Mircea Snegur
hopes to use the result to lure back the breakaway republic of Trans-Dnestr,
which believes that Moldova, 60 per cent populated by ethnic Romanians, is
intent on reuniting with Romania.

Russian and Ukrainian officials are to meet in Moscow tomorrow to discuss a

the two states and raised fears over the security of Russian gas supplies to
western Europe. Gazprom, the Russian monopoly supplier of gas, said
yesterday it would maintain supplies to Ukraine at between 50m and 80m cu
metres a day - enough to keep houses heated, but not enough for industry.
Gazprom officials say Ukraine is taking extra supplies from the west
European pipeline, but Ukraine said the 200m cu metres a day it was
distributing was coming from Russian supplies and storage. The dispute is
over an unpaid bill claimed by Gazprom to be running at Rbs1,500bn.

<TEXT>
Several thousand German public service workers took part in token strikes
yesterday, to keep up pressure for a new pay offer. The workers are calling
for a 4 per cent rise to match inflation. The OTV public sector trade union
has rejected a pay freeze, but there were hints yesterday that a low wage
award might be combined with measures to secure jobs, as in the weekend
agreement reached by engineering workers. Mr Heinz Schleusser, finance
minister of North Rhine-Westphalia and chief negotiator on behalf of the 16
federal states, said a 2 per cent pay award from next January 1 might be
possible - ensuring a pay freeze in 1994. The union is seeking shorter
working hours, as an alternative to redundancies, in the face of public
service budget cuts. But it wants 50 per cent compensation for the loss of
earnings, which would push up hourly wage rates, although cutting overall
wages. The employers are insisting on a pay freeze, further cuts in fringe
benefits, and improved working flexibility. Talks affecting 3.5m public
sector workers re-open tomorrow.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Brittan opens race to succeed Delors: An undeclared campaign
to become the next president of the European Commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The official word in Brussels is that Sir Leon Brittan is not running a
campaign to become the next president of the European Commission.
This may surprise those watching the EU chief trade negotiator's tour des
capitales in 1994, a combination of private hints about presidential
ambitions with a torrent of speeches on the future of Europe.
Since the New Year, Sir Leon has visited Athens, Dublin, The Hague, London,
Madrid, and Rome. Copenhagen and Lisbon follow soon. Paris and Bonn are
being held back until nearer the European summit in Corfu in June, when the
successor to Mr Jacques Delors will be chosen. A book setting out Sir Leon's
vision of Europe just happens to be coming out at the end of the month.
Convention dictates that people do not campaign for the top executive post
in Brussels, a job which is within the gift of the heads of governments of
the 12, not the people. Mr Delors himself was a dark horse in 1984, winning
the race only after Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then UK prime minister,
reportedly vetoed the first French choice, Mr Claude Cheysson.
The Brittan campaign has broken diplomatic precedent, but it has opened up
the contest. A year ago, Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime minister, looked
certain to succeed Mr Delors on the grounds of 12 years experience and
small-state credentials.
This last asset is perhaps the most important. The Commission presidency
usually alternates between the large and small member states. Mr Delors
succeeded Mr Gaston Thorn (a former Luxembourg prime minister) who succeeded
Mr Roy Jenkins, (a former British minister).
Sir Leon has managed to halt the 'Lubbers bandwagon'. He has capitalised on
the Dutchman's sphinx-like silence on his own candidacy by setting out his
own stall, starting with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade talks
last December in which he played a star role. 'The Gatt deal showed that
Leon could deliver politically,' says a close aide.
So how many votes can Sir Leon count on? Possibly one, the British
government; and that is by no means an advantage because the single most
important challenge for the senior British commissioner in Brussels is to
convince the heads of government that he is not a stalking horse for the UK
government and its minimalist vision of European integration. However, the
British might be happy with a free-trading Dutchman at the helm with Sir
Leon as trade negotiator.
To overcome the handicap of nationality, Sir Leon has put distance between
himself and the government of Mr John Major. He supports the idea of a
common European foreign and security policy. He has taken to chastising the
US in public for not living up to its free trade rhetoric. He has warned the
UK on several occasions to take seriously the prospect of a 'hard-core' of
members states moving to European monetary union.
Most striking is his campaign to cultivate the French. For although there
are plenty of people in Paris ready to demonise Sir Leon as an Anglo-Saxon
free marketeer, there are others who are drawn by his charm, intelligence
and panache.
Despite clashes with the French government in the Gatt talks, Sir Leon left
enough 'wiggle room' to secure a better deal on agriculture from the US, and
to avoid opening up the Europe film market to Hollywood. He was also smart
enough to let the government of French prime minister Edouard Balladur take
the credit.
But Mr Balladur himself has refused to be drawn on a successor to Mr Delors.
Diplomats in Brussels suggest Paris would like to cut the Commission down to
size, a recognition that Mr Delors, after almost 10 years in power, was
becoming too big for his boots. By contrast, Sir Leon is preaching the
message of Commission restraint.
The crucial vote probably lies with Germany. There are persistent rumours
that Chancellor Helmut Kohl is not as keen on Mr Lubbers as first thought,
despite his fellow Christian Democrat credentials and his long presence on
the European stage.
Last year, Sir Leon raised his candidacy privately with the German
Chancellor; he was rebuffed. Also, the Brittan camp suggests that Mr Klaus
Kinkel, German foreign minister, favours Sir Leon's candidacy. Mr Kinkel is
said to have appreciated Sir Leon's success in balancing his independence as
the EU's trade negotiator with the need to prevent Franco-German differences
over trade from splitting the EU.
Sir Leon is also paying attention to the southern states, knowing that their
preferred candidate - Spain's prime minister Felipe Gonzalez - appears to
have ruled himself out. His strongest card is that none of the 'Club Med'
members are likely to be enthusiastic about a northern liberal like Mr
Lubbers.
Whatever the outcome - and the odds still look to favour Mr Lubbers - Sir
Leon's secondary agenda may be simply to convert his new political capital
into a big international job other than the presidency of the Commission.
At the least, he has avoided the mistake of his last bid for more power in
Brussels, an attempt to become one of two vice presidents under Mr Delors.
Two commissioners say he never bothered to ask for their vote, and
subsequently did not even make the run-off.

FT  08 MAR 94 / German N-waste plan clears legal hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A local court in Luneburg, in the state of Lower Saxony, yesterday gave its
approval for work to resume on investigations for Germany's first full-scale
nuclear waste disposal site in the disused salt mines at Gorleben, on the
banks of the river Elbe.
The decision amounts to an important victory for the federal government in
Bonn, and the nuclear energy industry, in their long-running battle with
environmentalists and the local state authorities to establish proper
nuclear waste disposal facilities at Gorleben.
If the Gorleben site eventually gets approval, it is supposed to provide
facilities for long-term disposal of high-level nuclear waste in addition to
interim storage facilities. That could mean Germany will no longer need to
send its highly radioactive nuclear waste for reprocessing in Britain, at
the Thorp plant at Sellafield, and in France.
The waste disposal plans for Gorleben have been resisted by the state
governments of Lower Saxony for almost 20 years, both by the conservative
Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and the left-wing Social Democratic Party
(SPD).
The decision on Gorleben means the issue could now once again blow up into a
political campaign theme, for state elections are due next Sunday. The SPD,
represented by environment minister Ms Monika Griefhahn, and its Green Party
partners in government, have insisted that Germany must abandon nuclear
energy.
The court order means state mining authorities are obliged to allow further
exploratory work on the salt mine workings, and the state government must
extend planning permission for the Gorleben complex as a whole. It also
overruled objections to the plans by the local landowners.
Yesterday's victory in Luneburg was tarnished by a setback for the nuclear
industry in another key battle in the state of Hesse. A fire in the
20-year-old nuclear power plant at Biblis, near Darmstadt, meant the station
could not be restarted as planned yesterday after routine maintenance.
The fire has given Mr Joschka Fischer, the Green party environment minister
in Hesse, new ammunition in his battle with Mr Klaus Topfer, CDU environment
minister in Bonn, over restarting the plant. Last week Mr Topfer ordered Mr
Fischer to let it go ahead.
Mr Fischer's greatest success in his campaign against nuclear power
generation has been in preventing operation of the Siemens MOX plant at
Hanau, where reprocessed plutonium from Britain and France is supposed to be
turned into mixed-oxide fuel elements for re-use in German nuclear power
stations. By holding up that process, he has called the whole nuclear cycle
into question.
There is growing pressure on the government and industry for direct disposal
of nuclear waste - at a site such as Gorleben - instead of reprocessing.
In Lower Saxony, however, the government is adamant it will not allow direct
disposal unless it knows quantities of radioactive waste are limited - that
is, that Germany will eventually abandon nuclear power generation.

FT  08 MAR 94 / EU weighs up the votes and the cod
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A handful of votes in the European Union's council of ministers, and a few
thousand tonnes of Norwegian cod, last night stood between the EU and its
biggest ever enlargement, to take in Sweden, Finland, Austria and possibly
Norway as new members.
As negotiations at foreign minister level broke up - to resume today - only
the dimmest glimmer of how to resolve the two rows could be discerned. Mr
Theodoros Pangalos, European affairs minister of Greece, warned that if a
solution was not found by lunchtime today, EU heads of government might have
to step in to solve the 'crisis', possibly at an emergency summit.
The two issues must be settled so that the European parliament can decide on
Thursday whether to start approval of the accession treaty in time for the
newcomers' entry next January. All applicants except Norway have settled
their entry terms. But the dispute over votes could jeopardise prospects of
early entry for all four.
Spain and the UK insist for different reasons on maintaining the right of
two large and one small member states to block EU measures in the council,
under the EU's weighted majority voting system. If the 'blocking minority'
is maintained at 23 votes, then the threshold of assent rises from 54 votes
out of 76 to 68 out of 90 once the four new members enter. A majority of the
12 want the blocking minority moved to 27.
Votes in the council are distributed roughly according to size of country.
But with four small newcomers, the British argue that the relationship
between size of population and voting strength is being stretched beyond the
bounds of democratic legitimacy. 'You could have a failed blocking minority
representing 41.5 per cent of the Union's population,' a UK official
complains. Spain worries that a move to 27 could see the South out-voted on
Mediterranean policy issues.
The Benelux countries, Ireland and France are firmly in the 27 votes camp,
but other countries are ambivalent. Italy, on the EU's federalist wing,
wants easier passage for Euro-laws, but equally wants to protect interests
like agriculture.
Germany, which after unification gets only one vote in Council for every 8m
Germans, against Luxembourg's one vote for every 200,000 of its inhabitants,
is nevertheless concerned above all to ensure enlargement goes ahead,
preferring to put off voting reform until the 1996 constitutional review.
Euro-MPs are threatening to stop accession unless the blocking minority is
changed, and the Dutch and Belgians warn that their national MPs might halt
ratification if Spain and Britain get their way. Mr Ken Collins, chairman of
the European parliament's influential environment committee, warned last
week that retaining the 23-votes blocking minority could undermine generally
higher green standards in the applicant states.
The four have been allowed to keep different environmental norms for four
years, during which the EU will review standards and possibly upgrade them.
Making it easier to block upgrading threatens this carefully crafted
formula.
Some EU negotiators speculated last night that some form of 'solemn
declaration' alongside the accession treaty might break the impasse. Spain
would have to be assured its interests would be taken into account; the UK
would at the very least need some guarantee that the 1996 review would match
inhabitants to votes more closely.
The votes dispute seemed to be encouraging Norway to dig in its heels on
fish, in the hope that if Spain got some satisfaction on voting it would
moderate its equally insistent demands for Norwegian cod.
Spain wants 7,000 tonnes to restore its 'historic' catch, before it was
barred from Norwegian waters in 1981, and its roughly half share of the
11,000 tonnes Norway cedes to the poorest Union members under this year's
European Economic Area (EEA) free trade zone treaty.
Under EEA arrangements for mutual access to waters, Norway also allows the
EU 40,000 tonnes of its cod quota from this year. But it is adamant that it
will surrender not one fish more - and even suggesting it could withdraw
these quotas if it joins the EU and its membership of the EEA therefore
lapses.
However, a Spanish fisheries official said: 'It doesn't matter to us where
these tonnes of fish come from. But we cannot go home without them. This is
not a bluff.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Privatisation of Renault faces delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has quietly signalled his
reluctance to privatise Renault, the state-owned car maker, this year, in
contrast to his industry minister's continued enthusiasm for going ahead
with the sale despite the break-up with Volvo.
The prime minister's officials insisted yesterday that no definite decision
had been made to delay the car company's privatisation.
But they did not refute a statement over the weekend by one of their number
that, with last month's sale of Elf-Aquitaine, the oil major, bringing in
FFr33bn (Pounds 3.8bn) and the imminent flotation of the big UAP insurance
group, prepared by decree last November, the government's goal of raising
FFr55bn from privatisation in 1994 'will be met'.
Nor did the officials damp speculation that Mr Balladur's reticence applies
chiefly to Renault, though 16 other companies remain on the government's
privatisation list.
Only last week, in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Gerard Longuet,
the industry minister, said he still hoped that Renault could be sold off
this year - depending on the state of the stock market - as had been planned
in the context of its merger with Volvo. An official at the prime minister's
office insisted yesterday that any caution on Mr Balladur's part was 'not
cyclical' and not related to the fear that recent volatility on the stock
market might interrupt privatisation, as the 1987 crash did the last round
of state assets sales.
Some French press analysis of Mr Balladur's reservations about an early
Renault sale have highlighted resistance by the communist-leaning CGT union
inside Renault and the prime minister's desire not to add to the trade union
opposition he is already meeting on wage legislation.
Another possible factor mentioned by observers is the fact that Mr Louis
Schweitzer's mandate as president of Renault comes up for renewal in May,
and that delay could give Mr Balladur the chance to substitute for this
Socialist appointee a political loyalist to take the company into the
private sector.
Renault itself refused to comment yesterday, except to say that delay would
not complicate the financial divorce provisions it has already agreed with
Volvo, unless it extended later than mid-1996. That is well after the May
1995 presidential election, which could give Mr Balladur or any other
conservative incumbent of the Elysee, a freer hand on privatisation.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Poland and Hungary step up pressure
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary and Poland yesterday stepped up pressure to be made members of the
European Union and to force the EU to open its doors to eastern Europe by
the end of the decade.
Hungary said it would submit a formal application to join the Union next
month, with the goal of starting accession talks in 1997. Poland raised the
possibility of immediate 'partial membership' of the EU, through full
participation in the EU's foreign and security activities, as well as
justice and home affairs.
The diplomatic moves followed inaugural 'association councils' between
foreign ministers of the 12 and their Polish and Hungarian counterparts.
These councils are the new vehicles for co-operation between the EU and the
six 'associate' EU member states: Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic,
Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.
Foreign ministers also agreed to an Anglo-Italian plan for formal
co-operation at international conferences and 'joint foreign policy actions'
with the associate EU members. But more work is needed on justice and
immigration.
The Anglo-Italian initiative is part of a broader reassessment of EU policy
toward central and eastern Europe which began at last June's European summit
in Copenhagen. At that time, EU leaders agreed to the principle, but not the
timing, of EU membership for the six ex-communist countries.
Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Polish foreign minister, pressed his EU counterparts
yesterday to consider 'partial membership'. This would involve a delay in
Poland taking on full economic commitments while allowing immediate
participation in other areas.

FT  08 MAR 94 / French move on organised crime
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading French judge yesterday handed the justice minister a report
recommending the creation of 11 regional police squads to fight organised
crime, writes David Buchan.
Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, a justice ministry adviser, is reported to have
criticised an inter-ministerial body, the Central Service for the Prevention
of Corruption, for not acting on a dozen cases which it should be following
up, including 'at least four concerning elected politicians and
journalists'.
The report comes as the murder of a French deputy in the south of France 10
days ago has focused attention on organised crime in the Riviera and
coincides with a parliamentary by-election in scandal-ridden Nice. After a
first round of voting at the weekend, the Gaullist mayor of Nice, Mr
Jean-Paul Barety, looks likely to win next Sunday, despite an exceptionally
strong showing by his National Front rival.
Mr Barety beat Mr Jacques Peyrat, the National Front candidate, by just 34
votes but the Socialist party is now expected to openly support Mr Barety.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Major acts to avert leadership challenge: PM warns he will
fight to stay in office as Hurd seeks to unite party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday sought to pre-empt a challenge to his party
leadership later this year with a blunt warning to Tory critics that he
would fight to remain in 10 Downing Street.
In a move calculated to avert the threat of a leadership crisis after this
summer's local and European elections, the prime minister said he had a
mandate to remain in office at least until the general election due by 1997.
His comments coincided with a renewed attempt by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, to unite the Conservative party around a common position for the
June European elections.
In a speech echoed by the prime minister, Mr Hurd said Europe should abandon
grand ambitions for a federal structure in favour of making the present
institutions work effectively.
But amid a continuing battle within the Conservative party to shape its
manifesto for the European elections, that stance was attacked by Sir Edward
Heath, former prime minister, who said it would diminish Britain's influence
within the Union.
Mr Major's remarks followed the speculation at Westminster that Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has been positioning himself to
challenge Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, for the leadership if Mr Major
steps down.
Mr Clarke, in an interview with The Independent, made it clear that he
remained a contender for the leadership, 'but at a time of John Major's
choosing'.
Speaking on BBC Radio's Jimmy Young programme, Mr Major brushed aside
suggestions that the expected defeats for the Conservatives in the local and
European elections in May and June could force him from office.
Recalling that in 1992 the Conservatives had won more votes than any party
in UK history, he said: 'I was elected to remain prime minister of this
country at least until the next election and beyond it if I win it.'
Mr Major said talk that Mr Heseltine was poised to replace him was 'unreal'.
He declared: 'I have never run away from a challenge in my life and I'm
surely not doing so now.'
Acknowledging that he had faced constant allegations of weakness and
indecision, Mr Major insisted that he had not been shaken from his main
policy objectives: 'The things that matter are what emerges at the end of
the struggles, not what vitriol may be hurled during the time of the
struggles.'
He offered an upbeat assessment of economic prospects, emphasising that
inflation was set to remain below 3 per cent and that growth this year would
meet the Treasury's forecast of 2.5 per cent. But Mr Major was forced to
admit that the Conservatives' pre-election promises in 1992 to cut taxes had
been based on an over-optimistic assessment of the economic outlook.
Referring to the impending tax increases, he said: 'We did get it wrong. But
the important thing, having got it wrong, is not to shrink from the action
that is necessary to put the economy on the right path.'
Mr Clarke said that he did not propose to reduce taxes 'before recovery or
before we have healthier public finances'.
Mr Major accepted that the government had made a 'mistake' when in 1988 it
had briefly linked the sale of arms to Malaysia with aid provision. The
mistake had been put right, he said.
A new opinion poll in Scotland, published last night, showed the
Conservatives with the support of just 13 per cent of voters.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Martin Marietta bids for Grumman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Marietta, which has become one of the US's largest defence
contractors after a series of acquisitions, launched an agreed Dollars 1.9bn
(Pounds 1.3bn) bid for fellow defence group Grumman yesterday.
It is Martin Marietta's third big takeover deal in less than 18 months and
marks a further consolidation of the US defence industry, which is
rationalising in the face of a rapidly shrinking defence budget.
Maryland-based Martin Marietta is to pay Dollars 55 a share in cash for
Grumman, which is based in Long Island, New York. Grumman's shares closed
Dollars 14 1/4 up at Dollars 54 1/8 . Wall Street enthusiasm for the deal
pushed Martin Marietta stock up Dollars 1 1/4 to close at Dollars 46.
Martin Marietta bought General Electric's aerospace division for Dollars 3bn
in late 1992 and is currently in the final stages of buying General
Dynamics' space launch business for Dollars 208.5m.
Grumman, which reported a 1993 income of Dollars 120.5m, or Dollars 3.50 a
share from continuing operations, on sales of Dollars 3.2bn, used to be
known primarily as a maker of military aircraft, such as the F-14 fighter.
However, a dearth of orders in recent years has forced it to diversify into
electronics and data systems, and the only aircraft it now makes is the E-2C
Hawkeye, a carrier-based early warning aircraft. Its biggest electronics
programme is the J-Stars airborne surveillance system.
Martin Marietta, with 1993 sales of Dollars 9.3bn and earnings of Dollars
450m before special charges, has become the world's largest aerospace
electronics contractor.
Mr Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta, said the two companies
were complementary both in terms of their businesses and geographical areas
of operation. The acquisition should also mean an immediate improvement in
Martin Marietta's earnings per share.
The deal, taken together with the earlier acquisitions, will give Martin
Marietta 'critical mass' in every one of its product areas.
Mr Augustine refused to rule out job cuts as the result of the merger, and
analysts expect a substantial rationalisation. Martin Marietta has gained
considerable experience in cost-cutting from its takeover of the GE
business, which led to the closure of about a dozen plants.
Mr Renso Caporali, chairman of Grumman, said it had decided already that it
needed to make a strategic move to thrive in a shrinking defence market.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Central banks rule out move to curb hedge funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central bank governors yesterday decided against any immediate move to curb
the activities either of hedge funds or of banks that use their own capital
to trade on international financial markets.
Bank governors from the Group of Ten countries agreed at their monthly
meeting in Basle that markets had corrected themselves and there was no
reason to anticipate further turbulence.
Most European bond and equity markets made healthy gains yesterday as hopes
rose that the German engineering pay settlement at the weekend could give
the Bundesbank room to cut interest rates and open the way to lower rates
elsewhere.
There has been concern that US hedge funds, which are estimated to trade
with at least Dollars 50bn (Pounds 34.2bn) of capital, have increased
volatility in the past two weeks by selling bonds and trading financial
derivatives.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank and chairman of the G10
governors, said they had taken 'a relatively relaxed view' of recent price
falls. 'It was seen to some extent as a correction of a development before,
and the view was that the fundamentals are more or less sound. That means
there is no reason for further turbulence.'
Mr Tietmeyer said central banks would examine further the activities of
'hedging institutions', including hedge funds. 'We are willing to examine
closely what is going on with these new techniques, but we do not think that
there is for the time being any need for specific regulations,' he said.
Although some central bankers previously had expressed concern about the
rapid growth of trading of derivatives such as interest rate and currency
swaps, Mr Tietmeyer said the governors had not reached a final decision.
'We think we have got to live with these new techniques, but we will follow
closely what is going on,' he said.
There have been worries over the activities both of hedge funds - limited
partnerships mostly managed from the US, which attempt to make big
short-term gains on financial markets through leveraged and high-risk
investments - and the proprietary trading activities of banks and investment
banks.
The Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve have been taking soundings
among the banks they supervise to assess their exposure to hedge funds. The
funds themselves are largely based offshore and fall outside the direct
control of banking and securities regulators.
Mr Tietmeyer also said a big jump in the German M3 money supply in January -
growth at an annualised rate of 20.6 per cent - would not affect the
Bundesbank's long-term monetary targets. The M3 figure led to a sharp fall
in bond prices when it was disclosed last Wednesday.
He said there was 'no reason' for financial markets to remain concerned.
'The M3 figures are to some extent due to special factors, and of course we
hope their influence will disappear over time, and our monetary policy is
targeted to a whole year,' he said.
On the bourses yesterday, Frankfurt rose 2.4 per cent, while Paris advanced
1.9 per cent and Amsterdam put on 2.5 per cent. London rose by less than 1
per cent but the FT-SE 100 index regained the 3,300 level lost during the
recent shakeout. It rose 27.9 to close at 3,305.9. Wall Street also edged
higher. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 23.92 up at 3,856.22.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Clinton defends wife over Whitewater allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton coupled a stirring defence of his wife's integrity
with a blistering attack on the Republican party yesterday in his first
public comments since White House handling of the Whitewater affair forced
the resignation of his legal counsel last weekend.
'I have never known a person with a stronger sense of right and wrong than
my wife - ever,' he told a press conference held jointly with Mr Eduard
Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader.
'She has unfailingly always done the right thing. People can ask whatever
questions they want, and we will do our best to comply. But I'm just telling
you, the American people can worry about something else.
'Her moral compass is as strong as anybody's in the country, and they will
see that.'
He was responding, with controlled anger, to questions about a press report
that Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton had ordered in 1992 the shredding of
documents at her former law firm in Arkansas. Also several US newspapers and
magazines have in the last 48 hours run critical articles focusing on the
First Lady's uniquely influential role.
Mr Clinton committed himself, his wife and his administration to full
co-operation with Mr Robert Fiske, the special counsel investigating their
complex land and financial dealings in Arkansas in the 1980s. 'We are not
covering up, we're opening up,' he declared.
He said he knew nothing in advance about two meetings between White House
and Treasury officials concerning investigations into the Arkansas savings
and loan institution alleged to have funnelled money to his 1984 re-election
campaign. He had been apprised only after the event about a third meeting.
Equally striking was his attack on the Republican party, some of whose
leading lights, such as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, have begun to speak of
the president being forced from office because of Whitewater. Comparisons
with Watergate, which brought down President Richard Nixon in 1974, were the
product of 'blatantly partisan' Republican 'hysteria'.
Yesterday, Republicans in congress continued to demand hearings on
Whitewater. But it emerged last night that Mr Fiske had told congressional
leaders that hearings might complicate his own investigations.
Mr Clinton warned the opposition:
'What they do today, as Republicans, as a party, may look good today. It may
not look good when the independent counsel finishes his work. I think they
ought to think long and hard about whether this sort of partisan clamour and
careless use of language is really not only in the best interests of the
American people but in the best interests of their party.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Business mission flies to Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE, JIMMY BURNS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of leading British businessmen, including Lord Prior, chairman of
GEC and a former cabinet minister, has flown to Kuala Lumpur in an attempt
to persuade the Malaysian government to lift its trade ban on UK companies.
The group includes Sir Charles Powell, a director of Trafalgar House and
former foreign affairs adviser to Mr John Major and Lady Thatcher. It is
engaged in an intense round of private diplomacy with Malaysian officials to
try to reverse the ban.
There were conflicting signs over whether this new mission could persuade Dr
Mahathir Mohammad, the Malaysian prime minister, to reverse his policy,
which followed allegations in British newspapers that UK companies had
offered bribes to Malaysia's politicians in return for contracts.
Some British industrialists have taken heart from a statement made at the
weekend by Mr Abu Kamaradin, the Malaysian high commissioner in London, who
referred to his government talking to 'diplomatic channels' and to reopening
'excellent contacts' because of 'good relations over years'.
In London, one leading government minister was also confident that the
Malaysians were seeking a way to drop the ban. The issue was simply how they
could do so 'without losing face'.
But there were few signs elsewhere of any movement on the issue. 'I think
the Malaysian government is prepared to go all the way on this, especially
if there is any retaliatory action by Britain,' said Mr Razaleigh Hamzah,
the leader of one of Malaysia's small opposition parties.
Representatives of the opposition in Malaysia said the ban on British
companies should be lifted immediately.
UK construction company John Laing has already withdrawn from preliminary
tendering for a MDollars 3bn (Pounds 750m) contract to build a new airport
terminal.

These rates are published monthly by the Financial Times, normally towards
the middle of the month.
A premium of 0.2 per cent is to be added to the credit rates when fixing at
bid. Interest rates may not be fixed for more than 120 days.
SDR-based rates of interest are the same for all currencies but must be used
only for the OECD-defined poor countries.
Between January 15 and July 14, the SDR-based rate will be 5.95 per cent. It
replaces the previous rate of 6.85 per cent. The SDR-based rate will again
change on July 15.
CORRECTION
Due to a transmission error, the OECD Export Credit Rates for the US dollar
for up to 5 years should have read 5.83, not 5.43, per cent as reported in
the Financial Times of March 8.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Israeli economic reforms praised by IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund has praised Israel's economic reform
programme as laying the conditions for high and sustainable growth but
warned against complacency over inflation, Julian Ozanne writes.
In a report released in Jerusalem yesterday, the IMF backs Israel's central
bank which has clashed with the finance ministry over increasing interest
rates to meet an inflation target of 8 per cent for 1994. Inflation last
year ended at 11.2 per cent.
The fund welcomed the interest rate increase and said maintaining the full
independence of the central bank was important to macro-economic
credibility. The fund said the primary focus of Israel's monetary policy
should be 'attainment of the inflation target'.
The fund generally praised the economic reform drive but said the process
should be reinvigorated, particularly in the areas of privatisation policy,
banking sector reform, labour market reform and the further liberalisation
of the trade and capital accounts.

<TEXT>
Switzerland's largest financial group publishes 1993 results on Tuesday, and
they are bound to be good. Credit Suisse, the bank which accounted for over
80 per cent of 1992 group profits, has just reported a 53 per cent jump in
net income and CS First Boston, the New York investment bank subsidiary, an
87 per cent leap. The question is whether CS will be less miserly with a
dividend increase than the other two big Swiss banks.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Survey of Azerbaijan (4): Stalin's map explodes - The
conflict which has created 1m refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For six years Azerbaijan's politics and economy have been dominated by the
fortunes of a war on an obscure battlefield in its western mountains.
Five Baku governments have fallen, more than a fifth of the republic's
territory has been conquered by ethnic Armenian separatists and 1m Azeris
have become refugees. But neither side is yet ready to compromise and peace
seems distant.
Since coming to power eight months ago, the Azerbaijan president, Mr Heydar
Aliev, has prosecuted the war more boldly than his predecessors in the hope
of strengthening the republic's bargaining position. He has launched two
major offensives, but both failed. The first was undermined by desertions,
the latter by unsuccessful 'human wave' tactics reminiscent of Iranian
offensives in the 1980s war with Iraq.
As a result of these frustrations, the government has shrunk from radical
reform, contenting itself with get-rich-quick foreign trade deals.
The war, one of the fiercest in the former Soviet Union, stems from the
separatist aspirations of Armenian communities in the western region of
Nagorno-Karabakh. Its seeds were sown by Josef Stalin in 1923 when, despite
its majority Armenian population, Stalin made Nagorno-Karabakh part of
Azerbaijan.
After simmering for many years, the issue exploded in 1988, when
Nagorno-Karabakh's governing council voted to unite with the republic of
Armenia.
Now the fighting engulfs much of western Azerbaijan. The Armenians control
territory all the way to the Iranian border, and threaten to push north into
Azerbaijan's third city, Ganja.
Mr Aliev, a former member of the ruling Soviet Communist Party politburo,
appears to be politically secure but Azerbaijan has been so volatile since
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 that Western analysts say they do
not know how long he will last. He himself came to power in a coup by
Azerbaijan's disgraced former main battlefield commander in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
Meanwhile, western-led peace efforts continue. The European Council for
Security and Cooperation has resumed its so-called Minsk peace efforts with
an official scheduled tour of Azerbaijan and Armenia this month. Last month,
Russian defence minister Pavel Grachev persuaded both sides to accept a
truce, and there were signs that Moscow could push for further negotiations.
But the situation is not hopeful. Unlike in Bosnia, where an international
consensus has finally forced serious moves toward reconciliation, there is
no solid Western pressure on the Nagorno-Karabakh combatants.
The majority Azeris simply want to see the ethnic Armenians withdraw from
all captured territory, and make do with cultural autonomy for
Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian separatists, however, demand the independence
of Nagorno-Karabakh as the minimum condition for peace. They do not say what
else they want, but their scorched earth tactics in captured Azeri towns
suggests that they will also claim at least some of the additional territory
now in their hands.
Mr Aliev has appealed for help from the US, Turkey and Iran, but so far
seems to have gained little more than the dispatch of some military
advisers.
Late last year, Mr Aliev sought what senior Western diplomats and Azeri
analysts believe was a quid pro quo: in exchange for Moscow's military
assistance, Mr Aliev agreed to Azerbaijan joining the Russia-dominated
Commonwealth of Independent States.
He also awarded Russia a share in a Western-led oil deal to develop
Azerbaijan's rich offshore fields.
But there is little sign of effective Russian help. With his army weakened
by desertions, Mr Aliev sent an aide last August to Afghanistan to 'borrow'
some of that country's mujahideen rebels.
More than 1,000 Afghans came to Azerbaijan and faced their first test in
October, when Mr Aliev launched his first offensive. The surprise attack, in
the southwestern Zangelan region near Iran, was spearheaded by the Afghans.
They advanced a few kilometres, before they and the Azeris fled from an
Armenian counterattack. The Armenians then promptly drove some 60,000 local
Azeris from their homes.
Mr Aliev almost immediately began to prepare another attack. In November,
thousands of young men were called up and given a few days of basic
training.
On December 15, Azerbaijan attacked in several places, mostly in the
southwest and in strategic Kelbajar, next to Armenia's border. The the
ethnic Armenians were pushed back, but at the beginning of February they
again resumed the upper hand. The Azeris have held the town of Horadiz on
the Azerbaijan-Iranian border, but they have been ousted from Kelbajar and
pushed over the important Morov mountains.
A walk through Martyr's Cemetery on a Baku hillside shows the result of
Azerbaijan's new offensive. There are rows of shrines decorated with red,
pink and white carnations and new concrete tablets attest to the daily
funerals of fresh war victims.
Conservative Western estimates put Azerbaijan's dead in the latest offensive
at 4,000 men, and Armenian losses in the hundreds. These are higher figures
than for the previous two years of fighting. The sixth year of the war is
estimated to have seen more than 15,000 dead on both sides.
With the Armenian forces now controlling the Morov heights, Western analysts
worry that Ganja, the site of a former major Soviet Army base, may be
subject to rocket attacks.
'You can't put together any real army here to fight the Armenians. There is
a lack of determination in the people fighting, a disarray in the ranks,'
said a Western diplomat in Baku.
'This country is capable of gaining and holding ground only temporarily. If
the Armenians don't retake territory immediately, it is only for political
reasons, not because they cannot.'

FT  07 MAR 94 / Survey of Azerbaijan (5): Between Russia, Turkey and Asia -
Diplomacy and power politics on the Caspian Sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The basic pillars of Azerbaijani foreign policy are to balance its interests
between Russia and Turkey in the first place; to increase its developing
contacts with Western states, using the leverage of its Caspian Sea oil; to
remain on good but not close relations with neighbouring Iran, where
millions of Azeris also live; to continue membership of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, and to develop, especially, better relations with the
Central Asian states, which are, like Azerbaijan, moderately Moslem.
These new objectives, expounded by President Heydar Aliev and Mr Vafa
Gulizade, his adviser on foreign affairs, are meant to address two issues.
First and most urgently, they are seen as a way of achieving a ceasefire in
the undeclared war with Armenia - a conflict that Armenia has in the last
two years been winning. It is Azerbaijan's view that only Russia is capable
of stopping the war - arguing that Moscow is making it possible for Armenia
to fight.
Says Mr Gulizade: 'Armenia receives 90 per cent of its supplies from Russia,
and thus Russia could stop her in a minute. As soon as Russia threatens
supplies, Armenia will negotiate.'
A ceasefire has presently been arranged, under Russian auspices (by Gen.
Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister). This tentative agreement is
supposed to be followed by talks between Mr Aliev and Mr Levan
Ter-Petrosian, the Armenian president, probably also in Moscow.
Mr Aliev, in an interview, was sceptical: 'We have had so many ceasefires.
In many of them, the Armenians used the time to again attack. I am not
against the Russian initiative but our key demand is that the Armenians
withdraw.'
In invoking Russian aid to settle the war, Mr Aliev is, as he knows well,
being drawn into a complex negotiation. Russia will settle the wars along
its borders at a price. One is a share of a rich Azerbaijani oil deal led by
British Petroleum (see article on oil), in addition to the right to
establish new military installations.
When the latter question was put to Mr Aliev, he claimed, 'The issue has not
come up before me.'
Mr Gulizade is a little more forthcoming: 'In principle I'm not against it.
The world in which we live is a world of realities. And in the real world,
countries can lease bases in other countries. There is nothing against it.'
Turkey, on the other hand - 'a brother country', as Mr Gulizade calls it -
has less obvious political influence but more of a goal to which Azerbaijan
can strive.
In a February trip to Ankara, Mr Aliev won the important declaration from
Turkey's leadership that he was a valued friend. This was vital because,
since he was instrumental in the fall of Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, the previous
president who was decidedly pro-Turkish, Mr Aliev needed to ensure that
relations with Ankara were not too raw.
In addition, there is grave concern in Ankara about Russia's ambitions in
the largely Turkic, former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Central Asia.
Ankara, which until recently was viewed as the west's bulwark in Central
Asia and the Caucasus, believes with some cause that Russia is trying to
bully its way into the region and push Turkey out.
Azerbaijan's key politicians agree that much of the republic's future is
dependent on how Russia asserts its perceived rights in its 'near abroad.'
'If Russia's policy doesn't moderate, and the west doesn't become a
balancing force in this region, we realise there is going to be a problem
for Azerbaijan - for any government of Azerbaijan,' said Mr Isa Gambar,
leader of the opposition Mussawat political party.
The West is seen by Mr Aliev as 'the natural direction of our policy'. He
says that 'we share similar values - a belief in democracy, in the rule of
law and in the market system. We must build the culture of these here and
for that we will need assistance'.
The long-sought oil agreement is key to most of Azerbaijan's plans, both
political and economic. The currently discussed Dollars 250m signing bonus
from the BP-led western consortium would offer Mr Aliev immediate tools to
improve his influence at home and abroad. Domestically, he is still widely
respected and has a commanding presence, but he needs to start delivering
tangible achievements.
On foreign policy, it has not gone unnoticed in Baku that the huge oil
contracts already signed in the neighbouring Caspian Sea state of Kazakhstan
have helped give its president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbaev, access to the
highest power circles abroad. Mr Nazarbaev, for example, recently returned
from a successful visit to Washington where he was granted almost Dollars
400m in assistance. Azerbaijan leaders hope the oil agreement will gain them
similar western aid.
Together with religion, energy is the main common bond between Azerbaijan
and its neighbours across the Caspian Sea. The region's natural gas and oil
wealth links energy inextricably with its political future. This makes a
Central Asian-Azerbaijan alliance vital, particularly an increase in trade
across the Caspian.
Thus far, however, Caucasia and Central Asia have had very differing
political cultures. Conservative Central Asia was remarkably free of
anti-Soviet campaigns, unlike the Caucasus which saw widescale anti-Soviet
protest movements.
Air traffic between Baku and Central Asia's key hub, the Uzbekistan capital
of Tashkent, has been severed for more than a year. The breach began when
Azerbaijan allowed an Uzbek political opposition figure to stay in Baku
after he was assaulted in Tashkent.
Azerbaijan leaders have tended to take a far more lenient posture toward
political rivalry than have Central Asia's presidents.
This is part of Azerbaijan's paradox - its resources and political character
could give it a smooth eventual transition into a country that can do
business with a wide range of Asian and western nations. But its strategic
location on the edge of the Moslem world and the former Soviet southern rim
makes it a highly tempting target for Russian ambitions.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Survey of Azerbaijan (3): Oil and bribery lubricate the
wheels - Vitality and stagnation are the hall-mark of the post-Communist
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Azerbaijan looks to oil as the mainspring of its economic future and of
closer relations with the capitalist world.
In the meantime, its first post-Soviet governments have done little in the
way of economic reform. However, this has not prevented the emergence of the
liveliest trading climate on the southern fringe of the former Soviet Union,
after Kazakhstan, the economic leader in the Caucasus and Central Asia.
The people of Baku have access to a wide range of products from processed
foods to electrical appliances.
The influx has been generated by enterprising merchants who have made a
fortune exporting relatively cheap Russian or local scrap iron, rare metals
and other resources in exchange for consumer goods.
This activity has been vital in preventing Azerbaijan from slipping further
into the economic swamp that has engulfed neighbouring Armenia and Georgia.
However, although it has kept the economy ticking over, this trading has not
really altered Azerbaijan's general standard of living.
Over the last two years, the economy has contracted by 40 per cent and there
has been 1,000 per cent annual inflation. Azeri economists complain that,
while making their quick profits, businessmen have failed to start creating
the fundamental infrastructure and industrial investment that the republic
desperately needs.
'Instead of investing and waiting to earn profit after two years, they
prefer to buy junk from Tajikistan or Russia, resell it to Turkey or Iran,
and make a fortune,' said Mr Bajram Mamed Rzajev, an official in the
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. 'It's easy to become a Rockefeller
here.'
Most Azerbaijan officials still think in Soviet economic terms, and
President Heydar Aliev would face bureaucratic obstacles to market reforms.
In any case, the economic reforms discussed by all six governments over the
past two years have been paralysed by the six year-old war with Armenia.
A third of Azerbaijan's agricultural production - which accounts for 26 per
cent of the economy - comes from areas caught up in the fighting. In
addition, the conflict has also prevented Azerbaijan from being helped by
international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund.
Heavy industry, such as steel and oil equipment, has also been paralysed by
the rupture of trade links with other ex-Soviet nations. The 14 oil
equipment plants, for example, used to supply two-thirds of the Soviet
Union's needs.
In January, Azerbaijan's industrial output fell by 11.3 per cent compared
with a year earlier, due largely to lack of raw materials from other former
Soviet republics.
In spite of these problems, Mr Aliev has given no priority to economic
affairs. Senior positions in the taxation and foreign economic affairs
ministries remain unfilled. 'How can you leave these key ministries empty?'
asked a senior western diplomat, interviewed in Baku. 'These are vital to
the economy.'
There are many more complaints. Corruption is so common that western
diplomats and businessmen judge officials not according to whether they take
bribes but whether, having received them, they will still block necessary
market reforms or licence applications.
Another key problem, seen in other ex-Soviet republics, is the banking
sector. Although about 180 private banks are registered in Baku, corruption
and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh have rendered them ineffective for the
purposes of investment.
The banks' main function is to lend money to traders for a month so that
they can buy and sell commodities at a steep profit and repay their loans at
100 per cent interest.
'I don't think anyone here is interested in investment in any industrial
project. If they happen to be interested in long-term credit, it's probably
for trade,' said a senior western diplomat. 'Since inflation is so high,
traders are happy to pay 100 per cent interest. They would be willing to pay
several times that to get credit.'
The government has hard currency reserves, estimated at more than Dollars
300m. But it is not sure of their exact value because state enterprises are
discouraged from repatriating their profits.
The government requires 85 per cent of hard currency earned from the sale of
'strategic goods' to be surrendered to the state in exchange for the local
currency, the manat. Almost 75 per cent of all traded goods fall into this
category. When factories earn cash from exports, therefore, they often do
their utmost to bank the proceeds abroad.
Mahmud Mamedov, a dentist during Soviet times, is one of Baku's wealthiest
traders. He earned his first big money in the kind of rapid trading now
practised by many new entrepreneurs in Baku. Mr Mamedov, who sports gold
jewelry and a check sportsjacket, did so well that he now owns a bank, a
television station, a newspaper and one of Baku's top two hotels, which he
says he is refurbishing to international standards.
Mr Mamedov is scathing, sarcastic and somewhat patronising towards
government bureaucrats who he believes are mishandling the economy. But he
is a past master at dodging obstacles raised by the officials.
'You can't blame them. They lived for 70 years with the old system,' he
said. 'The ministers are accustomed only to taking bribes.  .. Until real
businessmen come to power, I don't expect a real economic plan.'

FT  07 MAR 94 / Survey of Azerbaijan (2): The Great Game revisited - How
Russia, the West and Turkey are jockeying for Baku's oil favours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crude is not necessarily the first word on the lips of Western and local
oilmen in the Azerbaijan capital, Baku. These days their first utterance is
just as likely to be 'Russia'.
The oilmen are preoccupied by a revival of the 19th century Great Game, in
which Russia vied for influence in the region against Britain, Iran and
Turkey.
The new round of this old game threatens to block a Dollars 11.8bn British
Petroleum-led oil proposal to resurrect Baku as a world oil leader.
One of three new oil producing republics on the shores of the Caspian Sea,
Azerbaijan possesses more than 4bn barrels of proven oil reserves. Industry
analysts believe that together with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan
could form the world's third-largest oil-producing region, after Siberia and
the Gulf.
For Azerbaijan, a century after Robert Nobel developed the Baku oil fields,
the same resource could be the basis for Azerbaijan's long-term independence
from Moscow for the first time since Czar Alexander the First's conquest of
the area.
President Heydar Aliev has just delayed a contract with the BP-led group, in
what industry analysts see as the beginning of a pitch for more Western aid
against a Russian effort to consolidate Moscow's economic and political
influence in the region two years after the fall of the Soviet Union.
'In Aliev's mind, he's negotiating Azerbaijan's international future, using
the only commodity he's got - the oil,' said a Western oil executive
involved in the Baku negotiations. 'He's trying to get as much as he can
before giving it up.'
The revival of Great Game politics on the shores of the Caspian comes four
years after Western oil companies began speaking with Azerbaijan about its
oil. The talks have involved not only new production. With their rickety old
equipment, the existing oilfields' production is declining - last year it
fell to 10.25m tonnes from 13.1m tonnes in 1989 - and western companies are
being asked to re-equip them.
Eight Western companies have won shares of the proposed oil production
contract. Besides BP, they are Amoco Production, McDermott International
Inc., Pennzoil, Ramco Energy Ltd., Statoil, Turkish Petroleum and Unical.
Since moving in, the companies have invested Dollars 140m in bonuses,
demonstration projects and charity, and most have opened plush,
computer-lined offices in Baku.
The deal has seemed close to signing several times, but on each occasion has
been held up because of the republic's political instability. Last June, two
weeks before the then President Abulfaz Elchibey was to sign the deal in
London, a military rebellion overthrew his government.
Then in November, Mr Aliyev, who criticised Mr Elchibey's version as
insufficiently lucrative, came close to a new deal that raised Azerbaijan's
percentage of proceeds from 70 per cent to 80 per cent and added Dollars
200m to a previously arranged Dollars 300m signing bonus. Ultimately,
Azerbaijan was to receive Dollars 94bn in profit over 35 years, and the
companies Dollars 24bn.
Mr Aliev, however, had second thoughts, and now may agree to a lower return
over the long term if he can receive more in the first 10 years of
production, according to an informed Western diplomat. Under the abandoned
deal, the diplomat said, Azerbaijan's proceeds in the first decade would
have been just 30 per cent, as the companies recovered their share of
Dollars 7bn in projected development costs.
Meanwhile, with the talks idling, some of the companies have lowered their
profile in Baku. BP, which in partnership with Norway's Statoil has the
greatest exposure with a 36.7 percent stake, has reduced its Azerbaijan
project staff from 80 to 30.
Diplomats and industry analysts say that Mr Aliev is not negotiating in bad
faith. He is merely responding to increased pressures, they say.
Among them are the public's desperation for a favourable end to Azerbaijan's
six-year undeclared war with Armenia, in which thousands of Azeris have died
in the last two months alone.
There also is dissatisfaction with the republic's unremitting economic
collapse, in which production has shrunk at least 40 per cent in just the
last two years.
And there are Russia and the oil, issues that have seemed increasingly
intertwined.
It is hard to see what pressure Mr Aliev thinks the US and European
companies can exert on Moscow, but he clearly wants a minimum breathing
space.
'Azerbaijan has no lobby in any Western country. But when the oil agreement
is signed, it will have economic relations with these countries,' and thus a
voice there, said Ms. Leyla Yunusova, a former deputy defence minister and
now a private military analyst.
For its part, Moscow wants a share in Azerbaijan's major oil projects, and
abandonment of a Dollars 1.4bn proposal to divert oil shipments through a
Turkish pipeline to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
Russia wants Baku to continue shipping its oil to its Black Sea port of
Novorossisk through an expanded or new pipeline. A new pipeline to
Novorossisk would cost an estimated Dollars 2bn.
Mr Aliev already has awarded Russia's state-owned Lukoil company a minimum
10 per cent equity share of the estimated 3bn-barrel oil deal under
negotiation with the BP-led group. He also has agreed to separate, joint
development with Lukoil of the 1.4bn-barrel Guneshli offshore oilfield,
which until October was supposed to be part of the Western-led venture.
Moscow is not the only former Great Game player to be cut in on the deal
late in the game. In 1992, Ankara's Turkish Petroleum was awarded a share.
But its appetite was far smaller than Moscow's - just 2.5 per cent.
Now, Turkish government officials believe that Mr Aliev has also agreed to
ship much or all of Azerbaijan's output to Novorossisk. If true, this would
meet what ultimately is Moscow's most serious demand, since a continued
monopoly on oil shipments would perpetuate Russia's stranglehold on
Azerbaijan's means of economic independence.
Since there has been no announcement about the pipeline, most Western oil
officials and diplomats continue to hope that the issue is still open.
Though Robert Nobel did ship his oil through Russia to Europe, using the
Volga River-Baltic Sea route, Western oilmen these days mainly look south.
'The only way Novorossisk makes sense is if you have to choose it for
political reasons to please Russia,' said a Western oil official in Baku.
'It's overwhelmingly the worst possible option. It's the most expensive, and
you end up with the oil in the wrong place. We want it in the
Mediterranean.'

FT  07 MAR 94 / Survey of Azerbaijan (1): Wealthy, beautiful, and bleeding -
Azerbaijan is rich in oil and gas, has a fine climate and fertile soil. But
it is being badly hurt by the rebellion of its powerful Armenian minority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

<TEXT>
Azerbaijan is one of the most blessed of the former Soviet states.
Offshore, its oil and gas reserves are enough to ensure huge revenues for
decades ahead, if properly exploited. The capital, Baku, is one of the
world's great ports and has an infrastructure which, though ageing, remains
serviceable.
The country is a rich producer of fruits and vegetables. It has areas of
great beauty. Its people are Moslem (if they are anything), but of a
moderate, mind-your-own-business kind.
Beneath the coarsened Soviet manners there is courtesy and civility to be
found. The national aspiration, it seems, is to emulate secular and booming
Turkey, to whose people the Azeris are ethnically and linguistically close.
Its present tragedy is a war which has swallowed up more than one fifth of
its land surface, rendered some 1m of its people into refugees and now
accounts for nearly half of its budget.
At the time of writing there is another Russian-brokered effort to achieve
peace between Azerbaijan and its closest neighbour and enemy, Armenia.
However, the last five years have seen a war becoming steadily more bitter
and intractable, with most of the victories falling to the Armenians.
Were the war to end, Azerbaijan would have problems enough. It was a poor
state even by Soviet standards, and both the capital and the provincial
towns, the roads and the farms, show it. But it could embark on
modernisation and investments with a much greater hope of rapid success than
most of its former fellow Soviet republics.
The Azeris are a predominantly Turkic people (though the ethnic composition
is a matter of debate) who have lived in the area for many centuries. There
are millions of Azeris still living in Iran, a legacy of the time when the
Azeris were divided between the Tsarist and the Persian empires.
The people became a nation only briefly, when a republic was declared after
the collapse of Czarist rule in 1918 - but it lasted only until the entry of
the Red Army into Baku when the republic was incorporated into the Caucasian
Federation and then later received republican status.
This settlement also appeared to favour Azerbaijan in another way - it gave
it control of the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh towards the west of the
country, a beautiful region then largely (and now wholly) dominated by
Armenians. Further, it gave to Azeri control the region of Nakhichevan on
the south west of Armenia, a region which has a section of border with
Turkey.
Nagorno-Karabakh proved to be the deadliest of nationalist landmines. It
exploded first in 1988, when the relative liberality of Mikhail Gorbachev's
rule stimulated increased nationalist fervour in Armenia, and saw first the
Karabakh then the Armenian parliament adopt motions demanding the transfer
of Karabakh to Armenian control.
Though the radicals of the Karabakh Committee were jailed - they included Mr
Levan Ter-Petrosian, the current Armenian president - the Armenian Communist
Party was itself split over the issue and functioned more as the moderate
wing of the nationalist movement than as a suppressor of it.
Fighting within and around Karabakh gave way to fighting in and around the
borders of the two states: in 1992, the Armenians drove a corridor between
Armenia proper and the enclave through the Azeri town of Lachin. Last year,
a failed offensive by the Azeris turned into a sustained advance by the
Armenians, to the point where most of the land round Karabakh, stretching
deep into Azeri territory, is now in Armenian hands.
The instability generated by both the war and the Soviet collapse at the end
of 1991 has meant that Azerbaijan has had three presidents in as many years.
Mr Ayaz Mutalibov, a Gorbachev-era communist, hung on unsteadily until 1992.
He was succeeded by Mr Abolfaz Elchibey, the candidate of the Azeri Popular
Front, a nationalist grouping which arose in response to the radical
nationalism of the Armenian Karabakh Committee.
The APF promised a much more aggressive prosecution of the war than the weak
and temporising post-communist regime. But it could neither win the war nor
conclude peace.
A radical turn towards Turkey and away from Russia, coupled with a rather
contemptuous refusal to join the Confederation of Independent States,
prompted Russian troops to evacuate all the positions they held in
Azerbaijan. There was now no force able to withstand the much more highly
motivated and better armed Armenian fighters.
After the rout of last year, President Elchibey invited the popular Mr
Heydar Aliev, leader of Nakhichevan and the former Communist Party First
Secretary of Azerbaijan (and member of the Brezhnev Politburo) to lead the
parliament. A few days later, the man Elchibey had fired as commander of the
forces fighting the Karabakh Armenians, Mr Surat Huseinov, led a march of
his units on Baku with a demand that the president be deposed. Elchibey fled
(there was no conflict), Aliev was elected president and Huseinov became
prime minister.
The policy which Mr Aliev has tried to follow is a blend of geopolitical
necessity and economic realism. He has taken a sharp turn back towards
Russia. 'What should we do?' he asked in a recent interview with the FT.
'Should we simply continue to annoy her? She is a great power and will
continue to be. She has been involved in the fate of Azerbaijan for two
centuries. She must be at the centre of our policies.'
At the same time, he has sought to keep open his lines to Turkey - he had
what was billed as a successful visit there last month - and he has, in
visits to France and Britain, opened up lines of contact with Western states
to redress what he believes is the dominant position occupied by the
Armenian lobby in Western thinking on Nagorno-Karabakh.
He claims a firm attachment to democratic values and to a market system  -
though warns against 'pseudo democrats indulging in the democracy of the
streets' and says it will take some time to build a culture which can
sustain democratic institutions. His presidency, solidly supported, remains
the pivot of the state. His experience and toughness are unquestioned (he
was head of the Azeri KGB as well as first secretary) and he has introduced
a so far mildly authoritarian rule which has put some of his opponents in
prison, others in exile (though Elchibey still lives in freedom in
Nakhichevan), others still in parliament.
The press is numerous and relatively free, there are signs of private
enterprise and the moment may now be more promising for peace talks than any
in the past five years.
The oil men, who have sat in Baku for two years waiting for one of the
largest deals in the world (estimated at around Dollars 9bn) still sit, but
with better expectations of signing a deal than for some months. The
consortium, which includes British Petroleum, Statoil, Amoco, Pennzoil,
Unical, McDermott and Ramco, have been much more keen to sign a deal in
war-torn Azerbaijan than in peaceful Russia - largely because the partners
believe that it can be made to stick, since the government and the oil
companies are at one and the legislation and tax regime can be friendlier
than they have yet been in Russia.
This first FT survey of Azerbaijan thus comes at a more hopeful time for the
fledgling state than any it has experienced since its independence - an
independence it did not actively seek. If it is to grow to full statehood,
it needs both peace and economic development very badly. It may get these,
if the hopes now visible grow and are fulfilled.

<TEXT>
Monday: Consumer credit figures will give a further guide to the strength of
the UK recovery. Analysts will be watching to see if consumers are starting
to curtail their borrowing as the April tax increases approach. In recent
months, borrowing has been quite strong, but analysts expect a slowdown to
Pounds 300m in January, from December's Pounds 443m.
Tuesday: Figures for fourth quarter West German GDP are expected to show a
0.5 per cent fall from the third quarter, indicating that the economy
suffered a double dip after two successive quarterly rises. Pan-German
unemployment, which topped an unadjusted 4.03m in January, is expected to
show a further rise.
Friday: Whole world visible trade figures for the UK in December are
expected to show a deficit at around the same level as the Pounds 1bn
recorded in November. Since the December deficit with non-European Union
countries has already been announced, at Pounds 671m, the new element of the
figures will be trade with the EU. The accuracy of the EU figures, compiled
under the Intrastat system and based on VAT, has been questioned.

7 MONDAY
Kazakhstan holds elections
Kazakhstan's voters choose a federal parliament and local councils. The
former Soviet republic, almost half of whose population is Russian, has
steered a careful course under President Nursultan Nazarbayev (above). Rich
in energy, but yet to exploit its reserves, it has seen big falls in living
standards and a rise in ethnic tensions.
President Nazarbayev has called for votes for parties which 'have shown an
understanding of the real problems of the country and are striving to find a
solution', which means those backing him. They will probably win a solid
majority and support his so far benign authoritarianism.
Tuzla airport
Tuzla airport in north-central Bosnia is expected to re-open under United
Nations supervision. Agreement to open the airport, held by Bosnian Serbs,
who are also besieging the Moslem-held city, was secured by the UN and
Moscow last week. It will facilitate the delivery of food convoys.
BIS meeting
Central bank governors from the G10 countries gather in Basle to discuss
international monetary trends, under the auspices of the Bank for
International Settlements. They will discuss the current volatility of bond
and equity markets, and concerns about the activities of US hedge funds
which take bets on markets in the hope of making big short-term gains.
Foreign Affairs ministers of the European Union
Foreign Affairs ministers of the European Union, meeting in Brussels (to Mar
8), will discuss Greece's trade embargo against the former Yugoslav republic
of Macedonia. This will be a sensitive issue, as Greece is chairing the
meeting as EU president.
The European Parliament
The European Parliament begins a week-long plenary session.
Nordic Council
Finland and Sweden's agreement of terms to join the European Union and the
uncertainty of Norway's position will give edge to the meeting of Nordic
leaders when they gather for a regular get-together in Stockholm (to Mar
10).
Liberian civil war
Disarmament of warring factions under the supervision of the Economic
Community of West African States Cease-fire Monitoring Group is scheduled to
begin, but may run into trouble.
Romania's president Ion Iliescu
Romania's president Ion Iliescu begins a one-week visit to Lithuania, South
Korea and China, aiming to boost trade and foreign investment. In South
Korea he will visit Samsung and Goldstar as well as Daewoo which plans to
invest USDollars 400m in the Romanian car industry.
8 TUESDAY
Norway on the brink
European Union foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels, will be hoping they
can iron out the problems that prevented Norway settling terms by the March
1 deadline for an accession deal. Agreement is being held up by disputes
over fish. Spain wants access for its fishing fleet to Norwegian waters,
while Norway is insisting its fishermen be able to sell their catch
throughout the Union.
A deal with Norway would allow the EU to submit an outline agreement with
Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway to the European Parliament by Thursday.
Accession would still depend on referendums in favour in all four countries.
UK output figures
Economists are looking for a January bounce-back in UK manufacturing output
and industrial production, after December falls in both measures raised
doubts about the strength of the UK recovery.
The consensus is for month-on-month rises of 0.3 and 0.4 per cent
respectively. If the figures are much weaker than that, expect renewed
speculation of further base rate cuts.
Geneva Motor show
Several key models for European vehicle makers will be unveiled at the
Geneva motor show. It has its Press preview today, followed by a trade and
industry day tomorrow. High on the list for attention will be the final
production version of Audi's A8 aluminium lightweight luxury car.
The Geneva show, traditionally one of the best-attended by manufacturers
from all around the world, runs until March 16 inclusive.
Swedish TV float
Applications for shares in the first public flotation by a Swedish
television company start today (to Mar 18). TV4, the country's only
commercial terrestrial channel, is to sell 20 per cent of the company for
SKr400m (Dollars 50m). The 4m shares are priced at SKr100 each and TV4 hopes
to attract 35,000 new investors.
International Women's Day
Holiday in Russia and Ukraine.
FT Survey
Credit Management. With the UK economy emerging from recession, the need for
good credit management is greater than ever.  Historically, a third of
companies that fail do so during recession, but two-thirds go bust as they
emerge from recession. Good credit management can ease the pressure on cash
flow.
Football
Scotland play The Netherlands at Hampden Park, Glasgow.
9 WEDNESDAY
Europe's regions in focus
The European Union's Committee of the Regions holds its inaugural meeting in
Brussels (to Mar 10). The Committee, created by the Maastricht treaty, is
intended to give a consultative voice to Europe's regions.
Its first task is to elect a president. The Belgian Luc van den Brande,
leader of the Flemish regional government, Jacques Blanc, from
Languedoc-Roussillon in France, and Charles Gray, former leader of
Strathclyde council in Scotland, have their hats in the ring. But rivalry
between the first two may bring forward a Catalan candidate, either Pasqual
Maragall, the mayor of Barcelona, or Jordi Pujol, president of the
autonomous government of Catalonia.
US-Japan trade
US secretary of state Warren Christopher (left) begins a visit to Japan (to
Mar 11). The main topic on the agenda will be trade. The atmosphere will be
tenser, following the decision of the Clinton administration to revive its
Super 301 trade weapon.
Cambodia
Cambodia's two prime ministers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and his junior
partner Hun Sen, begin a visit to Japan to attend an international
conference on Cambodian economic reconstruction (to Mar 12). They will meet
prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa and representatives of the Keidanren
business federation.
Hong Kong
Hong Kong's government tables the second of Governor Chris Patten's
political reform bills. This bill, seen as the more contentious, seeks to
broaden the democratic franchise and relates to arrangements for the
colony's Legislative Council elections in 1995.
The European Parliament
The European Parliament votes on legislation to establish minimum European
Union standards for car emissions by 1996. The parliamentary environmental
committee is demanding tougher standards, which could delay the legislation.
The vote is expected to be close.
German pay talks
Some 3.5m public sector workers begin their next round of pay talks in
Stuttgart.
Off the peak
UK chatterboxes will be celebrating, as BT and Mercury, the two biggest
carriers, abolish their peak rate charges for calls between 9am and 1pm on
weekdays. Both companies will have a daytime rate from 8am to 6pm and an
off-peak rate from 6pm until 8am.
Football
England play Denmark at Wembley Stadium, London. Wales play Norway at Ninian
Park, Cardiff.
10 THURSDAY
China's Peoples' Congress
About 3,000 delegates gather in Beijing for the annual session of China's
National People's Congress, the country's closest equivalent to a
parliament. The Congress will endorse fundamental changes already under way
in the financial system, including tax and banking reform.
Two things, however, will not be far from delegates' minds: the frail
appearance last month of Deng Xiaoping, China's patriarch; and fears that
the economic boom might be getting out of hand. Beijing is trying to win
back financial and macro-economic control from provincial capitals after
several years of helter-skelter growth.
EU enlargement
The European Parliament has said it must receive by today details of the
membership deals the European Union has negotiated with Austria, Sweden,
Finland - and possibly Norway, if it manages to conclude negotiations in
time.
The draft acts of accession are due for discussion by the foreign affairs
committee before the parliament votes on their texts, probably in May.
Parliament must approve the package before the applicants can join the
Union.
Czech mate
Vaclav Klaus, prime minister of the Czech Republic, will sign a Partnership
for Peace at Nato headquarters in Brussels, forging closer military links
with the Atlantic alliance. The Czechs will be the 10th state from eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union to sign up.
Macedonia embargo
Greek foreign minister, Carolos Papoulias, holds talks in Geneva with Cyrus
Vance, the UN mediator in Greece's dispute with Macedonia over its name.
Greece is under pressure both from the UN and its European Union partners to
drop a trade ban against the former Yugoslav republic and resume dialogue
with its neighbour.
Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference
An Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference takes place in London. Patrick
Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, and Dick Spring, the Irish
foreign minister, will meet to discuss the state of the peace initiative,
against the background of continuing prevarication by Sinn Fein and the
decision of the Ulster Unionists not to talk to the Irish government before
a devolved Northern Ireland assembly was set up.
Parade of pampered pooches
Dog lovers and breeders will be converging on the National Exhibition
Centre, Birmingham, for the start of Cruft's Dog Show, the UK's leading
judging competition. They can look forward to four days of comparing notes
and weighing up the finer points.
Holiday
South Korea (Labour Day).
11 FRIDAY
Frei takes over in Chile
Chile's long democratic tradition will be fully restored when President
Patricio Aylwin hands over power to fellow Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei,
elected last December. The changeover will end a painful period of Chilean
history which saw 17 years of military rule after a coup led by General
Augusto Pinochet in 1973.
President Aylwin has been credited with overseeing a remarkably smooth
four-year transition, during which the economy grew by 28 per cent.
Warren Christopher
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, arrives in Beijing for an
official visit (to Mar 14). He will warn that billions of dollars in trade
are in jeopardy because of China's human rights record.
The Liberal Democrats
The Liberal Democrats, Britains' centre party, start their spring conference
in Cardiff (to Mar 13). With the ruling Tories unpopular and in disarray,
and the opposition Labour Party distrusted by many voters, the Lib-Dems can
hope to hold the balance of power in a hung parliament after the next
general election.
Holiday
Indonesian New Year.
12-13 WEEKEND
Lower Saxony votes
Germany's seven-month spate of elections begins on Sunday with the contest
for the state parliament of Lower Saxony. The leftwing SPD, currently ruling
in coalition with the Greens, hopes to win enough votes to rule on its own.
The main question for federal chancellor Helmut Kohl's rightwing CDU is how
badly it will fare. The liberal FDP, ruling in coalition with the CDU in the
federal government, may not reach the 5 per cent threshold needed to win
seats at all.
Austria's provinces
Austria's provinces of Carinthia, Tyrol and Salzburg hold elections for
their assemblies on Sunday. The vote will test the public reaction to the
county's accession deal with the European Union.
Women priests
Saturday sees the first ordination in Britain of women priests into the
Church of England. The ceremony takes place at Bristol Cathedral in presence
of visiting clergy from around world.
Sunday is Mothering Sunday.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Investors gripped by inflation fever - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having survived Friday's nerve-wracking release of the February employment
report unscathed, the stock market faces a quiet week, with nothing on the
economic agenda to match the import of the monthly jobs figures.
Awaiting the employment data was nerve-wracking because both the bond and
stock markets feared that if the figures had come in above forecasts, the
Federal Reserve would have quickly pushed up interest rates again in an
attempt to dampen inflationary pressures in the increasingly buoyant
economy. In the event, the report was mixed, and the feared rate increase
never materialised, allowing share prices to end the week on a positive
note.
Ironically, the fuss over whether the Fed would follow a strong employment
report by raising rates diverted attention from the fact that the February
jobs figures were bullish for stocks. They were neither so buoyant as to
raise fears of an overheated economy, nor so weak as to revive concern about
the state of the labour market.
This good news was mostly overlooked because the stock market has caught a
bad case of the bond market's inflation fever. In recent weeks the slightest
hint of rising prices - in a purchasing managers' report, say, or a regional
Fed survey - has spooked fixed-income investors and pushed up long-term
interest rates and depressed share prices.
While concerns about inflation appear overdone (few economists can find any
real evidence of rising prices in the economy at the moment), the stock
market is right to be worried by the sight of rising long-term interest
rates.
This is because, as Mr William Dodge, Dean Witter's chief economist points
out in this week's equity research note, the stock market has moved from an
interest rate-driven phase in the cycle to an earnings-driven phase. If
interest rates continue to rise, they will eventually inflict some damage on
the economy. Weaker economic growth can only lead to weaker corporate
earnings growth.
Or, as Mr Dodge puts it: 'If interest rates do not fall, the tug-of-war
between rising earnings and higher interest rates will begin in earnest from
current stock market levels. And if interest rates slow the economy while
remaining high, the earnings underpinning will be pulled out from under the
market.'
Fortunately, bond prices performed remarkably well on Friday, and interest
rates actually ended the day slightly lower. Some observers hope that this
resilient display marks a turning point of some kind for the bond market.
The end, perhaps, of weeks of jittery, panicky trading.
If they are right, then the stock market should enjoy a welcome respite from
the recent turmoil that has unsettled financial markets in the US and
Europe. It helps that there is little important economic news due this week
that might unnerve investors. The main events are Wednesday's publication of
the Fed's 'Beige Book' report on the economy, and Friday's release of
February retail sales data.

ZURICH
Ascom, the troubled telecoms equipment maker, is expected to reveal a 1993
loss of about SFr350m (Dollars 241m) at a press conference today.
Electrowatt and Baer Holding also present full-year figures today. Analysts
have been busily revising upwards their estimates for CS Holding which
reports preliminary results tomorrow, after Friday's figures from Credit
Suisse. Estimates for earnings range up to SFr2bn, compared with SFr1.03bn
in 1992. Alusuisse is seen posting a 33 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
tomorrow. SBC, giving full details of its 1993 results on Wednesday, has
already reported net income up 36 per cent at SFr1.37bn.
BBC and its parent, ABB, report on Wednesday. Hoare Govett expects net
profit to fall to Dollars 376m from Dollars 505 due to higher non-recurring
costs at ABB.
FRANKFURT
Hoechst, the first of Germany's big three chemicals groups to report, is
widely expected to cut the dividend to DM6 from last time's DM9, tomorrow. A
40 per cent fall in earnings after nine months was attributed to weakness in
the European fibres business and polypropylene manufacture.
AMSTERDAM
Fokker reports on Wednesday and there is a broad consensus that the aircraft
manufacturer, which has already unveiled plans for a drastic cut in aircraft
output and jobs, will announce a Fl 150m (Dollars 79m) loss for 1993.
Analysts are looking for a 10 per cent improvement at Heineken, reporting on
Thursday. ABN Amro's figures are expected to advance 20 per cent on
Thursday.
STOCKHOLM
A spate of results this week looks set to confirm a sharp turnround in
earnings, says UBS. Gambro and Sandvik are seen raising net profit by 27 per
cent tomorrow while Stora is expected to see a return to profit of about
SKr400m. Results on Thursday come from AGA, Asea, Ericsson with an expected
137 per cent rise in pre-tax profit, Hennes &amp; Mauritz and Trelleborg.
TOKYO
Trade tensions between Japan and the US following Washington's decision last
week to revive the Super 301 provision for retaliatory trade tariffs may
become an important influence.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Time now for the bargain hunters - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was another difficult week for equities, although the final net loss of
only a few points on the FT-SE 100 Index is not in itself anything to lose
sleep over. The question asked on all sides is, quite simply, 'Is it over
yet or is another March 1987 lurking in the shadows?'
The answer from market strategists is that fears have been overdone, that a
shakeout in bond markets was inevitable and that equities now present a
buying opportunity not to be missed. And the market seems to be agreeing
with them.
There has been no great selling of equities - bonds and stock index futures
are another matter - and the institutions have begun to buy. They have
sought out bargains rather than buying across the board, and they have
eschewed sectors seen as deserving a good hiding; the financial sectors, and
in particular those with securities markets exposure, have continued to
suffer.
The good news is that the European bond markets, directly responsible for
the setback in equities, now show signs of disengaging from the US Treasury
market. London, like other European markets, is still resigned to a further
tightening by the Federal Reserve, but such fears no longer appear to be
upsetting share prices.
The London stock market is now looking towards economic recovery for
support, now interest rate prospects are more clouded. This week brings
potential developments on this score.
The oil sector's concern over languishing crude prices has relaxed as Opec
does not meet until the end of the month. But ministers of the
Gulf-Co-Operation Council (GCC), which is effectively led by Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait, meet in Jeddah this weekend. Nomura Research warns that the
stock market may be greatly mistaken in its apparent assumption that oil
price weakness is merely a temporary aberration.
The GCC is unlikely to contradict the blunt statement from the Saudis last
December that they are not prepared to cut production. Oil exploration
stocks, notably Enterprise and Lasmo, are still vulnerable to adverse news
on oil pricing and share prices may not wait for the Opec meeting.
The uncertainties of the past fortnight have refocused attention on solid
dividend-paying stocks which will underpin the liability side of pension
fund balance sheets.
The RECs, the 12 regional electricity companies, plus the two Scottish
companies, have been overshadowed by awareness that their distribution
reviews are in hand and that a harsher regulatory regime lies ahead.
Panmure Gordon believes their dividend paying capacities will not be too
badly hindered by tighter regulation.
Panmure reckons the value of the National Grid, owned by the RECs, is
'grossly underestimated' in balance sheets, and may be worth about Pounds
4.1bn. It considers dividend rates of 6 per cent should be possible and
rates London Electricity, Northern Electric, Seeboard, Southern Electric and
Yorkshire Electricity as buys.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Derivative frailties exposed by volatility -
Risk and reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dramatic sell-off in leading government bond markets during the past two
weeks has exposed fundamental weaknesses in the fast-moving world of
derivatives. Perhaps the most serious breakdown during this period of
intense volatility has been the failure of securities houses to ensure
liquidity in products they had structured and sold when the going was good.
Volatility is an important component in the pricing and trading of
derivatives. It can be defined as a statistical measure of the tendency of a
market price or yield to vary over time, or in the case of a government
bond, until it matures. When a trader has to evaluate an option price,
volatility is one of the most important and difficult elements to gauge
because it is usually the only variable the trader does not know with
certainty in advance.
With respect to options on European government bond futures, the implied
volatility on Italian and Spanish government bond options is relatively high
at around 10 per cent. Traders say the high level of implied volatility in
these instruments mainly reflects the uncertain outlook on interest rates in
these countries. In view of the volatility associated with these markets, it
was not much of a surprise when implied volatility shot up during the recent
heavy falls in the futures and cash markets.
By contrast, traders of fixed-income derivatives were panic-stricken when
the implied volatility in options on German bunds more than doubled. Before
the rout, options on bunds were seen as a model of price stability, boasting
a low implied volatility of between 3 1/2 per cent to 4 1/2 per cent.
According to Mr Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at NatWest in
Frankfurt, the implied volatility in bund options went as high as 10 per
cent last Wednesday, when bund futures rose and fell by more than two points
before closing virtually unchanged. The volatility has since fallen back to
around 7 1/2 per cent though the surge has caused the historical volatility
of the options to increase substantially.
Although the rise in volatility made it much more expensive for investors or
traders to buy options on Bunds, it also meant big paper profits for
investors who held them. However, many have failed to realise these profits
since liquidity in the market has virtually dried up. The large rise in
volatility has made fair-weather market-makers reluctant to buy back
options, causing bid-offer spreads to widen to more than six basis points
from between three or four basis points during normal market conditions.
Indeed, many market-makers, especially those who have participated in the
recent spate of government bond auctions, are keen to sell options at
current levels in order to hedge their positions.
Some traders of fixed-income derivatives argue the over-the counter market
in these products has never been particularly efficient. 'It has never been
a liquid two-way market, it has always been negotiated,' says a head of
department at a leading UK house.
Observers believe it will be some time before liquidity improves and they
fear that a long delay could bring on further, debilitating bouts of
volatility. The big players, namely the hedge funds forced to liquidate
positions when a series of bets went wrong, are licking their wounds and are
unlikely to come back soon.
Another brake on liquidity has been the sharp rise in margin requirements on
several futures and options exchanges which have penalised those brave
enough to keep trading. 'Less liquidity means a greater likelihood in price
jumps,' says Mr Kerger.

Gilts traders are hoping that this week the market will recover some poise.
Although there was precious little UK economic news last week, the market
was battered by reports of increased price pressures in the US and rapid
money supply growth in Germany.
Hopes of an imminent UK rate cut are diminishing. Although there is no
official word on the outcome of last week's monetary meeting between the
chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England, most
analysts assume the duo decided to keep their powder dry for another month.
The main focus of domestic interest this week will be tomorrow's
manufacturing output and industrial production figures for January, which
are expected to show an upturn after December's falls. Mr James Barty, UK
economist at Morgan Grenfell, said official economic statistics have been
lagging behind survey data from the likes of the Confederation of British
Industry. The market is expecting month-on-month increases of 0.3 per cent
to 0.4 per cent.
Most analysts believe the sell-off in gilts has been overdone, particularly
in the light of news on UK inflation. But if the US Federal Reserve tightens
policy further, this may turn out to be another week when UK economic
fundamentals take a back seat to international influences.

If investors are not still stunned in the aftermath of the 'horror' 20.6 per
cent growth in M3 money supply in January (announced on Thursday last week)
and last week's wave of selling from the US, there may in the next few days
be grounds for a cautious revival in sentiment.
First, the threat of a damaging strike in the engineering sector has been
averted. The wages deal reached between the IG Metall union and employers in
the early hours of Saturday morning removes one obstacle to further interest
rate cuts on the part of the Bundesbank.
Second, with this obstacle removed, the Bundesbank may seize the opportunity
to steer down money market interest rates by means of a variable rate tender
for securities repurchase agreements (repos). The results of the tender will
be published on Wednesday and it may be that after a minute three basis
point drop in the repo rate last week to 5.97 per cent the rate will be
shaved further.
A reduction in money market rates, by five basis points or more, would help
restore investors' hopes of further generous cuts in the discount rate (at
5.25 per cent) during the first half of the year. But with US interest rates
likely to rise, it remains to be seen whether the fortunes of the bund
market can be decoupled from those of the US Treasury market.

FT  07 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Caught up in negative sentiment -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese government bonds have not remained unscathed amid the recent
turmoil in international bond markets, but have been caught up in the
negative sentiment stemming from rising US interest rates.
Long-term yields have risen to five-month highs, and although investors have
expected weakness in the bond market ahead of the March year-end book
closing, where institutional investors lock profits on their portfolios to
shore up earnings, this year the decline has been exacerbated by worries of
extra supply and hopes of an imminent economic recovery.
The yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark, which breached 3 per cent to a
record low at the beginning of January, rose briefly above the 4 per cent
mark last week for the first time since September last year.
Deteriorating investor confidence was also highlighted by the failure of
last week's 10-year bond auction, where the average accepted price was
97.38, the second lowest on record.
Such weakness in sentiment comes as activity slows ahead of the business
year end. After an eight-month rally, investors rushed to realise profits,
and few have been willing to buy bonds to take on new positions.
The low trading volumes have made the bond market vulnerable to small-lot
selling.
On top of seasonal trading, worries of over-supply, triggered by the
government's Y9,400bn economic package and Y5,850bn tax cut announced last
month, have weighed down on the bond market.
New bond issues by the central government for this fiscal year to the end of
this month have risen by 52.5 per cent from initial plans to Y12,400bn,
while bond issuance by municipal governments, initially slated at Y10,350bn,
has increased by 30.4 per cent to Y13,500bn.
For the next fiscal year to March 1995, the central government is planning
to issue a total of Y13,640bn in bonds, a 10 per cent rise from the previous
year, of which Y3,130bn will be in deficit financing bonds - which have not
been issued for five years.
On the municipal level, bond issuance is expected to rise by 9 per cent to
Y14,730bn, of which Y1,650bn in deficit financing bonds, the first issued
since 1976.
While fears of additional supply are expected to be absorbed by the third
quarter, uncertainty over the economy has shaken bond investors, as recent
economic indicators have spurred hopes of a long-overdue economic recovery.
Industrial production figures for January announced last week were stronger
than previous forecasts by both private sector economists and the
government's preliminary indications.
Industrial output grew by 0.9 per cent from the previous month with the
inventory to shipment ratio easing from a peak in December.
Labour statistics for January were also encouraging, with the ratio of job
offers to applicants rising for the first time since March 1991.
Most investors also interpreted the Tankan, or quarterly survey on business
sentiment, which indicated a sideways movement in sentiment, as reflecting a
bottoming out of conditions surrounding the corporate sector.
Sentiment levels were largely unchanged from the previous survey, with
manufacturing sentiment remaining at -56, and non-manufacturing sentiment
rising to -46 from -47.
The level of confidence varied from sector to sector. Sentiment within the
electric machinery sector, for example, rose to -53 from -63 and the retail
sector posted an improvement to -60 from -65.
However, many economists are loath to call a near-term recovery just on the
recent economic figures.
'We know that the economy is indeed in a trough, but we don't know whether
it's going to go sideways or headed for a V-shaped recovery,' says Mr Dick
Beason, economist at brokers James Capel in Tokyo.
The Tankan, for example, indicated that business conditions at small
companies, usually leading indicators turning points in the economy,
remained grim. Confidence at small manufacturers fell to -48 from -45, while
they expect to cut capital spending by 32.3 per cent next business year, and
predict financial conditions to remain tight.
The sluggish business conditions, on top of a rise in the yen and mounting
trade tensions between the US and Japan, have been a concern for the Bank of
Japan, which has kept a wary eye on the recent rise in long-term yields.
In an attempt to curb some of the upward pressure on interest rates, it has
lowered the overnight call rate by 25 basis points to 2.125 per cent,
cutting the yield spread between the official discount rate to a record low.
Some traders hope the money market manoeuvers by the central bank is a
prelude to a discount rate cut.
'The odds of an ODR reduction are higher than markets currently expect,'
says Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. It believes that a discount rate cut
of 25 to 50 basis points during the second quarter is possible.
Although a discount rate cut will lift Japanese government bonds, an
improvement in international sentiment towards bond markets is essential for
a full fledged recovery. Mr Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International
in London, believes that once the US Treasury market revives, the Japanese
10-year benchmark will reach 3 per cent by the summer.

While last week ended as it had begun - with data pointing to stronger
economic expansion than bond investors had expected (or wanted) - a degree
of composure had crept back into the US government bond market. This week,
with little new data, should give the market pause to regain its bearings
after the frantic slide of the past fortnight.
Friday's employment numbers (a greater-than-expected 217,000 increase in
non-farm payrolls in February and a decline in the unemployment rate to 6.5
per cent (from 6.7 per cent the month before) seemed to provide ample
opportunity for a sell-off. But the figures contained downward revisions in
the January numbers and a modest 0.2 per cent increase in earnings. The bond
market shrugged off persistent speculation that the Fed was on the verge of
hiking rates again, this time possibly by 50 basis points, to recover its
losses by the end of the day.
After the pessimism of recent days, Friday's mood swing could set the tone
for the first part of this week. The only events of note will be the
publication of the Fed's Beige Book on Wednesday and February retail sales
figures on Friday. If interest rate speculation abates, and the bond market
can get to the end of the week without losing further ground, chalk it up as
a minor victory.

FT  07 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Tough times for government auctions -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent bloodbath in world bond markets has scared away all but the
boldest investors, and amid the ongoing 'buyers' strike' governments
couldn't be blamed for worrying about who will buy their debt.
In recent weeks, European markets slumped as fears of higher US interest
rates spilled across the Atlantic. The European sell-off was exacerbated by
aggressive speculators offloading large and highly leveraged long positions,
creating a sense of panic that sent institutional investors running for
cover. Last week, several institutions joined the sellers and opted to hold
large cash positions until the storm had blown over.
As a result, several recent government bond auctions have yielded dismal
results.
An auction of Italian five-year notes last week barely scraped through on a
bid-to-cover ratio of just over one, with the Bank of Italy placing only
L4,343bn of the planned L4,500bn. Spain effectively cancelled last
Thursday's auction of three-, five- and 10-year bonds by rejecting all bids.
In Japan, a recent auction of four-year bills flopped with a cover of only
1.06 times and a large tail (the difference between the average and the
highest accepted yield) of 12.3 basis points; at the 10-year auction last
week, only some 60 per cent of the targeted amount was sold, with the rest
placed among the syndicate of underwriting banks. In Germany, the
Treuhandanstalt's auction of 10-year bonds met with meagre bidding, leaving
the Bundesbank a large amount of paper to sell through its market tending
operations.
Some say all this is just a temporary hiccup, and predict buyers will return
once bonds recover on Europe's bond-friendly fundamentals of slow growth
accompanied by low inflation.
'Right now there's still a lot of nervousness, but sooner or later investors
will focus on the fundamentals and return,' predicts Mr Helmut Kaiser,
senior economist at DB Research in Frankfurt. In the meantime, 'governments
can wait this out without too much risk - their funding strategies have
become quite flexible'.
Moreover, he argues, real yields have risen to levels that should start
attracting buyers. The German real 10-year yield has risen to 2.83 per cent
from 1.82 per cent at the end of 1993; in the UK, it rose to around 4.64 per
cent from around 4.18 per cent over the same period.
'The level of real yields is very silly,' says Ms Alison Cottrell, European
economist at Midland Global Markets. She expects domestic investors to be
lured back by attractive yields, and also expects some of the funds which
flowed into US assets in recent months to return as Europe's economies
recover and their currencies strengthen.
Meanwhile, many expect Europe to get out of the US interest rate cycle once
its fundamentals reassert themselves. This decoupling, and the resulting
turnround in bond market sentiment, could be spurred by more aggressive rate
cuts from the Bundesbank, reminding investors that European short-term rates
are still headed lower. Friday's market action sent encouraging signals,
with European bonds outperforming US Treasuries after stronger-than-expected
US jobs data.
Additional help in funding budget deficits may come from
higher-than-expected tax receipts as Europe's economies recover.
Yet there are some who fear the end-of-cycle-blues may limit sustained
investor demand for bonds.
'It will be much more difficult to place stock this year than it was last
year,' says Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at IDEA. 'It's always easier
to fund in a bull market than in a bear market.' While he expects bonds to
recover in the near term, he says investor confidence will be slow to return
after the recent rout. Moreover, as the end of the cycle looms, rallies will
be increasingly short-lived as investors are quicker to seize opportunities
for profit-taking, he says.
This means that governments will have to gauge market conditions much more
carefully when they plan to issue bonds. 'There will be windows of
opportunity, but last year's flexibility is gone,' he says. 'We could get
some very messy auctions.'

<TEXT>
Seasonal window dressing of accounts ahead of the March book closing, where
investors prop up their earnings figures with profits from their gains from
bonds, will continue to weigh on the Japanese government bond market.
However, most traders believe that the sell-off in the JGB market peaked
last week, when the yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark rose nearly 40
basis points on the week to 3.99 per cent. Factors responsible for the
plunge included surprisingly strong economic figures, further weakness on
the international bond market, and worries about over-supply.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo believes that investors will regain
confidence as the underlying weakness of the economy continues and money
market operations by the Bank of Japan reveal that it would not tolerate a
further rise in interest rates.
The central bank has allowed overnight call rates to ease to 2.125 per cent
from 2.25 per cent, and the yield spread between the call rate and the
official discount rate, currently at 1.75 per cent, is at a historical low.
A rise in long-term interest rates could hurt the economy, which remains
vulnerable to the strengthening of the yen and political turmoil and the
bank could ease short-term money market rates lower this week, to prevent a
further fall in bond prices.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Secondary market
A sharp collapse in the price of secondary market emerging market debt has
left many traders in the paper nursing losses.
Among prominent traders, JP Morgan, the top-ranked New York bank, saw its
shares fall last week as reports swept the market that it had lost money in
both emerging market debt and derivatives trading.
Simply holding the paper has been enough to help some traders to riches as
prices rose relentlessly over the past few years. But losses since the
market peaked in mid-January have been rapid.
An index calculated by West Merchant Bank - which includes both Brady bonds
and restructured bank loans - has fallen almost 13 per cent since it peaked
in mid-January.
Falls were sharpest in countries that have yet to achieve a Brady debt
restructuring. Russian paper lost the most as the price fell more than 40
per cent to just over 30 cents on the dollar.
Other big losers were Peru, off more than 25 per cent, Nigeria, down 22 per
cent, and Panama, down 20 per cent.
VENEZUELA
Venezuela became the first country with outstanding Brady bonds to be
downgraded when Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its ratings on the republic's
Eurobonds to double-B minus from double-B. About Dollars 2.1bn of foreign
currency-denominated debt is affected. It has revised its outlook to stable
from negative.
S &amp; P said the downgrade stemmed from a further substantial weakening in the
country's public finances in recent months and uncertain prospects that the
new government can pursue effective fiscal and economic reforms over the
medium term.
MANILA
The country's two stock exchange trading floors - in the Ortigas Centre and
the Makati financial district - began their merger by trading one stock at a
single price last Friday. It is hoped to complete the process in about two
weeks.
LONDON
The Investment Bank of Latvia has signed an equity agreement with the EBRD.
The equity stake is the first foreign participation in the bank, and
represents 35 per cent of its capital. The LIB, established in 1992, aims to
promote Latvia's economic development by lending hard currency to the
private sector. Lending goes mainly into the wood processing sector, but
also into tourism, harbour facilities and light industry.
CAIRO
Egypt is considering offering shares of some 314 public sector companies for
public subscription. The government has said that about 90 of 360 state
companies were running at a loss, with debts of about Dollars 16bn.
BRATISLAVA
Direct foreign investment to Slovakia was about Dollars 135m in 1993, down
from Dollars 151m in 1992, the Slovak statistical bureau has said. Foreign
capital investment since the communist government fell in 1989 has totalled
Dollars 366.2m.
Austria was the leading investor from 1990 to 1993 with Dollars 87m placed
in 1,141 companies. Germany followed with Dollars 77m in 743 companies. The
US has invested Dollars 47m in 161 companies, and the Czech Republic Dollars
40m in 666 companies.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Emerging Markets: Shock waves hit the Latin markets - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is the definition of an emerging market? A market that you cannot
emerge from in an emergency.
The euphoria that greeted the new year in emerging stock markets has been
punctured. The flows of foreign money that had sustained record share prices
have slowed considerably or gone into reverse since the rise in US interest
rates a month ago
The hardest hit markets in Latin America have been those where foreign
participation has been highest. Mexico, Chile and Argentina - where foreign
participation is estimated at between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of the
market - have fallen between 7 per cent and 13 per cent in a month.
Mr Geoffrey Dennis, head of emerging market research at Bear Stearns in New
York, believes the Latin markets are suffering shock waves from the
corrections in the US stock and bond markets.
Once sentiment turns in favour of the US markets, the smaller markets will
see foreign buyers return.
The emerging markets fall harder than most mature markets for a variety of
reasons. Trading volume there has increased from Dollars 300m to Dollars
400m a day, but most of that is concentrated in a few stocks.
When the market is falling, many investors find it difficult to sell fast.
The limited role of marketmakers and a lack of flexible trading rules has
hindered liquidity in the market.
In Mexico, a difference of foreign and domestic opinion over prospects for
the market also meant that foreigners selling shares in the past month found
few Mexican buyers to take on the stock.
According to Mr Pablo Riveroll, head of research of the brokerage, Bursamex,
Mexicans had already sold most of their holdings.
'Foreigners have been looking at Mexico longer term than the Mexicans,' he
says. 'They say if you invest over three to five years you will do well.
Mexicans are looking at the troubles in store this year.'
The main source of these troubles became evident on New Year's Day, when
several thousand armed rebels seized half a dozen towns in the southern
state of Chiapas. This exposed the weaknesses in Mexico's political
institutions and deep social divisions in the country.
It also heightened concerns over next August's presidential election, which
most investors had previously assumed would be a shoo-in for the candidate
of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio.
Mexicans have been especially worried that Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace
envoy in Chiapas, would declare him-self as independent candidate for the
presidency, says Mr Arturo Acevedo, head of research at the brokerage,
Vector.
Some investors believe his candidacy would promote democracy and long-term
stability, but the majority view him as a threat to continuity of economic
policy represented by Mr Colosio, the man picked by President Carlos
Salinas.
These concerns have begun to permeate the consciousness of investors outside
the country.
'Two months ago no foreigners were talking about political risk,' says Mr
Acevedo. 'Today there is much more consciousness of the electoral process
and political complications that could arise.'
'A lot of people were saying that Mexico had emerged,' says another leading
stockbroker, 'but they were forgetting political risk. You need stability in
the transfer of power to emerge.'
The outlook was further clouded by the disclosure last month that Mexican
growth last year was a meagre 0.4 per cent, the lowest rate for seven years.
On top of that, there has been increased volatility in the Mexican peso,
prompting some worries about whether the current exchange rate band is
sustainable through the election year.
Despite all this, some foreign analysts dismiss arguments that the market
weakness is due to local factors: 'I don't believe it has anything to do
with politics, and I don't buy the story that it has anything to do with the
economy,' says Mr Dennis.
When buyers return, they believe Mexico will be well placed. 'A lot of
markets were overbought, and will not be able to sustain valuations that
were driven solely by the flood of money into the markets,' says Mr Larry
Brainard of Goldman Sachs in New York.
'When this happens, you have to look at the underlying economic
fundamentals. In Latin America, the fundamentals are good in Mexico and
Argentina right now.'
With the North American Free Trade Agreement in place, Mexico, along with
Chile, is regarded as the Latin country that has done most to streamline its
economy.
Although the pay-off so far in growth has been modest - the restructuring of
Mexican industry has been more profound than many thought likely beforehand
 -many analysts see medium-term growth prospects as good.
On top of that, price-to-earnings ratios in Mexico are low compared with
other Latin American markets. Mexico's average prospective p/e is lower than
any Latin American country save Brazil.
Bear Stearns calculates Mexico's at just below 14, compared with 17.3 for
Argentina and 18.2 in Chile. Brazil stands at 13.5, Venezuela at 15.5, and
Peru at 19.
But while foreigners may be content to look at earnings multiples, Mexicans
are likely to remain unconvinced. The last three presidencies have ended in
financial crisis, which suggests they probably will not return to the market
in strength until the election year is out.

Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Attention this week in foreign exchanges will focus on the two central banks
whose activities have combined recently to throw financial markets into
disarray.
On the one hand all eyes will be on the Bundesbank on Tuesday to see
whether, and by how much, it cuts the repo rate - the key rate it uses to
establish the level of money market rates.
Last week the German central bank trimmed the rate by 3 basis points to 5.97
per cent from 6 per cent.
Most observers expect it will continue the 'salami' process of trimming
rates down in small, weekly increments.
On the other hand, the market remains very skittish about the US inflation
outlook. Although the Fed did not tighten policy on Friday after the release
of employment data, many believe a tightening remains imminent - and the
sooner the better.
Most analysts agree that weak European economies need lower rates and look
to Germany to provide a lead.
They argue that Europe needs decisively to 'decouple' from the US, where
economic recovery is much more advanced.
One factor inhibiting the Bundesbank is the industrial dispute in the
engineering sector.
At the end of last week, employers and unions were trying to reach
agreement, but few expected the central bank to move decisively while the
whiff of strikes and lock-outs remained in the air.
Various data releases this week - principally tomorrow's fourth quarter GDP
figure, expected to confirm a 'double-dip' at the end of last year - should
lend support to the case for a monetary easing.
Two main factors are currently influencing the dollar: the trade dispute
with Japan, and the market view that the Fed is likely to push rates up
again.
Last week the dollar actually rose after President Clinton announced the
re-activation of the Super 301 executive order which will allow the US to
impose trade sanctions against Japan.
The market's obsession with the US inflation outlook will have to wait until
next week for price data. In the interim, Friday's retail sales figures and
the Fed's tan book, to be released on Wednesday, are sure to be the subject
of intense scrutiny.
Sterling has been out of the limelight since the furore over last month's 25
basis points cut in rates.
Most observers expect another cut of similar magnitude, but the Bank of
England is expected to wait until later in the month, or April, when it has
fresh, and supportive, inflation data.

FT  07 MAR 94 / The Markets: Waiting for Mr Greenspan - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Global securities markets recovered a measure of poise by the weekend after
an extremely volatile few days of trading, but the mood remains fragile and
dependent in no small measure on the actions, or lack of them, of the US
Federal Reserve.
Much of Wall Street is expecting Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, to
follow up last month's 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate with
another 25 point move during the next few weeks, possibly accompanied by a
50 point rise in the psychologically important discount rate, which acts as
a floor for the US interest rate structure.
The Fed's February tightening, which Mr Greenspan presumably hoped might
stabilise the Treasury bond market, in the event sowed inflationary anxiety
and sent US bond prices sharply lower.
Against this background, and statistics showing buoyant US consumption the
Fed is expected to reinforce its inflation fighting credentials. A move
could come as soon as this week or about the time of its policy-making Open
Market Committee meeting, towards the end of March.
A Fed move is so widely expected that it is already largely factored into
Treasury prices, but the market could still take fright again, particularly
if a rise were linked to a specific piece of economic news with worrying
inflationary implications, rather than presented as part of a planned
strategy to prolong the current economic expansion.
Take, for example, the market's behaviour last Friday morning, when the
headline statistics for February employment were much stronger than
expected, and bond prices fell sharply in anticipation of a mid-morning
tightening by the Fed which never materialised.
Closer examination of the data convinced economists that the figures
pointed, if anything, to slower rather than stronger growth, and the
benchmark 30-year issue ended the day up  1/16 for a yield of 6.829. With US
inflationary pressures still modest, the market looks oversold on
fundamentals, but it may take some very adroit presentation by Mr Greenspan
to convince Wall Street of that, at least in the short-run.
The manner of a Fed move also has important implications for European bond
markets, which so far have been unable to decouple themselves from falling
prices across the Atlantic. Last Wednesday Europe was given an excuse for
market turmoil of its own with figures showing the most explosive growth in
German money supply since unification in 1990, raising fears that the
Bundesbank will move even more cautiously in cutting German rates.
The figures were distorted by numerous special factors and tomorrow's German
labour market report will underline the delicate state of the economy. Even
so, further significant rate cuts by the Bundesbank - the key to a bond
market rally across Europe - still seem some way off.
Recovery stocks
The volatility in global stock prices since the Fed's February move has
analysts divided as to whether a short, sharp and much needed correction in
equities is under way, or whether this is the start of a creeping bear
market which could see a slow, relentless decline in valuations as small US
investors who have plunged into mutual funds switch out again.
What havens are there in such an uncertain climate? One possibility is
sectors which have traditionally outperformed at this stage of the economic
cycle, and in the US that means capital goods and basic industries. Another
alternative is recovery stocks - poor performing companies whose fortunes
are being transformed.
In the US, investment in recovery stocks has become entwined with the
corporate governance movement - the trend for certain public pension funds
and private investment groups to put very direct pressure on companies to
improve their performance.
The main focus of these campaigns is the company annual meeting season,
generally known as the proxy season, which is just about to begin. In the
months preceding the meetings, investors and managements go through an
elaborate game of carrot and stick, with the shareholders threatening to put
embarrassing resolutions on ballot papers.
Several leading fund managers have developed sophisticated screening
processes to identify dogs, while the Council of Institutional Investors, an
umbrella group, has produced a list of 50 poor performers for use by its
members.
A recent study by the pension consulting firm Wilshire Associates of
investment results by The California Public Employees' Retirement System,
Calpers, probably the most activist large investor in the US, gives powerful
support to the idea that corporate governance activism can pay big
dividends.
Beating the S&amp;P
Wilshire looked at the returns to shareholders of 42 companies targeted by
Calpers between 1987 and 1992. This group significantly underperformed the
Standard &amp; Poors 500 index of leading stocks in the five years before
Calpers targetted the companies. However, in the five subsequent years they
showed a 41 per cent excess return over the S&amp;P. Adjusting for special
industry factors, the return was 36.6 per cent. Wilshire then broke the
companies down into two groups (see chart above) - one targeted by Calpers
between 1987 and 1989, when its shareholder activism was limited to general
issues of corporate governance, such as the anti-takeover devices installed
by companies. That group showed little improvement relative to the S&amp;P 500.
The second group consists of those targeted by Calpers between 1990 and
1992, after it changed its policy to one of actively seeking to improve a
company's financial performance by engaging in a dialogue with its
management. The companies handsomely outperformed the S&amp;P.
Similar evidence comes from Lens, a small fund management group set up by Mr
Robert Monks, one of founders of the shareholder activist movement, to take
stakes in poor performers and pressure their management into changes.
Lens takes a more adversarial approach to management than the large pension
funds. It initially targeted four companies - Sears Roebuck, Eastman Kodak,
Westinghouse and American Express - all of which subsequently went through
boardroom upheavals mainly because of shareholder pressure.
In its first year to last July, Lens' investments in the four companies
returned 26.1 per cent, compared with 7.2 per cent for the S&amp;P 500.
Piggybacking
Of course, few investors have Calpers ability to concentrate the minds of
under-performing managers. But others can piggy back on their efforts by
investing in the same stocks.
Calpers has selected 10 companies on which it will focus attention in the
1994 proxy season. They include three it targeted last year but are still
underperforming - paper company Boise Cascade, IBM and Westinghouse
Electric.
The other seven include two photographic companies, Eastman Kodak and CPI;
chemicals group First Mississippi; Navistar International, the truck
manufacturer; US Shoe, a footwear and clothing retailer; USX-Marathon, an
energy company, and Zenith, the television manufacturer. Lens Fund, which
claims to differ from large institutional funds in targeting not just
under-performers, but companies where it feels strong activism can make an
important difference, is invested in Westinghouse, engineering group Stone &amp;
Webster, Scott Paper and Borden, the troubled food group which has just
shaken up its top management.
So far, the US funds have limited their lists of under-performers to the US
market. But American institutional shareholders are beginning to raise
awkward questions about corporate governance at annual meetings of foreign
companies, and it is only a matter of time before they start demanding
explanations for poor performance from European and Japanese boards.

FT  07 MAR 94 / The Markets: EMU is still alive - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BISHOP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The emotion and heat of the Maastricht ratification process has faded. Many
politicians and market participants alike have written off Economic and
Monetary Union. That judgment may be too hasty.
Financial markets - liberalised by the Single European Market - have already
created such convergence of long-term interest rates among a core group of
EU members that no trend divergence in exchange rates is discounted: a de
facto EMU of the few.
A wave of elections will roll across Europe in the next two years. The newly
elected governments will have to strike a delicate balance between their
political ambitions for further integration and economic constraints. When
the next Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) starts in 1996 there will be a
formal constraint on them: will the Maastricht criteria to permit the start
of EMU be satisfied?
The criteria were explicitly designed to promote price stability but there
was an implicit strategic purpose: to minimise the risk that financial
instability could spill over into the political arena.
Yet the opposite has happened. Policy and financial markets have become
increasingly entwined. In 1992-93, financial markets - liberalised by the
single market - demonstrated their power to discipline policy by shifting
capital, prompting the upheavals in the ERM.
However, recognising the apparent contradiction of increasing their own
exposure to mobile capital, policy makers are, reluctantly, accepting the
importance of markets by emphasising that economic stability includes low
long-term interest rates. They should complete the U-turn and recognise the
significance of two clear messages from the financial markets:
The remarkable convergence of long-term interest rates in some EU members
since the ERM collapse implies that monetary union would run with the grain
of markets. Nominal bond yields, that were recently close to post-war lows
in many countries, imply that the purchasers of government debt do not feel
that public deficits are excessive amid deep recession and with inflation
heading for 30-year lows.
As the 1996 IGC assembles, the European Commission and the European Monetary
Institution (EMI) will examine compliance with the Maastricht convergence
criteria, which cover four main factors: inflation, long-term interest
rates, exchange rates and public finances.
Inflation prospects suggest 10 states should pass that test. The same states
had met the interest rate criterion before the February collapse in bond
markets.
The ERM test - respect the 'normal fluctuation margins for two years' - has
a different quality now that the margins appear likely to remain at 15 per
cent. The ERM criterion will become a simple test of whether exchange rate
fluctuations have been minimal.
As these criteria seem likely to be met, the state of public finance will be
the key. The judgment required that 'The Council shall . . . decide after an
overall assessment whether an excessive deficit exists'  - will be highly
political. That decision may be foreshadowed by the review, later this year,
of the member states' convergence programmes: will their 'planned deficits'
for 1996 be acceptable?
That is the test where the reality of the market should intrude. If the
capital flows of 1992-93 are any guide, the market will discipline states
for whom EMU is unrealistic. Those states that are genuinely convergent will
be presented with a de facto EMU.
The political judges should toughen the standard applied to long-term
interest rates - both to absolute levels and convergence - when deciding
whether a deficit is excessive. Both tests would reinforce the role of the
market's judgment on whether a budget deficit above 3 per cent is genuinely
excessive in the sense that it threatens stability. It is bond holders that
will pay the penalty most rapidly if the judgment turns out to be wrong.
That is why the market will react so powerfully. Such an approach could help
to depoliticise the most crucial judgment in the decision to move to Stage
Three of EMU, which would involve locking exchange rates together as a
prelude to a single currency.
EMU is unlikely to get star billing on the political agenda until well into
next year - at least until the German parliamentary, and probably French
presidential, elections are out of the way. And they are not the only
elections: in the next two years nearly 70 per cent of EU electors will go
to the polls. So most of the politicians who sit down at the 1996 IGC will
have a fresh democratic mandate. The electoral cycle may mesh with a
recovery in the economic 'feel-good' factor (see chart).
Historically, an upswing in Europe's economy has raised political spirits -
spurring another leap forward in integration. On the EEC's 25th birthday in
1982 when 'Eurosclerosis' feeling was at its most virulent - the Community
was regarded as politically dead. Yet political vision was restored as early
as December 1982 when the heads of government accepted the concept of the
Single European Market - opening the way to an irreversible liberalisation
of Europe's markets.
1996 could prove to be another momentous year. An EU already enlarged by the
accession of several Efta members will be acutely aware of the need to
reform its system of political institutions. Germany is likely to push for
the goal of political union, perhaps stimulated by unease over developments
in Russia. A touchstone of the commitment to deeper co-operation will be the
willingness to honour existing agreements - just when economic convergence
under the Maastricht timetable is being examined.
The governments which the financial markets have already pushed into de
facto EMU should be able to avoid an excessively legalistic interpretation
of the criteria. As economies improve there will be a powerful incentive for
states on the borderline of participation to redouble their efforts to join.
Those in power at the time may feel the issue should be postponed despite
the risk to the members of the core group that an external shock could
trigger a tidal wave of capital flows. Investors should reckon on a
significant probability that EMU is alive and will kick into operation this
century - and not exclude the possibility that it could start on schedule in
1997. Graham Bishop is Adviser on European Financial Affairs to Salomon
Brothers, London.

FT  07 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BA suspends plan to make further USAir
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways is suspending further investment in USAir until its US
airline partner restructures itself to cut losses.
USAir, the sixth largest US carrier, is expected to inform its unions this
week of BA's decision.
The UK carrier has already invested Dollars 400m in a 24 per cent stake in
USAir. It made its initial investment of Dollars 300m in January 1993 and
then invested a further Dollars 100m in May 1993 in a rights issue to
maintain its 24 per cent stake in the airline.
Under the original agreement with USAir, BA also planned to invest a further
Dollars 450m in the US carrier over the next five years in two separate
phases to bring its total stake to around 44 per cent.
But the UK carrier is now suspending any further financial investment in
USAir, whose management has been seeking union approval for significant
restructuring and cost reductions to return the carrier to profit.
USAir has faced particularly fierce competition from low-cost US airlines
and has continued to lose money. It made a pre-tax loss of Dollars 180m in
its latest quarter.
BA's decision to freeze its investment in USAir does not appear to have any
relation to the current difficult negotiations between the US and the UK
governments over a new aviation agreement between the two countries.
American Airlines and Delta Airlines, two of the biggest US carriers, have
asked their government to renounce the agreement with the UK and withdraw
BA's ticket co-sharing rights with USAir unless they can secure more access
to the UK market and especially to London's Heathrow airport.
BA's co-sharing agreement with USAir runs out on March 17. The UK government
has warned it would retaliate should the US government not renew the
agreement.

FT  07 MAR 94 / International Company News: Astra calms ulcer drug fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday insisted there were no
scientific grounds to justify a threat by the German authorities to bar an
intravenous application of its anti-ulcer drug Losec, the company's
biggest-selling product and the world's fifth-largest selling prescription
drug.
News that BGA, the German health agency, was considering withdrawing
approval of the intravenous injectible form of Losec on the suspicion that
it was linked to hearing and eye disorders sent Astra's share price lurching
downwards by 7 per cent on Friday. Astra A shares recovered later to end the
day down 3 per cent at SKr171, but the company will be watching anxiously
today to see if investors react further.
The German action followed the appearance of vision and hearing impairments
in patients being treated intravenously with Losec for bleeding ulcer
conditions. The BGA said it was concerned that omeprazole, the active
substance in Losec, caused the condition.
Intravenous injection accounts for only a small percentage of Losec sales.
But total sales of the drug were SKr127bn (Dollars 16.1bn) in 1993.

Aggregate premium income at Generali, Italy's biggest insurance company,
rose 13.5 per cent to L19,200bn (Dollars 11.3bn) in 1993 after a further
strong performance from its joint venture in Spain with Banco Central
Hispanoamericano, according to preliminary results, writes John Simkins in
Milan.
Generali said the parent company's net profits, which will be revealed after
a board meeting in early May, were expected to show an improvement on the
L389.8bn in 1992 in spite of a heavier tax burden. The parent company's
premium income was L9,550bn, an increase of 8.4 per cent. Adjusted for
currency factors, the rise was 4.3 per cent.

Sime Darby, the Malaysian-based conglomerate which claims to be south-east
Asia's biggest multinational, has announced pre-tax profits for the six
months to December 31 1993 of MDollars 420m (USDollars 150m), a 12 per cent
rise on a year ago.
Group turnover was up 18 per cent to MDollars 3.9bn. Sime Darby, once
plantation based, is involved in a wide range of activities including motor
vehicle assembly, the oil and gas industry, heavy equipment franchises,
property and, most recently, the power sector.
Sime's operations in Hong Kong, where it is the main automotive and heavy
equipment distributor, contributed most to overall group profits through
activities in Malaysia, particularly in the fast expanding infrastructure
sector.
Pre-tax profits on Hong Kong operations increased to MDollars 95m from
MDollars 72m in the six-month period compared with the equivalent period in
the previous year. Pre-tax profits on Malaysian operations went up to
MDollars 94m from MDollars 79m.
Pre-tax profits were generally unchanged across most other divisions of the
company although there was a steep fall in profits in the plantations
sector.

FT  07 MAR 94 / International Company News: VW builds a platform for growth
 -A look at the German carmaker's rationalisation plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen's radical plan to rationalise its new product development and
engineering operations is important for the group's chances of achieving
long-term profitability.
The strategy calls for a reduction in the number of the group's basic car
chassis platforms from the present 16 to four by the early years of the next
decade.
'It will take seven, eight or nine years to complete,' says Professor Ulrich
Seiffert, VW research and development director and chairman of the group
product strategy committee.
The present 'platform confusion' results from the historical development of
the group, he says, although he admits that earlier managements of which he
was part had been too weak in failing to rationalise the group's sprawling
product range.
'In a world of shrinking engineering capacities but global operations, and
with the the opening of previously closed markets, there is a need for a new
strategy,' he says.
While VW has introduced new technology and platforms for its mainstream
models, such as the third generation VW Golf launched in the autumn of 1991,
it has left earlier generation models in production at overseas plants.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, the controversial chairman of the VW group management
board, who is leading a ruthless corporate revolution at Europe's biggest
carmaker, is adamant that this wild proliferation must be controlled. The
group's future product development will be streamlined.
Prof Seiffert, who was demoted from the VW group board in one of Mr Piech's
early purges of top management last year only to be reinstated on the board
last autumn, is the man appointed to lead the implementation of the new
platform strategy.
He is introducing a strategy in which there will be only one lead developer
in the group for each of four basic platforms, but there will be several
users of each platform, which will develop their own distinctive models
under their own brandnames.
'Under the skin' models off one platform will be largely identical with many
shared components, but the parts of the car visible to the customer - for
example body styling or interior trim - will differ.
'There are a lot of parts that we can make identical for all cars from one
platform, the ABS braking system, the airconditioner, water pumps, airbags
or fuel injection nozzles. You can standardise. No one is interested if the
airbag inflator comes from one company or another. The customer only wants
it to work,' says Prof Seiffert.
All of the four platforms will be designed and developed in Germany, two by
the Volkswagen division and two by Audi. Derivatives may then be developed
by any of the four brandname divisions.
Volkswagen will develop the AO small car (Polo) and the lower-medium (Golf)
A platforms, while Audi will develop the executive car B platform and the
luxury car D platform.
The AO small car platform will be the basis for the new generation Polo to
be launched in the autumn, but it will also spawn the replacement for the
Skoda Favorit, and the next generation Seat Ibiza. The A platform will be
the basis for the next generation Golf but also for a small Audi, for the
Seat Toledo replacement and a new product range for Skoda.
Prof Seiffert defines a car platform to include the drive train from
radiator and fan to the engine and engine mountings, fuel lines, gearbox and
gear shift, steering column, fuel tank, brakes and cables, exhaust system,
front and rear axles, foot controls and wheels.
For each platform these will be common, he insists. The differentiation will
come in body styling, the dashboard, the seats, the bumpers - 'everything
above the floor pan and the drive train'.
He claims that 55 per cent to 60 per cent of the whole development cost for
a new car is in the platform. This is where he hopes the savings will come.
The platform leader may have 10 per cent more costs, but all the platform
users will be saved the entire platform development cost.
The gains Prof Seiffert promises to reap for the Volkswagen group include:
increased flexibility and transparency between plants producing derivatives
of the same platform. Production could be switched more easily between
plants. 'We will be able to compare plants; there will be no discussion any
more of the contents of the cars.' Greater certainty in the start-up phase
of new models with shared parts and systems.
Lower purchasing costs for components because of much higher purchasing
volumes and improved chances for global sourcing. The new Golf A platform
with its derivatives could be produced in a volume of 1m-1.5m units a year.

Telekom Malaysia, the partially-privatised telecommunications utility, has
announced pre-tax profits of MDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 536m) for calendar
1993, a 20 per cent rise on the previous year, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala
Lumpur.
The Malaysian government floated 25 per cent of Telekom on the Kuala Lumpur
stock exchange in late 1990 and the utility is the second largest listed
company on the market.
Mr Rashdan Baba, Telekom's executive chairman, said he expected Telekom's
customer base to expand by between 13 per cent and 15 per cent over the next
few years.
'I believe our profits are a reflection of the scope of the market for
telecommunications in Malaysia and, we'd like to think, management's ability
to manage the business for commercial success,' he said.
Telekom said operating revenue increased 15 per cent to MDollars 3.9bn in
1993 while expenditure increased by 12 per cent.

FT  07 MAR 94 / International Company News: Astra calms health fears over
its anti-ulcer drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday insisted there were no
scientific grounds to justify a threat by the German authorities to bar an
intravenous application of its anti-ulcer drug Losec, the company's
biggest-selling product and the world's fifth-largest selling prescription
drug.
News that BGA, the German health agency, was considering withdrawing
approval of the intravenous injectible form of Losec on the suspicion that
it was linked to hearing and eye disorders sent Astra's share price lurching
downwards by 7 per cent on Friday. Astra A shares recovered later to end the
day down 3 per cent at SKr171, but the company will be watching anxiously
today to see if investors react further.
The German action followed the appearance of vision and hearing impairments
in patients being treated intravenously with Losec for bleeding ulcer
conditions. The BGA said it was concerned that omeprazole, the active
substance in Losec, caused the condition. In a letter to Astra, the agency
gave the Swedish company three weeks to respond.
Mr Staffan Ternby, investor relations chief at Astra, said the company had
been aware of the problems in the bleeding ulcer patients since last autumn.
Investigations by the group and by outside specialists had since found no
evidence to link Losec to the conditions, he said. Astra believed they were
caused by the underlying disease affecting the patients, not the drug.
'We are confident we can show scientifically that there is no connection. We
are not too worried by this letter from the German authorities,' he said.
Intravenous injection accounts for only a small percentage of Losec sales.
But total sales of the drug were SKr127bn (Dollars 16.1bn) in 1993.

Share prices of companies controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family jumped
late last week in the wake of reports that Anglo American of South Africa
was negotiating to acquire a large stake in the Canadian resources, real
estate and financial services empire.
Anglo American and the Bronfman group declined to comment, which suggested
that the South African conglomerate might invest an initial CDollars 300m
(USDollars 227m) in one of the Bronfmans' top holding companies.
Anglo, through Minorco, its international resources arm, is said to be
interested in Noranda, the Toronto-based mining, forestry and energy group.
Noranda shares gained CDollars 1.25 last week to CDollars 26.25.
Mr Alf Powis, Noranda's chairman, said that 'there have been conversations
between the (Bronfman) group and Anglo American.'
However, Mr Powis said he was under the impression that the contacts had
been terminated.

FT  07 MAR 94 / UK Company News: 600 Group to launch lathe range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
600 Group, the manufacturer and distributor of machine tools and materials
handling equipment, will next month launch a new range of low-cost
Colchester lathes specially designed for small engineering companies.
The launch is an important move for 600 Group. Within two to three years, it
hopes to be producing several hundred of the new Tornado machines each year
from its 600 Lathes plant in Heckmondwike, West Yorkshire.
The three new machines will be priced from Pounds 34,950 to Pounds 47,950 in
the UK, and could add Pounds 5m to 600 Group's profits within a few years,
said Mr Colin Gaskell, managing director.
In the year to March 1993, the company incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds
2.4m.
The launch follows a two-year, Pounds 500,000 development programme and a
market research exercise among 3,500 small engineering companies worldwide
to assess their needs for CNC (computer numerical control) lathes.

FT  07 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Interest deferral hits Heron shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices of Heron International's bonds and shares fell on Friday after
Thursday night's news that bondholders would be asked for a three-month
deferral of interest payments.
The securities were issued as part of last September's Pounds 1.4bn
restructuring. The senior bonds, which had been quoted at 68-73 per cent of
par value, fell on Friday to 60-65 per cent, while junior bonds fell from
20-25 per cent to 12-17 per cent. The shares fell from 14p-19p to 8p-13p.
The main cause of the proposed interest payment delay is the substantial
fall in Spanish property values. The interest payments were largely
dependent on the sale of some of the Heron head office division's Spanish
properties. Heron, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group, also said that it
would put proposals to bondholders converting a portion of the senior bonds
into a new debt instrument which could convert into equity. Heron said it
could no longer predict with any degree of prudence that the senior bonds
would be repaid in full.
Mr Ronson, whose shareholdings including his family and charitable trusts
fell from 100 per cent to 5 per cent under the restructuring, is now less
likely to achieve the maximum shareholding under the management incentive
plan.
That would have given Mr Ronson 85 per cent of a 25 per cent stake in the
group if the senior and junior bonds been repaid in full by March 31 2000
and the net asset value of the group exceeded Pounds 210m at the same date.

FT  07 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Robert Wiseman Dairies likely to have
Pounds 60m value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Wiseman Dairies, the Scottish milk company which concentrates on
supplying branded milk in cartons to stores in Scotland, is coming to market
towards the end of this month via an institutional placing by Panmure Gordon
which is likely to value the family-owned company at about Pounds 60m.
The placing should raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 16m, leaving 75 per
cent of the company in family hands.
It comes to the market at a time of big changes in the UK milk industry.
Later this year the government intends to abolish the milk marketing boards,
which have a monopoly on buying milk from farmers. Dairy Crest, the milk
processing and supply subsidiary of the MMB in England, is also likely to be
floated.
Whereas in England nearly 60 per cent of milk is still delivered to the
customer's doorstep, in Scotland most people buy it from a supermarket or
corner shop. Early recognition of the trends which produced that state of
affairs lie behind Wiseman's fast growth. It is now expanding in northern
England, where doorstep deliveries are also in decline.
Wiseman, as a traditional dairy company which processed and delivered milk
to the doorsteps around Glasgow, became convinced by the late 1970s that
doorstep delivery was dying out.
'Increasingly the Scottish housewife was going out to work, leaving home
before the milkman had come, and found it easier and cheaper to buy milk at
a shop,' says Mr Alan Wiseman, the 43-year-old executive chairman. He and
his brother, Robert, run the business which was founded in the late 1940s by
their father, also called Robert.
Wiseman decided to concentrate on the wholesale market, and invested in
systems for providing milk in non-returnable containers to supermarkets such
as Asda and Tesco under their own labels. However, this meant that Wiseman's
own identity was disappearing, so in 1989 it launched its own brands of
liquid milk and put its black and white logo on its cartons and big trucks.
Wiseman claims to have 22 per cent of the Scottish milk market and to be its
second largest processor and supplier, coming after Scottish Pride, the
Scottish Milk Marketing Board's offshoot. More than half Wiseman's milk goes
out under its own brand.
Its doorstep deliveries are franchised to self-employed milkmen. The
proportion of Scottish milk delivered door to door is now only 22 per cent,
having fallen from 44 per cent in 1983.
In England that proportion has declined from 86 per cent in 1983 to 58 per
cent last year.
Wiseman's turnover grew by 44 per cent between 1991 and 1993, when it
reached Pounds 46m. Pre-tax profits in 1993 were Pounds 3.3m. Turnover for
the year to March 31 1994 is expected to be about Pounds 60m and pre-tax
profits to be about Pounds 4.5m.
Last year the chairman and his brother were paid Pounds 885,000 in salary
and bonuses, making them among the best paid directors in Scotland. But the
way they are remunerated will change as the company is restructured for
flotation.

FT  07 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ladbroke goes back to casinos after 14
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased demand for gambling has prompted Ladbroke, the hotels, betting and
home improvement group, to consider relaunching its casino business for the
first time in more than 14 years.
The company, which last week reported a 21 per cent fall in pre-exceptional
profits to Pounds 117.5m, hinted yesterday that it was keen to exploit the
success of the gaming industry, particularly in the US where it earns more
than Dollars 10bn a year.
Plans to revive the division would mark Ladbroke's first return to casino
operations in Britain since 1979, when it was ordered to surrender three
licences following legal action about the way it tried to win business from
rival companies.
'We are looking at expanding our interests in gaming around the world, and
that includes the UK,' the company said.
A return to casino operations is expected to begin in the US where Ladbroke
has been awarded gaming licences in four states: California, Texas,
Pennsylvania and Michigan.
'The US is the biggest growth market, and we'd like to see significant
growth out of casino and gaming operations there,' the company added.
The proposals are thought to have been encouraged by Mr Peter George,
Ladbroke's recently-promoted chief executive, and Mr Mike Smith, the former
head of bookmaking at William Hill - who is joining the group shortly as
head of gaming operations.
Mr George, a former managing director of the company's racing operations, is
said to have sanctioned the move following his appointment in January and
the retirement of Ladbroke founder Mr Cyril Stein.
The company's renewed interest in casinos has emerged within days of it
admitting that trading conditions at its Hilton International hotels
subsidiary remained difficult and that product cutbacks were necessary at
Texas Homecare, the DIY chain.

FT  07 MAR 94 / UK Company News: QMH has big proxy vote in its favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, is understood to have substantial proxy
votes in favour of resolutions to be put at two extraordinary meetings
tomorrow.
If the resolutions, which confirm the group's Pounds 2bn borrowing limit,
are not passed the company will not be able to continue trading.
Shareholders are unlikely to receive any new information about progress of
financial restructuring, disposals or current trading. The group should soon
receive the latest property valuation, which will be incorporated in the
1993 accounts.
However, some holders may use the the meeting to raise other questions. Mr
John Bairstow, former chairman, said last week that the resolution being put
should be divided into two.
The first approving the borrowing limit and the second releasing present
directors from any liability caused by the error which called the borrowing
limit into question.
Mr Bairstow said if the resolution was in two parts then shareholders could
vote on each issue separately.
QMH dismissed his suggestion yesterday, saying that the two parts of the
resolution were 'inextricably linked'.
The second meeting is for holders of the 7 per cent convertible preference
shares who were mistakenly excluded from voting on borrowing powers at
annual meetings.
Shareholders may also ask who was responsible for the oversight which
necessitated the meetings.
The problem dates back to 1989 when the preference shareholders were first
omitted from voting on a change of borrowing powers.

FT  07 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Westland hits out over orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westland, the helicopter manufacturer, yesterday claimed GKN was trying to
undermine its order prospects as part of its Pounds 496m hostile takeover
bid.
The Yeovil-based company accused Sir David Lees, chairman of the engineering
and industrial services group, of exploiting extracts from its defence
document to persuade shareholders that most of its orders could be cancelled
or postponed.
It was responding to an open letter from Sir David, which which attempted to
play down hostility between the two companies, but went on to describe the
group's prospects as speculative and uncertain.
Mr Alan Jones, Westland chairman, said: 'He knows our prospects are strong.
He is raising questions over orders and wants our shareholders to sell at a
discount - that's certainly hostile.'
GKN, which already controls 45 per cent of Westland, has offered
shareholders 290p per share - a discount of almost 12 per cent to Friday's
329p closing price.
Mr Jones also dismissed an offer by GKN to alter the terms of a potential
compensation package to Westland shareholders arising out of a damages claim
against the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation.
Under its original offer last month, the engineering group promised a
partial pay-out should Westland receive more than Pounds 82m in damages from
the AOI, which has been ordered to pay Pounds 385m over cancelled helicopter
orders.
GKN has now reduced the threshold for a share-out of any damages to Pounds
65m, reflecting the Pounds 25m - some Pounds 17m after tax - which Westland
has already received in partial compensation.
Although GKN admitted the revised terms 'do not materially change the
offer', Sir David said: 'Our offer price of 290p plus the AOI entitlement is
a very fair one which properly reflects the prospects for Westland.'
Sir David Lees is meeting executives from Standard Life and Scottish Widows
in Scotland today. These together control 5.5 per cent of GKN and hold small
stakes in Westland.
His efforts, however, are expected to concentrate on M&amp;G and Schroders,
which hold more than 25 per cent of the helicopter company. The two
companies are also the largest institutional shareholders in GKN - together
controlling 9.5 per cent.
Support from either group would secure Westland for GKN.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Peruvian business to issue Eurobonds
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A consumer goods and pharmaceuticals group plans to become the first
Peruvian company for over a decade to make a Eurobond issue, marking a big
step in the nation's financial rehabilitation.
The Rodriguez Group hopes to raise Dollars 40m (Pounds 27.3m). It will
part-finance the group's Dollars 67m acquisition two weeks ago of Cementos
Yura, a formerly state-owned cement producer.
Lead manager for the issue is VestcorpPartners Group, a Latin American
investment bank with offices in Miami and London. VestcorpPartners is
underwriting the issue and taking a 15 per cent stake in Cementos Yura.
Peru has being largely marginalised from the international financial
community for 25 years, with predominantly statist and protectionist
democratic governments succeeding a long period of rule by left-wing
military.
But since the election of President Alberto Fujimori in 1990, it has mended
its fences with international creditors. Arrears with multilateral
organisations have been settled and it is following an IMF-monitored
economic programme.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Digital cuts 6,000 jobs in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment, the troubled US-based computer manufacturer, is to cut up
to 6,000 jobs in Europe over the next 12 months. The cuts represent about 20
per cent of the workforce and are twice as large as anticipated earlier this
year.
The redundancies are key to a regeneration plan being put in place by Mr
Vincenzo Damiani, who took over as head of Digital Europe in January.
Letters were being sent this weekend to staff throughout Europe, explaining
the rationale for the plan.
The company, once second only to IBM as a computer supplier, is suffering
from declining sales and unsustainable overheads. About 50 per cent of its
revenues derive from European operations and it has been hit hard by the
recession.
In common with other large computer manufacturers, Digital was slow to
appreciate the importance of personal computers or to anticipate the
emergence of networks of small computers as replacements for expensive, high
margin, mainframe systems. The smaller systems command low gross profit
margins.
For the six months to January 1 this year, Digital reported a net loss of
Dollars 155.3m (Pounds 106.3m) compared with a loss of Dollars 334.4m in the
same period the year before.
Mr Damiani, formerly a senior executive at IBM, said that on arrival he had
put in place project teams to analyse the company's business model. The
teams had now reported and their conclusions were the basis of the decision
to cut numbers from approximately 29,000 in Europe to under 25,000.
Mr Damiani said that, commercially, Digital had failed to work coherently
with its business partners - software companies, systems integrators and
distributors, who sell Digital computers directly to customers and who add
value in the form of special software.
The new strategy is designed to avoid competition for customers between
Digital and these partners. The company's 500 key European accounts will be
covered by dedicated account executives: 'They will be measured on the
percentage that Digital takes of the customer's total information technology
spend, no matter what channel is used,' Mr Damiani said.

FT  07 MAR 94 / BAe in talks with Giat over Royal Ordnance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace said yesterday that it had been in talks for some weeks
with the arms manufacturer Giat, which could lead to collaboration in some
form between the state-owned French company and the BAe munitions subsidiary
Royal Ordnance.
A BAe spokesman said the talks were exploratory; no agenda or timetable had
been set and there was no guarantee of their outcome. He did not rule out
the possibility of a merger between Giat and Royal Ordnance, but compared
the talks with the protracted negotiations between BAe and the French
Matra-Hachette group, which are expected to lead to the two companies
merging their guided weapons activities.
Royal Ordnance, sold to BAe by the government in 1987, is believed to be
losing money in spite of extensive restructuring. It has been struggling to
find export orders to offset declining defence hardware requirements in the
UK. In January, BAe cut more than 400 jobs at the Ordnance's Chorley factory
in Lancashire. The Ordnance now has a total UK workforce spread over 12
sites of about 4,500 compared with 16,000 at the time of the sale to BAe. A
further 1,000 staff are employed in Germany
The BAe spokesman said Royal Ordnance and Giat were investigating the
possibility of pooling resources to improve the quality of their businesses.
Both Royal Ordnance and Giat manufacture guns and ammunition. They compete
in certain areas and might continue to do so even if co-operation was
agreed, the spokesman said.
BAe, which reported a loss before tax of Pounds 273m last month, has been
refocusing on its core activities of defence and aerospace, selling off
Rover Cars to BMW and also disposing of its Corporate Jets business and the
Ballast Nedham group of construction companies.
Giat, which recorded a loss of FFr400m (Pounds 45.81m) on sales of FFr11.3bn
in 1991, was transformed from a defence ministry agency to a semi-autonomous
state owned company in 1990. It is one of the group of state-owned companies
that the French government is anxious to privatise.
Neither Giat nor the French industry ministry were available for comment
last night.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): An acquisitive animal faces City
unease - BTR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Why have shares in BTR underperformed the market by about 20 per cent since
last August? That question is likely to be exercising the executives of one
of Britain's biggest and most successful international manufacturing
companies as they prepare to present the group's 1993 results on Thursday.
BTR unsettled the market by warning in September that the outlook remained
uncertain for economic recovery in the second half. Analysts duly trimmed
their forecasts and the current expectation is for pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 1.23bn, compared with Pounds 1.06bn.
But Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive, will also want to dispel some of the
less tangible unease that has been expressed about BTR. This has cited
everything from executive departures to Mr Jackson's sale in January of half
of his shares in the company.
A more long-standing issue is the extent of BTR's reliance on acquisition
accounting. This concern was revived recently by the analyst Mr Terry Smith
whose book, Accounting for Growth, has enjoyed considerable success. BTR has
used up nearly all the provisions set up when buying Hawker Siddeley, the
aerospace and engineering group, for Pounds 1.5bn in 1991.
Analysts will ask what provisions have been created for Rexnord, the US
manufacturer bought for Dollars 820m (Pounds 560m) in December. Some who
felt BTR might have overpaid for Rexnord will also be scrutinising its
likely contribution to profits. The Rexnord deal pushed gearing above 90 per
cent, but the debt level is being reduced by such cash-raising deals as this
month's Pounds 200m flotation of Graham Group, the builders merchants.
The group has hit rougher patches with the City than this. Perhaps Mr
Jackson's main task is to reassure shareholders that economic upturn will
benefit BTR as well as more obvious recovery stocks.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Silver lining to a year of drama
and cost - Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, Sweden's biggest manufacturer, will on Thursday report its results
for 1993 - a year in which it forged a merger with France's Renault only to
renege on the deal in December.
The immediate impact of the merger's collapse - and the subsequent
unravelling of a three-year-old alliance - will be to drag Volvo down to a
pre-tax loss for the third time in four years. This will follow the SKr3.3bn
(Pounds 280m) pre-tax loss incurred in 1992. Volvo said last month that it
would write off SKr5.2bn against 1993 earnings in goodwill and provisions
related to the dismantling of cross holdings in the state-owned French
company.
But Volvo will direct attention towards a much more favourable underlying
picture of rapidly rising operating profits. One Stockholm analyst predicts
a profit before write-downs and minority items of almost SKr2.7bn.
Volvo has benefited from a number of favourable factors. The pay-off from
the krona's devaluation is coming through strongly, new model development
costs are at a low point and sales are picking up in Sweden, the US and the
UK.
But shareholders will have to wait until the annual meeting in April for
answers to the more worrying question of what its long-term strategy will be
now that it is without a partner in the tough motor industry world.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Hedge funds put G10 in quandary: The world's leading central
banks find one class of investment group almost beyond the reach of their
influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the face of it, the Group of Ten central bankers gathered in Basle today
to discuss the state of global financial markets might as well not waste
their breath on hedge funds. It is not only hard to define which investment
funds fall into this category, but also bankers' powers to sway them are
extremely weak.
Central banks do not have the direct control over hedge funds that most of
them do over banks. The funds - although mostly managed in the US - tend to
be based offshore and are not supervised by bank or securities regulators.
Nonetheless, the G10 central bankers have three reasons to be worried about
these funds.
First, they appear to have added to volatility by selling as bets on
currency, securities markets and derivatives went wrong. Second, heavy
losses could make funds default on loans from banks. Third, funds that could
not settle contracts might spark off a chain reaction affecting financial
systems.
This combination of concern, and the inability to do much to address it, may
well disquiet central bankers. The question is whether they will either try
to create regulations to allow them to intervene directly, or try to exert
greater indirect influence on hedge funds through supervised banks.
The first approach carries both practical and theoretical problems. In
practical terms, it is hard to draw a boundary between hedge funds and other
funds that manage institutional and private client money. Any change in
regulations would be complex and would have to be co-ordinated across
borders.
The theoretical problem is that hedge funds appear to be doing nothing
wrong. Leveraging risk to make big gains in the short term, while risking
sharp losses, is a common investment strategy. Regulating funds to prevent a
particular trade-off between risk and reward would be heavily dirigiste.
This leaves central banks with the possibility of exerting indirect
influence through banks. There is a promising start in that funds often
leverage their capital by buying securities and derivatives in tranches,
then borrowing more cash against the positions to make further purchases.
This exposes banks to credit risk, a legitimate concern of supervisors.
Banks hold securities of the same value as the cash they lend, with an extra
margin of perhaps 5 per cent to cover risk. Most mark the value of the
securities to market each day to ensure that they are not over-exposed.
These activities are being examined by the Bank of England and the US
Federal Reserve, although a director of one large UK bank says that most of
such lending is done in the US. Like other corporate lending, there has been
some pressure on margins as banks compete for business amid weak demand for
loans.
One New York bank, which says that it only trades with hedge funds in
foreign exchange markets, claims it requires a margin of 5 per cent, but
that others will trade at lower margins. 'Some (margins) just aren't big
enough to cover the daily swings you get in today's markets,' a banker says.
Volatile markets can eat up margins. Mr John Leonard, an analyst at Salomon
Brothers, says that positions can move substantially overnight. 'You have to
be aware if a fund is heading south quickly - where is the next margin call
going to come from?' says one bank's head of risk management.
Banks find it hard to assess credit risk accurately because hedge funds are
not credit rated, and hold a complex range of financial contracts. Some
funds also refuse to provide net asset valuations, an essential tool for
banks assessing the overall health of funds as financial counterparties.
In spite of such problems, the most recent proposals on market risk by
international bank supervisors could require banks to set aside less capital
against hedge fund exposures. At the moment, all reductions in the value of
securities held against loans to funds count as potential losses to banks.
This would change under the netting proposals issued by banking supervisors
last year along with proposals on market risks. Commercial banks should in
future be allowed to net off losses in the market value of securities
against the extra cash margin deposited with them by hedge funds.
Bankers argue that credit risks can be exaggerated. Banks can call for extra
margin payments if securities fall in value sharply, and lose only if funds
fail. 'This is not a credit quality issue,' one banker says. 'It is to do
with what happens to markets if funds all head for the exit at once.'
They also argue that they have been dragged into the debate illogically.
'Regulation only affects people who are easily regulated, and that usually
means us,' a banker says. Yet no matter how clumsy the weapon, it may be the
only one available if today's meeting opts to crack down on hedge funds.

FT  07 MAR 94 / VW embarks on plan to cut car production costs: Piech
strategy aims to simplify global operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WOLFSBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Volkswagen group of Germany, Europe's leading carmaker, is embarking on
a radical restructuring of car development and engineering operations to cut
costs and simplify its global manufacturing activities.
VW, which is losing money heavily, is planning to reduce the number of basic
chassis platforms which are used to produce its range of cars from 16 to
just four by the next decade.
The strategy will embrace all four makes in the group - Volkswagen, Audi,
Seat and Skoda - and will eventually have a big impact on its manufacturing
operations in Germany, Spain, the Czech Republic, Brazil, Mexico, China and
South Africa. It will hold the key in the long term to VW overcoming its
unenviable position as the high-cost producer in the European and world car
industry.
Volkswagen, led by Mr Ferdinand Piech, the controversial management board
chairman appointed 14 months ago, has sought in the short term to stem
losses by a harsh mixture of deep cuts in capital spending, a sharp
reduction in the workforce and the introduction in Germany of a four-day
week with corresponding cuts in pay. He has also imposed a squeeze on
components suppliers to reduce purchasing costs.
If the strategy is applied as rigidly as planned by Mr Piech and Professor
Ulrich Seiffert, group research and development director, it will spell the
end for production of the Beetle, assembled in Mexico and Brazil.
It will also rule out development of new products such as a micro-compact
car, like the two-seater city car prototype unveiled by Mercedes-Benz last
week which would call for an additional platform.
Prof Seiffert said the VW group's four car platforms (excluding light
commercial vehicles and the multipurpose vehicle under development with Ford
of Europe) would consist of:
the AO platform for small cars, which will form the basis of the new
generation VW Polo, due for launch in the autumn, and will later spawn
derivatives to replace cars such as the Skoda Favorit and the Seat Ibiza
launched last year.
VW's planned low-price small four-seater car due for production in 1996-97
would be based on a shortened version of the AO platform.
the A platform for lower medium cars, which will provide the base for the
next VW Golf, a second Skoda range, a new small car for Audi (A2), and a
Seat Toledo replacement.
the B platform for upper medium and executive cars, which will spawn
replacements for the Audi 80 (A4) and 100 (A6) and the next VW Passat.
the D platform for the aluminium-bodied Audi A8 luxury car.
In a separate move, VW is increasing its stake in VAG Sverige, its Swedish
importer and subsidiary of Saab-Scania, the Swedish truck and aerospace
group. It is expected to raise its holding to 50 per cent from one-third and
to increase representation on the six-man board from two to three.
VAG Sverige is the importer and distributor for VW, Audi and Seat cars in
Sweden and had sales last year of 19,200 units with turnover of DM765m.
Volkswagen has increased holdings in its main distributors in Europe, and
now controls distribution in its main markets of Germany, France, Italy, the
UK and Spain.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Healthcare reforms hit drug sales in European markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drugs sales in Europe's seven largest markets fell sharply in dollar terms
last year after widescale healthcare reforms.
Europe's five largest markets - Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Spain -
have all announced or enacted reforms over the last 15 months. Sales in the
seven largest markets, which include Belgium and the Netherlands, fell from
Dollars 51.6bn (Pounds 34.6bn) in 1992 to Dollars 45.97bn last year,
according to IMS International, a market research group.
In the German market, Europe's biggest, sales dropped to Dollars 12.66bn
from Dollars 14.82bn in 1992 - a fall of 9 per cent in local currencies.
Italy, the third largest market, also declined, from Dollars 11.06bn to
Dollars 8.45bn.
The rate of sales growth fell in every therapeutic category in Europe. The
cardiovascular market, which expanded at 7 per cent in 1992, grew only 2 per
cent last year to Dollars 10.13bn. The growth rate for treatments for
alimentary and metabolism disorders, the second most important category,
also fell, down from 8 per cent in 1992 to only 1 per cent last year.
The anti-infectives market which include anti-virals, antibiotics and
anti-fungal drugs, posted the strongest growth, up 8 per cent last year
compared with 9 per cent in 1992.
Meanwhile, the US market, the world's largest, expanded only 5 per cent from
Dollars 42.95bn to Dollars 45.22bn. Companies operating there have suffered
from both political pressure aimed at moderating price rises and the
negotiating of discounts by bulk purchasers. The Canadian market grew by 7
per cent in local currency, and rose from Dollars 3.5bn to Dollars 3.514bn
measured in US dollars.
The Japanese pharmacy market - excluding hospitals - increased by 6 per cent
in yen terms, up from Dollars 16.6bn in 1992 to Dollars 20.2bn last year.
But the Japanese ministry of health and welfare is implementing a 6.6 per
cent price cut and other reforms aimed at limiting drugs spend-ing.
Sales of cardiovascular drugs in the 10 largest markets - the US, Canada,
Japan and the seven European countries - rose by only 1 per cent in local
currency value, although in dollar terms they actually fell from Dollars
21.98bn to Dollars 21.2bn.
Among the largest categories, anti-infectives were the best performers, up
from Dollars 11.02bn to Dollars 11.7bn, a rise 9 per cent in local
currencies.
Worst performing were musculo-skeletal treatments - mostly anti-rheumatics.
This was the only category to register a year-on-year local currency decline
in the 10 markets.
Sales fell by 1 per cent, as a series of patents expiring around the world
undermined the market, which dropped from Dollars 7.13bn to Dollars 6.91bn.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Ukraine rejects Black Sea fleet deal in gas row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The commander of Ukraine's navy has repudiated last September's accord which
transferred the Black Sea Fleet from joint Russian-Ukrainian jurisdiction to
exclusively Russian control.
The move comes as relations between the two Slav neighbours deteriorate
because of heavy cuts in Russian gas supplies to Ukraine and tension over
the status of the Russian-dominated Crimean region of Ukraine.
Russia has used Ukraine's Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.2bn) energy debt as
leverage to gain Ukraine's share of the 350-vessel fleet based in Ukraine.
But Russia, which is in deep economic difficulties, is now calling in the
energy debt, leaving Ukraine with little to lose by refusing to hand over
the fleet.
Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, is also threatening to renege
on a deal to give up his country's nuclear arsenal.
As Russia's gas giant Gazprom announced further deep gas cuts to Ukraine
over the weekend, Mr Kravchuk said in Washington that 'fulfilment of all
agreements, including agreements on nuclear commitments, is possible only if
the economy works. If tomorrow factories come to a halt in Ukraine, and this
is a reality if there is no gas, what carrying out of commitments can be
spoken of?'
However, the official news agency Itar Tass said yesterday that the first 60
of the 1,600 warheads due to be shipped out of Ukraine arrived on a train in
Russia on Saturday. On Friday, Russia's nuclear energy ministry said that it
had begun to supply low-enriched uranium to Ukraine, thus honouring its part
of the agreement reached in Moscow in January between Ukraine, Russia and
the US.
Meanwhile, in the naval port of Sevastopol, Vice-Admiral Vladimir
Bezkorovainyi, who took part in last September's talks on the Black Sea
Fleet, said the Ukrainian side was now demanding a reversion to a 1992
agreement, under which the fleet would be divided by the end of 1995.
Ukraine is building up a separate fleet, just five ships so far. It claims
most of those serving in the fleet are Ukrainian, though most officers are
Russian.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is remarkable how little impact the turmoil in the bond markets has had
on the dollar. Perhaps the consensus, which believed it would rise this year
as the Federal Reserve tightened, was wrong about currencies too. Certainly
the 7.5 per cent US growth rate achieved in the fourth 1993 quarter, the
January purchasing managers survey and the latest robust employment figures
should push the dollar up. In the event it is trading slightly lower against
the D-Mark than when the Federal Reserve tightened a month ago.
Some of this may have to do with the trade pressures that the US is exerting
on Japan. The dollar's weakness against the yen has spilled over into the
D-Mark as well, though that could change now that the US has shifted the
focus from the currency market to direct sanctions under section 301 of its
trade act. Leveraged investors may also be selling D-Mark positions they
have held profitably for some time to cover their losses in other markets.
Yet it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the forces in favour of
the dollar are weaker than the market thought. Germany's steep money supply
growth will almost certainly delay Bundesbank interest rate cuts, and though
the Fed will almost certainly tighten further it is far from clear how far
the process will go. The interest rate differential may still not do much to
help the dollar. Meanwhile the US current account deficit is a drag. And if
the market is reluctant to buy dollars now, that may be because it is long
enough already.

of British Rail will have to earn their fees given the complexities of the
task. After all, British Rail is a Pounds 3bn-turnover business which will
shrink further when divided between Railtrack and various franchise
operators. Moreover, the railway network has a poor record, having steadily
lost market share to other transport systems for years. It now accounts for
just 7 per cent of all passenger miles travelled in the UK and has a
similarly small share of the freight market. The goodwill attached to
British Rail's name is unlikely to be large.
Cast in a rosy light, Railtrack, which will own the track and signalling,
could yet emerge as a privatised transport utility stock with a passing
resemblance to a ports company or the airports operator, BAA. Its permitted
rate of return will be the critical determinant of its saleability.
But attracting franchise operators with sufficient capital to exploit the
network is an altogether different proposition. Some quoted bus companies,
such as Badgerline, have expressed a tentative interest. But they await the
results of shadow franchise schemes to give a clearer idea of the relative
financial attractions. The Office of Fair Trading has also to determine
whether bus operators can run franchises in the same catchment areas.
The tasks of co-ordinating different franchisees' operations could be
colossal. The franchising director will have to possess the judgment of
Solomon to arbitrate between them.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was much excitement a while back when long gilts yields fell below
property yields for the first time in a generation. That made property seem
an especially attractive asset given its characteristics as a quasi-bond
with a 25-year lease and a minimum fixed income stream once fully let. A
surge of buying interest is now driving down property yields. But with bond
yields backing up again, the two yield lines are rapidly converging.
That may give some asset allocation committees pause for thought, which
would be no bad thing. Buying has become almost frantic, with some
properties changing hands at eye-watering yields. Property shares, too,
appear temporarily to have run ahead of themselves. For example, Land
Securities' share price has moved to a 41 per cent premium to its last
stated net asset value of 504p per share. The value of Land's existing
portfolio will have to rise at a thumping rate if its share price is to
revert to the discount to net asset values which is traditional for property
companies.
Historically, however, there has been little correlation between long gilt
and property yields. The property sector marches to its own tune and is
still at the early stages of its cyclical upswing. The big hope now is that
rental growth may resume in the latter part of this year. Any awakening of
dormant inflation would hasten its arrival while blighting the attractions
of gilts. Retail rents may recover first, followed by industrial property
and high quality London offices. But, as ever, selectivity is critical.

FT  07 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Taking a shine to metals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ announces full-year results this week against the cheerful background of
rising base metals prices. Copper, the company's most important metal, has
risen by 15 per cent from the depths plumbed last autumn. That pattern has
been repeated in aluminium, nickel and tin. The strength of the rally is
surprising given the discouraging fundamentals. Most metals markets face
huge overhangs of stock, which could increase again this year.
Forecasting the supply-demand balance in most metals is unusually tricky at
present. Imponderables such as the growth of Chinese copper consumption and
the level of aluminium exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States
cloud an already murky picture. Even on the most optimistic assumptions,
though, stock overhangs are likely to remain a feature well into next year.
On that basis, the turn in metals prices has come unusually early in the
economic cycle.
Speculative buying may provide an explanation. Low interest rates have
always increased the attractions of metals for fund managers by reducing the
carrying costs. With copper still 30 per cent below the peak reached in
1989, for example, the metal is clearly cheap. But rising trading volumes on
the London Metals Exchange have made base metals more liquid investments in
recent years. Improved clearing arrangements have added to the attractions.
If a substantial proportion of stocks are now held by fund managers, metals
markets may be tighter than hitherto assumed. Were such investment to prove
more than a passing fad, rising metals prices may no longer be the
late-cycle phenomenon of old.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Obstacles on the mainline: Charles Batchelor assesses the
remaining problems facing British Rail as it prepares for privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cut-price fares; a 'kids go free' scheme; discounts on purchases at airport
duty-free shops. The 27 miles from London to Gatwick airport have become the
most hotly-contested stretch of British Rail track.
The three companies competing on the Gatwick line are providing a first
glimpse of what rail privatisation might mean for Britain after 45 years of
a nationalised network.
Critics of privatisation say that competition on the Gatwick route consists
of marketing gimmicks that have simply confused travellers unused to
competition on the railway. But the outcome of the battle for the airport
passenger will provide vital markers for the future of BR's entire
10,270-mile network.
Gatwick Express is the first of BR's 'shadow franchises' - parts of the
railway network which will be run by their existing management as
independent operations to establish how attractive they might be for private
bidders.
The experience of its first few weeks provides an indication of how
difficult it will be to run a railway at a profit. Gatwick Express just
about broke even in spite of carrying higher than expected numbers of
passengers because of a surge in the volume of travellers passing through
Gatwick.
Gatwick is an experiment on a very modest scale but it illustrates the size
and nature of the problems still to be addressed when private-sector
managers, including management buy-out teams from BR, get down to making the
theory of privatisation work in practice.
For all the controversy that accompanied the passage of the railways bill
through parliament last year, the proposed framework still falls far short
of the conventional pattern of privatisation of the past decade. BR's losses
 -Pounds 164m in 1992-93 in spite of a government subsidy of more than
Pounds 600m - forced the government to adopt a compromise: franchising out
the running of the trains to private operators while offering them subsidies
where necessary.
The sale of franchises is due to start this year with Gatwick Express and
accelerate through 1995 as more lines are prepared for operation as
independent companies. However, some BR managers believe BR will be unable
to keep to this ambitious timetable.
A separate company, Railtrack, has been set up to take over the ownership of
BR's infrastructure from April 1. Railtrack last month announced its charges
for train-operating companies that wish to use BR track. The charges are
sharply higher than those made to BR's regions under its internal accounting
system. Railtrack says private-sector train operators will be compensated
for the higher track charges with an increased subsidy. But some potential
bidders for BR franchises say the onerous track charges will push even
profitable parts of BR into loss. Private-sector operators would also be
vulnerable if state subsidies are reduced in the future.
Railtrack itself is due to be privatised within the next few years under the
leadership of its chairman, Mr Bob Horton, a former chief executive of
British Petroleum. Two other key personalities have also started to piece
together the rail privatisation jigsaw. Mr Roger Salmon, a former merchant
banker, has been appointed by the government as franchising director to
negotiate contracts with private bidders for BR's operations. Mr John Swift,
a lawyer, has come in as rail regulator, charged with ensuring that safety
standards are met and that a fair balance is struck between the conflicting
interests of all participants in the post-privatisation era.
But other important parts of the jigsaw have yet to be assembled, including
the three regionally-based financing companies that are to own and lease
rolling stock to the train operators.
The crucial question of how many private-sector groups are likely to bid for
a franchise is still unanswered. Between 40 and 50 companies have expressed
an interest but it is not clear how many will emerge as serious bidders.
Bus companies such as Stagecoach and Badgerline are among the interested
parties; so too is Sea Containers, the transport and ferry group. Senior BR
managers are considering staging management buy-outs, among them Mr Chris
Green, managing director of InterCity. Mr Green takes charge of Scotrail in
April and is already working on plans for a management buy-out of the
Scottish rail network.
Transport specialists express concern that most of the possible
private-sector bidders that have so far emerged lack the financial or
management resources to develop a railroad. The bus companies and management
buy-out teams at least have experience of running transport systems but are
unlikely to be in a position to make substantial investments.
'If rail staff come along with Pounds 100 of capital each in a buy-out we
will have a deteriorating system,' says Mr James Sherwood, chief executive
of Sea Containers. 'Big companies must come in and invest billions of pounds
to improve the system,' he says.
An additional fear on the part of bus operators is that UK monopolies
regulations could prevent them from running train and bus services in the
same area. 'Why should bus companies go through the hoops of trying to buy a
rail franchise when they could more easily expand their bus operations
through acquisition,' says one industry observer.
Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, is sanguine. 'I would be surprised if there was
any great interest (in bidding) at this stage because no one knows enough
about the franchises,' he says. Increased interest will only come when more
of the framework in which the private-sector railway companies will operate
has been put into place, he says.
The central aspects of the privatised railway regime that still concern
potential private-sector franchisees include: The ownership of BR's track
and signalling. In spite of the creation of Railtrack and the government's
decision to separate the ownership of the railway's infrastructure from the
operation of the trains, some potential private-sector franchisees are
lobbying for a relaxation of the rules to allow them to own infrastructure
as well as run trains.
Supporters of the present framework point to airlines, which do not own
airports, as an example of an industry where infrastructure and service are
successfully split. But private-sector bidders say that with track costs
accounting for more than half of their overheads, railway operators must be
allowed to own the track on which they propose to run their services.
The government is, however, willing to allow vertical integration in certain
exceptional cases such as the Isle of Wight railway; there is also
private-sector pressure on the government for the Scottish network to be
treated in the same way.
Acceding to such pressure would strike at the core of the government's
post-privatisation rail structure. The government's room for manoeuvre is,
therefore, limited. But Mr Salmon says he is willing to consider
'non-compliant bids' which diverge from the ground rules laid down by the
government, provided they are submitted early.
There is a wide body of opinion in both BR and the private sector that
believes splitting track and train operations will prove unworkable. 'There
will be chaos for two to three years and then a sensible system will emerge
but only after substantial reform by government,' says one transport
analyst.
The degree to which private-sector competitors will have 'open access' to
run trains on franchised routes. The government wants open competition but
the experience of bus privatisation, where fierce rivalry erupted on popular
city centre routes clogging traffic and leading to a poorer service, has
frightened off some potential private-sector rail franchisees.
The likelihood is that given 'open access', private-sector competitors would
only offer limited services on lucrative lines. 'They would cream off the
profitable routes and the whole edifice would crumble,' says Mr Brian Cox,
managing director of the rail division of Stagecoach Holdings, a bus
operator.
The duration of franchises. The government believes the shorter the
franchise period the better. This is because it would ensure private-sector
operators met minimum levels of service within the briefest time-span. A
short franchise would also allow the government to bring in a new franchisee
if the original operator did not perform satisfactorily. The initial
government proposal for the duration of the franchise was between five and
seven years; but Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, has grudgingly
moved to the idea of 15-year franchises, largely in response to
private-sector lobbying. But, faced with buying rolling stock with a life of
about 30 years, possible private-sector bidders are still pressing for
longer terms. The flexibility of the system. With separate companies owning
the track, rolling stock, and carrying out repairs, how efficiently will the
proposed framework operate? The general fear is that such a set-up will lead
to an elaborate system of contracts and agreements.
'The complexity of the privatisation proposals will not make it easier to
raise funds,' said one potential private-sector bidder. 'There is a danger
that there will be even more bureaucracy than there was under BR.' And, ask
many industry observers, who should bear responsibility in the event of a
derailment or when a train breaks down? And whose trains should be given
priority when timetables are rescheduled following cancellations?
There is a danger that such disputes between different players in the new
railway age could lead to damaging litigation. Franchise director Mr Salmon
claims to have devised a 'no-fault incentive scheme to keep the lawyers in
their place'. The theory, he says, is that all participants have a
commercial interest in solving problems quickly and providing a a sound
service.
But doubts remain about whether so many players can work efficiently
together. Mr Swift, the railway regulator, has made plain the limits of
relying on commonsense and points out that the law is the ultimate guarantor
of fair dealing. But tensions between Mr Swift and Mr Salmon seem
inevitable: Mr Swift's role is to ensure a fair pricing structure; but this
objective could undercut Mr Salmon's drive to attract private-sector bidders
determined to set their own fares.
Ministers are fond of drawing comparisons with the airline industry, which
operates on a system of contracts with airports for landing rights and
maintenance services; the comparison is designed to show that such a
division between the 'infrastructure' and the 'service operator' can work.
Similarly, Mr Horton points to Marks &amp; Spencer's successful relationship
with its suppliers, under which the manufacture of M&amp;S clothes and foods by
sub-contractors is distinct from the retail end of the operation; critics
point out, though, that M&amp;S does not have to share its stores with Tesco.
The validity of tickets across the system. One advantage of the present
set-up is that passengers can travel across the entire network on a single
ticket. This may cease after privatisation. The government is insisting that
private-sector rail operators recognise each other's full fares and season
tickets; discounted tickets, however, will not be mutually recognisable.
With up to 80 per cent of all tickets sold at a discount this could either
push up the cost of travel for the vast bulk of travellers or bar passengers
from taking the most convenient train.
For the private-sector rail franchisees, the problem of sharing revenues
from a journey that criss-crosses the routes of several different operators,
could prove a nightmare. How are costs and takings to be allocated over a
journey that involves a mainline section followed by a shorter stretch of
local line?
These unresolved issues are daunting and time is running out before the next
round of 'shadow franchises' start and Railtrack takes over responsibility
for BR's infrastructure on April 1. 'It is important to get the first one or
two franchises right,' says Sir Bob Reid.
But with the first private-sector railway companies now only months away
from commencing services, it remains an open question whether the new system
can be made to work.
Railway privatisations in countries such as Japan and Sweden have been more
modest in their scope. BR's aim is more ambitious and the possibility of
derailment that much greater.

In January Observer brought news of Edward Belgeonne, a veritable British
entrepreneur who at the age of 30 had just sold his second mobile phone
business, for Pounds 1.5m, in order to nurture a burgeoning career as a pop
star fronting a band called Gone Tomorrow.
Belgeonne investigated the business of musical recording and promotion - to
discover the royalties from a big label would be a paltry 20 per cent.
A businessman to the end, that kind of margin leaves him cold. So welcome
Oscar Records, his own new label - where he will pay himself much healthier
royalties of 75 per cent. One of the numbers on the band's first CD is 'I
can't fly'; singularly inappropriate so far.

Seabrook struck up a matey electronic relationship with 'Billg', quickly

Gates apparently spends two hours a day reading and writing e-mail. While
Gates gives little away - 'having lots of money is a corrupting thing' gives

With impeccable timing - just as the country's latest economic stabilisation

Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, has come trailing banking

Baroness Thatcher is also on her way, funded by private Brazilian

Richard Needham - trade minister - and agriculture secretary Gillian
Shephard.
What's brought all this on? Sure, British exports to Brazil increased 52 per

all the hydro-electric dams it can manage, thank you.

<TEXT>
Two important court judgements last week, based on European law, are set to
enhance the rights of some British employees. The first almost certainly
means that consultation procedures with employees will have to be
established in the many organisations where they do not already exist to
cover certain cases of business transfer and large-scale redundancies. The
second means that part-time workers will have to work for an employer for
only two years rather than five to be covered by unfair dismissal and
redundancy pay provisions.
This underlines the point that Britain's ability to opt out from European
Union social legislation was always likely to be constrained in practice.
But it does not mean that the British programme of labour market
de-regulation has been stopped in its tracks. Indeed, contrary to the claims
made by depressed Conservative Euro-sceptics and over-optimistic union
leaders, the effects of the judgement are likely to be rather limited. The
consultation judgement will not apply to small companies and will require,
at most, an election procedure to establish consultation arrangements, which
can be dissolved as soon as a transfer or redundancies have occurred. It
will not mean the establishment of works councils up and down the land.
In the case of part-timers the five-year qualification threshold for
employment protection, accepted by all Tory and Labour governments since
1971, has always seemed an unfairly long time to decide whether someone's
face does not fit. Moreover, the potential redundancy payments will never
amount to more than a few hundred pounds. In any case, only about 500,000
out of Britain's 5.8m part-timers are likely to gain from the two changes.
Although the government will fight the consultation judgement if it is
confirmed by the European Court of Justice, it seems to be taking a
relatively sanguine view of these developments. This may be because it does
not want to stir up its own Euro-sceptics prior to the European elections.
But it may be also that it recognises that the changes involved are too
small to have any impact on demand for labour. Part-time work expanded just
as fast in the more regulated and union-influenced labour market of the
1970s as it did in the less regulated 1980s, suggesting that there are
bigger economic and social factors at play.
It is also true that even after the recent judgement takes effect there will
be a big cost and regulatory bias towards part-time employment, especially
if an individual is earning under the Pounds 56 a week threshold for
National Insurance payments. Given the difficulty European economies have
displayed in creating full-time jobs, especially for lower skilled workers,
governments would be wise to seek further incentives of this type to
stimulate this part of the labour market, rather than seeking to deny basic
employment rights to part timers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Governments must choose between bilateral and multilateral approaches to
trade policy. As Mr Peter Sutherland, the director-general of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, observed in New York last week, that choice
was not, in fact, made with the completion of the Uruguay Round last
December. On the contrary, the US believes that both can run in parallel.
That is the significance of the revival by president Clinton of the 'Super
301' trade provision. But he is mistaken.
'Super 301' is not particularly significant in itself. Certainly, it does
not have to be used in ways contrary to the Gatt. Revival of 'Super 301' may
even reduce congressional pressure for immediate action, giving both the US
and Japan a breathing space during which to resolve their current conflict.
After the failure of last month's summit between president Clinton and Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, such a breathing space is highly desirable.
It will also not be enough on its own, since Japan may use its time to
determine on dangerous concessions. If, for example, Japan were to decide
upon increased government management of the economy, it would damage itself.
But it would also reinforce the general appeal of the concept of 'managed
trade', which is what Mr Sutherland rightly labelled a 'misguided and
dangerous approach from all points of view'.
What is needed is not just a deep breath, but deep thought, on both sides.
Why, for example, should the Bank of Japan stand idly by while the yen
soars? It should be selling the yen, instead, which would restrain the
external value of the currency and, more important, expand the money supply.
Meanwhile, the US needs to put forward a far better economic justification
for its complaints about Japan's bilateral and overall trade surpluses than
it has managed hitherto. It also needs to ask itself why its bilateral
approach has been so roundly condemned. The concern is that a kind of lynch
law will undermine the credibility of the international rule of law.
At present the US is determined to act as prosecutor, jury, judge and
executioner. What is needed, instead, is an objective assessment of Japan's
alleged failures, along with neutral arbitration of the disputes. Even where
US complaints do not fall under the current Gatt, the latter could still be
asked to provide both an objective assessment and arbitration. Such an
approach would be far better than accepting the wish of the European Union
to turn the debate from a bilateral into merely a trilateral one.
The US must be helped off the hook on which it has impaled itself. If the
bilateral approach is continued, both its international relations and the
multilateral system itself will be gravely damaged. The sensible alternative
is to use the good offices of the central institution of the system,
instead. That is the choice Mr Clinton should now make.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Welcome deal in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The last-minute agreement to avert a German engineering strike shows that
both employers and trade unions are making a serious effort to restore
competitiveness in Europe's largest economy.
A strike this week in the northern state of Lower Saxony to support a claim
for a country-wide pay rise of up to 6 per cent would have severely damaged
Germany's efforts to climb out of recession. With unemployment now above 4m,
and inflation probably falling below 3 per cent later this year, a labour
stoppage would have started a battle the IG Metall union could not have won.
The weekend deal contains positive elements for both sides. As compensation
for a wage rise of only 1.2 per cent for the whole year, the union has won
employer approval for specific job guarantees at companies that reduce pay
and working hours because of falling orders.
After a cumulative rise in German unit labour costs of 15 per cent in the
past four years, the wage accord gives employers the opportunity to make
badly needed cuts in unit costs as they improve productivity.
It could be argued that the agreed increases in labour market flexibility
should have been more radical. Some details of the package of wage and job
cutting options look unhelpful. Additionally, the country-wide engineering
pay bargaining structure, one of the main sources of wage rigidity in recent
years, has survived intact.
A strike could have weakened the system by encouraging more plants to agree
wage deals on a company-by-company basis. However, an accord which
unambiguously favours competitiveness while preserving Germany's
consensus-based social partnership is still welcome. The outcome will
strengthen the government's chances of pushing through necessary pay
restraint in forthcoming public sector pay talks.
In a country still struggling to come to terms with many economic
challenges, one pay deal cannot transform the industrial outlook. Germany
must make a more determined effort to tackle the non-wage costs which have
had a still greater impact than high wages in lowering industrial
performance. Reflecting the consequences of recession and reunification,
social security payments in Germany, according to OECD figures, are likely
to make up 22 per cent of GDP this year, up from 15.2 per cent in 1990 - a
much larger increase than in any other big industrialised country.
Finding methods of satisfying welfare demands without heaping job-killing
financial burdens on enterprises will be a principal task for the government
that emerges from the October elections. Germany needs to maintain its
traditional consensus between labour and capital, yet in a manner more
responsive to economic realities than in recent years. The metalworkers'
deal demonstrates that both sides of industry can adopt constructive
policies. If they can build on this approach, confidence in German recovery
will grow.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Breathing space for the trade giants: The rift between the
US and Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's revival of the 'Super 301' trade provision last
week looks like a blunt threat designed to pave the way for sanctions
against Japan unless Tokyo opens its markets.
Yet the underlying plot is more subtle. For at the same time as tightening
the screws, Washington wants to give both sides more breathing space to
reach a settlement. This follows last month's failure by prime minister
Morihiro Hosokawa and Mr Clinton to conclude an accord on reducing Japan's
record trade surplus, more than Dollars 50bn with the US alone last year,
and liberalising its markets.
To many trade partners of the US and Japan, Washington's decision to up the
ante is unwelcome. It reinforces what many see as a tendency for the world's
two largest economies to negotiate on trade in an exclusive bilateral
manner. The risk of bilateralism has already provoked warnings from the
European Union to Japan and forms the core of Tokyo's broadside against the
US decision to reinstate 'Super 301' - the US trade law which permits
Washington to identify by name 'unfair traders' and makes possible the
imposition of American sanctions.
Neither Washington nor Tokyo is, however, behaving as if it wants a trade
war. The US has indicated that it will apply 'Super 301' even less
aggressively than by previously mild standards. 'Super 301' has never led to
sanctions since its introduction by the Reagan administration in 1988 and is
even less likely to do so on this occasion.
The US administration has given itself until September 30 to name 'priority
foreign country practices' - but not necessarily countries - which obstruct
US exports. The aim is to 'spare embarrassment' to suspected offenders, a
senior US official says. Washington will only then consider sanctions after
12-18 months of inquiry and an appeal to the World Trade Organisation, the
successor body to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, if it believes
multilateral rules are being infringed. 'The president did not really let
Japan off the hook,' says Mr Harry Freeman, a US trade lobbyist. 'He let the
line out.'
The concessions the US is fishing for in Japan include a permanent income
tax cut instead of the one-year reduction recently decreed by Tokyo,
measures to boost consumer spending, and more radical deregulation than the
moderate steps proposed by the Hosokawa government.
The Japanese government and business community are, meanwhile, in a mood to
give significant ground to Washington. Although Japan's bureaucrats and
politicians know that trade sanctions are unlikely, they sense that the
current trade dispute with the US is unlike previous ones.
The fear in Japan is that the outcome will go beyond economic relations and
damage Tokyo's strategic partnership with Washington. Mr Hosakawa's
government is unsure exactly how, or even if, Washington's attitude to Tokyo
has changed as a result of the end of the cold war; this dilemma is one of
the central unanswered questions facing Japan's foreign ministry. Officials
believe now that Japan has less strategic value to Washington as a buttress
against communism in Asia, trade rows with the US might not be as easily
containable as in the past.
The foreign ministry in Tokyo, chief advocate of caution against saying 'no'
too loudly to Washington, believes that the trade dispute might harm
long-term political and security ties with the US. At the very least,
officials fear that the traditional comfortable link between trade and
political co-operation in US-Japan relations has been broken.
Meanwhile, as Japan's export-dependent manufacturers have discovered to
their heavy cost, the US does not need to resort to trade sanctions if it
wants to apply economic pressure on Tokyo. Washington has only to talk up
the yen, the strength of which is one of the biggest constraints on Japan's
hopes of recovering from its worst recession since the second world war.
The Japanese government is, therefore, likely to accede to US demands. But
two big factors are likely to limit the extent of Tokyo's concessions.
First, Japan's seven-party ruling coalition is weak and divided and its
capacity to deliver on anything has been sharply reduced. The second factor
is the strength of feeling in Tokyo against binding import quotas. These
numerical targets on imports are what the US appears to be seeking as a
first step towards reducing Japan's bilateral trade surplus, as embodied in
last summer's economic framework agreement between the two countries.
Tokyo is under strong domestic and international support to face down
Washington on numerical targets, the one area where it can demonstrate more
assertiveness than previous Liberal Democratic party administrations. This
support was one reason why Mr Hosakawa was more direct with Mr Clinton at
their summit last month than any LDP prime minister had ever been towards a
US president. Yet even on the sensitive subject of numerical targets,
officials in Tokyo and Washington have started to sketch out a compromise.
Evidence of the Japanese government's eagerness to assuage the US came at
the weekend. Mr Hosokawa called an emergency cabinet meeting for Wednesday
to discuss market-opening measures; the prime minister intends to present
proposals to Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, when the two men
meet for talks on Thursday.
The private sector is also responding. At least two car producers, Toyota
and Mazda, are preparing 'voluntary targets' for the purchase of US
components this year. IDO, the Japanese telecoms group, is close to
agreement on improved market access for Motorola, the US telecoms
multinational which in recent months has been the focus of a row over access
for American mobile telephones in Japan.
Yet the government's ability to tackle the fundamental economic problems
underlying Japan's persistent trade surpluses is limited by the coalition's
current disarray.
Mr Hosokawa's ability to make economic policy decisions is looking shakier
than ever after he was forced last week to scrap plans for a cabinet
reshuffle to strengthen his economic team.
One side effect of the abortive reshuffle has been to weaken the position of
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, an important influence on economic policy. Mr Ozawa is also
a valuable behind-the-scenes negotiator with the US, having recently
suggested the adoption of non-binding 'effort targets' for a cut in the
trade surplus, an obvious step towards compromise.
However, the prime minister has risked alienating Mr Ozawa by turning down
his demand for the removal of Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet
secretary, who upset a package of Ozawa-inspired tax reforms in January. Any
signs over the next few weeks that Mr Ozawa is losing patience with the
prime minister could bode ill for economic policy.
The muddle in government and the absence of a strong opposition will no
doubt reinforce US suspicions that foreign pressure is the only way to get
results. Mr Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International
Economics and a renowned US trade hawk, says: 'The unfortunate reality is,
the Japanese tell us, in every single case we have to threaten sanctions
because that's the only way they move.'
What makes the current row unlike previous tiffs, is that it is still
unclear how much ground Japan's government can give and what might be the
wider non-economic consequences of its failure to do so.

SUPER 301: THE ORIGINAL TRADE SINS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Japan:  government procurement of foreign satellites and
        superconductors; and imports of wood products. Deals concluded
        on all three, and US exports of these products have increased.
Brazil: import bans and other import-licensing restrictions. Pact agreed
        and Brazil has since liberalised.
India:  trade-related investment measures and insurance market barriers.
        India refused to talk about changes. No sanctions were imposed,
        but the issues were referred to the Uruguay Round talks.
South   avoided a listing after agreeing to liberalise measures for
 Korea: foreign investment, and lifting import bans and other
        measures to protect local production.
Taiwan: avoided a listing after agreeing to open its markets, largely
        through reductions in tariffs on manufactured goods.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
It is starting to look as though Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime
minister, has unwittinglydone the British government a political favour by
banning UK bidders from public contracts in retaliation against press
reporting of the Pergau dam affair.
As well as eclipsing the domestic controversy over who did what in the
affair, the ban has made it easier for ministers to defend their conduct by
asserting that they were simply batting for UK plc in a ruthless world
market. This stance may prove popular, to judge by recent letters to this
and other newspapers. Business leaders have closed ranks to insist that
Britain cannot afford to alienate customers who can choose from plenty of
other suppliers.
That companies with commercial exposure to Malaysia should seek to limit the
damage in this way is understandable. However, it is quite another matter to
suggest, as some have done, that export-dependent countries such as Britain
can pay their way only by subordinating other priorities and principles to
the greater goal of a concerted foreign sales drive.
The neo-mercantilist lobby typically takes as its model Japan, whose postwar
economic success it ascribes to seamless co-operation between government and
industry. However, such arguments fly in the face of the very evidence
adduced in their support.
Not only have leading Japanese companies such as Honda and Sony thrived
precisely because their exclusion from this nexus of power forced them at an
early stage to seek most of their business overseas. The institutionalised
collusion and indulgence of special interests at the heart of the Japan Inc.
system is now exacting a massive political price, in the form of the
country's biggest peacetime crisis this century.
If the system has any parallel in Britain, the nearest is probably with the
arms trade, where the government acts as producers' biggest customer,
financier and salesman. Some may say that proves the virtues of a helping
hand from Whitehall. After all, is not defence one of the few manufacturing
activities in which UK companies still enjoy world-class excellence in
engineering and technology?
However, the industry's 'strategic' status and monopoly privileges in most
countries mean international competition is as much between governments as
between companies. In most other sectors, commercial risks and rewards are
geared more directly to straightforward rivalry on quality, delivery and
price.
Few people would dispute that governments can assist by gathering
information, opening doors and otherwise smoothing exporters' path in
foreign markets. That is particularly valuable in developing countries,
where foreign companies' credibility gains from a show of confidence by
their governments.
But the line between encouragement and second-guessing commercial judgments
can be stretched dangerously thin if governments go much further. Beyond a
certain point, moral hazard comes into play. How many bad debts have been
accumulated by companies which over-zealously obeyed injunctions to export
or die, in the belief that their governments would pick up the tab if things
went wrong?
Nor does a narrow national focus on chasing foreign orders necessarily yield
the expected rewards. In the 1960s, the Duncan Report recommended that
Britain's embassies abroad downgrade classic diplomatic activities in favour
of export promotion, a view enthusiastically accepted by the Wilson
government. Yet the following decade, inadequate political reporting left
Britain wholly unprepared for the overthrow of the Shah of Iran, support for
whom had been at least partly influenced by his regime's importance as a
customer for British exports.
But perhaps the most objectionable feature of the neo-mercantilist fallacy
is the idea that successful exporting requires avoiding any action which
might offend foreign governments. In its most extreme form, this comes
dangerously close to implying that countries which respect freedom of
expression and the rule of law should bend their principles to please those
which do not.
In Britain, those who believe themselves victims of libel may seek redress
in the courts. Dr Mahathir has not explained why he has not yet done so.
Perhaps he does not believe he would receive a fair hearing. More likely, he
refuses to treat with a system so closely identified with the 'western
values' which he has condemned as selfish and decadent. In this view, many
individual liberties guaranteed by western-style democracy are irrelevant -
if not, indeed, inimical - to economic progress.
The argument is false. Hong Kong, though not historically a parliamentary
democracy, is blessed with a judiciary of unimpeachable integrity, an
apolitical civil service and a free press. Its population also enjoys Asia's
highest standard of living after Japan.
Last week, Mr Richard Li, a prominent Hong Kong Chinese businessman, told a
London conference: 'The cornerstone of Hong Kong's commercial success, and
its ability to create wealth-creating capital, has certainly been the
existence of an independent and impartial legal system.
'Coupled with a sound administration, it has provided entrepreneurs and
investors, whatever their origin, with a level playing field. It is for that
reason one of the most significant contributions to Asia's development, and
is very much to Britain's credit.'
Dr Mahathir - and those in Britain who appear so anxious to appease him in
the name of economic self-interest - should take note.

<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALLAN WILLETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Wolf's excellent commentary on your EU Business Survey of
European Competitiveness ('A relapse into Eurosclerosis', February 24) came
down firmly for three core recommendations. These were to increase
competition and deregulation, and diminish the burden of the public sector.
In other words continue and intensify the political and economic
philosophies of the 1980s. May I add a fourth as a basis for a policy more
suited to needs of the 1990s.
In general, attention on the performance of manufacturing industry fails to
differentiate strongly enough between different types of company. Evidence
accumulates daily showing that while many large companies and sectors
dominated by large companies are shrinking, employment and growth are coming
from the dynamic entrepreneurial SME sector. My own company, privately
owned, turns over Pounds 50m a year; 90 per cent of its British made
high-technology coding systems are exported. The EU needs more examples of
similar enterprises.
To encourage that to happen, strong industrial structural adjustments are
needed across the EU. These should favour innovation and enterprise in the
dynamic entrepreneurial sector. The need includes encouragement of
innovative approaches from key service suppliers such as banks; improved
linkages with academic R &amp; D; changes in the laws relating to personal
guarantees and bankruptcy; guidelines of acceptable practice by the venture
capital industry; and measures to promote partnership-supplier relationships
with larger companies. But the key must be greater understanding and support
for the dynamic entrepreneurial sector from all levels of economic
management, the European Commission to national governments and their
industrial policy agencies.

Sir, Your coverage of UK car production statistics for 1993 highlighted
Rover overtaking Ford as the UK's biggest vehicle manufacturer and noted the
industry made the highest number of units since 1974 ('Car output at highest
level for nearly 20 years', March 2).
The figures, however, told another and more dramatic story about the rapid
structural change taking place in the industry. Rover's creditable but
modest increase of 30,000 units (+7%) was in fact more than offset by the
80,000-unit drop in output from the total of Ford, GM and Peugeot and
therefore overall production from established players in the UK was down
50,000 units. Far from matching performance of 20 years ago the companies,
which then made up the UK industry, are now operating at little better than
two-thirds the 1970s' levels.
The one reason for the reversal of the long-term decline of the British
motor industry has been the superb performance of Japanese transplants -
Nissan, Toyota and Honda - which together raised unit production last year
by 136,000 units - no less than a 75 per cent increase. The three groups
accounted for nearly a quarter of all cars produced in the UK and sailed
past GM and Ford with combined output of 316,000 units compared with GM's
274,000 and Ford's 301,000. Thank heavens for the policies that made the UK
the most attractive European location for inward investment

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD MCCORMACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Loud French protests over president Clinton's successful efforts to
encourage Saudi purchases of US civilian aircraft struck me as being a tad
on the hypocritical side ('French attack Clinton on aircraft sales', March
2).
For more than a decade as a senior economics official of the US State
Department, I observed president Mitterrand and a galaxy of other Europe
leaders on sales missions to the Middle East and elsewhere.
I noted efforts to link state-to-state political favours (or sometimes
threats) to national commercial interests, including aircraft sales, oil
concessions, arms deals, and construction projects.
The US government occasionally protested against this behaviour at an
official level. For years we quietly warned that we could also play this
game, and powerfully so, if others continued to practice.
President Clinton has just demonstrated the truth of that observation.
Commercial deals and international politics ought to be separated. Perhaps
this is an unattainable ideal. But in any case, under prevailing realities
and current widespread practices, the French have no grounds for complaining
about president Clinton's efforts on aircraft sales other than the fact
that, on this occasion, he successfully trumped president Mitterrand's ace.

This development, presumably approved by DTI officials, conflicts with the
UK energy minister's commitment to 'unwind the tilt' against British Gas.
Former regulators will, of course, comply with restrictions on disclosure of
information, such as those embodied in Section 42 of the Gas Act 1986. But
there is nevertheless a feeling among consumer groups that, once put out to
grass, regulators should not graze in fields where public service has made
them privy to information denied to others.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Multilingual pictures centre could
give Europe edge on Hollywood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From GAUTI KRISTMANNSSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The answer to your article 'Quest for a strategy to match Hollywood'
(Can Europe Compete? March 1), is yes: Europe can compete by concentrating
on communication instead of cultural isolation.
This can be done by addressing the problem of language. European film
producers and culture ministers have to think multilingually if they want to
compete with Hollywood. This is what US film producers did in the 1930s when
they had their movies dubbed in the relevant languages before selling them
in Europe.
Beacuse the home market is so small, such an investment is impossible for
low-budget producers in Europe who have many more languages to consider. One
solution is a cultural communications centre to act as mediator for
participating countries and to enable producers to have material translated,
subtitled or dubbed. Distributors are undoubtedly more willing to take on
films ready for distribution.
Working with professionals on a freelance basis, the centre would not
require an army of people; it could make services cheaper and European films
more accessible worldwide. There are markets in south-east Asia, where works
of art are frequently savaged with one or two voices speaking over for the
whole cast while the original can be heard in the background. Better service
now would not diminish the future market for European producers. Europe
could then create a Hollywood, albeit without the stars, but possibly with
success.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Arts: Tenderness on a dark road - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Friday, for his 65th birthday, Bernard Haitink spent the evening
conducting a new production of Katya Kabanova at his artistic home, the
Royal Opera. For several reasons it was an inspired choice, not least
because Janacek himself was the same age in 1920, when he started work on
what was arguably to be his greatest operatic achievement.
In this short opera he distilled a life's understanding of men and women -
especially women. By and large the female sex has not been a central
interest of the major 20th-century opera composers and even Strauss with his
colourful gallery of female portraits generally sees women from the male
point of view. Janacek is the exception: even as he was composing Katya
Kabanova he noted that people accused him of writing nothing but 'female
operas'.
Of all his heroines, none calls for our sympathy more poignantly than poor,
adulterous Katya. A dreamer desperate to escape an unsatisfactory marriage,
she finds herself at first trapped, then vilified and finally outcast by a
closed, rural community that is not prepared to understand or forgive. No
woman is better drawn in modern opera and it is the job of the producer to
put her case across.
A good pointer to a production's intentions is how it relates Katya to the
countryside around her on the banks of the Volga. In Scottish Opera's recent
production it became a wintry landscape in front of a cyclorama of drifting
clouds; in Vienna in the 1970s it was a flat marshland, featureless,
unending. For the Royal Opera's production, designed by Maria Bjornson,
Trevor Nunn has tried something different: a long, dark road that swirls
down into a bottomless gloom.
It is never quite clear whether Nunn intends this to be a naturalistic view
of the opera or one that is symbolic. His picture of peasant life in the
backwaters of 19th-century Russia features real horses pulling carts and
real rain pouring down in the thunderstorm, yet the winding road remains an
ominous presence throughout. There are no indoor scenes at all, not even the
family home to act as Katya's prison.
The visual prospect may sound bleak, but it is warmed by the human qualities
of the characters as Nunn sees them. When Katya stands in the centre of his
vortex of a set, she looks a helpless young soul, unable to resist the
forces dragging her down. Elena Prokina plays her simply and naturally.
There is not much sense of the frustration ready to explode from within, but
Prokina is very affecting and sings the music extremely well.
In this production no caricatures are allowed. Eva Randova barely hints that
Kabanicha can be a dragon of a mother-in-law. She underplays the role, doing
it the hard way, and shows how devastating a subtle exterior to this tyrant
of a woman can be. It is a shame that her scene with Gwynne Howell's
shambling Dikoy (a relationship that often smacks of masochism) goes for so
little. The lack of an interior is a drawback there, as elsewhere.
Kim Begley's put-upon husband seemed stronger than usual, not a whining
ninny; Keith Olsen's Boris, cleanly and confidently sung, was conversely a
frightened rabbit before the lovers' tryst. For Katya to be caught between
two weak men only makes her tragedy the more poignant. Monica Groop's
Varvara and Christopher Ventris's burly Kudrjas were an unaffected couple,
not coy as can happen.
At Glyndebourne a couple of years back the opera worked at a high level of
intensity. Haitink's Janacek is not like that. He takes his time, making
sure that the orchestra is kept low so that the singers can play in an
atmosphere of quiet, conversational intimacy. In the end there is not enough
tension, but for its infinite tenderness and human sympathy Haitink's
performance could hardly be more moving. In that respect the 65-year-old
Janacek has found a meeting of minds.
Sponsored by The Friends of Covent Garden and the Royal Opera Trust.
Performances continue until March 25.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Arts: Essence of domesticity - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Looking at architecture today, the most satisfactory new buildings are those
that achieve a symbiosis between contemporary innovation and tradition. It
was probably always that way. When Michelangelo converted the buildings on
the Campidoglio in Rome, he was bringing an innovative classicism to a
traditional civic space. There are some architects who can do this today,
but they are few and far between and often the object of ridicule from a
dogmatic profession that only wants to promote hard-line modernism.
It is worth looking back to the recent past when there were many architects,
working in and around the arts and crafts movement, who successfully and
enjoyably combined a sense of tradition with inventiveness. One of the very
best, and one who has been somewhat neglected by critics and scholars, is
Charles Voysey. Known as CFA Voysey (1857-1941), he designed interiors and
furniture as well as buildings and his work is the subject of an important
small exhibition at the Design Museum.
Anyone who has worked with an architect in a domestic setting knows how rare
it is to find one interested in furniture or accomplished in the field of
interior design. The rise of the professional decorator in this century has
been helped to no small degree by the contempt so many architects have shown
to colour, decoration and interior design.
Voysey's exceptional vision of the composite whole has never had quite the
recognition given to designers like Pugin, Morris and Mackintosh. This
exhibition is a success for two reasons. It is small and well chosen and it
is as much about the man as his work.
Voysey's life was unconventional. His clergyman father was dismissed from
the Anglican church for teaching questionable doctrine and went on to set up
his own Theistic Church, which developed a substantial middle class
following. Charles Voysey, in his work and in his private life, inherited
his father's strong sense of individuality. He was no follower and his very
best works - the series of important houses built mainly in the 1880s -
still appear today as highly original and immediately recognisable as 'pure
Voysey'.
His style achieved an essence of domesticity that influenced the development
of English house design at all levels. Because he believed that art affected
all aspects of life he developed a belief in simplicity of design and a
limited palette of materials that brought a huge draught of air into the
stuffiness of Victorian England. His work is undoubtedly revolutionary -
unpolished oak, whitewash, brass fittings, and a decorative treatment of
materials and wallpaper that is almost innocent in its naive contrivance.
To have lived in one of Voysey's houses like Broadleys on Lake Windermere in
the Lake District or in The Orchard, Chorley Wood must have been like
sleeping every night in fresh linen sheets. The sense of light, cleanliness
and uncluttered life is truly refreshing to body and soul. But Voysey was
not without fantasy or sentiment as his designs for furniture, materials and
silverware clearly show. The painted clock with its domed top, (you can buy
a replica at the Design Museum), is itself a microcosm of Voysey's clean
world where birds sing all day and there is an unreal sense of purity.
By all accounts Voysey was not an easy man to work with and his rigidity of
character lost him many friends. But he is one of those architects and
designers that has to be taken on his own terms. He offers a tough but
brilliant vision.
Everything he designed, and take a close look at the circular silver toast
rack in the exhibition, is thought through from the inside out. That is what
makes good design. This approach, combined with an understanding of the
vernacular and the landscape, where he carefully placed his houses, produced
a sense of simple elegance and progressive creation that is full of valuable
lessons for us today. He was also economical.
By paring things down to a minimum and, for example, not polishing oak or
brass, he made his houses look entirely natural with no sense of the
extravagant. In many ways he is a man for the 1990s - his sense of the calm
home is what we need in an economic climate that has made us value our
houses as homes and not just as inflationary investments. A visit to 'Heart
and Home' is both timely and aesthetically instructive.
As Sir Edwin Lutyens said of him: 'No detail was too small for Voysey's
volatile brain, and it was not so much his originality, though original he
was, as his consistency which proved such a source of delight.'
CFA Voysey: Heart and Home, until April 24 at the Design Museum, Shad
Thames, London, SE1 (071-407-6261). Sponsored by British Home Stores.

You could easily miss the start of what may prove to be a fascinating
exercise. At 7.58, at the end of the piano masterclass given by Jean-Bernard
Pommier in Young Musician Of The Year (7.20), BBC2 shows a two-minute
vignette in somebody's life. Inspired by the remarkable success of its
'Video Diaries' exercises, the BBC's Community Programme Unit is attempting
a 'Mass Observation type project'. This week there will be two-minute
programmes at 7.58 or 8.28 each day, and plans are being discussed for
weekly and monthly programmes with an annual review.
One of the most engrossing programmes on television, Horizon, describes the
amazing mission to repair the Hubble telescope (8.00 BBC2). C4 continues
Phil Agland's documentary account of life in a Chinese city, Beyond The
Clouds (9.00). Panorama offers one of those horrifying accounts of entire
populations suffering from atomic bomb testing, this time in Utah (9.30
BBC1). ITV begins another batch of its outstanding Memoirs Of Sherlock
Holmes with Jeremy Brett as the detective (9.00).

FT  07 MAR 94 / Arts: Starting a search for positive returns - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arts sponsorship was late into the recession and seems to be late coming out
of it. The growth in expenditure in the early 1990s created the illusion
that companies were so in thrall to the arts that there would be no
downturn. It has now arrived, especially in London and the south-east. The
main casualties are corporate membership schemes: companies that habitually
signed up as friends of the Tate, the Royal Academy, Covent Garden, the
Royal Shakespeare Company, Glyndebourne and so on are now selective, hitting
the income of arts organisations hard.
Also patronage is out; demonstrative advantage in. New sponsors tend to be
hard-nosed and practical, seeking a positive return. Often they are keen to
use the arts to boost contacts, as the following sponsorships suggest.
*
The arts event of the year to date has undoubtedly been the Picasso
exhibition at the Tate Gallery. It is clocking up around 4,000 visitors a
day and is on target to be the most popular show ever held there.
This is good news for Ernst &amp; Young, the consultancy firm, which snatched
the sponsorship from under the noses of Toshiba and a Spanish bank. It is
Ernst &amp; Young's first major involvement in the arts and it is paying a hefty
price - approaching Pounds 300,000 down, and a further Pounds 200,000 or so
in marketing and hospitality.
A recent arrival among the larger consultancy firms, Ernst &amp; Young decided
arts sponsorship matched its potential client profile and thought the
Picasso exhibition had an appropriate ambiance, familiar but slightly
avant-garde.
It has three targets. It wants to entertain, and is holding an incredible 30
evening receptions at the show; it wants to build up loyalty among its own
staff of 7,000, who get free tickets; and it wants to raise its profile.
One bonus is that the BBC is also backing the show, with 13 programmes
devoted to Picasso; Ernst &amp; Young gets a mention in ten of them. First
indications are that the 400 partners who ultimately fund the sponsorship
through their earnings will be happy enough to stick with the arts.
*
Another new sponsor evaluating its involvement is Capital House, the
investment management subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which has
backed the current exhibition of drawings by Holbein from the Royal
Collection at the National Portrait Gallery.
Capital House has a narrow target audience and John Ellwood, the company's
corporate affairs director, saw corporate advertising and sports sponsorship
as expensive and wasteful. Music had appeal, but art seemed to offer the
best environment to get the Capital House message across.
Based in Edinburgh with a budget of Pounds 100,000, Ellwood first approached
the Scottish Arts Council but received no joy. He had never heard of ABSA in
Scotland. Finally he rang the National Galleries of Scotland and discovered
the gallery wanted to put on a show to commemorate the 450th anniversary of
Holbein's death. The Fitzwilliam in Cambridge and the NPG were keen to take
the drawings. Capital House money made it possible, in return for the usual
perks: company name on the catalogue and publicity material, plus private
views and corporate entertainment.
As a first-time sponsor Capital House qualified for a Pounds 25,000
sweetener under the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme; but company costs
rose again to Pounds 100,000 when the champagne for the hospitality evenings
was included. But the final amount contrasts favourably with the cost of
media advertising, and Ellwood believes the company profile has been raised.
*
The Edinburgh Festival goes from strength to strength. It has just raised
Pounds 1m in sponsorship for the 1994 Festival, a 15 per cent increase over
last year. With the Festival Theatre coming into operation, raising the seat
capacity by 25 per cent, it was essential to reach the Pounds 1m target.
New sponsors include Scottish Widows and two firms of solicitors, Fyfe
Ireland and Maclay Murray &amp; Spens, while there was increased funding from
Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland, Famous Grouse, IBM and Scottish &amp;
Newcastle. The sponsorship money will be more important than ever if
Edinburgh Council cuts back on its grant, as seems possible.
*
Swiss-based Alexandra Trading and Investment is using the arts to ease its
way into the UK market. It has invested over Pounds 50,000 in the two
concerts given by Kiri te Kanawa at the Hampton Court Festival and will use
them to entertain prospective clients.
*
The Prudential is changing its arts awards, the most generous in the UK with
Pounds 100,000 for the winning arts company. It has responded to criticism
that too much money went on the gala dinner and has switched the next
ceremony, in January 1995, to the National Theatre. The budget remains
Pounds 800,000 and the money saved has been devoted to a new prize-winning
category: film.

FT  07 MAR 94 / The Monday Interview: The making of a media mogul - Bernard
Simon meets David Radler, the deal-making partner and confidant of tycoon
Conrad Black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All Conrad Black's deals, from his first foray into newspapers in rural
Quebec 25 years ago to his purchase last week of the Chicago Sun-Times, have
had one thing in common. They would not have happened without David Radler.
Officially, Radler is president and chief operating officer of Hollinger,
Black's Canadian holding company. In reality, he is Black's closest business
confidant, his chief deal-maker and, when necessary, his hatchet man. He
keeps a much lower profile than Black. However, Black, who spends most of
his time these days in London, seldom makes an important move without
consulting Radler in faraway Vancouver.
Radler sits on the boards of Hollinger's two flagship investments - the UK
Telegraph group and Southam, Canada's biggest newspaper chain. It was
Radler, not Black, who touched down in Chicago to announce Hollinger's
investment in the Sun-Times, the US's ninth biggest newspaper, and it is
Radler who will take over as chairman of the Sun-Times Company.
Adding to his clout, Radler has a minority stake in Ravelston Corp, the
private company which controls Hollinger. The only other sizeable Ravelston
shareholders are Black and Peter White, another long-time friend and
business associate, whom Radler had met during a Quebec election campaign in
the late 1960s. Radler was working for the finance minister, who had earlier
been a waiter in Radler's father's restaurant.
With the Sun-Times investment, Hollinger's world is unfolding much as Radler
predicted in 1992 when he and Black were unsuccessfully pursuing the New
York Daily News.
The international media industry will centre on 15-20 heavyweights, he said
at the time, 'and we want to be one of them. I wish we could determine where
we're going to be, but we're going to be wherever the opportunities are.'
Radler, 51, is almost the complete antithesis of Black. 'Conrad and David
have an ideal partnership,' says Martin Maleska, a New York investment
banker who advised Hollinger on the Sun-Times deal. 'I find it amazing that
they complement each other so well.'
Black, urbane and sociable, is a product of the stuffy Anglo-Canadian
establishment, and is at home in the company of (preferably conservative)
statesmen, aristocrats and intellectuals.
By contrast, Radler is a scrappy Jewish Montrealer, who won his business
spurs in the family restaurant and his own shop selling native handicrafts
at Expo 67 in Montreal. He moved to the west coast in the early 1970s when
the three partners bought a small paper in Prince Rupert, British Columbia.
He still works from cramped offices in an unpretentious Vancouver
residential neighbourhood, a sharp contrast to the opulence of Black's bases
at Canary Wharf in London and the elegant turn-of-the-century post office
which houses Hollinger's Toronto offices.
The two men work together more as partners than as chief executive and chief
operating officer. Although they consult frequently by phone, each has
carved out a primary sphere of influence. Black concentrates on the
Telegraph and on Fairfax Holdings, Australia's second-biggest newspaper
chain of which the Telegraph has 24 per cent.
Radler spends most of his time looking after Hollinger's North American
interests which, until the Sun-Times purchase, consisted mainly of about 300
small-town newspapers in the US and Canada, as well as the 8.3 per cent
stake in Southam. He is also chairman of the Jerusalem Post, which Hollinger
bought in 1988.
Radler's interest in newspapers was aroused in his boyhood by a Time
magazine cover story on US publisher Si Newhouse. The cover showed newsprint
going in one side of a machine and dollar bills coming out the other. 'I
said 'This can't be a bad business',' Radler recalled.
His admirers praise him for his efficiency and tenacity. According to
Maleska, 'he has a very keen understanding of how businesses operate at the
most mundane level'. Others are less flattering, however. One long-time
associate, who asked not to be identified, described Radler as 'difficult'.
Even Black, in his recently-published autobiography, mentioned his friend's
'fanatical determination'.
In particular, Radler has a reputation as a fearless cost-cutter. Black
recalls in his book that when a reporter at the Sherbrooke Record in Quebec,
their first newspaper, marched into Radler's office to present a petition of
grievances, Radler deducted two cents from the man's weekly pay cheque for
wasting a sheet of paper.
'I don't think I'm any worse or any better than anyone else in the
business,' Radler says. 'If I can see that an operation can be run by two
people, and we have six, I want it run by two.'
Radler has applied this philosophy to justify the relatively high prices
which Hollinger has paid over the past eight years for many of its 280 rural
US papers, most of them formerly family-owned. As a result, many papers in
neighbouring towns now share printing presses, advertising departments and
even news-gathering resources.
The Dollars 180m Sun-Times deal is in a different league. The purchase
fulfils Black's and Radler's ambition to add a North American metropolitan
paper to their stable. Radler says that he and Black first looked at the
Chicago paper more than two and a half years ago. The Sun-Times, which has a
daily circulation of 535,000 and Sunday sales of about 524,000, propels
Hollinger into the top ten US newspaper publishers.
Although the Sun-Times plays second fiddle to the Chicago Tribune, Radler
says it is profitable and 'has loyal readers and advertisers'. The tabloid
is best-known for its fearless coverage of Chicago's rambunctious political
scene.
True to form, Radler insists that there is 'a potential for improving
operating margins' at the Sun-Times - in particular, Hollinger plans to
modernise its technology. The paper's previous owners, comprising
institutional investors and senior managers, have been hobbled by the heavy
debt-service burden incurred through a leveraged buy-out from Rupert Murdoch
in 1989.
The Sun-Times' 1,550 employees may get an early taste of the Radler style.
The paper's labour contracts come up for renewal later this year. Radler
says: 'They've absolutely nothing to fear. I'm not going to set a new policy
because we're in control.' But it would be out of character if he did not
push hard for concessions. As he says: 'We'll seek a better deal for
management, and labour will do the same for themselves'.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Management: It doesn't have to end in tears - Japanese
alliances are about more than just business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese industry reacted with disbelief when the news broke a month ago
that Germany's BMW had stolen Rover, the last British-owned car maker of any
size, from under the nose of its long-standing partner, Honda. How could a
western ally be so unreliable? How could Rover - and especially its
perfidious parent, British Aerospace - fail so blatantly to respect the
Japanese commitment to long-term relationships? Did they not realise that
the affair would damage other Anglo-Japanese business links?
It has since become evident that Honda will be harmed less severely than was
at first feared. As the dust settles, the Japanese business community is
starting to reflect more calmly on the significance of the affair for other
alliances.
People are now more prepared to raise questions on several counts: whether
Honda was sensible to follow with Rover a strategy of 'control without
takeover' which has been common for decades within Japan; whether the
company should have had a better-prepared 'exit strategy' in case the Rover
alliance broke down, either suddenly or gradually; whether the Japanese
really do always believe that such relationships should be long-term; and
whether, paradoxically, alliances involving equity participation are less
likely to last than weaker types of link.
Corporate collaboration is not taken lightly in Japan. When two companies
overcome their mutual apprehension and decide to do a deal, it is often
expected to be a long-term affair that involves more than cold-blooded
business decisions.
As such, Japanese companies will frequently find value in an alliance that
is not obvious from a purely business point of view. Even if there are no
immediate advantages in a particular link, they are often quite happy to
make it as a symbolic gesture or for some vague future benefit.
NEC, for example, says its stake in Bull, the loss-making French computer
company, offers benefits in its computers and telecommunications businesses
and an entry into the French market. But the company, which recently
invested a further Y7bn (Pounds 44.58m) to maintain its stake at 4.43 per
cent although IBM refused to do likewise, says there were also 'some
emotional reasons' behind that decision. These include the need to help a
partner in trouble.
This does not mean that Japanese companies expect alliances to last forever.
They are not averse to ending one that has outlived its usefulness. 'When
the mutual benefit disappears,' says one manager at a Japanese electronics
company, 'then in principle, the relationship should be terminated.'
It is therefore seen as general practice - in Japan as in the west - to have
a pre-planned exit strategy in any kind of alliance, whether it be a joint
venture or one involving equity participation. 'When the stake involved is
less than 50 per cent, we will include an exit strategy (in the contract),'
says Koichiro Yasuda, manager of the corporate advisory division of the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, which consults for many of its corporate
clients.
'If you are going to tie up with another company, there is always the risk
that what you put in will be wasted,' he notes.
It is unclear whether Honda had a prepared exit strategy. But the aspect of
British Aerospace's action over Rover which most unsettled Japanese minds
was that it chose BMW, a new suitor, over a long-term partner simply because
the German company made a better financial offer.
'There are hardly any cases in Japan of owners cashing out, so the main
point for both sides is whether the two companies can be integrated,' Yasuda
points out. 'Price is a secondary consideration.'
That sensitivity towards cultural integration plays an important part in
Japanese thinking on acquisitions, whether they are cross-border or
otherwise.
Past experience of takeover problems, plus their current shortage of funds,
has turned Japanese companies increasingly to strategic alliances as a means
of getting what they want from another company.
This preference is likely to grow. As industries become more global, it is
important but virtually impossible for one company to have a full presence
in all the important geographic regions, says Yasuo Tsuchiya, general
manager of the business strategy department at Mitsubishi Research
Institute.
At the same time, many companies are finding that the most effective, and
least troublesome, strategic relationships are narrowly defined. 'Alliances
will from now on be on a smaller, more focused basis,' Tsuchiya asserts.
'They will be looser, more like networks.' Such relationships also make for
an easier exit.
When a Japanese company does take a stake in its western partner, it faces a
choice over how to operate. The traditional way is described by James
Abbeglen, an American consultant who has worked in Japan for 40 years, as
'takeover without takeover': the stronger company takes the lead, and the
weaker becomes, in effect, its dependent supplier. Abbeglen says this is how
Honda was starting to treat Rover.
One top Japanese manager with considerable experience of dealing with
western companies describes this as an 'old-style' way of seeing an
alliance, and not a model of how to give it long life; he calls it
'fundamentally flawed'. He sees Fujitsu's handling of its UK computer
subsidiary, ICL, as more enlightened, and more of a partnership.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Management: Town hall basics - A local council inspired by
the private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement 10 years ago that Courtaulds was closing its Braintree
textile operations came as a bitter blow to local people. The problem was
not just the disappearance of the Essex town's largest employer, leaving
5,000 workers on the dole. The prospect of them finding new jobs was also
severely limited by the then concentration of government aid packages on
apparently more deserving regions such as the Midlands and the North.
That crisis, however, proved to be the early inspiration for a management
revolution at the local council which has since become a model for other
local authorities in the UK.
The then newly appointed chief executive of Braintree District Council,
Charles Daybell, decided that to attract investment the authority would have
to concentrate on customer service. As the current assistant chief executive
Robert Atkins explains today: 'You don't know when meeting a person at
reception whether they will be complaining about their washing or whether
they might have 2,000 jobs in their pocket.'
Since setting off down this path in the mid-1980s, Braintree has developed a
corporate culture drawn from best practice in the private sector which
appears to permeate every part of its organisation. As such it belies the
still potent image of UK local government firmly rooted in the bureaucratic
town hall atmosphere of post-war Britain when gentlemen with waistcoats and
fob watches inspected holes in the road and had a form for everything.
On the surface, Braintree (population 120,000) appears to have a council not
much different from others with modern, brick-built administrative offices
at the edge of a tidy Essex town. It is the behaviour of the staff - and the
way they deal with people - which has encouraged a steady stream of
public-sector managers to beat a path to Braintree's door.
'Like many authorities if we had any terminology for the people we served it
was ratepayers, residents, clients,' says Annie Ralph, the current chief
executive. 'Now we have customers and what they think and say is paramount,'
she adds.
People are not only referred to as customers; they are encouraged to
complain and told how to complain if they feel services fall below par. The
complaints service, which includes a review procedure, is comprehensive and
allows the involvement of chief officers and councillors.
Staff are trained how to deal with people and how to respond to telephone
calls, while concepts such as quality assurance have been taken to heart.
All 70 services in the authority have been accredited to the British
Standard 5750 on quality.
Reading the mission statement and the set of core values, emblazoned like
commandments on almost every wall of the headquarters, there is a suspicion
that Braintree has had an attack of corporate fadism, an urge to run local
services like a McDonald's hamburger bar.
But, while its culture does borrow ideas such as TQM and draws on practices
developed by organisations such as Marks and Spencer, the authority has
attempted to be pragmatic in its application of management and personnel
practices.
When it decided to look at car parking arrangements, for example, it asked
local residents what sort of car park they wanted. 'They said they wanted a
hut with an attendant so they got one,' says Atkins.
Services, meanwhile, are backed by undertakings. The guarantee on emptying
dustbins includes a promise to come back and collect rubbish from a missed
bin the same day if the council is contacted by noon or the next working day
if the call is in the afternoon. 'We know we can meet such a promise because
research has shown us we are likely to miss no more than 200 bins from the
47,500 pick-ups,' explains Atkins.
One of the biggest impacts has been in industrial relations which has all
the appearance of a rare union and management love-in. John Reeve, the GMB,
general union convenor, said: 'I was a shop steward for about 18 years and
probably one of the most militant people here. I think it was the authority
that made me militant because they didn't understand us.'
Today, by contrast, his union file is empty and meetings are overdue. 'There
hasn't been anything to discuss, to be honest,' he said.
An important catalyst, he believes, was the introduction of compulsory
competitive tendering five years ago. 'We were already working towards a
better understanding but I think the realisation that both staff and
management needed each other or both would be out of work, was a strong
influence.'
Customer orientation, however, has been at the centre of the changes. In
addition to the framing of five core values, the authority decided to invest
heavily in staff training, devoting a higher than average percentage of the
payroll. It harmonised the workforce - at a cost of Pounds 25,000 - so that
all staff were given the same terms and conditions.
Political stability in the administration has enabled polices to be
introduced with all-party support. The council has been continually hung for
the past 10 years.
Wider recognition of its achievements came last year when Braintree was
nominated as UK representative for the Carl Bertelsmann Prize, a
German-based international award for good management in public services. The
1993 prize, focused on public efficiency and democracy in local government,
was shared by Phoenix, Arizona and Christchurch, New Zealand, with Braintree
among the runners up.
'The council managed to effect a close working relationship between elected
members and officials without in any way subverting the political control of
the authority,' Michael Clark, former chief executive of the local
government management board and a member of the nominating panel, says.
'The basic theme of what it's about has percolated down through the
institution and into the community at large. People have respect for it.
Despite the high-flown stuff they have actually managed to keep their eye on
the basics and they do the basics very well.'

FT  07 MAR 94 / People: Double act of Japan's UK diplomats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A formidable diplomatic double act is about to take the centre stage at
Japan's UK embassy, writes William Dawkins.
Hiroaki Fujii, 60, will take over as the new ambassador on March 17, joined
by his long-standing junior colleague, Sadaaki Numata, as minister
plenipotentiary, the embassy's number two, 51 on that day.
The pair have shared offices on and off several times since 1975, when Fujii
became Numata's boss at the foreign ministry's north American division. They
were together in the late 1970s in Japan's Washington embassy and then
turned up again back in Tokyo's north American division in the mid-1980s.
Fujii later became ambassador to Thailand, his most recent job. The new
ambassador has never lived in London, so he will be a newcomer to his
posting - similarly, his friend Sir John Boyd, Britain's ambassador to Japan
since mid-1992, had also never lived in Tokyo.
However, Fujii will not be completely in the fog in London, since Numata is
a self-confessed Anglophile. Oxford- educated, he worked in the UK embassy
for two years in the late 1960s. A useful skill is his ability to put some
of the finer nuances of Japan's foreign policy into plain English.

FT  07 MAR 94 / People: Yassukovich picks up from Cragnotti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanislas Yassukovich, once upon a time a big name in the Euromarkets, has
become chairman of a new trading vehicle, Park Place Capital, formed via a
management buy-out of Cominvest UK from the Cragnotti &amp; Partners Capital
Investment Group, writes Katharine Campbell.
Cragnotti has decided to withdraw from financial services, and the formation
of Park Place Capital represents the first in a series of disposals.
Yassukovich's involvement with Sergio Cragnotti has been nothing if not
eventful. The Italian financier brought in Yassukovich in 1991 to run the
London end of his newly created Cragnotti &amp; Partners Capital Investment
Group. A former chairman of the Securities Association, Yassukovich was
supposed to lend the venture credibility.
The original idea of drumming up cross-border M&amp;A business quickly fell
through. 'Cragnotti was such an active acquiror of businesses on its own
behalf that it produced too many conflicts to have a parallel agency
operation,' Yassukovich explains. Called a merchant bank in Italy,
Cragnotti's raison d'etre is the acquisition and development of consumer
product companies.
The M&amp;A business gone, that left, in London, an arbitrage team, hired from
Banque Nationale de Paris, which has, according to Yassukovich, done well.
Essentially a 'very equity-oriented' hedge fund, it focuses on the
Continent.
But then came Cragnotti's own problems towards the end of last year. A
former Ferruzzi executive, he gave himself up to police in Italy for
questioning at around the same time as he came to a settlement regarding
allegations of violations of Canadian securities law. This 'accelerated the
group's decision to pull out of financial services' is how Yassukovich puts
it.
Yassukovich, 59, remains vice-chairman of the Cragnotti group - but why,
particularly seeing he is not exactly short of directors' fees? He sits, in
various capacities, on at least ten other boards.
'I have no doubts about (Cragnotti's) integrity; he is a very skilled
industrialist. Unless you are Italian, it is very difficult to follow the
incredible complexities of what is going on in that country,' says
Yassukovich. 'I'm also a very loyal chap,' he adds, almost as an
afterthought.

FT  07 MAR 94 / People: Libyan Saudi resigns in Bahrain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arab Banking Corporation is sifting with some urgency through possible
candidates to assume the presidency of the Bahrain-based bank after the
resignation of Abdulla Saudi, writes Mark Nicholson.
In a statement, ABC said Saudi was leaving 'owing to external circumstances'
and that his departure was 'necessary to protect shareholders' interests and
safeguard the bank's future'. All of which is apparently code for Saudi's
chief problem: his Libyan nationality.
Senior bankers in Kuwait say the primary reason for Saudi's departure is
that his Libyan nationality had led to fears among ABC's chief shareholders
 -notably the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait which, with Libya, hold about
a quarter of the bank each - that the US might decide to freeze the bank's
assets under sanctions against Libya for its alleged role in the Lockerbie
bombing in 1988.
In February, a two-month freeze of the assets in the US of Arab Financial
Services, a Bahrain-based credit card and travellers cheque company which
Saudi (right) also chairs, was lifted only after intensive lobbying by the
Bahraini authorities.
ABC apparently felt Saudi should step aside to avoid any further such
problems. He will do so after May 1 and Gulf bankers say it could be as big
a blow to ABC as to Saudi himself - though he could not be reached to
comment on his future.
Saudi was ABC's founding president in 1980 and has crafted it ever since -
raising it from a straightforward Offshore Banking Unit in Bahrain to an
international group embracing operations in Hong Kong, Spain, London and,
increasingly, across the Arab World. His retail banking experience in Spain
led him to acquire Banco Atlantico, the Spanish retailer.
For now, Khalifa al-Muhairy, an ABC board member, will chair a committee to
take over the running of the bank until a permanent replacement for Saudi is
found. Well informed gossips in Kuwait say Abdulla al-Qbandi, former head of
the Kuwait Investment Authority, is among the favourites.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Business Travel: Track through the traffic - How to get
around and do deals in Bangkok
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In any other city, the sight of a sweating businessman in a pinstriped suit
perched on the pillion seat of a small, noisy motorcycle, clutching his
briefcase and mobile telephone while the driver weaves between lines of cars
and buses, might be considered unusual.
Not so in Bangkok, where the notorious traffic congestion has made the
lethal motorcycle taxi a routine form of commuter transport for secretaries,
government officials and foreigners alike.
Traffic jams inevitably feature in any assessment of the problems
confronting visitors to the Thai capital, but it is worth putting Bangkok's
bad reputation in perspective.
For a start, it is a big city, comparable in size with London, and is home
to several times the population of Kuala Lumpur or Singapore. Nor is it the
only Asian metropolis with traffic problems: Manila, Jakarta and even Kuala
Lumpur are also suffering from the surge in car ownership that accompanies
economic growth.
Occasional floods in the June-October rainy season can cause city-wide
gridlocks lasting several hours, but few journeys within Bangkok during the
daytime should take more than an hour. Here are some tips on how to beat the
traffic:
Be flexible about your means of transport. A taxi is often the best
solution, but it might be quicker to get out and walk 200 yards than to wait
for the taxi to crawl round a one-way street system for half an hour to drop
you at the door.
Occasionally, you will find it quicker to go between two points by river
taxi or canal boat, but make sure you know where you are going, because few
of the operators speak English.
My own view is that motorcycle taxis should be a last resort when you are
late for an appointment with the prime minister. Otherwise, they are for the
brave and those who do not mind being asphyxiated by exhaust fumes.
For foreigners, the three-wheel tuk-tuk is usually as expensive as a taxi,
and much less comfortable. There is no metropolitan railway system. From the
airport to town, most international business travellers take the Thai
Airways limousines for 500 baht (Pounds 13.30).
Be certain about your destination. Thai street addresses can be baffling, so
your contact will often send you a map by fax with the name of the place
written in Thai; such maps should be shown to the driver.
Taxis with meters are now cheap and easily found. But if you can afford it,
a chauffeured car from your hotel is even better; the driver is more likely
to be familiar with your destination and to speak some English.
Choose a hotel near to where your meetings are to be held. Instead of a
single city centre, Bangkok has several business districts and another area
embracing most of the government ministries.
Take your work with you in the car, or a newspaper or book to while away the
time. If possible take a mobile telephone as well (a hotel limousine may
provide this), so that you can contact people if you are going to be late.
Having reached your meeting, you now have to do your business - interesting
and potentially profitable, but not always easy.
Unless you are a fluent Thai speaker, it is essential that you have a
first-class interpreter. Some senior Thai government officials and business
executives speak excellent English, but English is inevitably much less
widespread than in former British or American colonies such as Singapore and
the Philippines.
One example of the pitfalls involved in undertaking large projects in
Thailand is the so-called Second Stage Expressway, a Dollars 1bn elevated
toll road built by a consortium led by Kumagai Gumi of Japan. KG and some of
the foreign banks that helped finance the deal believe the Thai government
has flouted the contract and effectively nationalised the road. They are now
trying to get their money back and extricate themselves from the project.
Part of the dispute centres on the wording of the contract.
One weary foreign businessman once told me that a signed contract in
Thailand was regarded as no more than a starting point for further
negotiations, but do not believe everything you hear about the Asian way of
doing business. (In the provinces it is not unusual for Thai tycoons to be
gunned down by hit-men on the orders of their rivals.)
Be direct in your letters and discussions, explaining what you have to offer
and what you want from the other party, but do not expect an immediate
yes-or-no response. In a country where the economy is growing at about 8 per
cent a year, your contacts, whether from the public or private sector, are
likely to be busy.
Office meetings tend to be formal. Suits and ties are worn; such clothes are
extraordinarily unsuitable for the steamy Bangkok climate, but local
businessmen move from air-conditioned house to air-conditioned Mercedes to
air-conditioned office and rarely breathe the hot, poisonous air outside.
Any good guide book will give you advice on how to be polite in Thailand,
although one foreign businessman, asked about business etiquette, pointed at
his cheque book and said: 'It's usually made out to cash.' Matters of
bribery and corruption - sorry, consultancy fees and special payments - for
everything, from customs clearance to winning contracts, are best handled by
your local partners.
For all its pollution and physical ugliness, Bangkok's saving grace is that
it is a lively, cosmopolitan city. Hotels and restaurants are excellent, and
you can enjoy a Dollars 1 Thai snack from a roadside stall as much as a
Dollars 50 meal in a five-star hotel.
Given a free weekend, you can explore the many sights of Bangkok or make an
excursion by road to the beach at Hua Hin, the 'Death Railway' between
Thailand and Burma, built on the River Kwai by prisoners of the Japanese
during the second world war, the old capital of Ayutthaya or the Khao Yai
national park.
There are regular flights to the islands of Samui and Phuket and to the
northern capital, Chiang Mai. This once peaceful town is now being called
'another Bangkok': not, alas, with any affection, but because its traffic
jams have started to emulate those of the capital.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Egyptian fear
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Extremists are continuing their campaign of violence, mainly in the area of
Assiut in Upper Egypt, but also in Cairo and occasionally elsewhere. In
February, they explicitly threatened to attack tourism, foreign investments
and banks. There have been several attacks on tourist targets. Over the past
two years, terrorist attacks have caused the deaths of seven foreigners.
The authorities are giving the highest priority to protecting visitors: more
than 250,000 Britons visited Egypt in 1993 without experiencing any security
difficulty. But complete security cannot be guaranteed and further incidents
are to be expected.
Visitors should not travel to or through the Assiut area. They should be
vigilant and are reminded to behave and dress discreetly.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Another Italian shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's state-run railways have set out to attract commuters and other
frequent users with a shake-up in the ticket system, writes John Simkins in
Milan.
The effect of the regulations, which came into force on March 1, is that
travellers who buy nine consecutive monthly passes for journeys up to 250km
will receive a further three free of charge. If the traveller makes a
one-off payment for the nine passes, four more are gratis.
The innovation comes alongside a 3 per cent average increase in prices which
still leaves Italian fares well below the average European level. A railways
spokeswoman said that measures to reward customer loyalty were aimed at
increasing the railways' share of traffic from the present 12 per cent to 20
per cent within the next few years. She said that a bigger increase in fares
was unlikely until there was a widespread network of high-speed trains.
Currently high-speed trains run only between Rome and Florence.
Under the new ticketing system, return tickets have been scrapped. Books of
tickets are now available, giving a 10 per cent reduction for at least four
journeys of more than 70km to any destination, and a 20 per cent reduction
for journeys exceeding 350km. Discounts on return tickets have also been
scrapped. Books of tickets are now available, giving a 10 per cent reduction
for at least four journeys during one month of more than 70km to any
destination, and a 20 per cent cut for journeys longer than 350km.

Prime candidates: Wales and Scotland top list. Ireland has low costs
     and flexibility, suffers from distance from markets. Bavaria in W
     Germany has strong electronics industry, but is 'far from cost

Main considerations: Links to an established scientific community,
     attractive location, suitable schools, cultural and sports
     facilities. Leading executives prefer a 'sunbelt' site.
Prime candidates: 'Ideal location' could be a science park in southern
     France such as Sophia Antipolis, near Nice. Southern Germany and
     Switzerland also attractive. The new European Medicines Agency, to
     be based in the UK, could be a 'major pull factor'. A company
     looking for well-trained scientists at low cost may consider the
     ex-Soviet Union - but this is now more dubious because of political
     risk.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Challenge from the periphery - Case
Study: GM / A Hungarian auto plant that sets quality standards for the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Szentgotthard in western Hungary is a strategic crossing point for the flux
of products, capital and ideas streaming across the widening European
market.
This unprepossessing town close to the Austrian border was sealed off before
1989 by the cold war insignia of barbed wire and watch towers. Now it is a
test-bed for western manufacturing techniques. In a Dollars 250m plant in
the shell of a communist-built farm equipment factory, General Motors has
been assembling cars and engines since 1992.
GM has profited from a five-year tax holiday and a Dollars 25m Hungarian
investment grant. Other motor groups with footholds in Hungary include
Suzuki, Ford and Audi. By setting new standards for low-cost production with
up-to-date technology, such investments are helping spur the cross-border
rationalisation and cost-cutting that are potent realities of the European
market.
Mr Ernst Hofmann, the moustachioed 63-year-old managing director of General
Motors Hungary, describes how GM has designated Szentgotthard-produced
engines as a quality benchmark throughout the group. Mr Hofmann - a veteran
production specialist from GM's Opel subsidiary in Germany - praises the
'100 per cent flexibility' of his 480-strong Hungarian workforce.
Productivity and quality are at least as high as in comparable west European
plants, he says.
The Hungarian factory has a bearing on GM's larger plants in western Europe.
'We are competition for decision-making in the west.' At the equivalent of
DM300 a month, workers at the factory earn one-eighth of the pay of those in
GM's west German car plants.
The GM assembly plant this year should produce about 11,000 Astra Opel
hatchback cars and 140,000 engines, assembled from knock-down kits from west
Germany.
Labour accounts for less than 10 per cent of total costs, with materials
making up 80 per cent. The share of local Hungarian production is about 10
per cent. Mr Hofmann believes this could eventually rise to 30 per cent as
Hungarian component producers increase production.
Last year, the plant exported 3,500 cars out of its 13,400 production - an
uneconomic exercise at present, in view of the high cost of transporting
components to Hungary.
At least until 1996, the car plant is likely to operate at below its 15,000
per year capacity. By contrast, the engine plant is planned by end-1994 to
be operating at full capacity of 200,000 engines per year.
By introducing an extra shift, Mr Hofmann reckons Szentgotthard's capacity
could be doubled with little extra investment. The importance of this plant
and others like it in eastern Europe is far greater than their small size.
West European car-makers will have to fight hard to beat the east European
challenge.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: State aids refuse to die - Subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask Mr Karel Van Miert, the European competition commissioner, what he is
doing to improve the competitiveness of the European economy and he gives
two answers: cracking down on illegal state subsidies and liberalising
sectors that have traditionally been state-owned monopolies.
This may seem odd. After all, the European steel industry is now convulsed
by a row over the Commission's decision to sanction Ecu7bn in aid to several
inefficient state-owned groups. There is also disquiet at the slow pace of
Commission plans for liberalising sectors such as energy and
telecommunications.
By comparison with the mid-1980s, there has been progress in reducing both
state aid and the incidence of monopolies. Mr Van Miert and his two
predecessors, Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Peter Sutherland, have taken a fairly
tough line.
But many sectors of the European economy are still burdened by state aid and
monopolies. Government hand-outs to inefficient companies not only waste
taxpayers' money; subsidies also distort competition by placing more
efficient enterprises at a disadvantage. That is currently the danger in
both the steel and the airline sectors.
Likewise, persistent monopolies in utility industries mean European
businesses pay more than they need for telecommunications, energy, air
transport and postal services. More competition would drive down costs and
spur the development of trans-European networks which could act as the
infrastructural backbone of the single market.
The Commission has not moved more aggressively because curbing aid and
opening markets often involve job losses. It fears a political backlash
which could undermine its authority. 'OK, you could make it a war. But at
the end of the day, what interests me is results,' says Mr Van Miert.
The Commission has had some successes. It has become more insistent that
subsidies be allowed only if they are part of a viable restructuring plan.
And the Commission has encouraged member states to prepare aided companies
for privatisation.
So far, though, the fall in the overall volume of hand-outs has been small.
It averaged Ecu89bn a year between 1988 and 1990, down from an average
Ecu92bn in the previous three years - a drop to 2 per cent of GDP from 2.2
per cent.
Equally, progress on liberalisation has been patchy. Data communications
services have been opened to competition, but ordinary voice telephone
services will remain monopolies in most countries until 1998 or later.
Air transport is being progressively liberalised. But national flag-carriers
still typically monopolise take-off and landing slots at airports.
The view that even slow progress on curbing state aid and monopolies will
enhance Europe's competitiveness is not necessarily accurate. Other regions
of the world are also weaning their industries off subsidies and
liberalising monopolies.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: A captive of recession and high
expectations - The European single market still has much to prove
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European market exists. The question is: Does it work? The single
market, freeing movement of goods, services, capital and people across the
EU, came into effect in January last year. It was extended this year to four
Efta countries - Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden.
Most countries in the newly-formed European Economic Area carry out 70 per
cent of their foreign trade with the rest of the region - a very high level
of integration.
For several reasons, however, the market has not met expectations. Companies
criticise the bureaucratic intricacies of the new regime for collecting and
monitoring value added tax, as well as continued technical barriers to
trade.
The main reason for the sour reaction to the single market is that it has
come into operation during deep recession. Low business confidence feeds on
itself - helping explain why, according to last month's FT opinion poll, 77
per cent of European companies say they have registered no benefits from the
single market.
Mr Bruce Ballantine, a BP executive on secondment to Unice, the European
employers organisation, says the survey exaggerates disappointment with the
1993 programme. The 'real effects' of the measures have been obscured by
recession - but he admits: 'Expectations were far too high.'
The easing of constraints on distribution of goods has been undeniable.
Around 70m customs documents used annually to monitor cross-border trade
were abolished on January 1 1993, leading to a 3 per cent saving in time
taken for moving goods around Europe.
However, the single market's main effect in boosting cross-border investment
came in the years immediately after the project was launched in 1985. Since
then, the investment effort - and its effect on growth - has petered out. Mr
Ludolf von Wartenberg, general manager of the Federation of German Industry
(BDI), says many German companies 'anticipated' the single market by
building up Europe-wide production and distribution networks during the late
1980s.
The Delors white paper on growth and competitiveness even suggests late
1980s single market optimism, by contributing to economic overheating, may
have added to the severity of the subsequent recession.
At the European Commission, some officials show frustration at criticism of
the single market. They admit the programme has been a victim of its own
advance publicity. An optimistic Commission report in 1988 predicted it
would add 4.5 per cent to Europe's gross national product in the medium
term.
Brussels officials now claim the programme has added an average annual 0.4
percentage point to growth since 1985.
But the single market programme is incomplete. The main areas where the
Commission wants to fill the gaps are:
Abolition of passport controls. Checks were supposed to end on January 1
last year, but even the most federally-minded EU members have not met
deadlines for ending them.
Implementation and enforcement of proposals and legislation. Some 95 per
cent of the original 282 proposals have now been agreed by member states,
and 87 per cent of the relevant measures have been transferred into national
law.
Removal of technical barriers. Niggling regulations still hamper
cross-border trade, particularly for smaller businesses.
Liberalisation of 'closed' sectors. Important sectors such as energy,
telecommunications and postal services were left out of the original 1985
programme. Proposals to introduce more competition here have made slow
progress.
Enforcement of procurement legislation. The Commission wants to enforce
rules opening public authority and utility contracts to free competition.
Meanwhile, the Commission is resigned to criticism. Without more evidence of
how the project is working, one senior official says it will be difficult
for Brussels to strike a balance between 'misguided complacency and an
exaggerated view of the problems'.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: 'National champions' become obsolete -
Cross-border deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1967 two important structural changes took place in the UK motor industry
 -the formation of Ford of Europe, and the merger of Leyland and British
Motor Holdings to create British Leyland. The first, uniting Ford's British
and German subsidiaries, was designed to achieve Europe-wide economies of
scale. The second was a nat-ional affair; it did nothing to remedy one of
the industry's most serious competitive weaknesses: lack of marketing
presence in continental Europe.
The subsequent 25 years have underlined the wisdom of Ford's approach and
the sterility of the 'national champion' strategy. As barriers to
intra-European trade and investment have come down, companies in many
industries have had to follow Ford's example; those that left the transition
to Europe too late, such as most British Leyland companies, have paid the
penalty in dwindling market share.
In the early 1970s, before and after the UK's accession to the Community,
British companies were unfamiliar with continental systems and management
practices, yet felt the need for a big leap forward to take advantage of the
enlarged market. The result was a series of ill-judged mergers and joint
ventures - the Dunlop-Pirelli partnership was an example - which failed to
produce economies and led to some disillusionment with Europe. Today a
European strategy is not an adventure; it is an accepted part of doing
business.
As Ford recognised in the 1960s, integration came quickest in sectors like
cars, where customer needs were sufficiently uniform to justify a
continental approach to design and manufacture. This, in turn, has
encouraged the leading component suppliers, such as Valeo in France, GKN and
T&amp;N in Britain, to build or acquire factories throughout Europe to serve
vehicle assemblers. Pilkington's moves into Germany and more recently Italy
are part of this trend.
Progress has been slower in traditionally protected sectors like electric
power and telecommunications. But even here nationally based procurement is
giving way to open competition, providing a further stimulus to cross-border
alliances, such as GEC-Alsthom and Siemens's stake in the British
telecommunications equipment industry.
Nationalism, of course, is not dead, as is clear from the angry reaction in
Britain to BMW's proposed takeover of Rover. No doubt the tendency for
European countries to try to look after their own will persist. It was,
after all, one of Germany's national champions, Siemens, which took over the
loss-making Nixdorf computer group; one of Germany's largest lame ducks,
AEG, went to Daimler-Benz and not to Britain's GEC, which came close to
buying parts of the business in the early 1980s. In steel, local political
pressures still impede structural change, although another sector plagued by
over-capacity, petrochemicals, has been reshaped through asset swaps and
divestitures, many involving cross-border transactions.
No doubt, too, European mergers and acquisitions will continue to be
complicated by differences in management style and shareholder expectations.
But where the underlying commercial logic is sound, these cultural and
organisational strains are usually manageable. How much further will
European rationalisation go? In the motor industry it seems unlikely the
present structure, with six high-volume producers each holding about 11-15
per cent of the market, will survive the removal of restrictions on Japanese
imports; the trend towards higher concentration, which has already
eliminated most smaller players, will probably go further in the next
decade.
But whether all Europe's manufacturing industries will move in an American
direction is more doubtful. Even if all artificial barriers are dismantled,
differences in consumer tastes between Italy and Britain will remain greater
than, say, between California and New Jersey. Hotpoint, the British domestic
appliance maker, has been successful without embracing a fully European
strategy; national markets can still provide the basis for healthy profits.
Not all national markets will go regional, nor will all regional markets
become global.
What matters is that strategies can now be based on normal commercial
criteria, with fewer distortions arising from government intervention or
conflicting national regulations. While European integration is not
complete, the focus of management attention may be shifting. In some
industries the ability to compete in the US and, perhaps more important, in
the Asia-Pacific region is increasingly crucial to profitable growth.
Companies such as Renault and Peugeot, whose business is based almost
entirely on west Europe, could be vulnerable if they fail to break out of
Europe. Just as the 1980s saw a shift from national champions, so in the
1990s being a Euro-champion may no longer be enough.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Eastern springboard for western
manufacturing - Investment in east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, NICHOLAS DENTON and PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For companies doing business across Europe, the former members of the
communist bloc have become vital elements in the international economic
equation.
Since the Berlin Wall fell in late 1989, western companies have made about
Dollars 9bn of capital investments in Hungary, Poland, the Czech republic
and Slovakia, the four most developed economies of central and eastern
Europe. The OECD says the lion's share has gone to Hungary, with roughly
Dollars 5.5bn invested there so far.
About 60 per cent of this investment has been geared to serving local
markets, according to estimates by the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development. But large companies are increasingly using their eastern
manufacturing bases as springboards for exports to the west.
For the moment, central and eastern European exports to the west are very
limited. According to the latest data, for 1992, the four countries' sales
to the EU made up only 1.4 per cent of EU members' overall imports.
Despite agreement last summer to improve eastern Europe's access to EU
markets, exports are still being held up by barriers in areas such as steel,
chemical and textiles. But in view of the region's low labour costs and
increasingly modern production facilities, eastern Europe could become an
important source for the west of goods such as consumer products and
manufacturing components.
Mr Niall FitzGerald, director in charge of worldwide detergents operations
at Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, points to the
particular attractions of Poland - where the company is investing heavily in
raising production of detergents and edible oils and fats. 'With investment
in new technology and relatively low labour costs, its industrial operations
are potentially more competitive than those in the west.' Unilever is
starting to service the Czech and Slovak markets with Polish-made
detergents, and eventually could sell to Russia and western Europe, he says.
But some plans to source foreign markets from eastern Europe have soured.
Volkswagen has cut planned investment in Czech carmaker Skoda from DM7.1bn
to DM3.7bn. VW had wanted to sell a third of its production on the Czech and
Slovak markets, a third to other eastern European countries, and a third to
western Europe. But recession and protective tariffs in Poland have upset
plans.
In Hungary, several companies aim to build up sales to western markets. In
buying Hungarian light bulb producer Tungsram for Dollars 550m, General
Electric of the US acquired both a competitive production base and an
established 7 per cent share of west European lighting sales. According to
Mr Jack Welch, GE chairman: 'In the European manufacturing sense, Hungary
will be our principal base.' GE says wage costs in Hungary are only a third
or a quarter of levels in the UK, where it is closing lighting plants.
Another company increasing Hungarian production is Oesterreichische
Kabelwerke, an Austrian subsidiary of Germany's Siemens. After gaining a
majority stake in Magyar Kabel Muvek, it plans to shift much of its cable
production to Hungary .
Audi, part of VW, starts production of engine components this summer at its
DM300m plant in north-west Hungary. All production is to be exported to the
Audi assembly plant in Ingolstadt, Germany. Audi says Hungary had a 15 per
cent cost advantage over other shortlisted sites in Austria and eastern
Germany - an indication of the ground companies in the west must try to make
up.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Pay awards move upwards to track inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Annual pay awards are picking up in line with rising inflation, two reports
published yesterday say.
Figures from Industrial Relations Services show that the average settlement
for the three months to the end of January 1994 edged up to 2.5 per cent,
compared with 2 per cent in the three months to the end of December.
More than half of the settlements in the three months to January provided
increases of between 2 per cent and 2.9 per cent, contributing to the first
significant movement in the IRS headline figure since August last year.
However, only a quarter of the deals were worth more than a year earlier
and, thanks to the relatively sharp rise in inflation, the average rise has
failed to clear the rate of inflation for the first time in three years.
IRS says that with almost two-thirds of the year's pay reviews to be
completed by the end of April, the next few weeks will be of crucial
importance to pay planners. 'We may be seeing a return to a familiar pattern
 -pay pressures being driven upwards in the wake of rising prices - which
would frustrate the government's desire to break the link between pay and
inflation,' concludes IRS.
This picture is supported by rival pay analysts Incomes Data Services, which
says that settlements are mainly between 2 per cent and 3.5 per cent, and
slightly up on the end of last year.
It says that less than 10 per cent of companies are freezing pay, with a
similar proportion settling at 4 per cent or 5 per cent.
IDS adds that about a third of January settlements were higher than one year
earlier.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Rise in fears for future of manual jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's manual workers have grown increasingly pessimistic over the past
month about job prospects, according to the latest in a series of monthly
surveys for the Financial Times, published today.
The survey, conducted by MORI, the pollsters, for Industrial Relations
Services, the pay and employment analysts, showed that while 48 per cent of
all workers said they were very or fairly concerned about becoming jobless
in the next 12 months - compared with 44 per cent in January - as many as 58
per cent of manual workers asked in February were worried about their
employment.
This compared with 47 per cent of manual workers who expressed concern in
January.
An upsurge of anxiety has also occurred among workers aged between 35 and
54, with the proportion expressing concern rising by 11 percentage points to
54 per cent.
By contrast there was a decline in concern among the over-55s from 41 per
cent to 34 per cent in January. Forty-five per cent of those aged under 34
were worried, a percentage point less than in the previous month.
The rise in anxiety has been greatest in the Midlands, where the proportion
has risen from 41 per cent to 52 per cent. This may reflect local worries
about job losses in after BMW's decision to acquire Rover.
Today's figures also confirmed a trend that has been persistent since the
survey began last April, which is that part-time workers appear less worried
about redundancy than those in full-time jobs. Last month 49 per cent of
full-time workers were worried about losing their job compared with 42 per
cent in part-time employment.
A further sign of a deterioration in expectations of recovery can be found
in MORI's so-called 'misery index' which is compiled from both its economic
optimism index and its fear of redundancy survey. The higher the index, the
more miserable the public.
Last month the overall index stood at 34 per cent, the second highest figure
 -after October's - since the survey began. Misery is worst among manual
workers, with a figure of 41 per cent, compared with 36 per cent in January.
The survey is based on interviews between February 24 and February 28 with
1,007 adults aged 18 and over who work full-time or part-time across 149
constituency sampling points in the UK.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Career loans fall short of target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession has taken its toll on individuals investing in their own
training, with a fall in demand for government-backed career loans and an
increase in defaults by borrowers, says the Unemployment Unit, an
independent research organisation.
In 1992-93 only 10,000 Career Development Loans were approved, compared with
a government target of 15,000, the Unemployment Unit says in its magazine
Working Brief.
The first seven months of 1993-94 also showed this trend had not improved.
The scheme was set up in 1988 by the government, which intended the loans to
play a strong role in encouraging people to invest in training. The maximum
loan rises from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 8,000 in April, and the government
meets interest costs during training.
The Unemployment Unit said that more participants were having problems
making repayments, with 1,500 default notices being served in 1992-93
compared with only 574 during the first three years.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Courts shift the employment goalposts: The Maastricht
opt-out may be academic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week was an unusually good one for British trade unions. A
well-received 're-launch' of the Trades Union Congress was followed by two
favourable court judgments, based on worker-friendly European law.
First came the ruling from the European Court's advocate general that
employees must be properly consulted in collective redundancies and
transfers of business ownership, even where there are no recognised trade
unions.
Then came the judgment by the law lords that reduced from five years to two
the qualifying period for redundancy pay and unfair dismissal rights for
part-time workers.
It is not clear whether these judgments - and others to come - will
significantly encumber the government's programme of labour market
de-regulation. But they do lend weight to the view that the government's
opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty has given it
strictly limited immunity from European employment law.
Right and left agree on this point. Mr Ira Chalpin, of the aggressively
free-market Institute of Directors, said: 'Our victory in securing an
opt-out from the social chapter just over two years ago is looking
increasingly hollow.' Supporters of European employment law, such as labour
lawyer Mr Simon Auerbach of Patteson and Brewer, said: 'The tide of social
directives and the way they are implemented will not be stopped by our
Maastricht opt-out.'
The government itself seems uncertain how to respond to the latest moves. Mr
David Hunt, the employment secretary, today lodges a formal appeal against
the European Union's working time directive, which despite being watered
down could introduce important new minimum standards in the UK on holidays
and working hours. He has also warned his cabinet colleagues that legal
pressures coming from Brussels may hinder some aspects of labour market
flexibility.
Advisers to Mr Hunt in the employment department were last week taking a
relaxed view of the two judgments. On the part-time workers judgment it is
estimated that only about 500,000 of Britain's 5.8m part-timers will be
affected.
It is difficult to calculate what kind of disincentive to part-time
employment might be created by introducing protection from unfair dismissal
three years earlier, but most analysts say it is not likely to be large.
Similarly, the minimum redundancy pay requirement is one week's pay per year
of service up to a maximum of 12 years, which is unlikely to generate more
than a maximum of Pounds 500 for a part-time worker.
There remain powerful incentives favouring continued growth of part-time
employment from a flexibility, cost and regulatory point of view.
For example, for those paid under Pounds 56 per week employers still do not
have to provide National Insurance, statutory sick pay or maternity benefit.
And those employers who do find the new unfair dismissal rules troublesome
can simply switch workers to rolling temporary contracts.
The requirement to consult workers' representatives in certain
circumstances, even where (as in a growing number of UK workplaces) there
are no recognised unions, has a less predictable outcome and is likely to be
fought hard by the government.
It will not mean the introduction of a right to union recognition or the
emergence of permanent works council-type bodies in Britain. But one
European Commission official said: 'Some sort of election system will be
needed to establish a worker representative,' though he added that the
system could be immediately disbanded once it had served its function. Many
smaller organisations would be excluded.
But the government faces other European employment law problems. In the
coming months it can expect:
A possible bill for tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds from workers
claiming compensation for loss of earnings or dismissal as a result of the
government's failure to properly implement the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) legislation, which gives workers some protection
in cases of business transfer.
Little joy in having contracting out from the public sector excluded from
the Tupe regulations. The latest draft of a commission discussion paper on
Tupe merely suggests that it should apply to genuine organisational entities
and not to individuals.
Pressure to raise the Pounds 10,000 maximum compensation limit for cases of
unfair dismissal.  As a result of EU legal judgments maximum compensation
limits have already been lifted from awards given to workers found to have
suffered from sex or race discrimination, which is leading to substantial
damages being awarded.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Receivers issue warning in wake of staff-rights ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure is mounting among insolvency firms for clarification of employees'
rights in receiverships following a controversial court ruling last week.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand said yesterday that it had already shed staff in one
company that entered receivership this week as a result of the Court of
Appeal ruling.
The verdict in the Paramount case suggests that under UK insolvency law
receivers and administrators must re-employ staff on new contracts within 14
days of their appointment, or assume all the existing employment
obligations.
The unexpected effect is to rank substantial additional employment costs
above other creditors, and may prompt receivers in any new appointment to
fire a large proportion of the workforce before the 14-day limit is
exceeded.
Mr Mark Homan, head of insolvency at Price Waterhouse, said yesterday: 'We
are still in a state of shock.' He warned that the effect of the ruling
could be to delay further pay-outs on existing receiverships.
Mr Chris Hughes, head of insolvency at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said the effect of
the ruling on receivership cases was unclear, but that insolvency firms were
worried that they could be forced to lay off staff in all cases.
'The law appears to have been thrown into the melting pot by the judgment.
It has caused some concern, and it needs to be clarified quickly,' Mr Hughes
said.
The insolvency profession is studying the details of the ruling and may
attempt to bring an early case on appeal in order to clarify its
implications.

FT  07 MAR 94 / De-regulation bill proposal could backfire on employers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A proposal in the government's de-regulation bill to allow companies to
select employees for redundancy - contravening customary arrangements such
as last-in, first-out - could backfire on employers that use it as an excuse
to abandon redundancy procedures, says the Institute of Personnel
Management's vice-president for employee relations.
In today's issue of the IPM's magazine, Mr Ewart Wooldridge says that the
measure could be seen by employers as an invitation to reject a structured
and consultative approach to redundancy.
'There is a substantial pay-off from treating staff and their
representatives properly. Those who remain will judge you by how you looked
after those who had to leave.'

FT  07 MAR 94 / Smith 'furious' at leak of Major meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith yesterday warned that Labour may not take part in bipartisan
meetings after a private talk with the prime minister was leaked to the
Sunday Express.
The private meeting focused on the forthcoming renewal of the Prevention of
Terrorism Act, which Labour regularly votes against.
Mr Smith wanted to see if Labour's disagreement with the government over two
specific measures of the act could be bridged before it comes up for annual
renewal on Wednesday.
The Labour leader asked for the removal of internal exclusion orders and the
provision which allows suspects to be detained for seven days before a
charge is made.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, yesterday said the government had
rejected the demand because such a two party 'approach would have weakened
the fight against terrorism'.
Mr Smith was reported to be 'furious' that the meeting had been made public
and called for an independent inquiry into how it had been leaked. The
meeting, which took place at 10 Downing Street, was just between Mr Smith
and Mr John Major.
The Labour leader has warned that unless he receives a satisfactory
explanation it may not be possible to have meetings on security matters. His
office accused the government of 'playing politics with Northern Ireland'.
Downing Street denied that it leaked the meeting. Mr Howard regretted the
fact that the meeting had been made public. 'These meetings were private.
They should have remained private,' he said.
However, Mr Howard was unapologetic for refusing to accept the offer of a
bipartisan approach.
He told BBC TV: 'Just as Labour supported the Prevention of Terrorism Act
until 1983 we believe it is essential in the fight against terrorism today.'

FT  07 MAR 94 / IoD warns of tax blow to business confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Confidence about economic prospects is rising but many business leaders are
worried by the prospect of next month's tax increases, an Institute of
Directors survey says today.
Mr Peter Morgan, the institute director-general, said the economic upturn
was continuing although 'muted'. He said business confidence could be
expected to dip before the tax increases, which are likely to depress
consumer spending and company order books.
The poll of 302 companies in manufacturing and services indicates that sales
volumes have risen since December although the rate of increase in orders
and profits has fallen.
According to the survey, conducted last month, 53 per cent of companies were
more optimistic about the economy than six months previously. That compared
with 47 per cent in the last survey in December, although it is well below
the 65 per cent recorded in August.
Nearly two-thirds of the companies said they were more hopeful about their
own business's prospects than six months before. Only 58 per cent gave this
answer in December. More than three-fifths of companies had increased sales
volumes, slightly above the figure at the end of last year.
The poll showed order books continuing to expand, though at a slower rate
than in December, with 57 per cent of companies reporting increased orders
last month compared with 58 per cent in December.
Profits were rising, though more slowly than last autumn, and this was a
'cause for concern', the institute said. Just over half of the companies
that responded to the poll said profits were up, compared with 55 per cent
in December last year and 57 per cent in October.
The proportion of company investment directed to what the institute calls
the 'key areas' of research and development, machinery, training and
advertising has fallen slightly since December. These declines have been
offset by increases in cash spent on acquisitions, buildings and working
capital, leaving overall investment levels unchanged.
Cashflow remained a big problem for two out of five companies while lack of
demand was rated as a serious difficulty by nearly a third. Prospects for
employment were considered slightly worse with 37 per cent of companies
saying they were likely to take on more workers compared with 39 per cent in
the December survey. Consumers are increasing borrowing, especially for cars
and other expensive items, says a report today from the Finance and Leasing
Association, which represents companies providing credit to individuals and
businesses. The association said its figures indicated that next month's tax
increases had not sapped people's enthusiasm for taking out loans, although
it was concerned about weakness in companies' investment spending.
