FT  07 MAR 94 / Heseltine restarts talks with senior industrialists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is restarting
efforts to gather ideas from senior business executives with informal
discussions on competitiveness and the pace of recovery.
Invited to two unpublicised dinners will be industrialists from a network of
about 20 companies which Mr Heseltine established last year.
The initiative underlines how Mr Heseltine - who in recent weeks has emerged
as a candidate for leadership of the Conservatives in the event of a move to
depose Mr John Major - is seeking advice from executives including those not
regarded as Tory supporters.
The dinners are at Lancaster House, a government mansion in London normally
used for top-level discussions with other countries. They indicate that Mr
Heseltine is pressing on with moves, interrupted by his heart attack last
summer, to establish a new dialogue with industry.
Industrialists asked to the dinners, to be held on May 23 and November 14,
include Mr Christopher Haskins, the left-leaning chairman of Northern Foods
who advises Labour, and Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of J. Sainsbury and a
former paymaster of the now defunct Social Democrats.
Others invited include Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster
Bank, Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel chairman, Sir Christopher Lewinton,
chairman of the TI engineering group, Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive of
the Unigate foods group, Mr Ken Coates, chairman of engineering group
Meggitt, and Mr Mike Harris, chief executive of Mercury Communications.
All these people, or others representing their companies, came to a lunch
for about 20 senior industrialists hosted by Mr Heseltine shortly before his
illness.
Subjects to be discussed are expected to include the merits of a further cut
in interest rates, state help for exporters and the role of the banks in
assisting industry, especially small businesses. Also under discussion could
be the degree to which the DTI should target financial help or advice to
specific industries or technologies.
Mr Heseltine's efforts to canvass ideas on economic policy have caused
raised eyebrows at the Treasury, the main economic policymaking department.
To ensure that the Treasury and the DTI views are consistent, a Treasury
representative is likely to be asked to both dinners.

<TEXT>
The MSF manufacturing union is to become the first union to buy BBC airtime
to get its message across to members and potential members.
The union, the UK's fifth largest, has bought a 30-minute slot on BBC
Select, the BBC's specialist night-time service. The programme, which will
be listed in the Radio Times, will go out at 5.30am on May 12 - the day
after the union's annual conference.
Until now The Business Channel, operated by BMH Communications, which has an
agreement with BBC Select, has been the domain of employers.

European Commission propos-als to force companies to consult with employees
on a range of business issues is an 'unwarranted interference' on their
right to manage and should be resisted, says the British Chambers of

The business lobbying group said the need for legislation across the
European Union on this subject was 'questionable'. It added that employers
should be free to establish their own internal procedures based on what was
most appropriate.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Labour vows end to school rankings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour pledged yesterday to end competition between schools as well as the
national league table of performance.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said that a Labour government
would end the practice whereby schools 'compete against each other in a
market situation'.
She declared on BBC television that national league tables were a waste of
government money and unnecessary for parents. who needed only to know about
their local schools.
Mrs Taylor added that grant-maintained status was not the way forward.
Labour put the emphasis on the need for equity in resourcing.
Also yesterday it was made clear that Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, plans to proceed with plans to cut surplus school places by
closing schools.
But the Department for Education said there would be fewer than 100
closures. The department denied a Sunday newspaper report that as many as
1,000 schools would be closed.
New powers contained in the Education Act 1993, which comes into force in
April, give Mr Patten the ability to force local authorities to take action
to close schools.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Short fuse on Tories' Budget timebomb: On Budget day the
Financial Times asked individual taxpayers for their assessment. Now five of
them have been shown details of what they will have to pay from next month.
Rachel Johnson, Motoko Rich and Chris Tighe report on their reactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one thing to read about the Tory 'tax bombshell' but it is entirely
different to feel one detonate in your pocket.
'Good God,' said Professor Richard Joyner, a scientist at Liverpool
University, on learning that his annual tax bill will rise by nearly Pounds
1,000. 'I was expecting direct tax increases of around Pounds 600 but I had
no idea that indirect taxes would be so high.'
Prof Joyner was one of the people who gave an immediate reaction to the
Financial Times last November to the Budget. Now they have responded to a
tax evaluation carried out for the FT by accountants Touche Ross which shows
the impact of proposed tax increases on their disposable income.
Spending on luxuries such as holidays are likely to be the main casualties
of the tax rises which will hit pay packets from next month, the survey
found. A large part of the tax increases result from the chancellor's
freezing of most tax allowances and restricting mortgage interest relief.
National Insurance contributions will increase by one percentage point to 10
per cent.
Prof Joyner, will pay Pounds 435 a year more in direct tax. 'We will
probably spend less on holidays,' he said. He might also postpone buying a
replacement car.
Mr Sean Cockburn, 23, a quality manager at a plating factory, and his
girlfriend, Ms Karen Jewers, a 29-year-old nurse, have just taken out a
mortgage. They face an annual tax rise of Pounds 243 on their combined
salary of Pounds 28,600. Mr Cockburn said: 'I try to run my house like a
business, finding the cheapest, most reliable suppliers.'
The couple has already been forced to try to apply business principles to
Karen's two cats, which cost about Pounds 300 a year in food, cat litter,
toys and baskets. But the cats turned up their noses at discounted food
bought in bulk and the couple have instead cut down on smoking and going
out. Ms Jewers said she would probably trade down in the shops she used.
Ms Sylvie Pierce, chief executive of Reading Borough Council, is facing a
tax increase of Pounds 596. On a salary of Pounds 65,000, she feels it would
be 'undignified to complain'. But she will do what many other people may
find themselves doing in the face of higher tax bills. 'I shall just
increase my overdraft,' she said. 'I suppose I may make economies at the
margins.'
The increases could have significant effects on the lifestyle of some
people. Ms Suzana Radovic, a teacher and single mother on a salary of Pounds
25,000, will be cutting back on basics to accommodate the Pounds 473 rise in
her tax bill. 'It will actually affect my main spending on things like food
and I'll be extra careful about heating,' she said. 'We will have to adjust
what we spend on basics because it is quite a sizeable amount of our
income.' Ms Radovic said that if she had to pay for childcare she would not
be able to afford it. At the moment she relies on her mother.
It is the prospect of such personal economies, small savings and cuts in
spending, multiplied across the population, which is provoking fears that
the recovery may be cut short. The Confederation of British Industry said
last month that retail sales had not risen as much as expected at the
beginning of the year, and that consumer confidence in general was low in
anticipation of the tax increases.
The Budget did produce a bright spot for pensioner Mr Leslie Thomson, 76, a
former Lloyd's underwriter. He said: 'The introduction of the pensioners'
guaranteed income bond is a very good thing for a chap like me and I have
invested in it quite largely. I put Pounds 15,000 in and that will produce
about 2 per cent per annum better than in other investments that a chap like
me can make.'
This nest egg and a modest lifestyle have put Mr Thomas and his wife in a
position where a Pounds 117 tax increase will not destroy their personal
budget. However other aspects of the Budget horrify him. 'I think the VAT on
fuel is an absolute shocker. The badly-off pensioner probably spends a very
large proportion of their income on keeping warm and this VAT is going to
add to it.'
As a public servant, Ms Pierce is also worried about the potential effect of
the tax rises on her community. She said: 'My concern is about the impact of
the changes on people who are already living absolutely at the edge. There
are a lot of people living like that in the community I work for. The
recovery is pretty fragile so the impact on the local economy worries me.'
Even if the economic consequences of the tax rises are less far-reaching
than feared, the government may still face some political fall-out. It
raises the issue of whether taxpayers feel they were misled by the 1992
election campaign, in which the Tories campaigned as the party of low
taxation and warned of a tax bombshell if Labour won.
According to Mr Thomson this is most definitely so. 'I think they misled the
public and ran a campaign frightening the wits out of the public into not
voting for Labour.'
Prof Joyner agrees. He said: 'I would say they are the party of less
well-funded public services. But that does not excuse the dishonesty the
electorate has been subjected to.'
But Mr Cockburn is a loyalist. His tax bill would not, he said, affect his
support for the Conservatives. 'I'll still stick by them,' he vowed.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Fewer payments made by cheque
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The use of cheques is declining in favour of plastic cards and direct
debits, according to research conducted for Girobank, the banking subsidiary
of Alliance &amp; Leicester building society which runs a money transmission
service.
The survey, which compares results obtained in December with findings from a
year before, also highlighted a continuing attachment to cash.
In both surveys, more than 60 per cent said they expected to be using cash
as often in five years as now.
In 1993, 52 per cent of adults with a current account used direct debits
compared with 46 per cent in 1992; and 26 per cent used debit cards,
compared with 19 per cent in 1992.
About three-quarters of those questioned had use of a bank or building
society current account.
For buying goods worth about Pounds 10, using a cheque was the first-choice
method of payment for 5 per cent in 1993, compared with 8 per cent in 1992.
Preference for a card for such purchases rose from 8 per cent to 11 per
cent.
Similarly in 1993 those expressing a preference for paying household bills
by cheque had fallen from 35 per cent to 28 per cent, while the proportion
preferring to pay by direct debit rose from 42 per cent to almost half.
The survey's findings on the use of cash may make bleak reading for banks:
the cost to banks of cash transmission in the clearing system has been
estimated by the Association for Payment Clearing Services at Pounds 2bn a
year.
The cost of using cheques in 1991 was put at Pounds 1.5bn, but even if the
number of cheques continues to fall, the infrastructure to handle them will
still be needed and unit costs will rise.
RSGB, part of market research group Taylor Nelson AGB, carried out the
survey in December 1992 and 1993, each time questioning about 2,000 adults.

FT  07 MAR 94 / ITV may link up with cable groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ITV companies are considering co-operating with cable television groups
in such areas as acquisition of rights to televise big sporting events.
Mr Nigel Walmsley, the chief executive of Carlton Television, who is acting
as a co-ordinator for ITV's relations with the cable industry, plans to meet
leading operators later this month.
One possibility is a joint bid for the rights to the Five Nations rugby
competition. There could also be talks about sharing World Cup cricket
rights. A consortium of cable television companies recently bought exclusive
rights to show the competition in the UK.
The fact that the talks are taking place at all is an indication that the
cable industry is being taken more seriously by conventional broadcasters
although cable is still limited to not much more than 600,000 homes out of
the total of 21m in the UK that have televisions.
There is already a strong precedent for rivals co-operating in the
television market. The BBC supported British Sky Broadcasting's bid for
English premier league football and shows highlights on Match of the Day.
Both Carlton and London Weekend Television were last year interested in
creating an all-London television channel for the cable companies. In the
end they chose Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, to
provide the channel, which is due to launch later this year.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Fewer than 100 schools to be axed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, still plans to cut surplus school
places by closing schools, but fewer than 100 will be shut, his department
said yesterday.
New powers contained in the Education Act 1993, which comes into force in
April, give Mr Patten the ability to force local authorities to take action
to close schools. He has already asked authorities to review their surplus
places and come up with proposals on how to tackle them.
The Department for Education denied a report in yesterday's Observer
newspaper that as many as 1,000 schools would be closed.
It said: 'That would be a huge number. I don't expect it will be that high
for a minute. It will be in the tens.'
Ministers are anxious to tackle spare school places, which reached 1.3m in
England's 4,000 secondary and 18,000 primary schools when they were last
counted in 1991.
The Treasury is said to have completed a review which found that Pounds 310m
could be saved by getting rid of the excess places.

FT  07 MAR 94 / EU stresses stance on holdings in BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Commission officials in Brussels yesterday denied that there had
been any public protest to the UK government over the limits on overseas
shareholdings in British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce.
However, the commission warned yesterday that the limits, agreed with the
government in 1989 after a year of wrangling, were always regarded as
temporary. Now that they had technically expired the commission - which is
concerned the restrictions infringe European Union rules - would not want to
create a precedent by allowing the situation to continue.
The government, which insists on a limit for national security reasons, had
planned to raise the ceiling from 29.5 per cent to 49.5 per cent after
complaints from the companies that it artificially depressed their share
prices.
Officials said yesterday no decision had yet been reached by the commission,
but with the limits on overseas ownership clearly contravening the spirit of
the single market, it was unlikely to favour any extension of a situation
which distinguished between British and other EU shareholders.
After the privatisation of Rolls-Royce in 1987, the government had wanted
the limit to be 15 per cent but was forced to increase it to 29.5 per cent.
Both BAe and Rolls-Royce would like to see the limit removed altogether.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Freight companies to shun Channel tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transport companies are hostile to the Channel tunnel and are unlikely to
make much use of it for freight shipments, says a survey published today.
Only a quarter of British freight companies questioned thought the tunnel
would have a positive effect on their business.
The poll of 102 senior executives was carried out in January by MORI for
Scania, a manufacturer of heavy trucks. It found 62 per cent of transport
companies believed their drivers would prefer to stick with the ferries,
while 84 per cent thought the ferries would offer better facilities than the
tunnel.
'We've managed perfectly well without the tunnel; I don't see it making a
big difference except for the novelty value,' said one transport company
executive.
Mr Dieter Merz, managing director of Scania (Great Britain), said:
'Eurotunnel has predicted it will carry more than 8m tonnes of freight in
its first full year of operation and its aim is to take a significant share
of the ferries' freight business. Our survey shows it may be in for a
surprise.'
The running of freight services through the tunnel was intended to start
today but has been postponed until some time in March or April. Difficulties
in completing tests and safety checks have been blamed.
Only 44 per cent of freight operators questioned in January felt industry
needed a tunnel to make shipments to the Continent. And only 16 per cent of
transport companies believed the tunnel would be cheaper to use than the
ferries.
Shippers wishing to use the tunnel will negotiate individual rates with
Eurotunnel, which will operate shuttle services between Folkestone and
Calais. Only one in five companies said it would use the tunnel if costs
were higher than for the ferries.
'The tunnel will need to set competitive prices for freight to attract
haulage companies away from a ferry service which seems to be more than
satisfying their needs,' the survey said.
Transport companies saw the main advantage of the tunnel as speed but very
few executives mentioned the other benefits which the tunnel claims to
provide: reliability, frequency and convenience.
The survey, which was carried out before the launch of Eurotunnel's
advertising campaign aimed at freight carriers but after extensive general
publicity, showed 64 per cent of respondents knew little or nothing about
how tunnel services would operate. Fifty-eight per cent thought - wrongly -
that they could reserve a place for their trucks on a train.
French transport companies had given more thought to using the tunnel and 55
per cent thought it would have a positive effect on business.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Jump in complaints over sexist adverts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp increase in the number of complaints about the portrayal of women in
advertisements is highlighted by the Advertising Standards Authority's
annual report, published today.
Complaints from the public on this issue rose from 180 in 1992 (of which 52
were upheld) to 536 in 1993, 111 of which were upheld by the authority, the
independent advertising watchdog. The authority said the increase was
'surprising' and highlighted 'the need for greater sensitivity over the use
of sex and women in advertisements'.
Nearly two-thirds of these complaints were about six advertisements.
Only one advertisement broke the rules of the voluntary advertising code
agreed by advertisers and publishers. The advertisement was for Linn Hi-Fi
and the caption beside a photograph of a young woman read: 'She's terrific
in bed.  She's witty, intelligent and makes her own pasta. She doesn't have
a Linn Hi-Fi. But her sister does, and she's the one I married.'
The advertisement was withdrawn after the authority ruled that the use of
innuendo, combined with the picture, was likely to cause offence to the
public.
Overall, there was a slight decrease in the number of complaints to the
authority about advertisements over the year - down from 10,688 in 1992, of
which 1,490 were upheld, to 9,603 in 1993, of which 1,268 were upheld.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Building equipment sales show 42% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction equipment sales rose 42 per cent last year after three years of
decline that left the market at its lowest level in living memory, according
to a report by Corporate Intelligence Group, the researchers.
The rise in sales, from 9,236 units in 1992 to 13,017, was nearly twice as
much as was predicted a year ago. It means the UK was the only major
European construction equipment market to rise last year.
The group predicts a further 11 per cent rise this year, but warns against
over-optimism: even if this forecast is fulfilled, sales will still only be
equivalent to those of 1986-1987, and many more companies are now fighting
for market share.
Much of the rise last year was generated in the last quarter, with
agriculture products and the plant hire industry showing the most growth.
The group says: 'Farmers benefited from the strength of the Green Pound, and
needed to replace equipment which was getting old.'
For plant hirers, fleets often dating back to the late 1980s needed
updating, interest rates were low, and there was little good secondhand
equipment available as most of it had been sold overseas.
Sales of mini-excavators rose by 50 per cent to 2,170 units. In the biggest
single product sector, backhoe loaders, sales rose 40 per cent to 3,452.
However, markets for larger equipment are still lacking in confidence, says
the report. This is because of continued uncertainty over the future of
opencast coal, and the minimal rise expected in construction spending, which
will keep activity in the extractive industries at a modest level.
A further rise in the market this year would still leave sales a long way
short of the 21,710 units sold in 1989. But most suppliers would be happy if
that level was never reached again, says the report, because overheated
demand creates as much confusion in the marketplace as no demand.
A realistic total volume of 16,500-17,500 units a year would be welcomed and
should be sustainable, it says.

FT  07 MAR 94 / O'Reilly to urge curbs on MGN bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland will today urge Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to impose strict conditions
on the takeover bid for The Independent newspaper by a consortium which
includes Mirror Group Newspapers.
However the Irish group, which holds 29.9 per cent of Newspaper Publishing,
the company that owns both The Independent and the Independent on Sunday,
will not push for a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission when
it gives evidence to the DTI today.
There is growing concern at the financial state of The Independent, which
could lose between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m this year, and at the
realisation that an MMC investigation would increase the period of
uncertainty.
Mr O'Reilly's team will argue that three main conditions should be imposed:
An independent board should be set up which would include the Irish group as
the single largest shareholder.
The DTI should look again at change to shareholding structure. The main
shareholders, El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, could sell their
shares to MGN or vice versa if there was a failure to agree a business plan.
There should be a transparent agreement on provision of services such as
printing. Under the agreement with the consortium, MGN will provide services
to Newspaper Publishing, apart from editorial, until 1999.
Meanwhile a number of MPs are expressing concern about the future of The
Independent, particularly over issues of editorial independence. Mr Peter
Mandelson, Labour MP for Hartlepool, said that the Labour party should argue
for a reference to the MMC even though the Daily Mirror was 'a friend'.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Rift denied as mandarin quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Whitehall's senior mandarins, Sir Clive Whitmore, permanent
under-secretary at the Home Office, is leaving to take up a job in the
private sector.
Government sources yesterday confirmed Sir Clive's decision to quit, but
denied any rift between him and Mr Michael Howard, home secretary.
Officially, Sir Clive is said to be leaving six months early to take
advantage of a job offer which might not be open to him if he waited until
he was due to retire next January.
But news of his early departure will fuel speculation within Whitehall of
increasingly difficult relations between Mr Howard and his senior officials.
Senior Home Office advisers are said to be sceptical of Mr Howard's hardline
views on criminal justice and unhappy about his apparent unwillingness to
accept their advice.
Press reports of a letter, sent to Sir Clive last November by important Home
Office policymakers who complained that Mr Howard consistently ignored their
advice, drew a public denial of a crisis from Sir Clive.
In a letter to The Guardian, he denied the existence of the officials'
letter and said policy formulation in the Home Office was 'as it always has
been: vigorous and healthy'.
But in spite of these denials, morale in the Home Office is said to be low.
Officials are known to be dismayed that Mr Howard overlooked their advice on
important aspects of the police and magistrates' courts bill forcing the
government into a series of climbdowns in the House of Lords.
However, Whitehall observers said that with less than a year to go before
retirement, Sir Clive's departure would not be as embarrassing to the
government as the resignation last November of Sir Geoffrey Holland,
permanent secretary at the Department for Education. Sir Geoffrey resigned
amid claims of a serious rift between him and Mr John Patten, education
secretary.

FT  07 MAR 94 / R-R moves to calm customers after fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce will today be contacting customers of International Research and
Development, part of its nuclear engineering division, to reassure them in
the wake of a severe fire which destroyed part of IRD's Newcastle premises
at the weekend.
IRD carries out materials testing and other research. Half its work is for
outside clients including Nuclear Electric, the Ministry of Defence,
National Power and PowerGen.
Eighty fire fighters tackled the blaze, which broke out shortly before
midnight on Friday. Nobody was injured but it wrecked one wing of the
L-shaped building, destroying laboratories and melting computers.
Managers from Rolls-Royce's Tyneside-based Industrial Power Group, of which
IRD is a part, spent the weekend planning how to minimise disruption to the
research projects.
IRD's 170 scientists and engineers have been asked to report for work as
normal this morning; some may be accommodated temporarily elsewhere within
Industrial Power Group premises. The company hopes work may resume soon in
IRD's undamaged wing.
The cost of the damage is not yet known. Nobody was working in the building
when the fire broke out, but a guard was patrolling the site.
The cause is being investigated by Northumbria police and the Tyne and Wear
fire brigade. Police said yesterday that they had not 'heard any suggestions
of anything malicious'.

FT  07 MAR 94 / International Press Review
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK
While the New York City press remains unsure whether last Tuesday's shooting
of four young orthodox Jews on Brooklyn Bridge was a ploy by an Arab
terrorist to undermine the PLO-Israeli peace talks, or simply an
opportunist's attempt to gain revenge for the Hebron massacre, the
newspapers have agreed on one thing: that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has earned
the city's respect for his skilled handling of the affair.
'Within hours of the shooting, the mayor and the police department created a
sense of control that gave the public a reason to feel confident in their
government,' said an editorial in The New York Times.
Under the headline 'Giuliani Had Right Stuff', Newsday reported that the
mayor's calm, assured performance in the immediate aftermath of the shooting
 -when it was feared that the attack might trigger unrest between the city's
Jewish and Arab populations - won widespread praise.
Other papers, including The Daily News, noted how the praise for Mr Giuliani
contrasted with the criticism that was aimed at the failure of his
predecessor, Mr David Dinkins, to react quickly to an outbreak of violence
between orthodox Jews and blacks in Brooklyn two years ago. Mr Giuliani
clearly wants to capitalise on all this goodwill, for Newsday reported that
he is keen to arrange a summit between New York's Jewish and Arab leaders.
While praising the mayor and the police for their quick work in arresting a
suspect in the case, the city's press has also followed Mr Giuliani's advice
not to jump to too many conclusions about what motivated an Arab man to fire
on a mini-van full of orthodox Jews. With four Arab New Yorkers having just
been convicted of conspiracy in the World Trade Center bombing, caution was
called for.
The Times said: 'If the attack was the act of one mad individual, it needs
to be divorced from the broader tension between Arabs and Jews. And if it
was a larger political act, there is all the more reason to demonstrate, as
the mayor emphasised, that most people in this city of immigrants are not
terrorists.'
GERMANY
The German government's decision last week to press ahead with the
Transrapid super-fast magnetic levitation train, by building a line from
Berlin to Hamburg, was presented as a technological triumph by its
supporters.
Mr Matthias Wissmann, the transport minister, warned against the familiar
'doubters' in the federal republic who might try to hold it up. This time,
he declared, they would not succeed.
Yet the German press appears to be full of them. Even Handelsblatt, the
conservative daily newspaper for the business community, is not convinced it
will really happen.
It is not just the vociferous environmental lobby which is already whipping
up a campaign against the 400 km/hour monorail train, the newspaper said:
'Many of the opponents of the project argue from a high level of expertise,'
not least the transport ministry's own panel of scientific advisers.
Their main objection, the newspaper's commentator Eberhard Krummheuer
pointed out, was over the private sector's financial and operating plans for
the Transrapid. They questioned the traffic forecasts and the likely level
of federal finance required. They warned it could all prove much more
expensive for the national exchequer than the present plans imply.
Industry is all for it, Handelsblatt admits, but mainly because of the lack
of export success of the high-speed ICE train against the French-built TGV.
Yet Transrapid's export prospects remain for the time being no more than
wishful thinking. Moreover, any big export contracts, as in the case of high
speed trains, will depend on a very high proportion of local content: they
will not create many jobs in Germany.
Munich's Suddeutsche Zeitung fears the whole scheme will be a 'multi-billion
flop'. 'The fact is that industry and the politicians are beavering away to
prevent the multi-billion risks of the project coming out into the open,' it
says.
As for the Frankfurter Rundschau, a traditional supporter of the opposition
Social Democrats, the whole decision is 'financially indefensible, senseless
in transportation terms, and questionable from the point of view of
industry'. Everyone else in Europe is pressing ahead with high-speed trains,
it says. And Bonn simply has not got the cash in the public kitty to go it
alone.
If the doubters in the press are to be believed, Mr Wissmann may still be
proved wrong, and Germany may yet go through years of further debate before
it launches the next generation of rail technology.
JAPAN
The sport of lambasting the prime minister's character and political
judgment in the national press has taken on in a big way in Japan over the
past week.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japanese prime minister, has received a drubbing
almost as merciless as that meted out in recent months to his British
counterpart, for his last-minute decision to abort a much-publicised cabinet
reshuffle and failure to avert US threats of trade sanctions.
The worst insult came from the Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second-largest
newspaper, which likened Mr Hosokawa to an unsuccessful sumo wrestler who
refuses to accept the rules of the game and keeps climbing back into the
ring after he has been defeated. 'This is typical of the second generation
salaryman,' the Asahi mysteriously comments.
'The prime minister brings up serious matters one after the other and
subsequently retracts them in confusion,' says the Asahi, referring to Mr
Hosokawa's recent U-turn on tax reform: 'What is in question is not so much
his leadership but. . . his judgment.'
Mr Hosokawa's personal authority has been diminished as a result of the
reshuffle row, said the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest daily. However, it
cited as a mitigating factor that running a coalition government was
understandably difficult given that this was a new experience for Japan.
Mr Hosokawa's problem is that he belongs to the shinjinrui (generation of
'new human beings'), which gave him high ratings in the opinion polls but a
weak sense of policy direction, alleged the Mainichi Shimbun. 'Some people
say that Mr Hosokawa's political ideas and policies are hard to discern,'
wrote Mr Yoshihisa Inoue, a Mainichi commentator.
The Japan Times joined in the chorus, warning that the weakness of Mr
Hosokawa's leadership would jeopardise Japan's ability to resolve its trade
dispute with the US.

FT  07 MAR 94 / 'Output gap' takes edge off worries about prices: Leading
economies show there is little reason to fear a rapid return of the bogey of
resurgent inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the period of increasingly low inflation that the industrialised world
has enjoyed so far this decade about to come to an end? Recent falls in bond
prices suggest that markets think so. But a closer look at the evidence
shows that there is little, if any, sign of a resurgence of inflation.
Current inflation remains subdued. Consumer price inflation in the seven
major industrial countries has been running at an annual rate of about 2 per
cent, while the prices charged by producers at the factory gate have
actually been falling. Japanese producer prices have even been declining at
the remarkable rate of 2.9 per cent a year.
Only commodity prices have been showing evidence of a pick-up in inflation.
The prices of industrial raw materials, in particular, have risen steeply
over the last eight months, to levels not seen since 1988.
Prices of commodities can be a good predictor of turning points in
inflation. This is partly because higher costs feed through into prices. It
is also because commodity prices are very sensitive to any changes in
demand. For this reason, any rise in global demand will show up first in
commodity prices.
Nevertheless, short-term movements in commodity prices are far from a
reliable predictor of inflation. The price of gold - which Mr Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, has said he regards as a
leading indicator of inflation, because of its sensitivity to inflationary
expectations - has risen a little, but hardly in a convincing manner.
Only an excess of demand over full capacity supply is likely to generate a
sustained rise in prices.
A good indicator of how close an economy is to that point is the 'output
gap', which measures the difference between actual and potential output.
Whenever actual output is below its potential level, inflation ought to
decline and vice versa.
Although difficult to estimate accurately, the output gap in the 10 major
industrial countries seems to have been widening since the second quarter of
1991. It continues to do so, which should mean a further strengthening of
disinflationary pressures.
Only in the US has the gap been closing. The belief that it could even
disappear around the end of this year was one reason why the Federal
Reserve, under Mr Greenspan's chairmanship, raised the federal funds
interest rate on February 4.
The German output gap does remain relatively small, which puts the scale of
its recession in context, but the gap in Japan is very large and widening
still further. Outright deflation, rather than inflation, is the main threat
to Japanese economic stability. The UK output gap, though wide, has begun to
close. But UK economic growth is still not much above its underlying trend
rate, which suggests that the gap will not be closed for some time.
Over the long term, expansion of the money supply is a prime cause of
changes in demand and so of inflation. For some time the monetary picture in
the major industrial countries has been somewhat peculiar. For all that,
there is little to suggest an early resurgence in inflationary demand.
One unusual phenomenon has been the faster growth of narrow money, which
consists of notes, coins and commercial bank deposits with the central bank,
than of broad money, which includes the public's deposits in banking
institutions.
Narrow money has little causal significance in a modern monetary system.
Despite signs of a slight pick-up, the growth of broad money, which is
largely driven by bank lending, has remained very slow indeed. In the US,
for example, its annualised rate of growth in the six months to January 1994
was only 2.4 per cent. In Japan it was still less, at 1.6 per cent.
Amazingly, Germany's broad money offers the sole exception to the pattern of
generally low growth. It is not surprising, therefore, that bond markets
reacted sharply to the shocking figure for German M3 announced last week.
But January's annualised increase of 20.6 per cent over the average for the
last three months of 1993 was freakish, as even the Bundesbank has argued.
Notwithstanding the lack of any obvious economic reason for concern, the
bond market retreat - with an increase in yields of almost one percentage
point on US 10-year bonds since October 1993 - would seem to signal the fear
that inflation is about to rise.
UK 10-year gilt yields have also risen by a little over one percentage point
since the beginning of 1994. But it is clear in this case that only a little
more than half of that increase in nominal yields is due to a change in
inflationary expectations.
In the UK the gap between yields on index-linked bonds and on conventional
bonds provides a good indicator of these expectations. Since early January
the index-linked yield itself has risen by a little less than half a
percentage point, while the gap between the two yields has risen by a little
more than half a percentage point.
Thus a significant part of the change in yields is due to higher real
interest rates, themselves presumably a reflection of greater optimism about
world recovery, fuelled by what is happening in the US, in particular.
It does seem plausible that the bottom of the current inflationary cycle is
now being reached, with financial markets convinced that recovery from
recession is well established, especially in the US and UK. Inflation is
unlikely to fall very much further, therefore, except in Japan and perhaps
in France.
Nevertheless, there is also no evidence that recovery would cause global
inflation to rise significantly. Current inflation remains subdued, output
gaps leave plenty of room for growth, while monetary conditions look far
from worrying, except perhaps in Germany. Policy-makers may react with
caution to the turbulence of recent weeks. But there is little reason for
them to fear a rapid return of the bogey of resurgent inflation.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Bad old days have gone though wage concerns remain: Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Britain left the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, many
commentators thought it was about to descend into its old pattern, with a
devaluation designed to boost competitiveness merely ending in increased
inflation.
Few thought that, nearly one and a half years later, retail price inflation
would be just 2.5 per cent. In 1993, growth was much stronger and inflation
far weaker than analysts had expected at the start of the year. What is not
clear is whether this is just a temporary blip, or whether Britain is
starting to escape from its inflationary past.
Most economists feel that UK inflation will stay within the government's 1-4
per cent target range during this year and next. One key factor has been the
low growth of wages. Average earnings grew by just 3 per cent in the year to
December 1993. This low wage growth enabled manufacturers to absorb some of
the cost increases caused by sterling's devaluation, and helped keep prices
from rising.
Now the focus of inflationary fears has switched. The effects of devaluation
on import prices have disappeared from the system and manufacturers' input
costs are falling - by 2.5 per cent in the year to January. But wage rises
may now be starting to pick up, in part because unemployment has fallen
faster than expected.
Most economists agree that Britain still has an output gap, although not on
its size. Pessimists such as Mr Bill Martin of UBS think, however, that
Britain is very close to capacity and that inflation will pick up sharply in
1995, rising to 7.7 per cent in the fourth quarter.
But Mr Tim Congdon, one of the British chancellor's six independent economic
advisers, expects an annual rate of inflation of just 1.7 per cent in the
fourth quarter of 1995. He believes the output gap is still substantial and
that the lagged effects of slow monetary growth in the early 1990s are still
working their way through the system.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Improving picture likely to soothe historic fears: Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The short-term trends in west German inflation are so clear - at least in
the minds of private and public sector economists - that many are now
looking well beyond the end of the current year. Most expect an average rate
of 2.5 per cent in 1995, tailing off to 2 per cent early in 1996. This is
the Bundesbank's magic 'normative' rate, regarded by the central bank
directorate as real price stability.
The signs are certainly firmly set for an average of 3 per cent being
comfortably achieved or even bettered in the current year after 4.2 per cent
in 1993. The annual rate was already down to 3.3 per cent in February,
despite a raft of increases in fuel taxes and insurance and pension premiums
which pushed January's year-on-year inflation up to 3.5 per cent.
Underlying the current downtrend is an increase in the price of goods of
just 2.3 per cent in the past 12 months. Even though some rises are
predicted this year in producer prices and the cost of imports, and allowing
for the likely appreciation of the D-Mark against the US dollar, feeble
domestic demand is expected to counter such effects.
Falling real incomes and sharply rising unemployment last year helped
depress retail sales by a real 4 per cent. No improvements are in sight
since real earnings are likely to decline again this year and next, despite
the current industrial unrest over pay negotiations. Meanwhile, continuing
fierce international competition will tend to reduce the price of industrial
products.
This promising picture was clouded for much of last year by sharply rising
rents and high charges for private services. But the tide has turned, and
both trend lines now point firmly downwards. Rents, which have an 18 per
cent weighting in the consumer prices index, were soaring by almost 7 per
cent year-on-year last summer. They are now going up by less than 5 per
cent. The cost of private services - 25 per cent of the CPI - formerly
rising by 7.5 per cent is now increasing at around 5 per cent.
Other favourable factors include federal and local governments'
understandable reluctance to increase taxes or administered prices in an
election year.
Unquantifiable, but not to be forgotten, is an inbuilt, historical dread of
inflation among the German people.
A recent survey by the Munich Imas institute found 70 per cent of the
population were finding life uncomfortable. The main sources of their
depression were fear of unemployment (65 per cent), crime (60 per cent) and
inflation (55 per cent).

The choir of economists from the US administration, Congress and Federal
Reserve is singing in remarkable unison: there is no cause for alarm over
inflation prospects.
'The signs of continuing growth in the economy are signs that suggest growth
is occurring without accelerating inflation,' Ms Laura Tyson, the chief
White House economist, said last week. 'Not only is current inflation
extremely modest, but the fundamentals, the things that explain future
inflation - wage patterns, productivity growth, import prices, energy
prices, for example - all remain well behaved.'
But 235 miles north-east of Washington, Wall Street bond traders are hearing
a different tune on prices. Ever since the Fed tightened short-term interest
rates to 3.25 per cent on February 4, every signal has been interpreted as a
mark of higher inflation on the way. Many Wall Street economists now expect
the Fed to tighten further, possibly at its March 22 meeting.
Markets have focused more on rising measures of commodity prices such as
surveys of manufacturers' purchase prices conducted by the Philadelphia
regional Fed and by the National Association of Purchasing Managers, as well
as on fears that the unsustainable growth of the fourth quarter - gross
domestic product rose at an annualised rate of 7.5 per cent, according to
the latest estimate - could lead to prolonged overheating this year.
Washington economists, on the other hand, have preferred to look at
controlled import prices, moderate wage increases and improving
productivity.
The Fed, in its half yearly monetary policy report to Congress last month,
acknowledged some commodity factors that could work to lift inflation this
year: last year's poor harvest left some crops in short supply, creating the
risk of higher food prices, and the likelihood that last year's decline in
energy prices will not be repeated.
Nevertheless, most of the Fed governors and presidents of the regional Feds
expect consumer price inflation to be close to 3 per cent in 1994 - though
their forecasts range from 2.25 per cent to 4 per cent.
The Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, also sees little likelihood that
inflation will be a problem in 1994 or 1995.
Although manufacturing capacity utilisation is at a rate often associated
with inflationary pressures, the CBO notes that strong investment in new
plant and equipment should keep the rate from rising much this year. More
broadly, CBO says, the shortfall of GDP below its potential 'will remain
large enough to dampen inflation even with economic growth close to 3 per
cent'.
Although the reviving economy has undoubtedly left less slack in the labour
market, many economists believe productivity is set to improve at a rate
that should keep the lid on inflation.
The growth rate of unit labour costs has declined from 4.5 per cent in 1990
to a level close to 2 per cent for the last two years. Revised statistics
due to be released tomorrow are likely to show that unit labour costs
actually fell by more than 3 per cent in the fourth quarter.
Ms Tyson concludes, like most Washington economists, that consumer price
inflation will indeed accelerate this year from last year's rate of 2.7 per
cent but only to around 3 per cent. 'So we anticipate something but you
would hardly call that a change in the underlying inflationary
fundamentals,' she said.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Caracas still feeling Latino aftershocks: The backlash from
the Venezuelan bank's failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the three bankers originally named by the Venezuelan government to
take over the failed Banco Latino, the country's second largest bank,
recently described how he and his colleagues were surprised late one night
to discover that Latino's computer link to the outside world was receiving
and transmitting data.
Virtually all of Latino's activities were supposed to have been halted after
the bank was closed on January 14, but it turned out that one of the former
shareholders still had access to the bank's main computer through a
satellite link from the US, and was working feverishly in its records.
The government-appointed intervention team subsequently secured the computer
and other records from tampering, but they will never be sure how many
important items were altered, eliminated or removed by Latino's
shareholders, executives or others working on their behalf.
This is but one of the anecdotes produced by the spectacular failure in
January of Banco Latino, a bank that grew vigorously under the shadow of
political protection of the government of President Carlos Andres Perez, who
was forced to step down last year on corruption charges.
A judge issued arrest warrants last week for 83 people, including executives
and shareholders of the bank, alleging the bank was used to commit massive
fraud with funds deposited by the general public, private companies of all
sizes, pension funds and even the government.
Bankers and government officials tell their friends - and sometimes the
media - how people connected with Latino allegedly carried off bags and
suitcases stuffed with US banknotes as it became clear that the bank was
close to going under. They have described how hundreds of millions of
dollars in loan proceeds, deposits and trust accounts apparently
'disappeared'.
They have noted how Latino board members had more corporate jets than much
larger companies and how the board of directors declared 1993 cash dividends
even as the bank was headed for disaster.
The demise of Latino, which the government hopes to re-open, continues to
generate shockwaves nationwide. Forced to close by the government after it
could not meet daily cheque-clearing payments, despite heavy official
assistance, the bank set off a crisis that hit other banks. Several other
institutions are now under de facto government control, although they have
continued to operate.
The weakness of the banking system was cited as a reason behind the
downgrading late on Friday of the government's Eurobonds by the US rating
agency Standard &amp; Poor's.
Latino's collapse created a huge demand for US dollars that seriously hurt
Venezuela's international reserves and forced a deficit-ridden government to
produce up to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) to assist Latino and the other
troubled banks.
It caused financial and personal difficulties for hundreds of thousands of
clients ranging from teenagers and low-income retired people to large
Venezuelan corporations, government entities and the military, which kept
part of their pension fund money with the bank.
One small city in western Venezuela - Puerto Cumarebo - was paralysed
financially after its only financial institution, a Banco Latino branch,
shut down. Latino also managed to place branches in key areas such as the US
Embassy in Caracas and the headquarters of the national oil company, PDVSA.
Even the government's Bank Deposit Guarantee Fund (Fogade) had 33 per cent
of its assets on deposit with Latino.
The arrest warrants were issued last Wednesday by a Venezuelan criminal
court judge working under heavy police protection. They cover members of the
bank's last board of directors, its senior executives and others, including
the Superintendent of Banks, who was charged with concealment. Other charges
covered falsification of financial statements, fraud and illegal
appropriation of funds.
The names include members of Venezuela's business elite, most prominently Mr
Ricardo Cisneros, one of two brothers who own one of the country's largest
business groups, Organizacion Diego Cisneros. They also own Spalding,
Evenflow and Pueblo Extra supermarkets in the US, and hold an important
stake in Univision, the largest Hispanic television network in America.
Even before the arrest orders were issued, the Cisneros brothers, Mr Gustavo
Gomez Lopez, a former president of the bank, and others were engaging in a
bitter exchange of public accusations and counter-claim over blame for
Latino's failure.
The Cisneros brothers deny any wrongdoing on their part or on the part of
their companies.
Venezuelans were surprised that the judge, Ms Diamora Ramirez de Simancas,
had ordered the arrest of wealthy and influential figures. Seldom in the
past have prominent Venezuelans been called to answer serious charges or
been held responsible for illegal activities.
What has not surprised them, however, is the fact that only one of the 83
has been arrested so far, and that many of the others are believed to have
left the country some time ago, despite government bans on international
travel.
President Rafael Caldera has promised to bring those responsible for the
disaster to justice, which would be immensely popular among a disaffected
population.
But whether a legal system implicated in corruption can deliver on the
promises of the president and a criminal judge remains to be seen.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Corruption drive on cards: American leaders urged to give
priority to crusade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin American leaders are expected to join President Bill Clinton in an
anti-corruption drive to be launched at the forthcoming Summit of the
Americas.
Mr Alberto Dahik, Ecuador's vice-president, has called on leaders of North
and Latin America to ensure that corruption, 'which has a direct impact on
democracy and economic development', be given priority at the planned
summit.
Mr Dahik is also chairman of the advisory council of Transparency
International, the Berlin-based body which campaigns against corruption in
international business transactions. His proposal, made after a meeting last
week of the group in Quito, Ecuador, already has White House support.
Leaders of the Group of Seven industrialised countries are also expected to
put corruption on their agenda at their meeting in Italy later this year.
A date for the Summit of the Americas, due to be held this year, has not
been fixed and the agenda is still fluid. The likely main topic will be the
extension of free trade through the western hemisphere.
The US administration is also anxious to use the summit to find ways to
improve the accountability and efficiency of government as well as reducing
corruption, but would prefer to see the issue raised as a Latin American
initi-ative.
The move comes amid growing concern about the impact of corruption on aid
and development, and efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Latin
America, Africa and elsewhere in the third world.
The US is almost alone among industrialised nations in outlawing the payment
of bribes in foreign countries. Its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act forbids
the making of illicit payments by US companies, a law seen by some US
businesses as weakening their ability to compete for international tenders
in some countries.
The US has in the past through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development tried to persuade other industrialised countries to follow
its example, with little success.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Mitchell sets sights on public service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Washington may still be digesting the impact of the stunning decision last
Friday of the Senate's most powerful Democrat not to seek re-election. But
Mr George Mitchell himself is portraying his decision as entirely logical
and personal.
In several interviews in his native Maine over the weekend the majority
leader, who is 60, confirmed that he could be interested in two new
challenges; as commissioner of baseball, a position that has been vacant for
two years, or as a judge on the US Supreme Court when the next opening
occurs, possibly later this year should a justice, most likely Mr Harry
Blackmun, retire.
But he denied he was pulling out of politics because firm private offers on
either score had been made to him. Instead, he maintained that: 'I never
intended to remain permanently in the Senate' and that 'at least for myself,
turnover in office is a healthy thing'.
He told the New York Times: 'I have not ruled out public service. In fact I
have specifically ruled it in.' He said the Senate had its frustrations, but
there had been 'great rewards' in the majority leader's role, which he has
held for six years.
The general consensus is that Mr Mitchell, appointed to the Senate in 1980
to fill the unexpired term of Mr Edmund Muskie when the latter became
secretary of state, has been an effective, if partisan, director of his
chamber, both in opposition to the policies of President George Bush and as
a proponent of President Bill Clinton.
When Mr Clinton took office, Mr Mitchell was instrumental in winning votes
on the budget and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
His departure does not make things easier for either the president or the
party. The most immediate consequence is to raise fresh doubts over the
Democratic 56-44 majority in the Senate. Mr Mitchell was considered certain
for re-election, but the early favourite to succeed him is Congresswoman
Olympia Snowe, the Republican and wife of Governor John McKernan.
Mr Mitchell is the eighth senator - and fifth Democrat - to announce
retirement plans this year.
Another senior Democratic senator, Mr David Boren of Oklahoma, is also
considering leaving to become head of the local state university.
Although there is no suggestion that Mr Mitchell will now devote any less
energy to Mr Clinton's legislative programme, the struggle to replace him
threatens to be a diversion in the coming months, since there is no clear
heir apparent.
The next-in-line in the Democratic hierarchy is Senator Wendell Ford of
Kentucky but interest has already been expressed by younger senators,
including Mr John Breaux of Louisiana, Mr Tom Daschle of South Dakota, and
Mr Jim Sasser of Tennessee. Mr David Pryor of Arkansas, long close to the
president, may also command support.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Wei Jingsheng, China's most famous dissident, left Beijing suddenly
yesterday, hours before he was scheduled to meet reporters, Reuter reports
from Beijing.
Mr Wei was expected to talk about his detention by police in a clampdown
before this week's visit to China by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state.
His abrupt disappearance came as the official Xinhua news agency accused him
of violating his parole and police extended their crackdown by taking away a
prominent student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.
Mr Wei's secretary told reporters the activist had left voluntarily. She
said she did not know if police had advised Mr Wei to leave for Mr
Christopher's visit, a tactic the authorities have used in the past at
sensitive times.
The sweep against more than a dozen prominent dissidents in Beijing and
Shanghai has cast a pall over Mr Christopher's visit to China, scheduled to
start on Friday.
Mr Christopher has said the issue of human rights was the top priority for
his visit, a last-ditch attempt to warn the Communist party it will lose
billions of dollars in trade with its key market unless it improves its
treatment of dissidents.
President Bill Clinton must decide by June whether to renew China's Most
Favoured Nation trading status. He has repeatedly stated he would only do so
if there was a 'significant overall improvement' in China's human rights
record.

<TEXT>
Japan's divided ruling coalition will this week hold an emergency cabinet
meeting in an attempt to decide market opening measures in response to the
latest increase in US trade pressure, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo.
This follows US President Bill Clinton's decision last week to revise the
Super 301 provision of US trade law, which gives the US power to impose
trade sanctions on countries unfairly impeding its exports. That was a
consequence of the deadlock between Washington and Tokyo on ways to reduce
Japan's trade surplus and increase demand for imports.
The Japanese government aims to take firm decisions on further steps to open
its market to imports by the end of March, said Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign
minister.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes rose yesterday for an amicable resolution to the storm over the Pergau
dam scheme, and the bar on British companies receiving Malaysian government
contracts, Our Foreign Staff writes.
In a television interview, the Malaysian High Commissioner in London, Mr Abu
Kamaradin, hinted that diplomatic exchanges were in progress. 'We are
talking to diplomatic channels and we have excellent contacts because of the
good relations over the years. Therefore we are quite confident that this
matter can be resolved amicably,' he said.
And in a letter to The Times newspaper today, Mr Khalid Jaafar, press
secretary to deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, writes that Kuala Lumpur
is not seeking an apology for British press reporting of the affair, only
'factual reporting'.
However, in Malaysia there was little indication of an early settlement of
the dispute.
Last night Mrs Rafidah Aziz, the minister of trade and industry, said the
British media had no right to meddle in the domestic affairs of other
countries. 'As long as the media there chooses to be arrogant and not face
reality, we will not award contracts to the British,' she said.
The minister added that Malaysia had nothing to lose by barring British
companies from seeking government contracts. But senior Malaysian officials
have privately expressed fears that a prolonged row with Britain could
damage the local economy.
Malaysia announced the ban in retaliation for what it said was 'the
patronising attitude and innuendoes' contained in British media reports. Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, the premier, was angered by a report that a British
construction company was prepared to offer him a bribe to win a contract.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Mandela calls for later registration deadline
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela said yesterday the deadline
for parties to register for South Africa's first all-race election should be
extended, after white right-wing groups reversed their earlier decision to
register for the poll.
Hard-line officials of the white, right-wing Afrikaner People's Front (AVF),
meeting Saturday in Pretoria, censured their moderate leader, General
Constand Viljoen, for registering a right-wing party for the election. He
registered an unknown party called the Freedom Front six minutes before the
midnight deadline on Friday. He was heavily outvoted in a meeting on
Saturday of the AVF executive, which declared a poll boycott.
Moderate members of the white Conservative Party present at the meeting
argued for election participation, but it was not clear whether they might
still break away and form an alternative right-wing grouping. They must
lodge a candidate list with the Independent Electoral Commission by
Wednesday, or the Freedom Front's registration will lapse.
Mr Mandela told supporters at an election rally in the northern Transvaal
town of Pietersburg that he would go down on his knees to persuade those
boycotting to take part. He said there would be no peace if some players
remained outside the election process, adding 'I am prepared to talk to
those who have refused to register. . . We must develop absolute patience
and the ability to understand the fears of others.'
He praised Gen Viljoen for his efforts to register a right-wing party,
saying: 'I am convinced he is genuine, with strength of character and
integrity.' This is praise which the general will scarcely welcome, given
charges from his own allies that he is too close to the ANC.
Merely extending the registration deadline, as suggested by Mr Mandela, is
unlikely to woo the white right to join the process. They are demanding a
white referendum to test support for their demand for an Afrikaner homeland.
At least 11 blacks were killed on Saturday night in the Bhambayi shack
settlement outside Durban in the latest round of political violence between
Inkatha and the ANC.

<TEXT>
Law enforcement officers from nine African countries are meeting in Nairobi
this week to create a regional task force to fight international crime
syndicates dealing in ivory, rhino horn, diamonds, arms and drugs.
'We need a highly mobile team of officers with the authority to operate
across borders to penetrate. . . increasingly sophisticated smuggling
networks,' says Lt Col Pieter Lategan of the South African police force's
Endangered Species Protection Unit.
'With an African task force, we could place wildlife traffickers under
surveillance as they move across borders, so that entire networks, and not
just individuals, could be apprehended,' he said.
Trafficking in wildlife is on the rise, and has become linked to illegal
trade in weapons and drugs across southern and eastern Africa. Mr Lategan's
unit impounded 2,200 tusks last year - hacked into 22,000 cubes to
facilitate smuggling - compared with 130 tusks in 1992.
Kenya seized more than 1,000 kg of ivory in 1993 in a case involving five
Koreans and one Ethiopian smuggler. Officials from Kenya's Wildlife Service,
who have won plaudits worldwide for their anti-poaching efforts, say they
need freedom to cross borders when pursuing poachers and smugglers. They
would also welcome extradition treaties to trap ring leaders of
international networks.
Zambia arrested 1,500 poachers in 1993 and seized more than 2,000 automatic
weapons. Uganda is concerned with the growing trade in chimpanzees and rare
birds. Swaziland says it has lost 60 per cent of its white rhino population
since poachers invaded the landlocked kingdom in 1988.
'Hardened criminals are what we are often up against,' says a Swazi police
officer. 'They deal not only in poaching, but in gun-running, drugs, grand
larceny and murder.'
Mozambique, which is emerging from a 17-year civil war, has become a
free-for-all for poaching gangs, including foreign armed forces who
regularly invade Mozambique from neighbouring countries. According to the
law enforcement officers at the Nairobi conference, it is known that
Zambians and Malawians hunt elephants in Tete province, while Tanzanians and
Somalis operate along the Rovuma river in northern Mozambique.
Officers believe an African Task Force would give them more power to address
corruption within their own customs, police and armed forces.
The delegates, from Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa,
Swaziland, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia hope the anti-smuggling task force
will be operational in 12 months.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Militant religious settlers in Hebron vowed a campaign of civil disobedience
yesterday after Israeli cabinet ministers said the government was
considering evacuating the 400 Jewish settlers who live in the West Bank
town.
Ministers said the cabinet could decide next Sunday whether to evacuate the
settlers from the heart of Hebron - a Palestine Liberation Organisation
demand for resuming peace talks after the Mosque massacre of worshippers by
a Jewish gunman 10 days ago.
Although ministers stressed that such a move would reflect government
security concerns for the settlers rather than a concession to the PLO, it
would be bound to provoke a storm of protest from right-wing settlers and
religious parties.
Rabbi Shlomo Goren, former chief army rabbi who last year told soldiers not
to obey orders to evacuate settlements, said settlers preferred to be killed
than leave Hebron. However, he also said Jewish settlers should not fire on
soldiers.
Up to 110,000 Palestinians live in Hebron, the burial place of the Biblical
patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, sacred to both Arab and Jew.
The PLO, which suspended peace talks after the massacre, says it would
return to negotiations only after Israel takes more measures to protect
Palestinian lives, disarm settlers and evacuate some ideological settlements
such as the ones in Hebron.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, who has so far ruled out
evacuating any settlements, drew fire yesterday from cabinet colleagues
opposed to his steps to broaden the coalition by including the far
right-wing Tsomet party.
The left-wing Meretz faction, Mr Rabin's most important coalition partner,
said they would quit the government if Tsomet joined. Political observers
said the Meretz ultimatum would effectively kill off Mr Rabin's overtures to
Tsomet, which is against evacuating settlements, the peace process and a
Palestinian state.
However, Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, said that, despite Meretz and
Labour party opposition, Mr Rabin would go ahead with negotiations with
Tsomet because it was vital to broaden the coalition during the current
crisis.
The International Monetary Fund has praised Israel's economic reform
programme as laying the conditions for sustainable growth but warned the
government against complacency over inflation.
In a report released yesterday, the IMF backs Israel's central bank which
has clashed with the finance ministry over increasing interest rates to meet
inflation targets.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Mercouri, fiery advocate of Greek heritage, dies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Melina Mercouri, a former film star and fiery Socialist politician who
twice served as Greece's culture minister, died yesterday in New York after
a long battle with lung cancer.
Ms Mercouri, 73, a former actress, entered politics after being stripped of
her Greek citizenship while in exile during the 1967-74 military
dictatorship, joining the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) when
democracy was restored in Greece.
As minister of culture in Greece's first socialist government in the 1980s,
Ms Mercouri was a passionate advocate for Greece's heritage. Her most widely
publicised campaign was for the return of the Parthenon Marbles, some of
Greece's finest classical sculptures, taken in the 19th century from the
temple on the Acropolis overlooking Athens and held by the British Museum.
She survived 14 government reshuffles, and despite poor health was
re-appointed culture minister when Pasok returned to power last October,
vowing to renew her campaign for the return of the mar-bles.
Greek state television prefaced the announcement of Ms Mercouri's death with
sombre music, replacing the evening news bulletin with clips from her
speeches at political rallies and from some of her 50-odd films.
Ms Mercouri, the daughter of a prominent Athenian political family, started
her acting career with Greece's National Theatre in the 1940s, but preferred
contemporary to classical roles, marking her first success in Tennessee
Williams' 'Streetcar Named Desire'.
Her film career took off in 1955, when she won the Best Actress award at the
Cannes film festival for her performance in 'Stella'. She was nominated for
an Academy award for 'Never on Sunday' in 1960, the film that brought her
international fame.
'Never on Sunday' in which Ms Mercouri played a warm-hearted prostitute from
Piraeus pursued by an American tourist - played by her husband, Jules Dassin
 -was believed in Athens to have done more than any official promotion to
make Greece a popular tourist destinat ion.
She claimed that it was pride in her Greek heritage that took her into
politics at that time. 'I'd be selfish, lazy and cowardly if I didn't feel
so passionately about Greece,' she once told an interviewer.
Ms Mercouri died in hospital in New York of a respiratory infection
following surgery for lung cancer.

United Nations officials intend to restore electricity and water supplies to
the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, but they urgently require more troops to
protect power plants and open roads into the city.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia,
yesterday said it was essential to build on the ceasefire through restoring
Sarajevo's essential services.
However, a UN official said the troops still had no mandate to demilitarise
the city and did not yet control all entry and exit routes, which in most
cases were controlled by Bosnian Serb patrols.
Mr Akashi has already said his forces require at least 4,000 troops for
Sarajevo. Britain has indicated it would send more if supported by other
countries.
Meanwhile in Vienna, Bosnian Croat and Bosnian Moslem officials, along with
Croat officials, will today continue talks aimed at deciding how to
implement the complex federal and confederal plan agreed in Washington last
week.
Bosnian Croat forces yesterday started withdrawing heavy weapons from
south-west Bosnia a day ahead of the deadline agreed as part of the plan.
The plan envisages the creation of a Bosnian Croat and Moslem federation in
part of Bosnia, loosely linked to Croatia through a confederal structure.
A transitional committee, comprising representatives from Zagreb and the
Croat and Moslem-held territories of Bosnia-Hercegovina will negotiate until
March 15 and seek agreement on four issues:
The constitution of the federation;
The relationship between the confederation and the proposed federation;
Military arrangements in the federation;
The creation of governmental/administrative structures for the confederation
and the federation.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the
Bosnian Serbs, have yet to decide whether to join the new federal structure
for Bosnia.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Fyodorov predicts action by Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russian president Boris Yeltsin would use his extensive presidential powers
to rescue the economy if the inflation rate accelerated out of control, Mr
Boris Fyodorov, the former minister of finance, has predicted.
Suggesting that inflation would rise to 30 per cent a month by the autumn,
rather than the 10 per cent targeted by the government, Mr Fyodorov
indicated that the outcome would probably be a return to reformist
government.
Mr Fyodorov, speaking in London on Friday, said he did not believe in a
disaster scenario, since Mr Yeltsin would take a grip of things. The future
for Russia was going to be one of muddling through, not one in which an
extremist 'clown' took power.
However, in a country of 'geniuses and future presidents' it was difficult
to obtain co-operation among reformers, he said. His own December 12 group
could co-operate with Mr Yegor Gaidar on virtually all issues. He would also
co-operate with Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, a presidential candidate, if possible.
But there were a dozen people in Russia's Choice with whom he would find it
difficult to work.
Nevertheless, the former finance minister was worried about the political
confrontation looming between president and parliament.
Unrest might come to a head with demonstrations on May 1, which would have
to be firmly handled by the authorities in Moscow.

<TEXT>
Spain and Norway yesterday dug deeper into their already entrenched
positions on access to Norwegian cod, as the European Union struggled for a
formula to permit Norway to settle EU membership terms.
Mr Javier Solana, Spain's foreign minister, warned on Spanish television
that Madrid would veto Norway's entry unless Spain recovered its 'historic'
rights' to fish in Norwegian waters.
Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, Norway's foreign minister, said on arrival in Brussels
for the final three days of membership negotiations with the EU that Spain's
demands for an extra 14,000 tonnes of Norwegian cod were 'out of the
question.'
He pointed out that as part of the negotiations leading to this year's
European Economic Area (EEA) free trade zone Norway ceded to the EU about
51,000 tonnes of cod - including an extra 11,000 tonnes by 1997 for the
poorest EU member states, some half of which is earmarked for Spain.
This last quota would lapse if Norway entered the Union next year and its
'consolidation' as a permanent quota might provide the only possible area
for compromise in the talks.
The whole EU enlargement exercise could, however, grind to a halt if Spain
and the UK continue to insist that their voting weight inside the 12-member
Union be kept unchanged in a Union of 16 members. The EU will try to resolve
this issue at a foreign ministers' meeting tonight.

FT  07 MAR 94 / EU to boost Ukraine trade pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union is to offer Ukraine a more generous political and trade
agreement in an effort to bolster the country's moderate political groups
ahead of its elections later this month.
A meeting of European foreign ministers in Brussels today is expected to
give the European Commission a mandate to conclude the deal, which is
similar to the partnership agreement concluded with Russia earlier this
year.
The deal promises greater political co-operation and contains a commitment
to discuss the establishment of a free trade zone by 1998. However, it falls
considerably short of the partnership deals offered to the Baltic states and
eastern Europe, and, in contrast to the deal now agreed with Russia, gives
no endorsement of Ukraine's economic reform.
Commission officials said the omission was intended to signal EU concerns
about the limited nature of Ukraine's economic reforms, and put pressure on
Ukraine's leadership to act more decisively.
But the omission has angered Ukrainian officials, who insist there is no
reason to treat Ukraine differently from Russia. 'It is not fair to label us
a country that does not want to change. We consider we are an economy in
reform,' said Mr Volodymyr Vassylenko, Ukrainian ambassador to the EU.
He added that Ukraine was hoping that closer ties with the EU could help
defuse tensions with Russia over regional issues such as Crimea. 'We want
the EU to recognise that Crimea is Ukrainian territory and send a clear
signal to Russia to that effect,' he said. But EU officials have so far
responded with caution to suggestions that the EU could act as a mediator in
the dispute over the Crimea.
However, coming after a year in which EU ministers have paid scant attention
to Ukraine, the agreement highlights a new attempt, led largely by the
German and French, to bolster EU links. This shift has been triggered by
growing concerns about Ukraine's economic instability and nuclear arsenal,
and by growing doubts about the reliability of Russia as a partner.
'The members states of the EU are more interested now in the Ukraine than
they have been for a long time,' said a diplomat in Brussels. 'They want to
do something for the Ukraine because it is starting to co-operate over
nuclear weapons.'
The EU is also considering opening talks with Moldova, Belarus and
Kazakhstan with a view to offering similar agreements.
A Ukrainian delegation is due in Brussels later this week for a final round
of talks on the agreement, which will also set up a framework for market
access talks to cover areas such as steel, coal and agriculture.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Italian environmentalists claimed at the weekend that the country's first
onshore oil well blow-out had caused an ecological disaster and wiped out at
least a year's rice production in the area, writes John Simkins.
Agip, the oil exploration company controlled by the state-owned Eni group,
has commissioned the Battelle Institute of Geneva to analyse the damage
caused by the spill last week at its Trecate-Villa Fortuna oilfield near
Novara, about 40km west of Milan, and advise on cleaning up. Trecate
provides half of Italy's annual crude oil production and 5 per cent of
consumption in a country heavily dependent on imports. Agip made the well
safe at the weekend.
Mr Roberto Gazzola, of the environmental group Legambiente, said: 'We
believe the damage is even more serious than it appears. It is possible the
oil has permeated the earth's water-bearing stratum and seeped into the
Ticino river.'

Poland's 1994 budget was passed at the weekend by the Sejm, parliament's
more important chamber, as the Solidarity trade union prepared for a
campaign of protest strikes due to start today, writes Christopher Bobinski
from Warsaw.
The budget, which is in tune with IMF guidelines, opens the way to new
standby credits and a 20 per cent reduction of Poland's Dollars 33bn (Pounds
22.6bn) debt to western governments. It won the overwhelming support of the
governing coalition parties despite initial demands from individual deputies
that spending restrictions be eased.
Solidarity, which is planning to disrupt rail services and power and
telecommunications links over the next few days, is demanding that controls
on wages be eased and the scale of planned energy price rises reduced. The
government led by Mr Waldemar Pawlak is now expected to nominate Mr Dariusz
Rosati, an economist in his late 40s who is a specialist in foreign trade
issues, as the new finance minister and deputy premier responsible for the
economy.
Mr Rosati's views on the economy are similar to those of Mr Marek Borowski,
his predecessor who drafted this year's stringent budget.

FT  07 MAR 94 / British Steel to seek pledge on industry support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel has proposed that European industry ministers make a solemn
pledge at their next meeting in April not to sanction any further subsidies
in the steel industry as a way of resolving the sector's crisis, writes Hugo
Dixon.
Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel's chairman, said he would then be prepared to
take part in an industry-wide restructuring scheme being brokered by the
European Commission. British Steel and other private-sector steel groups
have been refusing to take part in the scheme following the decision by
industry ministers to approve Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.3bn) in aid to several
state-owned steel groups last December.
The scheme envisages non-aided companies cutting up to 25m tonnes of
capacity to bring demand and supply for steel into balance. Mr Moffat vowed
to continue his boycott of the scheme if there was no pledge to curb future
subsidies. He said that without such assurance, he would also not attend a
meeting between the Commission and European steel chiefs scheduled for March
23.
British Steel accepts that it will be impossible to unravel December's deal
on subsidies. But it is trying to build up support for a total ban on any
more being granted.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Rousselet plans libel writ against minister
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andre Rousselet, the French businessman who last month resigned as
chairman of the Canal-Plus television group, plans to sue Mr Alain Carignon,
the communications minister, for libel.
Canal-Plus, one of Europe's most successful pay-TV companies, has been
clouded by controversy since Mr Rousselet's resignation, with some analysts
saying it has lost considerable independence. Mr Rousselet, one of the most
influential figures in European media and a close friend of Mr Francois
Mitterrand, the socialist French president, founded the company 10 years
ago.
He resigned in protest at the formation of a concert party to take control
of Canal-Plus by its largest shareholders, all of which were privatised by
France's last right-wing government.
Mr Rousselet has since publicly accused Mr Edouard Balladur, the
conservative prime minister, of orchestrating a campaign against him.
Mr Rousselet said at the weekend that he planned to pursue a civil libel
suit against Mr Carignon over remarks about Mr Rousselet's role in
broadcasting appointments in the early 1980s, when he was head of President
Mitterrand's private office. He also plans to sue Mr Philippe Alexandre, a
prominent French political commentator, over comments on Mr Rousselet's
personal wealth. The libel suits should ensure that the row over Mr
Rousselet's resignation stays in the limelight.
The concert party has raised important questions about the future
relationship between the French government and industry at a time when the
Balladur government is pursuing an ambitious privatisation programme.
Until recently most French companies in 'sensitive' sectors such as
broadcasting have been state controlled, and governments have openly
intervened in management and personnel issues, notably in the appointment of
the chairman.
But in theory the state should have no influence over the affairs of a
private sector company such as Canal-Plus, which is publicly quoted with a
large part of its equity owned by companies in related industries that act
as noyaux durs or 'hard core' investors.
The Balladur government is now introducing noyaux durs to the companies
being sold in its privatisation drive. These hard core investors tend to be
companies sympathetic to the aims of the Balladur administration.
Mr Rousselet's conspiracy allegations have fuelled fears among international
investors that future French governments could use the noyaux durs
indirectly to influence the affairs of private-sector companies.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Germany's big guns pull back: Compromises that won a wage
deal and averted a strike in industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first hint of a breakthrough in the hard-fought pay round for Germany's
3.6m engineering workers came in the early hours of Saturday morning, in the
unlikely surroundings of Hanover's city press club.
Five leaders of IG Metall, the mighty engineering workers' union, and six
from Gesamtmetall, the employers' federation, had been sitting around the
table since 6pm, looking for ways of heading off the first strike in west
German industry since 1984.
At the heart of the deal was a proposed trade-off between guarantees of job
security, and more flexible working hours. At 1am the negotiators broke to
report back for the second time to their national executive committees,
waiting patiently in nearby conference rooms.
'The whole package is back on the table,' one official whispered. 'It looks
as if they are getting somewhere.'
It took almost seven hours more, but at breakfast time the two sides were
able to announce, with visible relief, that a deal was done.
'We have been able to prove that national collective bargaining has a
future,' said Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, the tough-talking employers'
leader, whose determination to get real cost cuts for his members took the
pay round to the brink of collapse. 'We, as well as IG Metall, want to carry
on working with such national agreements.'
On the face of it, both sides had to give up a lot of their demands.
The employers wanted a 10 per cent cost cut. They served notice of
termination of the current agreement on holiday pay and conditions. They
wanted individual enterprises to have more freedom to do plant-level deals
on longer working hours.
The union wanted guarantees of job security, and preservation of real
incomes. The pay claim was for 5.5-6 per cent, and it wanted a new deal to
cut working hours as an alternative to redundancies in recession-hit
enterprises.
Neither side got what it wanted.
The pay deal this year amounts to an effective pay freeze: the 2 per cent
increase from June 1 - five months late - amounts to about 1.16 per cent
over the full year. But other fringe benefits have been reduced by 10 per
cent for the year, and then tied to the pre-June pay scales for 1995 and
1996. A 10 percentage point increase in Christmas pay has been postponed.
Holiday pay has been reinstated, but at the old rates.
Mr Gottschol says that means no overall increase in company wage bills. With
increased productivity, that does mean cost cuts - although scarcely of 10
per cent.
The union won a deal on shorter working hours for crisis-hit plants. But
only one option provides for guarantees of no redundancy.
According to that model, an entire company can opt for shorter working hours
 -say 30 hours a week instead of the current 36 hours - as an alternative to
job cuts, if it is facing a slump in demand. The workers will lose a full
six hours' pay, but they will not lose their jobs.
The alternative model agreed is for companies where only specific sections
are operating under capacity. Then shorter hours can be introduced where
needed, but the employees will not suffer a corresponding pay cut: they will
get partial compensation for loss of earnings, but there will be no formal
guarantee of no job cuts.
Where German employers are facing a temporary slump in demand because of the
recession, the models may prove attractive as an alternative to expensive
redundancy packages. But they do not answer the problems of those companies
losing export markets because of their high unit wage costs.
Mr Walter Riester, the deputy leader of IG Metall who negotiated the
package, said the deal amounted to a new option for flexibility in the
national wage contract for recession-hit companies.
It does not amount to the sort of flexibility many employers were seeking,
to shift the real focus of wage deals from the national to the plant level.
Indeed, it amounts in effect to a reprieve for national collective
bargaining at a moment when the system was under enormous pressure.
Mr Gottschol and Mr Klaus Zwickel, his IG Metall counterpart, were obviously
content. But the real test of the system will depend on whether the latest
package answers the real structural problems of the industry, and not just
the need for a temporary pay freeze.

Strains between right-wing allies contesting this month's Italian elections
burst into the open at the weekend with an attack on the Forza Italia party
of Mr Silvio Berlusconi by Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern
League.
Opinion polls suggest about 40 per cent of decided voters will back the
right wing in the March 27 poll, in opposition to a broad-left alliance led
by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left. However, Mr Bossi is
concerned that the emergence of Forza Italia is taking away votes from the
Northern League, which won nearly 9 per cent of the national vote in 1992
and had 79 MPs in both houses.
At a rally in Florence Mr Bossi said that Forza Italia had been created by
the former Christian Democrats (now the Popular party) 'to take votes from
the League and create a moderate grouping in order to recycle the old
political class'. In a play of words he also referred to 'Sforza Italia'
(Italian strain) and 'Falsa Italia' (False Italy).
Italian newspapers reported yesterday that Mr Bossi had also written to
League officials directing them not 'to support or put forward Forza Italia
candidates in any way at all'.
Mr Bossi was even more forthright in Florence about Mr Gianfranco Fini's
National Alliance, formerly the neo-fascist MSI, with which Forza Italia has
a technical alliance on division of seats. He said Mr Fini would not win
votes in the north, which has 'been traditionally anti-fascist'.
Mr Berlusconi responded to Mr Bossi's remarks with an appeal for unity on
the Italian right. 'Our partners' candidates are of the same flesh and blood
as us. They must be treated like our candidates,' he told a rally in
Florence.
Mr Berlusconi called on the members of the so-called Freedom Alliance to
'overcome selfishness and small-mindedness'.

FT  07 MAR 94 / Heseltine initiative seeks to help UK groups compete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is planning an ambitious
framework to co-ordinate government policies which could improve the
competitiveness of British companies.
He is drawing up a white paper on industrial performance which will cut
across several Whitehall departments. It is designed to give the Department
of Trade and Industry a bigger role in formulating policy.
While the paper has been planned for several months, the scope of its remit
may be seen as the latest attempt to raise Mr Heseltine's profile in the
event that the government's low standing in the opinion polls prompts a
leadership election.
Mr Heseltine yesterday made it clear, however, he did not believe there
would be a vacancy. After a week in which he distanced himself from
government policy over arms exports to Iraq, being investigated by the Scott
inquiry, and delivered a barnstorming speech to the Commons, Mr Heseltine
insisted: 'I believe John Major will lead us to win the next election and my
position is entirely that of a loyal member of his cabinet helping him to do
it.'
Mr Heseltine's decision to address issues such as long-term financing for
companies, education, training and infrastructure funding has irritated some
senior officials in other departments.
They have insisted the DTI should submit its paper to the cabinet office,
which has set up a committee representing civil servants from affected
departments. Nonetheless, Mr Heseltine has made it clear he has strong
backing from Mr Major and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
While the paper is yet to be drafted, those involved in its preparation have
begun to focus on what they call 'factors of productivity' which influence
corporate competitiveness.
Mr Heseltine's advisers are understood to believe the City, for example,
does not provide companies with adequate long-term finance. The paper will
argue the government should build on the 1980s approach of privatisation and
deregulation by developing policies to support British companies in the
1990s.
His advisers are also looking at whether a single Whitehall department
should take responsibility for vocational and academic qualifications.
The paper will not be published until the Commons trade and industry
committee completes its own study into Britain's competitiveness, which is
not expected until the end of the month.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
who first called for the white paper, said: 'The white paper is a one-shot
opportunity for the government to demonstrate its coherence in its approach
to economic policies.'

FT  07 MAR 94 / EU may seek faster integration of east bloc: Fear of Russian
nationalism prompts shift in stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union is fundamentally reassessing policy towards the former
communist countries of eastern Europe, with Germany pressing for their
faster integration with the west and future EU membership.
The reassessment, strongly supported by the US, is being driven by fears
about Russian nationalism and the risk that Moscow might seek to reclaim its
sphere of influence in eastern Europe, according to senior diplomats in
Brussels.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is also moving
towards the concept of a 'wider Europe,' modifying his emphasis on deepening
integration among the 12.
The results of the policy review will emerge over the next few months,
particularly when Germany takes over the rotating EU presidency from Greece
in July. But the broad outlines are already apparent.
European foreign ministers in Brussels will today consider an Anglo-Italian
plan allowing formal co-operation at international conferences and 'joint
foreign policy actions' between the EU and the six 'associate' EU member
states - Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and
Romania.
The Anglo-Italian plan is likely to be followed by selective offers of
associate membership of the Western European Union, the EU's emerging
defence arm.
Brussels is watching closely to see how Russia will respond in the light of
its rejection of Nato membership for Poland and other former communist
satellites.
The European Commission is also conducting a wide-ranging review of trade,
aid, competition policy and the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy
in relation to eastern Europe.
Mr Delors will chair a Commission brainstorming session on March 23, with
several new ideas under review. They include:
An end to export subsidies for EU farmers sending produce into eastern
Europe. In a little-noticed action, the Commission agreed temporarily to
stop export restitutions for apples entering the Czech Republic this year.
But officials say more needs to be done to prevent highly competitive
western farmers wiping out east European agriculture. An overhaul of the
Phare aid programme, which has pumped around Ecu1bn (Pounds 750m) of
technical aid into eastern Europe over the past four years. Officials say
aid needs to be channelled into infrastructure spending, more on the lines
of the EU's own 'structural funds' budget.
A drive to persuade the former communist countries to copy EU competition
law and harmonise regulations. A new 'competition area' could defuse
disputes over state aid in eastern Europe, reducing the risk of the EU
invoking anti-dumping actions.
Although welcome, these moves may not satisfy the east Europeans,
particularly Poland and Hungary. Hungary last week signalled that it intends
to apply for formal membership next month with the goal of opening
negotiations in 1996-97.

FT  07 MAR 94 / White House 'cover-up' fears: Gore concedes officials made
'mistakes' over Whitewater affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's Whitewater problems hit dangerously close to home
yesterday as the focus shifted on to the role of his wife and whether the
White House has engaged in a classic 'cover-up'.
The complex and dimly understood Arkansas land and financial dealings in the
1980s claimed their first definitive victim over the weekend, with the
resignation, effective next month, of Mr Bernard Nussbaum, the president's
widely criticised legal counsel.
His resignation came just a day after the special counsel probing the
Whitewater property venture affair, Mr Robert Fiske, issued subpoenas to 10
White House and Treasury officials, including Mr Nussbaum and Mr Roger
Altman, the deputy Treasury Secretary.
Mr Fiske is seeking details of three meetings held in recent months between
the officials to discuss the status of regulatory investigations into the
failed Madison savings and loan institution at the heart of the Whitewater
affair.
Congressional Republicans have charged that the meetings were improper.
Yesterday, vice-president Al Gore put up a vigorous televised defence of the
president and First Lady, Hillary Clinton. He conceded that 'mistakes' had
been made by White House officials, but said new instructions from the
president created 'new fire walls' between the White House and other
government departments.
He promised the 'highest ethical standards' in the future, insisting that
'no credible allegations' of impropriety had been lodged against the
Clintons and that 'no one can now doubt the independence of Mr Fiske'.
Mr Gore also dismissed as 'a cartoon image' reports in the US press
yesterday that the White House was in a state of gloom and despair over the
latest developments, with one unnamed senior official quoted as saying that
this was 'a perilous time' for this presidency.
Mr Gore accused the Republican party of partisan exploitation of the issue.
This was not surprising, he said, because the president was doing so well on
issues such as the economy.
A flavour of the Republican attack was immediately provided in another TV
interview by Senator Phil Gramm, the Republican from Texas, who came close
to suggesting Mr Clinton could be forced from office - he denied he meant
impeachment - if he did not 'begin by levelling with the American public'.
The likelihood of a congres-sional investigation into Whitewater,
supplementary to Mr Fiske's, is also increasing, with some Democrats now
joining the Republican clamour for hearings.
Yesterday even Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, who is generally supportive of
Mr Clinton, refused to exclude looking into the role of the Treasury, over
which his ways and means committee has jurisdiction.
The implication of Mrs Clinton in the affair has less to do with her carving
out a new policy role in the White House than with her past associations as
a partner in the influential Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, through which
much Arkansas state business passed.
Two other former partners are much in the news. The circumstances of the
suicide last summer of Mr Vincent Foster, then Mr Nussbaum's deputy,
continue to attract interest.
Mr Webster Hubbell, now associate attorney general, is reportedly being
questioned by Rose itself over past billing practices.
The quality of the White House staff, many of them old friends of the
Clintons, is also under fire. Mr Nussbaum, a former Wall Street lawyer, had
seemed error-prone, especially in vetting candidates for senior
administration posts and allegedly interfering with judicial processes over
Whitewater and the Foster suicide.

FT  07 MAR 94 / German pay deal averts threat of strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HANOVER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes for a round of low wage deals for German industry and the public
sector rose sharply at the weekend, after a last-minute pay settlement
headed off the threat of an engineering industry strike from today.
Agreement on an effective pay freeze for the 3.6m engineering workers was
reached on Saturday morning, after more than 13 hours of negotiations
through the night between trade union and employers' leaders.
The deal was welcomed yesterday as a clear signal to 3.5m public sector
workers, whose next round of pay negotiations opens on Wednesday, to accept
a low pay settlement. Their employers in the federal, state and local
governments want an outright pay freeze. Banking workers, printers and
construction workers are also in the pay queue.
The engineering workers will get a 2 per cent pay rise from June 1 - five
months late - but see a 10 per cent reduction in other fringe benefits for
the rest of the year. The wage rise amounts to an increase of 1.16 per cent
for the full year, but the net effect, according to the employers, is a zero
increase in wage bills.
A promised rise in Christmas pay has been postponed for a year, and fringe
benefits will be calculated at the current rate until 1996.
The deal also includes an agreement providing for shorter working hours in
companies facing a temporary slump in demand, as an alternative to job cuts.
Individual plants can negotiate a shorter working week within the national
agreement.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, the leader of IG Metall, the engineering workers' union,
said the deal was a trade-off between pay and job security.
'We decided to trade job security against money,' he said. 'In return for
these successes (on job security) we have been skinned on the wage increase.
It did not come easy.'
The deal on working hours does not amount to the full flexibility sought by
employers, who wanted to allow individual enterprises to negotiate longer or
shorter hours according to their needs. It only provides for shorter working
hours for those with severe overcapacity.
The agreement means that the strike by almost 11,000 engineering workers in
the state of Lower Saxony, due to begin at 6am today, has been called off,
although the workers will have to confirm the decision in another ballot.
The other 13 wage districts in west Germany must confirm the agreement
individually.
Warning strikes by public sector workers will go ahead today and the banking
unions plan similar action later in the week.
However, the deal will greatly increase the pressure on the public sector
unions to settle close to the nominal pay freeze sought by their employers.

FT  05 MAR 94 / US trade law move on Japan sparks fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US decision to reactivate its Super 301 trade law provision, opening the
way for sanctions against Japan, was greeted with concern in Asia and Europe
yesterday.
It sparked anxiety in South Korea and Australia, both of which feared a
setback to free trade. The revival of Super 301 was 'regrettable at a time
when countries are expected to engage in more liberal trade', said a Seoul
government spokesman. He said trade disputes should be settled under the
World Trade Organisation, to be set up as the successor to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, not by the 'domestic legal procedures of one
nation'.
Mr Bob McMullan, the Australian trade minister, warned: 'We don't support
the US opening up the Japanese market in a unilateral and retaliatory way.'
Mr Jeffrey Garten, US undersecretary of commerce for international trade,
who has just taken a two-week trip through the region, told Asian leaders US
problems with Japan 'were quite unique'.
In Japan, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said unilateral
trade action against another country would be contrary to WTO rules. But
Tokyo recognised 'the need for a restrained response', he said. Japan would
continue to work on plans to open markets. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime
minister, promised to redouble efforts to cut regulatory trade barriers.
In Europe Sir Leon Brittan, European Union chief trade negotiator, was
disappointed at the renewal of the provision allowing the US to single out
countries for sanctions. 'The European Union will be examining the import of
these measures very carefully,' he said.
However Mr David Woods, spokesman for Gatt, the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade said yesterday that the reinstatement of Super 301 should be
viewed with 'a sense of proportion'. It should not be assumed that a trade
war was bound to would follow.

FT  05 MAR 94 / China MFN chances weakened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's arrest of a prominent dissident yesterday cast a shadow over the
visit to Beijing next week by Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of
State, and further weakened the chances that the US will extend China's most
favoured nation trading privileges.
Mr Wei Jingsheng, who was released last September after 14 years in prison,
was detained yesterday after meeting with the US's top human rights envoy
and just one week before Mr Christopher's arrival.
Chinese officials also confirmed the detention of three other dissidents.
The State Department refused to make any immediate comment on the arrest of
Mr Wei, who was a leader of the Democracy Wall movement in 1978-79 and is
probably the Chinese dissident who is best known outside China.
President Bill Clinton last year extended China's MFN status for one year,
on condition that it meet US demands for free emigration, put an end to the
use of prison labour in exported goods, and make progress in other areas
such as the release of political prisoners, the protection of Tibetan
culture and allowing outside radio broadcasts.
While Clinton administration officials have indicated some encouragement at
the steps the Chinese government was taking, they have also repeatedly
warned that China has not yet done enough to fend off revocation of MFN in
June.
'There already has been some progress in recent months. There has got to be
more, and this is going to have to involve actions as well as pledges,' said
Mr Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs.
Mr John Shattuck, the State Department's human rights envoy, met last week
with Mr Wei, whose arrest appeared to come in response to his comments to Mr
Shattuck on the need for the US to maintain a tough line on human rights.
Before leaving China for Hong Kong yesterday Mr Shattuck said he was
disturbed by the reports of new detentions, and again called on the Chinese
government 'to release those who have been incarcerated solely for the
peaceful expression of their views.'
US officials accompanying Mr Shattuck had earlier been encouraged by hints
that China was considering abolishing the law against 'counter-revolution'
under which most political dissidents have been imprisoned.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Estonia pullout pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moscow yesterday confirmed its intention to pull out troops from Estonia by
the agreed date of August 31 - but only if a dispute over the fate of 10,000
Russian military veterans were settled to its satisfaction, writes John
Lloyd.
On Wednesday Russia had said it did not intend to stand by its promise to
pull out the 2,600 troops.
Estonia has so far been determined not to pay social security to the army
pensioners. It claims most of them are not - as Moscow says - elderly, but
are young/middle-aged ex-counterintelligence or airborne troops who pose a
security threat to the state.
Sweden and Denmark have come out strongly in support of a pullout by August
31. Denmark's Foreign Ministry said yesterday that it planned to raise the
issue with its European Union partners in talks next week.

FT  05 MAR 94 / South Africa's right wing registers for polls

<TEXT>
Conservative Zulu and Afrikaner political leaders last night registered for
South Africa's April elections just ahead of a midnight deadline, reversing
an earlier decision to boycott the poll and reducing the chances of
widespread violence during the campaign.
But both the Freedom Front and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party of Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi stressed their decision was 'provisional', and that
they would withdraw from the poll if their constitutional demands were not
met through international mediation or negotiation.
White right-wing leader Gen Constand Viljoen registered a previously unknown
party called the 'Freedom Front' just 15 minutes before the deadline. Two
hours earlier, Chief Buthelezi had registered his Inkatha Freedom Party for
the April 26-28 all-race election.
Gen Viljoen heads a white right umbrella body called the Afrikaner
Volksfront, which includes moderate Afrikaners as well as hard-right groups
such as the Conservative party and the paramilitary Afrikaner Resistance
Movement (AWB). It was not clear last night whether the Conservative party
was included in the Freedom Front, as its leader Ferdi Hartzenberg had said
earlier in the day his party would not register.
The emergence of the Freedom Front could mark a split in the white right,
with moderate CP members of parliament, eager to participate in the poll,
siding with Gen Viljoen against their hardline leader.
If Mr Hartzenberg does decide to stay out of the new Front, its chances
could be weakened. Without the Conservative party's seasoned political
machine, the Front would struggle to mount a campaign for elections now only
seven weeks away.
Gen Viljoen defended his decision to register, saying the Afrikaners'
freedom to exercise strategic options 'would be severely restricted if we
did not register provisionally'. But he noted: 'Due to the limited time
available, this decision could not be approved in advance by the Afrikaner
Volksfront.'
The right's decision to register could mean a move away from confrontation,
although it has set many conditions including international mediation.
The ANC is understood to be considering former Nigerian head of state
Olusegun Obasanjo and former British ambassador to South Africa, Sir Robin
Renwick, as possible mediators.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Despatches: Confucius or convenience? - Asian leaders say
their ideology must be taken seriously by the west, but critics say the
philosophy is cynically self-serving

Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad has asked Malaysians not to accept
western-style democracy as it could result in negative effects. The prime
minister said such an extreme principle had caused moral decay, homosexual
activities, single parents and economic slowdown because of poor work
ethics.
 - Voice of Malaysia radio 29 May 1993
A resurgent Asia is spurning the dogma of western liberalism and forging for
itself a new and improved set of political and social beliefs, if we are to
believe east Asian leaders such as Dr Mahathir, the Malaysian prime
minister.
Trumpeted across the region as 'The Asian Way', this emerging ideology is
loosely based on the teachings of Confucius, who championed family values
and respect for authority 2,500 years before John Major. Not all supporters
of the Asian way claim that democracy makes you decadent and gay, but they
reject many of the western liberal democratic ideas that seemed poised to
dominate the world after the collapse of European communism in the 1980s.
In speeches and newspaper columns throughout Asia, the neo-Confucianists
argue that authoritarian governments such as China's are acceptable, even
essential, because discipline is necessary to bring prosperity to developing
countries. Full democracy as understood in the west would lead to chaos.
Freedom of expression is undesirable, the argument continues, because it
encourages instability and could provoke conflict between ethnic groups. The
rights of individuals must be respected only insofar as they do not impinge
on the greater rights of the community as a whole; in Asia, says Anwar
Ibrahim, Mahathir's deputy, there is none of the 'corrosive individualism'
found in the west.
The Asian way is pragmatic. Asians reach agreement by consensus, rather than
through the open and sometimes damaging confrontation of opposing views
favoured in the west. The Asian way is applicable in domestic politics, in
foreign policy and in business, and it should be accepted by the west; the
west should stop arrogantly trying to impose inappropriate western standards
of human rights, democracy and environmental protection on Asia, especially
since Asia is on the rise and the west is declining as the 'Pacific century'
approaches.
International British businesses are by now painfully aware of their
country's new-found notoriety as an offender against the Asian way.
First the British government angered Beijing with its attempts to introduce
a limited democracy to Hong Kong before the colony was absorbed by China in
1997. Now the British press has offended Malaysia by investigating
allegations of corruption and mismanagement involving British companies and
the governments of both countries.
The recent popularisation of the Asian way doctrine has been assured by the
economic success and resulting boost to the self-confidence of authoritarian
east Asian governments. Perhaps it was not surprising that Mahathir should
use an economic weapon to punish the British, barring British companies from
Malaysian government contracts and depriving them of up to Pounds 4bn of
expected business.
Already the Asian way (or its local variants: the 'Thai way', the
'Indonesian way' and so on) is a phrase blithely used by diplomats,
businessmen and politicians - Asian and western - to explain anything about
Asia they do not understand or do not want to discuss further, including
corruption.
But does the Asian way really exist as something separate? Do ordinary
Asians believe in it?
Leave aside for a moment the obvious objection that Indian democracy and
Vietnamese communism, Thai corruption and Singaporean government
incorruptibility, Malaysia's controlled media and the Philippines' free
press, are all 'Asian' but all as different from each other as chalk from
cheese.
Consider instead whether the philosophy can shed any light on the present
confrontation between Britain and Malaysia, whose government vigorously
promotes the Asian way and bitterly resents what it sees as the racism and
arrogance of the west.
'We believe the foreign media must learn the fact that developing countries,
including a country led by a brown Moslem, have the ability to manage their
own affairs successfully,' said Anwar in announcing the sanctions against
Britain.
If Asia was indeed the scene of a clash between western and Asian values,
one would expect to find the westerners ranged on one side and the Asians on
the other.
The reality is that the British and Malaysian governments, and British and
Malaysian big businesses, are united in their horror at the substance and
impact of the revelations by the British media: so far, these show that
there was a link between Pounds 234m in British aid for the Pergau
hydroelectric dam in Malaysia and a Pounds 1bn package of British arms
sales, and that the dam project was uneconomic and therefore harmful to
British taxpayers and Malaysian electricity consumers alike; they also
allege that British companies were prepared to bribe Malaysian officials,
including Mahathir.
Just as there are illiberal Britons who agree with Mahathir that such
reports should never have been published, so there are many liberal
Malaysians who would like a free press and who believe that corruption
charges should be investigated. Lim Kit Siang, the Malaysian opposition
leader, said the sanctions would be seen as 'an attempt at a cover-up' and
as 'self-serving'.
The philosophy of the Asian way is used to justify not only the existence of
relatively benign Asian governments such as Malaysia's - dubbed 'soft
authoritarianism' by political scientists - but also the repressive actions
of anti-democratic groups such as the Burmese junta. Its soldiers killed
hundreds of civilians, and it refused to accept the results of an election
in which its opponents won four-fifths of the seats.
This has given rise to suspicions among Asian liberals that the Asian way is
a pretext for existing Asian governments to stay in power rather than a
coherent ideology to explain the supposedly unique social and political
values of Asian people.
To some Asians, a 'consensus' merely means the view of whoever is in charge.
For every Asian who attributes success in, say, Singapore, to
authoritarianism, it is possible to find another who attributes failure in,
say, Burma, to the same thing.
The favourite butt of Asian authoritarians such as Lee Kuan Yew, the
Singaporean leader and father-figure of neo-Confucianism, is the
Philippines, where the undoubtedly unproductive bickering and lobbying of
US-style democracy is regarded as the reason for the country's inability to
match the economic performance of its south-east Asian neighbours.
But Filipino democrats protest that 13 years of dictatorship by the late
Ferdinand Marcos ruined their country. When Lee told Filipino businessmen
that they needed discipline more than democracy, president Fidel Ramos
replied: 'This prescription fails to consider our ill-fated flirtation with
authoritarianism not so long ago.'
One of the main weaknesses of the Asian way is that it is often portrayed as
a reaction to western liberalism rather than a set of ideas in its own
right. This is particularly true in Malaysia, where British colonialism
seems to have left deep scars. It was the Malaysians who brought up the
subject of 'brown Moslem' leadership in the dispute with Britain; the
British press was more interested in corruption and in the lies told by the
British government. Even Singaporeans, who better appreciate their
dependence on western markets and a western defence umbrella, see the Asian
way principally as an antidote to decadent western values.
Most of the supposedly 'Asian' values - hard work, strong families, home
ownership, and morality, to name but four quoted by Tommy Koh, a Singapore
academic and columnist - would in any case be regarded as unexceptionable by
John Major. So supporters of the Asian way resort to wilful exaggeration of
the west's (very real) social problems, while underplaying their own
(equally real) difficulties as their countries are transformed at breakneck
speed from agrarian to industrial societies. Typically, the narrowest
western liberal attitude towards the world - every country must have
one-person-one-vote democracy immediately - is set up as a man of straw and
knocked down as impractical.
It is instructive to see what the proponents of the Asian way have not done.
They have rarely suggested new, 'Asian' forms of 'consensus' government;
instead they have usually adapted or distorted western or communist systems
to their own ends, raising the question: if Asian authoritarianism is such a
good idea, why pretend to be democratic? Academics have spent many happy
hours pondering the way in which the governments of Singapore and Malaysia
use democratic systems but become agitated - punishing offending
constituencies - when their opponents win too many votes.
References to culture and civilisation, apart from the occasional token
gesture, are also often curiously absent in the new official Asian thinking.
Ask an Asian government minister about progress and achievement, and nine
times out of 10 he will tell you by how many per cent the gross domestic
product of his country has risen in the past year: western materialism at
its worst, some might say.
'A strong economy is a precondition for domestic health, military strength
and global influence,' wrote Morton Abramowitz of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, in a recent article* casting doubt on the notion of the
Pacific Century. 'But in an interdependent world, those that aspire to lend
their name to centuries must also have political strengths and value systems
that enable them to project influence persuasively.'
Many Asians agree, including a group of academics, bankers and former
ministers who recently produced a report called 'Towards a New Asia'; it
advocated democracy within the rule of law and, while paying tribute to the
importance of economic growth, suggested that Asia should 'move to higher
ground' and 'become a greater contributor to the advancement of human
civilisation'.
Ironically the very economic growth which the authoritarians have used to
justify their rule is rapidly creating an educated Asian middle class whose
members do care about such supposedly 'western' notions as individual rights
and press freedoms, and who are prepared to protest publicly against
government corruption, incompetence and authoritarianism. In recent years
such democratisation has been visible in South Korea, Taiwan and Japan; and
if the free market is a form of liberalism, then liberalism is visible all
over Asia. The democratic uprising against the armed forces in Thailand in
1992, in which about 50 people were killed, became famous for the number of
mobile telephones carried by the pro-democracy demonstrators.
Such people understand how quickly the world is becoming inter-dependent.
Whereas Malaysian politicians tend to say that western companies are 'taking
advantage' of Malaysian economic success, the fact is that both sides are
profiting from each other. Malaysia depends heavily on western education and
on western and Japanese technology for its success. Asian countries,
furthermore, are becoming so rich and successful that many Asian companies
have started to invest in the west in the same way that western companies
have for years invested in them.
Of course Asians are different from Europeans, but then the Thais are
different from the Vietnamese, and the French from the English. To talk
defensively of the Asian way is no substitute for vigorous public debate
(forbidden in much of the region) about the challenges confronting
authoritarian Asia: political successions, the gap between rich and poor,
population growth, and the environmental devastation which threatens to
undermine the very basis for future development. Orientalism - the practice
of depicting eastern civilisations as mysteriously alien and subject to
special treatment - is no more fitting for modern Asian rulers seeking to
protect their fiefdoms than it was for the European colonialists of the
past.

<TEXT>
What a torment of stress I suffered this week. Pain. Anguish. The ripping to
shreds of my fragile male ego. Everywhere I look, in fact, men are being
scoffed at, thrust into victimhood. Our power is evaporating, our
irrelevance ballooning. It is time to fight back.
The incident that propelled me into stress was an injury on the tennis
court. Last Sunday morning. Paddington Sports Club. A ladder match -
singles. Man versus man. Primeval. Barrel-chested. The crash of mighty
strokes. Until the unfortunate moment when my back gave out. Just sort of
locked itself. Pain unendurable. Lasted all week. Can still feel the
twinges. Yet soldiering bravely on.
What exacerbated the stress was a run-in I had on Wednesday with my
executive assistant. Like all true Thatcherites, Miss Lee is oblivious to
male stress and pain, which are on the rise globally. She accused me of
being a wimp. I had told her I was in trauma.
Miss Lee laughed imperiously. She said: 'Let's get this straight, Michael.
You walked on to the court and hit a few practice balls. Your opponent was
under 30; you, of course, are not. He won the toss. His first serve hit the
net. His second serve - not fast - looped on to your forehand and you hit it
past the baseline. You scuttled to the net to pick up the first ball and as
you started to bend you suddenly gave a croak and jigged around in agony.
'You had played just one point. Talk about a wimp. How do you expect, in
this day and age, a professional woman like me, with a completely full
agenda, to find time to listen to spineless whimpering?'
That made me cross. I support female emancipation and a degree of equality.
But talk like that provoked a turning of the worm.
I said: 'It's gone too far, you know, this taunting of men. You obviously
haven't heard, but it is men who are subjugated. We get a completely rotten
deal.'
'Rubbish,' said Miss Lee.
I said: 'Rubbish it is not. Through the blur of my pain I have been reading
a plucky book: The Myth of Male Power: Why Men Are the Disposable Sex, by
Warren Farrell. It has just appeared in Britain, and should be feted for the
vigour with which it sets the record straight.'
'Record?'
'Correct. In the space available I cannot convey more than a haunting
snapshot of Dr Farrell's thesis, but his argument is that, after millions of
years, male-female roles - man the protector, woman the protected - have
suddenly become unworkable.
'Dr Farrell says he wants us to stop expecting men to earn more money than
women and then referring to male 'power' or 'dominance' rather than
'pressure' or 'obligation'; to grant men the same life expectancy as women;
to 'give men special outlets and incentives to express their feelings and
perspectives until men commit suicide no more frequently than women'; to
'monitor media sexism that defines relationship issues disproportionately
from the female perspective'; to care as much about battered husbands as
battered wives; to give fathers as much right to their children as mothers;
to care as much about saving males as saving whales; to 'go beyond woman as
sex object and man as success object to (see) both sexes as objects of
love'.'
Miss Lee chortled. 'Frivolous tosh,' she said. 'Cloying. Stupid. Care as
much about saving males as saving whales? Now I've heard it all.'
I said: 'Understand this, cup-cake: modern stress has produced far higher
rates of heart attack and disgracefully shorter life-spans for males than
for females; more alcoholism; pronounced fear of therapy; fear of
commitment; far more male suicide. The stress is killing us.
'Here is a tit-bit from Dr Farrell: 'A woman (in the US) is 14 per cent more
likely to die from breast cancer than a man is from prostate cancer, yet
funding for breast cancer research is 660 per cent greater than funding for
prostate cancer research. The death-to-funding ratio is 47:1 in women's
favour'. That is a motto for our times, Miss Lee: 47:1 in women's favour.'
Miss Lee laughed savagely. She said: 'All you've got is tennis-back. But
most men are wimps. Dr Farrell has assisted me. Clarified things
considerably. Helped me see the light. My vote goes to whales.'

FT  05 MAR 94 / The thin red line stands firm: Dominic Lawson praises the
one British institution that is above ridicule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the turn of the year I published a somewhat callous article suggesting
that our ailing national institutions needed the threat that has ever hung
over companies in the private sector. That figure of nemesis is the
liquidator, brought in by the banks when the business concerned is beyond
salvation.
Among the customers for institutional euthanasia was Lloyd's of London. It
would be better for all involved - except perhaps those drawing salaries for
running it into the ground - if the whole market was wound up in an orderly
fashion. The Football Association, the Test and County Cricket Board and the
Jockey Club were also on the list of candidates for humane killing. There
are those who would add the monarchy to this rota of once-great British
institutions which have outlived their usefulness and which we should not
strive officiously to keep alive.
After this article was published the titular head of one of these bodies - I
do not mean Her Majesty the Queen - got in touch with me. Could I name, he
asked me, any British institution which had not fallen victim to ridicule
from the press and the public? The point of his question, I think, was to
suggest that it was not so much that the institutions were all rotten, but
that there was a general mood of fin-de-siecle cynicism which had been
targeted indiscriminately at all public bodies.
But there is one British institution which has survived this attack. Indeed,
I suspect that its reputation is as high as it has ever been. I refer to the
army, or, more properly, the armed forces.
I am incapable of being in the company of a British soldier, active or
retired, without feeling some slight sense of inferiority, in that he is a
member of a profession which is above reproach. I am aware that journalism
is perhaps not the highest calling that a man can achieve, but I do not feel
the same sense of moral inadequacy when introduced to a doctor, an
accountant, a lawyer or indeed any other member of our great professions.
Perhaps all men feel the way I do. From our earliest childhood we are
brought up to believe that there can be nothing more masculine than to be a
soldier. All other business is effete by comparison, so naturally we feel
slightly less of a man in the company of one who is paid to take up arms in
the service of his country.
There is more to it than that. The great virtue of the armed forces as an
institution is that - outside Northern Ireland - we do not encounter them in
our day-to-day lives. They are all but invisible, doing their job in a way
that does not intrude on our prejudices or our fantasies. They live in
barracks, not among us, abroad even when they are at home.
In so far as we are aware of them, we can hardly avoid noticing that they
seem to be better than their international counterparts, something which
scarcely seems to be the case with our other public bodies.
While General Sir Michael Rose could perhaps be expected to feature
glowingly in the British press, there does seem to be an international
appreciation that it has taken a British soldier to raise the morale of the
United Nations forces in Bosnia, and to instil some sense of coherent
military strategy into its operations.
There is, I believe, one overriding reason why the British Army is so good.
It is ruthless with itself, as ruthless as any private company. It is
continually culling from its ranks those men and officers who do not match
the highest standards. That process will intensify as a result of the
government's proposed cutbacks in the armed forces, but the constant
pressure on men to resign their commissions if they cannot see their way to
steady and merited promotion is very much the army's own style.
So when you read of Major James Hewitt's ungentlemanly conduct in selling
his story of friendship with the Princess of Wales to the Daily Express, do
not think less of the British Army. Just think how wise it was to have
spotted a wrong 'un and given him early redundancy. What a discriminating
institution.

FT  05 MAR 94 / A dizzy fall from the heights: Financial Times Round the
World Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They spent February in North America.
We had expected the US southern states and the mid-west to be different from
Colorado, but we hadn't realised quite how different. We should have guessed
from the enormous altitude change - almost 13,000ft at Breckenridge to
scarcely 1,000ft above the Mississippi at Mount Lacrosse, Wisconsin.
Here, ski resorts are sited in the most ridiculous places. Cloudmont in
Alabama, for example, is tiny, pretty and bizarre and if there were a
competition for really small ski areas, I would hand it first prize straight
away because it is kept going against all odds.
Lucy Dicker, my companion on this round-the-world ski expedition, and I had
the honour of being the last skiers this winter to descend the only run at
Cloudmont with enough snow on it to remain open. And when Cloudmont closes
for skiing, so does Alabama.
Cloudmont, in a peaceful wooded vale not far from Chattanooga, has a
vertical drop of just 150ft and only one 'pony' tow, with no chairlifts. And
there are just two runs: half of the gently sloping fields that make up the
skiing terrain is for intermediates; the other half is the nursery slope.
During our visit, the beginners' slope had melted completely, and only 90ft
remained of the intermediate slope.
But then you might think it miraculous that Alabama can manage a ski resort
at all, let alone one which next winter will celebrate its quarter century
as the only ski area Alabama has ever had.
Normally Cloudmont gets just 12 inches of snow a year, an inch or two at a
time. Gary Jones, who runs Cloudmont with six relations and a few friends,
makes nearly all the snow himself.
February has turned out to be a month of feast or famine for our adventure:
we caught Colorado at its best and the Mid-West at its most unpredictable -
a week before we arrived at Ski Butler in Kentucky there had been a
heatwave.
During the month we have featured in some strange-sounding newspapers, such
as the Idaho Falls Post Register, the Ashland Daily Tidings, and the Record
Searchlight.
One headline read: 'Surgery can't stop ski writer.' Our mission to ski every
day of 1994 came under threat in Paoli Peaks, Indiana, when I required
inconvenient minor surgery. While recovering, Lucy and I made a daily
pilgrimage to Paoli and, rather gingerly, skied one run just to keep our
record intact.
Earlier in the month, at Montana's Big Mountain, we took a Snow Cat tour,
travelling in an old gondola bolted onto the Cat - a Heath Robinson device.
And at Big Sky the sun came out and warmed the bones which had been so
chilled the previous week. It was a day of fast cruising mixed with some
more adventurous and steeper terrain off the recently opened Challenger Quad
chair.
One special area I was anxious to try in Ski the Summit's resorts was the
latest addition to the skiing terrain at Breckenridge, Peak 7. Unlike Peaks
8, 9 and 10, this mountain has no lifts, is completely ungroomed, and
involves a tough 30-minute hike followed by a serious descent through a
steep and often deep snowfield.
My hands and feet were frozen when I got to the top, and all I could think
about was getting out of the piercing wind, but as we started our descent,
several things started happening at once. Lucy fell almost immediately, and
in my eagerness to help her I promptly took a tumble myself, temporarily
losing a ski.
Then I found my goggles had frozen over inside my jacket and Lucy told me
that my nose had turned white with frostbite. We managed to pick ourselves
up and, trying hard to keep my nose covered, we skied out of the wind. For
two weeks my nose looked as if it had been left out for too long in the
Caribbean. It has only just healed.
Our last day's skiing in Colorado until we return in December was a morning
of Cat skiing at Ski Cooper.
And so to our dizzy fall from the heights of Colorado to the lows of
Wisconsin: in the Rockies, when it rains in the ski village there is a
strong chance that it will be snowing higher up. In the mid-west states
there is usually no higher up. If it is raining low down, it is almost
certainly raining on the slopes too. Skiing in torrential rain was one thing
we hadn't really bargained for.
That evening - still in pouring rain - we skied at Cascade Mountain.
Strangely, once committed to skiing in the rain it feels quite snug under
your hood, hat and goggles. It was only when we had completed five miles in
the two resorts (not easy with a vertical drop of only 500ft or less) that
we realised quite how drenched we were.
At Mount Lacrosse, Wisconsin, pain in my left foot became a major problem
and I had four people crowding round me - Ted Motschman, owner, Tom
Caspersen, rental manager, and Matt Kleppe, head boot-fitter, plus Bruce
Erdmann, orthopaedic specialist - to advise about my crippled foot. My boot
was successfully 'blown out' and I have now stopped limping.
On the outskirts of Chicago, the ski 'resorts' get even smaller. Villa
Olivia's vertical drop is only 180ft. And we arrived at Four Lakes Village
to find a vertical drop of just 100ft and no lifts - only tow ropes.
While most skiers would prefer to ski in the Alps or Rockies, this does not
mean that all ski areas have to be huge or even anywhere near a mountain. As
long as it is cold enough to make snow at night you could build a ski area
just about anywhere - and these states prove it.
In Indiana and Kentucky, four resorts are fighting in the same unlikely
catchment area: Paoli Peaks, Ski World, Perfect Slopes and Ski Butler. Their
winter season can be as short as 90 days or even less, and to make the most
of the snow they make there is night skiing - even all-night at weekends.
Paoli Peaks, run by a Swiss couple, Felix and Margarit Wurmli-Kagi, is
probably the best of the four areas and they certainly make the best snow.
Felix is a snow-making boffin and has even patented his own snow-making
machine.
Having just caught Cloudmont in time, we now head for North Carolina via
Chattanooga. We must make haste, because to the resorts it is already spring
and the snow is melting fast . . . .

FT  05 MAR 94 / Motoring: Two pretty Japanese models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a tale of two new coupes, both pretty and Japanese. One of them is
unique, as it breaks Marshall's Law of Car Selection which says that, when
you buy a coupe, you always pay more for less.
The new Toyota Celica GT, which goes on sale in Britain next week, is not
the unique one. This two-door, sporting four-seater, with a hatch opening on
to a boot of sensible size, costs Pounds 20,617; this makes it Pounds 3,000
dearer than a similarly-engined, although larger and roomier, Carina E GTi
five-door. But - and this is what matters - it really does look a million
dollars.
The surprise newcomer is Honda's Civic coupe. Priced from Pounds 10,450
upwards, it is cheaper and just a little more powerful than its saloon
equivalent. The coupe was conceived and styled in Honda's Californian
research facility and, like the Accord Coupe and Aerodeck Estate also sold
in Britain, is built in the US.
Profit-chasing by motor insurers, the activities of car criminals and
tougher speed limit enforcement did nothing for sales of high-performance
sports in Britain last year; they fell by 6 per cent. But Toyota GB is
confident that the latest, sixth-generation Celica GT - the first of the
line appeared 21 years ago - will have as much showroom appeal as its
predecessors.
The Celica GT shares a market niche with a lot of rivals, including the Audi
2.8 and BMW 320i coupes, Ford Probe, Honda Prelude, Mazda MX-3 and MX-6,
Rover 220 Turbo coupe and Vauxhall Calibra.
Unquestionably, Toyota's string of world rally driver championships with
Celicas in the past five years will attract some buyers. But many will put
more weight on its styling - a family resemblance to the stunning new Supra
is clear to see - plus its top-rate build quality and Toyota's reputation
for reliability.
The Honda Civic coupe is aimed at buyers whose ambitions and resources are
more modest. Mechanically, it is closely related to the Civic saloon and
hatchback, which are favoured in the main by older motorists. Honda hopes
the coupe will attract young buyers - it expects many of them to be women -
into its dealerships.
People who buy Hondas tend to get hooked on the marque and have one after
another. Honda is banking on the coupe, which a cynic might call a sheep in
wolf's clothing, to start the process much earlier.
Toyota makes it plain that the Celica GT is a purpose-designed coupe, not a
two-door version of a saloon. A re-worked engine with 10 per cent more power
makes it faster (a claimed 139mph/224kph maximum) than the last model. This
is, of course, just for test tracks. A new Celica I drove in Portugal the
other day struck me, above all, as a civilised sports car.
On rough roads, the wide tyres did not thump or bang unduly; the engine made
lovely noises when accelerating hard but motorway cruising was quiet; and
the Celica handled and held the road well enough to flatter the skill of an
averagely competent driver.
It comes with all the usual kit: driver's side air bag; anti-lock brakes;
powered steering, sun roof, windows and mirrors; and a good security system.
A five-speed gearbox is the only transmission available and air-conditioning
is an optional extra. On the Isle of Man, where I sampled the Civic coupe,
there are no speed limits away from the urban areas. But, apart from the
smoothly-surfaced and potentially very fast TT racing circuit, Manx roads
seem to have changed little since the horse and cart era.
The whole time I was there, it rained so, while I cannot talk from
experience about the Civic coupe's performance, I can vouch for its
sure-footedness.
I thought it a charming car, easy to drive yet with spirited responses. It
has power steering as standard and can be had with automatic transmission at
extra cost, although a driver's side air bag or anti-lock brakes are not
available.
I could see a two-pedal Civic coupe captivating many women drivers who came
to the conclusion long ago that gear-shifting was tiresome and unnecessary.
At the same time the young will enjoy the finger-light, five-speed gearbox
of this affordable, occasional four-seater.
Honda executives think the Civic coupe could become a cult car of 1994.
I think they may be right.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Sport: Charmed by the rudest of clubs - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not easy to decide which has produced more anguish over the years: the
Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers or the rules of golf.
Words such as pig-headed, irrational and incomprehensible abound when either
is the topic of conversation. Both are 250 years old on Monday, which makes
the former the oldest golf club in the world.
To be fair to the Honourable Company, whose present home is the sublime
links course at Muirfield, when they came up with the original rules of golf
on March 7 1744 they made a great deal more sense than the labyrinthine set
of clauses and sub-clauses that the Royal and Ancient Golf Club applies to
today's game.
Alas, if only the same could be said about the behaviour of certain Company
men down the years, or their representatives. When Golf Digest, the US
magazine, ran a piece on Muirfield before the 1992 Open there, it headlined
it: 'The rudest golf club in the world.'
It is said that one Muirfield member, a distinguished politician, was so
appalled by the attitudes of his peers that he refused to go to his own golf
club. One man came up from the English Midlands to play and was bowled over
by the reception he received from the then secretary, the usually fearsome
Paddy Hamner.
Hamner was most taken by the man's cravat. They settled into a conversation
about the guest's textile business and he revealed proudly that his cravats
were made from the finest silk.
Hamner was delighted with the offer of a couple as gifts. The visitor made
his way towards the lounge to order some lunch, wondering how Hamner had
come to earn such an unjust reputation. As he stood at the threshold of the
beautiful room, Hamner roared down the corridor: 'You won't be having lunch
in there. You're not allowed in without a tie.'
At first glance, not much has changed. The notice on the entrance gate tells
you that this club is 'strictly private'. One door in the clubhouse has
'lavatories' written on it, but do not think it opens to reveal further
doors for men and women. There are no women members. The oldest golf club
has never had any. Its waiting list is enormously long and closed - and
there are no women on it.
But Muirfield has taken steps to soften its image. These began three years
ago with the appointment of Group Captain John Prideaux as secretary.
Where previous holders of this office had been obstructive and rude, he
could not be more effusive or helpful. 'I just do the job as I see fit. I
think some of the criticism of Muirfield for being snobbish or offhand was
justified, but equally a lot of it was people believing what they wanted to
believe. There's also a lot of jealousy about the way we do things here. The
game has changed greatly in recent years but Muirfield has remained free of
rampant commercialism, and some people resent that.'
Contrary to myth, it is not impossible to play Muirfield. On Tuesdays and
Thursdays, 60 men and women out of the 300 or so who make the request each
week are allowed to sample its pleasures, and while Prideaux is almost
apologetic at the charge of Pounds 50 for the round or Pounds 70 for the day
 -'very high for the east of Scotland' - this is one of the great golfing
bargains.
The fact is that you cannot help but fall in love with Muirfield - with the
course, for one thing, and with its innate fairness, which makes it the
favourite of all the great players.
There is also the fact that the club makes no tawdry effort to cash in on
its unique place in the game's lore. The following day I visited another
Open championship course, where they have a thousand souvenirs covered in
tacky 'Turnberry, Scotland' logos and where they discriminate by means of a
pricing policy which places it outside the budget of all but the wealthy.
Muirfield, with plenty to flaunt, is surely the only club in the world that
offers no souvenirs. They have no golf shop. They have no pro.
In the breakfast room a wonderful photograph caught my eye. A letter
underneath tells of four golfers who decided to visit an optician because
one of them had become unhappy with his putting, and decided it was because
of his eyesight.
He was right, too. But the others were in for a shock: they all had poor
vision, which is how they came to pose for the light-hearted photograph. The
quartet were J H Taylor, Harry Vardon, Alex Herd and James Braid and, bad
eyesight or not, between them they won 17 of the 21 Open Championships
played from 1894 to 1914.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Sport: On the fast track to success - Rugby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We call them stadiums or pitches. Players call them tracks. And the fastest
track in Europe is the Parc des Princes, Paris. The reason? The French
national stadium, being a council-owned ground, is used for soccer and
rugby. The soil and the grass is specially prepared to cope with the
vicissitude of both games and one outcome is that the grass is considerably
shorter than at any of the other Five Nations venues.
Not only does this mean that the three-quarters have a chance to show their
pace, or lack of it, but the speed of the back-row to the break-down becomes
more important. One reason why so few away teams win at the Parc (Ireland
and Scotland have never won there; Wales did it last in 1975) is because the
game is much faster, and players succumb in the final quarter of the game.
It also explains why the scorelines are bigger than elsewhere.
England's brilliant wins in 1990, 1991 (World Cup quarter-final) and 1992
owe much to the way its forwards so dominated the scrums and line-outs that
France suffocated.
Parc des Princes has only a limited life. In 1999, the French Federation de
Rugby will move to a new stadium (also council-owned) being planned at St
Denis to house the World Cup soccer finals in 1998.
This is fortuitous, for it saves them raising the money to build or replace
stands, something which is currently exercising the Irish, the Scots and the
English.
St Denis will seat 80,000, an improvement of 25,000 on current capacity.
Bernard Lapasset, the French president, accepts that the enlarged capacity
may be a problem: 'We could have sold today's game out twice, but earlier in
the season we struggled with the Australians.'
Lapasset has helped change the face of French rugby since he succeeded the
ancien regime of Albert Ferrasse in 1992. The former Agen second row and
occasional No 8 (he won a championship medal in 1969 with the Under-21 side)
played most of his rugby in Paris - for Paris University Club and then for
the Custom Officials club which he helped found.
He still works for Customs, collecting tax debts. It was from this unlikely
rugby base that he made his way through the labyrinth of committees to
become assistant secretary, an honorary position, of the FFR, in the late
1980s. From there he challenged for the presidency in what he calls 'the
rugby wars of 1990 and 1991'.
Unlike England, where the tenure of the president of the Rugby Football
Union lasts a single year, Lapasset's term lasts four seasons and he is
likely to stand again in 1995. But, said Henri Bru, the rugby correspondent
of L'Equipe: 'It doesn't matter that for you the president lasts one year.
Dudley Wood (secretary of the RFU) is your president and everyone knows it.'
Two projects have exercised Lapasset's diplomatic skills. The first was
redefining 'amateurism' in the modern game.
'There is no definition of the word amateur. It is not a legal statute. For
us the word means the spirit of the game and that is what we must keep at
all costs,' he said. 'We do not want to play for money nor create a new
professional game. There isn't room in France with soccer, basketball and
tennis claiming so much of our attention and so much of the economic cake.
The critical element of rugby is its manner, its style, its traditions.'
Lapasset has forged a partnership with the players. Two months ago, after
eight months of negotiations involving all the international squad and using
great players such as Walter Spanghero and Jo Maso as a sounding board,
France became the first union to contract its players.
'Every player was asked to sign our player's charter. It sets out the terms
under which they are allowed to operate, including any commercial spin-offs.
Any player not willing to sign cannot be considered for national selection.'
Other countries have allowed players to have agents which has led in some
cases to national coaches and players sharing the same agent. This can lead
to conflicts of interest. The French have decided to run all the commercial
activities.
The charter enables players to earn money by promoting the game, a clear
contradiction of the International Rugby Football Board's laws on
amateurism.
Each squad player is allocated 200 kit bags which contain balls, jerseys,
videos and equipment to give to children. Players have visited schools in
Pau, Toulouse, Arras, Rennes and Paris. Targeting schools is new for rugby
in France, where sport is not part of the curriculum. These visits have been
a resounding success.
Meanwhile, the RFU has its own problems. It has called an emergency meeting
of the coaching committee for next Thursday. The successor to Geoff Cooke as
England coach should be announced at the executive meeting the following
day.
Over the past decade my old club Bath, under Jack Rowell, has managed to
change personnel while remaining successful. If the RFU hesitates over
choosing Rowell, English rugby will return to the hesitant years of 1970s
and early 1980s.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Gardening: The scent that says spring - How can the
sweet-smelling mimosa be grown successfully in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Throughout the week there have been definite signs of spring, but they mean
different things in different countries.
In Britain, they mean the best of the crocuses, emergent flower on
brown-leaved Prunus and lengthening beads of flower on my particular
favourite among yellow-flowered shrubs, the Stachyurus.
Roses have started into leaf and if you want to ward off black spot, you
must start to spray now, using Nimrod T once a fortnight on the young
leaves. Delay, and you have lost the war.
Who has cared about black spot this week on a latitude below Europe's fog
belt? I have been in the right place at the right time.
It has been shirt-sleeves only outside San Spirito; Primavera has stepped
out of Botticelli's painting; no-one is pining by the Arno; there have been
angels at large in Florence and, on the track of Fra Angelicos, I found
something heavenly. Along the Borgo Pinto, the houses open on to courtyards.
Just before Perugino's Crucifixion, spring met me head on in clouds of
yellow, pink and satin-red flowers.
We will soon have our pink-flowered almonds in the UK and already, there are
satin-red buds on the japonicas. The yellow is denied to us.
In florists throughout London you can buy a few sprigs of mimosa. In
Florence, there are huge trees of it, flowering as thickly as those Banksian
roses which are next month's glory in southern Spain.
Mimosa, not tax, may yet drive me offshore.
Expatriates gloat among it over breakfast on the Riviera. Florentine
flat-dwellers look on to trees of it beside branches of the almond blossom
which are picked and displayed on the counters of flower-conscious shops.
In their great Italian city, we all complain about our fellow-tourists, but
we ought to remember what we owe to botanical immigrants. If the great men
of the past could return, they would be amazed by the present
Mediterra-nean.
The Greeks knew no eucalyptus and the Romans knew no orange trees in
Andalucia. Botticelli never saw mimosa, nor did the English Grand Tourists
who visited the Uffizi and idealised its naked statue of Venus without
bothering to look at the paintings which now amaze us.
Mimosa arrived in the 1820s, the Antipodes' postscript to old European art.
Of course Masaccio's frescoes are memorable, but a full-flowering tree of
mimosa measures up to him, as yellow as the robes of the youthful St John. I
have never expected that a prime site in Florence would be Austra-lian.
How can we grow mimosa in Britain? Only once have I seen it luxuriate, in
the great Irish garden of Glen Veagh in County Donegal. Its lavish American
owner would advance on the trees with his personalised secateurs and clip
the branches with suitable throw-away comments before handing them to his
guests.
Derbyshire is not County Donegal and you cannot grow a mimosa outdoors in
most of Britain's climate. In warm areas, it will survive by the Gulf
Stream, in Devon or even in especially sheltered parts of London.
It is happiest on a wall, but it never flowers as freely as I have now seen
it: the reason, I think, is not so much the risk of frost as its need to be
thoroughly ripened by sun in summer.
In Britain, the best place for the best varieties is a conservatory or cool
greenhouse.
Under cover mimosas need little more heat than suffices to keep out frost in
winter: they will grow best in a bed with room for their roots, but most of
them will try to touch the skies if they are happy. The hardiest forms have
been recorded at heights of 100ft in wild Australia.
Unless you have a glass castle, you should confine your plant in a large pot
and prune it heavily after flowering. The main reason why indoor mimosas
flower half-heartedly is that they are allowed to become too dry at the root
in winter.
Stand them so that you can water freely from below and try not to choose the
more boring varieties. Mimosas are correctly listed as Acacias nowadays.
A big selection is still offered by Burncoose Nurseries, at Redruth, in
Cornwall and their small plants will grow away quickly.
The best is baileyana which comes from New South Wales and is distinguished
by its silvery-blue leaf, an exceptionally pretty feature.
On a wall, the silvery pravissima arches into a good shape and is too little
known: up a pillar in a conservatory, you would also enjoy riceana which is
named after a chancellor of the exchequer but as he died long ago, you need
not hold the name against it.
In Australia, these wonderful trees are known as Wattles: Silver Wattles,
Oven Wattles, Rice's Wattle until you wonder wattle turn up next.
In Britain, we all know them as mimosa, grouping them with those similar
sensitive plants which curl up their leaves when you touch them or brush
against them while sheltering underneath.
Their sensitive habits mimic sensitive humans and so, I suppose, they began
to be known as mimosas because of their mimicry.
Personally, I love the scent. Imitate the Florentines and, if you cannot
join them, at least compete by growing your own mimosa in a pot for cut
flowers and that exquisite scent of warm Italy.

If your bird table has been abandoned and you cannot remember when you last
saw a blackbird, a song thrush or a robin, try leaving your garden shed
open.
According to Chris Meades, of the British Trust for Ornithology, all three
species, together with wrens, will be quite happy to nest in there and, more
importantly, those much-feared serial killers of smaller birds, magpies,
will not dare to enter.
'Magpies prefer to forage in the open. If they are after smaller birds they
will look for a hedge to plunder,' Meades says.
Meades also advises those worried about the black and white marauders to
protect any songbird's nest they find with wire netting.
'It's quite possible to create a ball of chicken mesh that smaller birds can
get through but a magpie cannot,' he said.
When a fully-grown blackbird is killed it is bad news for the species,
Meades says.
'The chances of a chick growing to full maturity are about one in 10, so we
should do all we can to protect adult blackbirds.'
One way both country and town dwellers worried about declining blackbird and
other bird populations can help is to provide more habitat. 'So often we
destroy birds' habitat without realising it,' he said.
'In many cases gardens have been landscaped and there is therefore far less
cover for the small birds.
'The answer is to plant - particularly shrubs. Spiky bushes such as
pyracantha are hard for the magpies to penetrate.
'A few prickles will do an awful lot to deter cats too. Basically the more
cover there is, the harder it is for the magpies to seek out nests and kill
fledglings.' Meades does not blame magpies alone for the decline in
Britain's bird species over the past few years.
'Monoculture has a great deal to do with it,' he said. 'Thirty years ago a
field of barley contained about 5 per cent weeds. These were good for the
birds because they produced seeds that were winter fodder for a variety of
species. Today, chemicals have made sure that that field is 100 per cent
barley, and this is bad news for species such as the corn bunting, the reed
bunting and the skylark.'
However, magpies have been multiplying as much in the country as in the
towns, the reason being that there are fewer gamekeepers.
There are all sorts of reasons - not least the recession - for the decline
in the latter species, but it has meant fewer magpies are killed by man.
'Magpies are therefore attracted to the towns because they do not associate
humans with shooting any longer,' Meades said.
'However, magpies are not entirely the bad news for garden birds that so
many seem to think. They are omnivorous: even in the breeding season they
only take a few chicks.
'People who have seen and heard the commotion when a magpie attacks an
exposed blackbird's nest and slaughters chicks often get unduly uptight over
magpies and blame them for more deaths than they actually cause.
'Magpies are beautiful and fascinating birds that have been around for
thousands, if not millions, of years.
'Probably because their numbers have increased threefold in the past 30
years they have had a pretty bad press. Although magpies have no predator in
the natural order of things the chances of them making any particular
species extinct is nil.'

FT  05 MAR 94 / Property: Why Ireland may be lucky for some - Whether you
want a cottage, a castle or an island, bargains abound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN

<TEXT>
Rural Ireland offers extraordinary value for property buyers and now is a
good time to buy.
As in the 1980s, the Irish market will be mirroring the UK market, with a
lag of a year or two. Whether the rises will come later this year, or in
1995, is hard to say. When the market does improve, 'overseas' buyers,
mainly from the UK, will be in the driving seat - just as buyers from the
Far East gave the London market a kick-start to recovery.
If you buy now, you are almost certain to look back with a smile in the year
2000. Castles, large Georgian houses, bungalows and cottages are on offer at
remarkably low prices. The bigger they are, the less they cost in square
footage - but restoration and maintenance charges escalate.
Within commuting range of Dublin, prices have held firm. In the rest of the
country take your pick of properties at excellent prices in UK terms. Agents
and vendors will be glad to see you.
In the good years of 1988-90 the 'best buyers' of country houses in Ireland
came from the UK, says JBC Hamilton, of Jackson-Stops McCabe.
Of late, these UK purchasers have been absent, unable - or unwilling - to
sell their houses in Britain. That will change. Italians and Germans have
been buying in the meantime, but lower interest rates will allow the Irish
to re-enter their own market, particularly for substantial houses.
To buy a house in Ireland, you must learn to like the Irish way of life. You
might survive as a teetotaller - just - but you could not survive at all if
you did not enjoy talking. Ireland does not have a silent majority.
If you go hunting, shooting, fishing, betting at the races or are a
gardener, life will be richer. Leisure and tourism are vital for the rural
economy, where people often need several jobs to make ends meet. A village
carpenter may keep cattle as well - and go oyster fishing at the right time
of the year.
Taking advantage of the European Union's sheep payment regime is an art,
'provided you can get them to hobble past the inspector' my informant in
County Mayo said. It leads to ferocious overgrazing of the mountains in
winter. The sheep destroy the thin top layer of boggy turf. The gravel
subsoil then erodes and washes into the rivers, where it may affect the
fish.
But the economy needs outside money. The trickle-down effect of catching one
salmon on the fly, in terms of aircraft or ferry, use of car, hotel, food
and local support services, runs into many hundreds of pounds - a most
expensive way to buy fish. It is a pity then that sea-trout are fewer, as
they are suffering from sea lice, perhaps as a result of salmon farming.
If you do go to Ireland, recognise the importance of the house you choose to
buy. This may seem an odd remark but, unlike secular England, the concept of
spirit of place is rampant in Ireland. At all levels, houses have their own
life and control their owners. That is (partly) why impoverished gentry
still hang on to properties they cannot afford, and it is why their homes
were burnt down in the troubles of the 1920s. Then, their houses were not
just a symbol of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, they were the power behind it.
Jackson-Stops McCabe has a long list of such places, many in their third
year on the market. The recurrent phrase in Irish property particulars,
'open to offers', means what it says.
Prices start at about Pounds 250,000 - the UK and Irish pounds are virtually
at par - as with Moyne Park in County Galway, a Regency house built by the
family of Lord Sligo. It has been reduced from Pounds 350,000. The
particulars speak of 'the present owner, the late George MacBeth, a
distinguished poet and novelist'. Good Irish stuff. But the point is clear -
and it emphasises that powerful Irish spirit of place. (Sotheby's
International Realty is also an agent for this property.)
Greenstones Hall, at Glandore, in County Cork, is pink-painted Georgian.
Overlooking the harbour, which in 1900 had the largest fishing fleet along
the Cork coast, the house comes with a private boathouse and slipway, and
sub-tropical plants in the garden. The price for the whole is Pounds
850,000, from Charles P McCarthy.
Also in the pink, and with the same asking price, is Garretstown, at
Dunshaughlin, in County Meath, 20 miles from Dublin and commanding a Dublin
premium - but it is Georgesque, built in 1975. Agents are Hamilton Osborne
King and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
Smaller Georgian houses include Carrick Lodge at Cornamona in County Galway
on the shores of Lough Corrib - excellent fishing - for Pounds 210,000 (down
from Pounds 300,000) from J-SM. Two gelebe houses - or old rectories of the
Anglican Church of Ireland - are available through McCarthy, in County Cork.
They are at Ballinadee (Pounds 359,000) and Drimoleague (Pounds 200,000).
Dukes Lodge at Athy, in County Kildare, an hour from Dublin, is a handsome
house built by the Duke of Leinster. It is on offer for Pounds 200,000 from
Ganly Walters.
Also of interest are the early 18th century Prospect House at Westport,
County Mayo, from J-SM and Brendan Tuohy for between Pounds 320,000 and
Pounds 380,000, and Corran House, at Leap, in County Cork for Pounds 235,000
from McCarthy. The company is also selling The Old Mill at Leap for Pounds
165,000, completely renovated in 1989.
Among castles, the 1882 Tulira in County Galway is still for sale from
Jackson-Stops McCabe and Sotheby's for Pounds 2m, and Hamilton Osborne King
has fully-furnished homes at Dromoland in County Clare, adjoining a golf
course, for Pounds 200,000. Perhaps the pick of the bunch should be
Strancally at Knockanore, County Waterford, set where the Bride and
Blackwater rivers meet. It is an early 19th century house and with 160 acres
is on offer from Jackson-Stops McCabe for Pounds 800,000-Pounds 850,000.
At the opposite end of society, cottages inland in County Leitrim may go for
as little as Pounds 5,000. On the west coast, Heaslip has several cottages,
old or new-in-the-old-style, in County Galway from Pounds 23,000 upwards.
More unusual is Heaslip's Old School House at Annaghdown, a solid
neo-Georgian building that personifies the importance of learning. It costs
Pounds 87,000 'open to offers'.
On Whiddy Island in Bantry Bay, with 28 permanent inhabitants and a pub,
Ganly Walters is selling Stonefarm House for Pounds 150,000. If you need a
whole island with six smaller islands around, Dominic J Daly and Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley have the answer. It is Inishanboe, the 'island of the cow'.
The price is Pounds 1.5m.

THE HITE REPORT ON THE FAMILY by Shere Hite Bloomsbury Pounds 16.99, 424
pages
Shere Hite made her money and name some years ago with what she called
'reports' on female and male sexuality. If they had really been reports,
consisting of carefully gathered and dispassionately analysed data, they
would not have been best-sellers. But they were not what they pretended; far
from being exercises in social science, their real attraction lay in
gratifying our voyeuristic instincts by telling us sexual anecdotes, thinly
tacked together on a string of Hite's opinions. They were not reports but
polemics, hitching a ride on the back of sexy tales.
In her new 'report', this time on the family, Hite uses precisely the same
technique. She recounts anecdotes told by people unidentified as to age,
occupation, nationality, ethnicity, and quite often sex. Some of the
anecdotes are a line or two long, some occupy several paragraphs. These
disjointed slivers of autobiography are followed either by generalisations
about the state of the contemporary family, or recommendations about how
families ought to be. Most of the anecdotes and linking remarks - and
therefore the book's main themes - concern sex in one way or another:
nudity, masturbation, spanking, incest, childhood sensuality and sexuality,
the eroticism of motherhood, sexual abuse, menstruation, fathers' jealousy
of daughters' boyfriends, and so, interminably, on.
According to Hite, children between the ages of five and 15 get too few
cuddles, because they have to sleep alone and because touching between
adults and children borders too closely on sex. Parents, she claims, are
afraid of children's 'active sexuality'. She deprecates the resulting
paucity of physical comfort in children's lives, and argues therefore that
we should 'reconceptualise' sexual contact between adults and children so
that there can be more of it. There should be lots of embracing and lots of
frankness about everything sexual. In particular, says Hite, the mother
should be acknowledged as the 'erotic centre of the household', and her
childrens' closeness to her body and breasts should not be curtailed
immediately after infancy.
The picture that emerges might best be described thus: Hite's utopian family
is a snugglesome group consisting of a languorously erotic mother, a gaggle
of highly sexed children, and perhaps a father, all nude and fondling each
other on a fluffy rug in front of the fire. This sentimentalised
para-sexuality is Hite's recommended antidote to the 'patriarchal family',
described as embodying socially-ordained power structures which are
'undemocratic' and unresponsive to childrens' needs.
There is a Quaker saying that 'all the world is queer except me and thee,
and even thee's a bit peculiar at times'. Reading Hite's contextless
snippets from other people's reminiscences is like peering down on a strange
planet. Is it generally true that parents stop cuddling their children at
the age of five? Is it really true that children are highly sexed? Is
spanking typically an act of erotic sado-masochism? Hite answers yes every
time. The world she describes is barely recognisable, not just to the
average reader, but to serious researchers in the same sociological fields.
This is where scrutiny is invited of her claim to be 'reporting' a
statistical survey. In response to damaging criticism of her earlier
'reports', Hite has sandwiched the main text of this book between 'notes on
research, methodology and statistics' at the beginning, and, at the end,
half a dozen brief testimonials from American academics, telling us chiefly
that since most research in social science is dodgy, we should not fault
Hite's research for being likewise.
We can ignore the fact that women undergraduates constitute the largest
single group of respondents in Hite's survey, and that the whole sample is
highly skewed towards well-educated youth. We can ignore this because Hite,
in the service of her personal agenda, quotes selectively from just those
anecdotes that fit her case. It is no surprise that the resulting picture is
idiosyncratic; it is one person's view, whose aim is not to tell us how
things are but how they should be.
The raggedness of Hite's discussion is demonstrated by her ignorance of
scholarly work on the history and nature of the family. Barely any of the
main studies in the field are mentioned. She seems not to know that what she
calls the 'traditional' - the nuclear - family is a very recent phenomenon;
her simplistic belief that Christianity's 'Holy Family' provides its
historical paradigm is risible. But it is the shallowness and vapidity of
her discussion of her material - itself, as we see, highly tendentious -
which scuppers the enterprise. If we wish to understand families, and find
out whether they are failing and if so what needs to be done, Hite's book is
the last place to look.

RALPH BUNCHE: AN AMERICAN LIFE by Brian Urquhart WW Norton Pounds 27.50, 496
pages
Ralph Bunche was one of the first black Americans to play a prominent role
in international affairs. At the height of his career he was distrusted by
the US state department and the Soviet foreign ministry. British and French
governments never liked him because, in the 1930s, he had become an early
advocate of decolonisation, made friends with such people as Jomo Kenyatta
and written a thesis, based on first hand research, on French policy in west
Africa. In the 1950s he irritated Europeans again by his handling of crises
in the Middle East and the Congo.
For Bunche was an independent man. He was one of the architects of the
United Nations Charter after the second world war and will be remembered as
one of the UN's most outstanding peacekeepers. The trouble is that after the
Six Day War in 1967, his achievements went out of fashion and it was thought
that the role of the UN must be limited. Only in the 1990s, particularly
with the break-up of Yugoslavia, has the possibility of international
peacekeeping on the grand scale come back into discussion.
It is certainly there in the Charter with its provision for a military
committee consisting of the chiefs of staff of the five permanent members of
the Security Council. And even during the cold war, Bunche had at least
three major successes to his name. He helped negotiate the armistice between
the Arabs and the Israelis in the Middle East in the late 1940s, winning the
Nobel Peace Prize for his pains. He was instrumental in putting together the
United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF), to keep the Egyptians and Israelis
apart, after the Suez war of 1956. In the Congo in the early 1960s it was
Bunche as much as anyone who ended the secession of Katanga.
True, he was often the number two. He took over as mediator in Palestine
only after the assassination his superior, the Swedish Count Bernadotte. The
concept of UNEF first came from the Canadian foreign minister, Lester
Pearson, and Bunche might have been less involved in the Congo had it not
been for the death of the UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold.
Yet in each case Bunche worked hard and was innovative. In the Middle East
he saw that the Israelis talked to the Arab States separately, not together,
a formula which continues to work. A footnote at the end of this book claims
that a former street gang member recently took the Bunche diplomacy as a
model for successfully negotiating a truce between the Bloods and the Crips
in Los Angeles. After Suez, UNEF became the most popular army in the world
with its theme song 'Don't Fence Me In'.
The sadness was that when President Nasser asked the UN forces to go in
1967, no one stood up to him. The Russians backed Nasser, the US did not
press Israel to keep calm, and the ambassadors representing the UNEF
participants said that the decision was up to the Egyptians. Worse than war
followed: U Thant, then the UN Secretary General, and Bunche were blamed for
their feebleness and peacekeeping was discredited.
Bunche spent much of the rest of his life wondering if more could have been
done, but concluded that without the support of the majority of the UN
members, UN officials were impotent. And as Brian Urquhart, who was to
become Bunche's successor, remarks in this biography, the Six Day War meant
that much of Bunche's life work was destroyed within a few days.
Bunche died in 1971, spending his last few years working on civil rights.
This was an old cause. In 1941 he had successfully picketed the National
Theatre, Washington for refusing to allow blacks admission to Porgy and
Bess. Nearly 20 years later he was given the key to the City of Birmingham,
Alabama, then refused a room in a local hotel. Yet he never campaigned as a
demagogue, simply as a black American demanding equality.

THE MASTER OF PETERSBURG by J M Coetzee Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99, 250
pages
John Coetzee is a Capetonian academic who writes slim novels of
extraordinary power. Dusklands, in 1974, was a touch experimental - two
linked novellas announced his fascination with what his next book was to
describe as 'the barbarous frontier'. That second book, In The Heart Of The
Country, drew strength from its remote South African setting and even relied
on a fair amount of Afrikaans dialogue.
The masterpiece arrived soon: Waiting For The Barbarians, his 1980 tale of
the sympathetic magistrate who governs a remote district between 'the
Empire' and the encroaching 'barbarians'. Life And Times Of Michael K, a
terrifying fable of a simple, hare-lipped gardener caught up in a South
African civil war won him the Booker Prize. Next came Age Of Iron - an
unforgettable story of a woman dying of cancer attended by an alcoholic
vagrant who becomes her angel of death - and Foe, a break with South Africa,
an ingenious re-telling of the story of 'Cruso', Friday and 'Daniel Defo'.
The Master Of Petersburg also proclaims its distance from South Africa
(though its theme of the great novelist harassed by the secret police can
hardly be accidental). It is, I suggest, a first faltering of a huge talent:
a disappointment. The narrator is Dostoyevsky, the year 1869, and the writer
has returned from exile to St Petersburg in response to the death - suicide?
murder? - of his beloved stepson.
The narrator discovers that the young man has been associated with a group
of anarchists led by a certain Sergei Nechayev. The police confiscate first
the stepson's papers, containing a list of assassination targets, and then
his father's passport. 'Dostoyevsky' becomes involved with his landlady, and
with her precocious girl-child Matryona, 'a conductor of souls'.
Evidently we are in the world of The Devils (sometimes called The
Possessed), which Dostoyevsky started to write in the same 1869. Nechayev
was indeed a young nihilist, a disciple of Bakunin and the probable model
for Peter Verkhovensky in The Devils. It is known that Dostoyevsky was aware
of the conspiracy of the 'Society of National Retribution' led by Nechayev -
he used it for the novel.
At this point Coetzee's re-writing of history becomes irritating, even
perverse. The fact is that the real-life stepson, Pavel, was not killed
either by the police or by his fellow conspirators - he was to survive his
real-life stepfather. Dostoyevsky never met Nechayev (although their
relationship is central to The Master Of Petersburg). He did not return to
Russia until 1871. He was not a inclined to paedophilia.
True, Coetzee gives us elements of a portrait of Dostoyevsky: references to
Poor Folk and Crime And Punishment; epileptic attacks; the Siberian exile;
the gambling obsession; 'fathers and sons: foes: foes to the death'; and
hints of some of the Russian writer's higher themes. There is also a sense
of Kafka-esque menace that has been a frequent feature of Coetzee's work.
Above all, this is a book about desperate tragedy and distress.
What is the point of this re-imagining, this re-arrangement, of
Dostoyevsky's life history? I suspect that there is a private sub-text which
it would be impertinent to investigate. Taken as a fiction, there is a
fascination in the portrait of a society in which one's fate is determined
by bureaucrats and policemen, in which extreme poverty co-exists with
autocracy and luxury, in which dedicated young political activists are
prepared to give their lives to change the social order. But it would have
seemed hard to imagine Coetzee writing a dull, inert book about Dostoyevsky.
Perhaps The Master Of Petersburg should best be seen as a fine writer's
hommage to The Devils.

TED HUGHES: WINTER POLLEN edited by William Scammell Faber &amp; Faber Pounds
17.50, 465 pages
It is hard to think of a poet whose poetry finds its counterpart more
exactly in the drawings of an artist than does Ted Hughes's work in that of
the engraver Leonard Baskin. The only parallel case that comes to mind is
the inter-action between the work of Blake the poet and Blake the
draughtsman.
It was, we learn from Winter Pollen (a collection of Hughes's prose pieces
written over the past 30 years), an invitation from Baskin to make a book
with him about crows that inspired the first of the Crow poems. The squat
visceral emblematic bird drawn by Baskin glared beadily from the jacket of
Hughes's Crow in 1970, and has remained a numinous presence in Hughes's mind
ever since.
One of the pieces printed here, 'The Hanged Man and the Dragonfly' is the
introduction Hughes wrote in 1984 to Baskin's Collected Prints. He speaks
there of 'the rich inwardness of Baskin's art' and he relates it to the
Hasidic tradition of Jewish mysticism that Baskin, son of an American rabbi,
inherited. In a piece on Isaac Bashevis Singer he sees the key to his work
as being the collapse of the Hasidic way of life under the pressure in the
20th century.
This is but one strand of a wider perspective on mystical tradition that is
gained from this book. Hughes has an insatiable interest in all forms of
illumination. Books like TC Lethbridge's Ghost and Divining Rod (1963),
Mircea Eliade's Shamanism (1964), Turville Petre's Myth and Religion of the
North (1964), John Greenaway's Literature Among the Primitives (1964), open
windows for Hughes into worlds beyond the rational about which he is
brilliantly articulate. The choice of fellow-poets whose work he discusses
admiringly is just as revealing. They include Wilfred Owen, Keith Douglas,
Dylan Thomas, the Serbian poet Vasko Popa and the Hungarian poet Janos
Pilinsky.
There are also several articles about the work of his wife, Sylvia Plath. In
trying to understand the controversy that still surrounds her death it is
useful to have reprinted here Hughes's 'Publishing Sylvia Plath'. More
enlightening however in understanding her work are his informed comments on
her method of writing and poetic technique, especially the article in which
he traces the genesis of her poem 'Sheep in Fog'.
Poets of the illustrious English past form yet another large swathe of this
wide-ranging book. In a section on metre where Hughes locates instances of
Manley Hopkins's 'sprung rhythm' in English verse at least as early as
Chaucer, Hughes demonstrates how all the editors from Tottel to Tillyard
have scanned the poetry of the Elizabethan Sir Thomas Wyatt incorrectly.
Hughes's effort to discover a unifying theme throughout Shakespeare's work
were given in a book published in 1992 (it received the thumbs down from
most of its baffled reviewers).
Hughes propounds a thesis of such magnitude, spanning Venus and Adonis and
The Rape of Lucrece at one end and King Lear and The Tempest at the other,
that initially it seems much too audacious, summary and tortuous to
contemplate. But taken here in small doses extracted by William Scammell, it
offers perceptions about Shakespeare's reaction to the English Reformation
that are wholly new and surely valid.
Some of these longer explorations are, it must be said, difficult to follow.
As a literary critic Hughes does not have the incisive expository power
demonstrated in his prose work by TS Eliot. On the other hand when Hughes
turns the focus inward to his own work he writes with sensitivity and utter
clarity about the mysteries of the poetic process.

SEASONS IN HELL: UNDERSTANDING BOSNIA'S WAR by Ed Vulliamy Simon &amp; Schuster
Pounds 6.99, 370 pages
BOSNIA: A SHORT HISTORY by Noel Malcolm Macmillan Pounds 17.50, 340 pages
WHY BOSNIA: WRITINGS ON THE BALKAN WAR edited by Rabia Ali and Lawrence
Liftschultz Pamphleteer's Press
Some might see a glimmer of hope in developments in Washington this week.
But Ed Vulliamy's accounts of the brutal killing and destruction by the
Croats of the western Bosnian city of Mostar suggest that the prospect of
peace between Croats and Moslems is remote.
His unremitting catalogue of evil and deception races through the war zones
in eastern Croatia, where Serbs and Croats pounded each other's villages and
towns, to central Bosnia, where Vulliamy joins a crowd of dispossessed
Moslems forced to join the thousands of other Moslems and Bosnian citizens
fleeing the war zones. His images hark back to the second world war when
Jews, gypsies and communists were sent to the concentration camps.
Vulliamy, more intent on conveying the horror of war than explaining why the
former Yugoslavia collapsed into chaos, blames the Serbs and the
'international community' for starting and prolonging the killing
respectively.
This view is shared by Noel Malcolm, whose book, though sometimes uneven in
judgment, is nonetheless an excellent account of the political culture
underpinning Bosnia. It was, as he explains, a land caught between the
ambitions of the old Serb, Ottoman and Habsburg Empires, a situation which
helped to create a rich and exotic range of dialects and traditions.
Nowhere was this more obvious than in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. For
centuries the inhabitants of this cosmopolitan city of Moslems and
Catholics, Orthodox and Jews, Turks and Bulgars, co-existed. This apparent
oasis of tolerance, as well as the economic potential of Bosnia, was quickly
recognised by Benjamin Kallay, the enlightened Habsburg minister of finance
sent from Vienna to run the country after it was placed under
Austro-Hungarian rule in 1878.
Kallay also recognised the emerging tensions between the prosperous, largely
urban Moslem middle-classes and the rural Serbs, many of whom had migrated
from other parts of the Balkans, but his administration failed to stem the
rise of nationalist sentiment. It was this sentiment which sparked off the
first world war after the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand by Gavrilo
Princip, a Serb nationalist, in 1914.
As to the current war, Malcolm - like Vulliamy and the contributors to
Writings on the Balkan War - falls short of tackling its causes and the
potential instability of Bosnia.
All three books suggest that the disintegration of Bosnia was due largely to
external factors. But it is Vulliamy who comes closest to showing how
Croatia, as well as Serbia, had designs on carving up Bosnia. Once Germany
pushed through the recognition of Slovenia and Croatia in January 1992, any
chance of a negotiated settlement for the peaceful disintegration - or
redefinition - of the Yugoslav federation collapsed.
In the event, Bosnia not only became the chosen pawn of President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, but its
legitimacy was undermined since its territorial integrity had been
inextricably linked to the existence of the Yugoslav federation.
There are many reasons, not fully explained by these books, as to why the
European Union did not act sooner. One was the persistence of historical
alliances. Paris, London, and Athens were sympathetic to the Serbs, while
Germany, in an uncomfortable echo of its wartime support of the Nazi-backed
Ustasha regime in Croatia, backed Zagreb, capital of the Croat Republic.
This prevented consensus on how to deal with the first break up of a
multi-ethnic state in the post-communist world.
The European Union and the US also held the misguided view that the Yugoslav
federation had to be kept together at all costs, for fear that its
fragmentation would serve as a precedent for the Soviet Union, then still in
existence. But as Malcolm rightly asks: why did Europe, when it finally
recognised the independence of Bosnia, do nothing to defend it?
There is another, more complex explanation as to the EU's failure to
interpret the nationalist signals from Belgrade and Zagreb as early as 1987,
when Milosevic was catapulted into power as head of the Serbian communist
party.
Since 1945, the role of memory, underpinned by guilt and shame, had helped
to shape European culture. The countries of western Europe slowly came to
terms with what happened in the second world war and memory was gradually
merged with the politics of forgetting. In communist-dominated eastern
Europe, however, history was re-written and memory became a tool of regimes
which manipulated the past and destroyed the region's weak democratic
traditions.
The war in the former Yugoslavia was about the revival, and selective
exploitation of memory, juxtaposed with western Europe's profound need to
forget. The clash of these two psychological processes have tragically
prolonged the war in Bosnia. Western Europe, as these books rightly
conclude, is paying the price for failing to provide assistance to ensure
that post-communist Europe could reclaim its painful memories quietly.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Arts: Great painters of patronage - William Packer reviews
Gainsboroughs and Reynolds in the Royal Collections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contrasts in Royal Patronage may be its sub-title, but the contrasts
presented in this latest exhibition from the Royal Collections are of more
than the one sort. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds were the two
pre-eminent English artists of the 18th century, more or less
contemporaries, both of them successful in their careers, and patronised
alike at Court. Yet together they were as chalk and cheese, not enemies
exactly but certainly rivals. One was equable in temperament and of steady
application to his work, the other more volatile and inconsistent. Reynolds
was the first President and pillar of the Academy, Gainsborough the
quarrelsome founder member who at last would have nothing to do with it.
How nice the irony that it should have been the urbane and reliable Reynolds
whom the conventional and proper-minded George III and his Queen, Charlotte,
could hardly stand, the more raffish Gainsborough whom they adored. But
personal preference never got in the way of the business of collecting, for
the King bought and commissioned from both artists regardless. The
infinitely more rakish George IV, as Prince of Wales, got on equally well
with both of them and continued to collect their works long after their
deaths.
It was Prinny indeed who acquired from Reynolds' niece, Lady Thomond, the
two important mythological pieces, the 'Death of Dido' and 'Cymon and
Iphigenia', each with its central, voluptuous reclining female nude. He had
long had the small enamel copies of them, by Henry Bone, hanging in his
private bedroom at Carlton House. These are late and unusual works in the
oeuvre, representing as they do the ambition common to so many artists of
the time, to succeed as a painter of history, which was to be considered a
painter of the highest sort. They had been hanging obscurely within the
Royal collection for many years and their reappearance now, newly cleaned,
is the chief surprise of the show.
'Damn him, how various he is', said Gainsborough of Reynolds, and it is
clear that the two men had a real if sometimes somewhat puzzled admiration
for each other. 'He often wondered at Reynolds' equal application', said one
of Gainsborough's daughters, having remarked how her father 'often exceeded
the bounds of temperance and his Health suffered from it, being occasionally
unable to work for a week afterwards.' Reynolds, for his part, thought
Gainsborough 'had a painter's eye but not a painter's mind,' yet had finally
to concede that the painter was there nonetheless. 'It is certain that all
those odd scribbles and marks . . . so observable in Gainsborough . . .
appear rather the effect of accident than design', yet 'this chaos . . . by
a kind of magic, at a certain distance assumes form . . . so that we can
hardly refuse acknowledging the full effect of diligence, under the
appearance of chance and hasty negligence.'
Such contrast, as demonstrated in the work itself, is the true subject of
this exhibition. There is Reynolds, himself magnificently diligent, the
master of the full-length and theatrical machine - 'The Marquess of Granby',
the bald and booted C-in-C, off at the wars; 'The Duke of York' resplendent
in his Garter robes. He is no less impressive on a smaller, more intimate
scale. He was, as some artists are - Rembrandt, Van Gogh, David - a constant
self-portraitist, and the late image of himself, grey-haired, red-cheeked
and bespectacled, is the most delicate and touching painting in the show.
And there is Gainsborough, all light and air, the brush flicking and dusting
across the surface of the canvas, conjuring form and texture, flesh and
blood out of nothing in just the way that Reynolds found so bemusing.
According to James Northcote, a pupil of Reynolds, the lovely state portrait
of Queen Charlotte was 'actual motion, and done with such light, airy
facility'. Even more spectacular in this respect is the three-quarter length
of the Duchess of Cumberland, the head and hair perfectly realised and the
rest, sleeves, dress and bodice, a calligraphic tour-de-force, at once
unfinished and as effectively descriptive as could be.
Gainsborough in 1788, dying of a tumour in the neck, sent word to Reynolds,
begging 'a last favour, which is to come under my Roof and look at my things
. . . if what I ask now is not disagreeable to your feeling . . .' Reynolds
came and the two were reconciled, 'any little jealousies . . . forgotten in
those moments of sincerity.' It is a nice story.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Arts: Curtain up on Newcastle - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Shakespeare Company is playing away this month, enjoying its
annual visit to Newcastle. Following it north is Peter Brook, with his new
play The Man Who. In May comes the Maly Drama Theatre of St Petersburg, and
the premiere of a Michael Clark dance work. All this in Newcastle?
The city fathers may not have digested the message from Birmingham, Glasgow
and Manchester that the arts can be an economic stimulant. But the Arts
Council and its satrap on the spot, Northern Arts, are filling the breach,
providing funding for the high-calibre visiting companies and aiding the
revitalisation of Northern Stage.
Two years ago, the company was in a parlous state. Alan Lyddiard was brought
in from Glasgow as artistic director and his first task was to take control
of the Playhouse Theatre. Now he has created the first Newcastle
International Festival of Theatre. He thinks in terms of consortia and
packages, and plans a Nordic Arts festival, uniting theatres in Derry,
Newcastle, across Scandinavia and St Petersburg, where Northern Stage plans
to perform Animal Farm next year.
The one established cultural beacon in Newcastle occupies an inaccessible
prefab under one of the Tyne bridges. From this suitably modest spot Neil
Astley runs Bloodaxe, which over the last two years has doubled its sales to
become the leading publisher of contemporary poetry in the UK.
About 50 books are published a year. Half make money; half do not, but with
poetry now appearing on Radio One and public readings by poets assuming the
appeal of pop concerts, Bloodaxe is on a high.
With established poets RS Thomas and Tony Harrison, rap poet Benjamin
Zephaniah and pop poet Joolz on its list, Bloodaxe looks like the first
specialist poetry publisher in the land to flourish for generations. It
still needs Pounds 66,000 from Northern Arts to cover the cost of the poets
that take years to move into the black. The hundred unsolicited manuscripts
that arrive each week on Astley's desk cannot be ignored. It was this pile
that yielded Glyn Maxwell's earlier work.
Across the Tyne, Gateshead has always felt itself the poor relation to
Newcastle. But it has plans to show its innate superiority with two
ambitious plans for the visual arts.
At the entrance to the town, on the A1, Gateshead is proposing to erect a
mammoth metal sculpture of an angel, designed by Anthony Gormley and cast by
British Steel. It will be 150ft high with a wing span of 60ft. It should be
ready by in two years time, when the northern region becomes the Arts
Council's key venue for the Year of the Visual Arts. The work will cost at
least Pounds 150,000 but Gateshead is confident that trusts, sponsors and
British Steel will contribute to make the project possible.
By 1996 Gateshead also hopes to have opened part of the region's largest art
gallery, the converted Baltic Flour Mill on the banks of the Tyne. This is
the north east's main candidate for Millennium Fund money from the Lottery.
It will cost around Pounds 10m to convert the mill into a gallery, which
will be used for visiting exhibitions. Lord Palumbo, outgoing chairman of
the Arts Council, and Nick Serota of the Tate are enthusiastic about the
project. The only problem is that the ledges beneath the roof provide
protected perches for kittihawks which apparently are protected and take
priority over art.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Arts: Edinburgh's new opera house - The stage will be larger
than Covent Garden's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cynics who maintain that Edinburgh is only committed to the performing
arts during its annual festival would receive a shock if they ventured up to
Nicolson Street, not far from the city's Royal Mile. About 200 construction
workers are putting the finishing touches to a new opera house. The
Edinburgh Festival Theatre, as it will be called, will open to the public on
June 25 with a performance of Wagner's Tristan and Isolde by Scottish and
Welsh Operas.
People have been campaigning for the creation of an opera house in Edinburgh
since the late 1940s. Now Scotland's capital is to get an opera house
seating up to 1,900 people with a stage that will be slightly larger than
that of Covent Garden. It will meet all the modern requirements of comfort,
space and convenience for both audience and performers.
Although it will fulfill the technical needs of an opera house, its
promoters prefer to call it a lyric theatre. Despite its name it is not
under the wing of the Edinburgh International Festival, though it will be
used by the Festival to stage productions by international opera companies,
which Edinburgh's existing theatres have been unable to accommodate.
With the Festival Theatre open, Scottish Opera and Scottish Ballet are to
double the number of weeks they spend in Edinburgh each year, and other
British opera and ballet companies will visit, along with drama companies
such as the Royal National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company. But
there will also be musicals, variety evenings, concerts and ice shows. Paul
Iles, the general manager, was previously general manager of the Grand
Theatre in Blackpool.
By spending about Pounds 21m Edinburgh will get a theatre that would have
cost about Pounds 50m or Pounds 60m to build from scratch, because the new
theatre is an upgrading and expansion of the old Empire Theatre, which was
first opened in 1892 and used for bingo since 1963. Its greatest asset is
the breadth of its auditorium, which puts the entire audience closer to the
stage than is normally possible in such a big theatre. The new project
leaves the auditorium largely unchanged.
However the architects, the Law and Dunbar-Naismith Partnership of
Edinburgh, have designed a much larger stage. There is a rear scene dock
which can either be separated from the main stage with an acoustic door for
the unloading of scenery, or opened up for exceptionally deep stage vistas.
The new stage is three times the size of its Edinburgh counterparts, the
King's Theatre or the Playhouse.
The upgrading has involved constructing a new stage house and a wider and
higher fly tower, building hospitality rooms alongside the auditorium and a
new glass entrance. Unfinished, the building already gives a impression of
spaciousness and light.
The Festival Theatre project became possible when the Empire Theatre came
onto the market at a knockdown price and the public and private sectors
coalesced under the prodding of Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise to fund the
project. About Pounds 16m has come from official bodies led by the local
authorities.
The private sector has put in Pounds 4m, with the Royal Bank of Scotland,
Scottish Power and United Distillers big corporate donors. The theatre will
be a non-profit distributing trust, and is raising the last Pounds 1m by
offering individual and corporate membership of a Founders Circle which will
provide priority booking for ten years in return for Pounds 2,500.
Iles will reveal the Edinburgh Festival Theatre's programme for its first
six months on April 7. But the key question is whether the city can absorb
the 20 per cent increase in theatre capacity which the new venue, with 68
separate productions in 1994, will bring.
Edinburgh already has a quarter of the seats that the West End of London
has, but only seven per cent of London's population. 'We will have to market
ourselves very hard,' Iles acknowledges.
The Festival Theatre will cooperate in programming with the other Edinburgh
venues such as including the Edinburgh Playhouse and the King's Theatre in
order to avoid obvious clashes between similar productions. But the theatres
are all in competition with each other. 'How things work out depends a lot
on how they respond to us. Every theatre could fail, including us,' says
Iles.
Some might think that adding more capacity at a time when several theatres
south of the border have closed is over-ambitious. But they may be
underestimating Edinburgh's determination to prove the cynics wrong.
Details of the Founders' Circle are available from Marianne Everett,
Edinburgh Festival Theatre, Nicolson Street, Edinburgh EH8 9BE. Tel 031 662

FT  05 MAR 94 / Arts: The birth of American song - Richard Fairman enjoys
Thomas Hampson's recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even France can see no threat from American classical music. While
legislation keeps a limit on American films in the cinema and television
programmes over the airwaves, there is little sign that the amount of
serious music from the US is likely to stake a significant place for itself
anywhere in Europe.
The Wigmore Hall has called its month's recital series 'Discover American
Song', which presupposes (no doubt rightly) that most people have heard very
little of it. Throughout March a group of top American singers looks set to
draw good audiences on the strength of their names, if not that of the
music. On Wednesday Thomas Hampson proved the ideal exponent for a series
like this - not just a fine recitalist, but adventurous and imaginative.
The history of American song tells of a slow severing of the umbilical cord
that formed the link to the country's cultural forebears in Europe. In the
early days some American composers thought that writing art-songs meant
trying to sound German, even sometimes setting German poetry. It took a
generation or two to develop a distinctive style, which could be popularist,
jazzy, bluesy, multi-cultural in the best American sense.
The programme devised by Hampson followed the birth of the all-American
song. As befits a singer who has become virtually an honorary German when it
comes to performing Lieder, he started with an American composer who wrote
German songs. Among Charles Griffes's early songs are settings of Heine and
Lenau, music from the high noon of romanticism for which Hampson's big and
beautiful baritone voice is perfectly suited.
Unlike some opera-singers, Hampson never misjudged the Wigmore's friendly
acoustics. A group of songs to poems by Walt Whitman gathered together
varied musical personalities, who showed what this luxurious voice can do.
Bridge's 'The last Invocation' was tenderly wafted, as the poem demands;
Neidlinger's 'Memories of Lincoln' spanned the sentimental and the heroic
with equal success. In Bernstein and Ives, composers who are American to the
core, he made every word count.
Is Hampson the all-American singer? Relaxed, open-hearted, supremely
self-confident, he stands on the recital platform proud and tall as the
Empire State Building. It is difficult to imagine many other singers who
would dare try to bring off Paul Bowles's Blue Mountain Ballads, a quartet
of Tennessee Williams' poems which blaze with the heat of the deep South,
but Hampson has no inhibitions. With Craig Rutenberg's help at the piano, he
made them a tour de force. An impressive evening.
Further recitals in the series on March 6, 15, 25 and 29

FT  05 MAR 94 / Arts: Fun with fish out of water - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifteen-odd years ago, in the dawn of 'high-concept' thinking, Hollywood
suddenly had a brainwave. 'Fish out of water]' it cried, smiting its brow at
a power breakfast somewhere on Sunset Boulevard. It had had the idea for a
surefire plot device. This was to throw the main characters of movies into
alien environments or predicaments to see what happened.
Passing for an original notion, this caused 1980s cinema to be plagued with
wacky whimsies like Three Men And A Baby and Good Morning Vietnam. But the
well-schooled movie buff, unlike the rulers of Tinseltown, knows that every
good story is basically a fish-out-of-water one anyway.
Look at March's video releases. Old movies and new draw their panache from
the spectacle of characters out of their depth or element. For cinema has
always used its magic carpet facility - geographical or geo-spiritual - to
catalyse characters into a new awareness.
Some thrash for sexual survival, like Glenn Ford thrown on the cruel mercies
of now-married ex-girlfriend Rita Hayworth in the incomparable 'noir'
thriller Gilda (Columbia TriStar). This sizzles all the way up to and beyond
Miss H's famous glove-striptease as she sings 'Put the blame on Mame': a
sequence which seems to get into every history-of-Hollywood documentary.
Other heroes and heroines gulp more comically for air, like Cary Grant and
Irene Dunne as the married squabblers thrown from yesterday's bliss into
today's divorce proceedings in the 1937 screwball classic The Awful Truth
(Columbia TriStar); or like the all-star guests of Grand Hotel (Warner), who
include John and Lionel Barrymore and a Greta Garbo who actually says here
her famous tag-line about 'vaunting to be a-lawn.'
Other characters in film history show there can be a grimmer tragedy in
displacement: like the homesick soldiers of Renoir's La Grande Illusion
(Arthouse), the greatest of anti-war films; or like the aristocrat's
daughter (Louise Brooks) thrown into brothel, then reform school, in GW
Pabst's powerful, Lulu-esque cautionary tale from 1929 Diary Of A Lost Girl
(Tartan).
But Hollywood was right in one sense. The fish-out-of-water idea is at its
best in comedy. This month four leap to your attention. Much Ado About
Nothing (Entertainment) is one of those typical Bardic comedies where a
gaggle of English-sounding wits is found wandering for no good reason around
Italy. But how witty they are in Kenneth Branagh's film. Master Ken and Miss
Em speak the verse with relish; the improbably cast Americans excel (Denzel
Washington, Michael Keaton, Keanu Reeves); and the scenery (Tuscany for
Shakespeare's Sicily) offers the kind of burnished, beautiful terra firma
where few fish could resist jumping out of their native element.
For an American pairing of f-out-of-w comedies, what better than In The Soup
(Tartan) and El Mariachi (20: 20)? The first is about an aspiring film-maker
(Steve Buscemi) pushed by funding needs into the arms of a Mafia boss
(Seymour Cassel) with his own delusions of movie-making genius. (A modern
screwball comedy and a good one). The second film is a high-style parody
Western directed by Robert Rodriguez as if he had overdosed on the movies of
Sergio Leone. Its hero stumbles into a mistaken-identity imbroglio as
intricate as, and funnier than, Shakespeare's Comedy Of Errors.
But to conclude, what is comedy of disorientation without Tony Hancock? Fans
should rejoice that his 1963 film The Rebel (Lumiere) has at last come to
video, in which our East Cheam cultural climber goes to Paris to become an
artist. In short order he meets Salvador Dali lookalike Dennis Price, is
corrupted by dealer George Sanders, has a series of cherishably daft
Hancockian monologues, and finally returns home to his muse, inspiration and
landlady, the lovely Irene Handl. Vintage.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Arts: A flawed but fabulous Peer - Alastair Macaulay on
Yukio Ninagawa's staging of Ibsen's classic play
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mesmerising, pretentious, bold, gimmicky, revelatory, exasperating - Yukio
Ninagawa's staging of Ibsen's Peer Gynt has arrived at the Barbican, fresh
from its world premiere at the Winter Olympics, and ready to visit
Manchester and Tokyo.
It is, at every level, full of contradictions. It uses both sophisticated
video effects and old-fashioned two-dimensional scenery. The text used is an
audacious new translation by Frank McGuinness, but some important roles (the
Troll King, the Buttonmoulder) are played by foreign actors whose diction
blurs important lines; there are some beautiful performances - yet the
constant air-conditioning whirr renders their softer lines inaudible. But
the main performances carry the show.
Ninagawa's overruling gimmick is to begin and end Peer Gynt in a modern-day
cityscape, with street noise and rock music and neon signs. Peer Gynt is a
lone dreamer amid all this Babel. Rolling video fantasias - his fantasies -
appear on a scrim: the planet turning in space, an onion revolving. Masterly
stuff, but what follows is simpler and finer. Through the scrim, we see
Peer, now hero of his own daydreams; and his daydreams are the wild,
psycho-spiritual folk tale of Ibsen's play, into which Ninagawa plunges us
so keenly (most of the time) that it becomes a bore whenever the production
returns to its video effects accompanied by tepid Jap-pop muzak by Ryudo
Uzaki.
Peer himself is 25-year-old Michael Sheen, whose tour de force performance
is the heart of the whole production. The entry he makes in the third scene
 -zooming on through the crowd, leaping up onto a table and vaulting right
off it again, legs wide apart, curly-maned - sums up his exhilarating,
tearaway, Puckish force. In Acts I, II and III, he is a light-voiced, Welsh
country boy, his eyes alight with youth and fancy; in Act IV he plays at
being a mature English toff, a debonair poseur abroad; and in Act V he is a
weary old man, his voice heavy, dark, his eyes anguished and lost. This is
sensational, heart-catching acting.
The wedding scene into which he comes over that table is the most marvellous
of all. Long before the bridegroom speaks, he is brilliantly impinged on our
minds - feckless, knock-kneed, drunken and forlorn, unable to find his
bride, pathetically copying Peer. (He tries to vault the table, and fails.)
When Solveig (Catherine White) arrives, quiet and soft-spoken with haunting
Meryl Streep cheekbones, she is shyly luminous. Then Ase, Peer's mother
(excellent Paola Dionisotti) enters, angry, loyal and defensive, leaning on
a stick yet furiously kicking her heels in the air. Wonderful, every bit of
it.
By making the Nordic scenes Irish, McGuinness's translation catches the
resemblance of the first three acts to the naive ebullience of Playboy of
the Western World. There are a few needless liberties; but this version
conveys the play's wonderful mixture of colloquialism and metaphysical
poetry.
Too bad that the trolls are crummy Kabuki gonks; and that the rake's
progress scenes of Act IV are (Ibsen's fault) too long; and that there is no
great tension to the Buttonmoulder scenes in Act V. All Peer's human
relationships are vividly achieved. Glorious to see how both Peer and his
mother have the same way of hitting out at the air; how, after Peer has
knocked himself out by charging into a wall, the Green Woman comes jumping
on, over his supine body; and how old Solveig rests the aged Peer's head on
her breast as she sings him a lullaby - the mother to this prodigal son, the
Gretchen to this Faust. Flawed; and fabulous.
At the Barbican until March 12; at the Palace Theatre, Manchester, March
17-19; and at the Ginza Saison Theatre, Tokyo, April 20, for 10
performances.

<TEXT>
European Capital of Culture is a pass-the-parcel game in which each year a
different city gets the title, and a little European Union cash, and
encourages the world to come and unwrap it.
Some years the world yawns - it was pointless giving the accolade to Paris
and Madrid, who largely ignored the event. Some years it has a real impact.
Glasgow, the UK's choice in 1991, has retained its unlikely reputation as an
artistic power-house, and in 1993 Antwerp attracted 10m visitors to its
vigorous programme of culture as a global band-aid.
This year Lisbon gets the laurels, although, as always, some poison ivy has
crept in. These events have a ritual: great local pride and excitement,
ambitious plans, and then a nasty wrangle about who picks up the bill for
the party, which in this case is estimated at over Pounds 30m.
In Lisbon the socialist mayor has come up with his contribution but the
conservative government is still blustering. The delays have caused
cancellations - of a production of Carmen and a planned exhibition by
Portugal's most celebrated contemporary artist, the London based Paula Rego.
But once this inevitable wrangling by politicians is accepted Lisbon has
much going for it.
It is the right size; it has enough, but not excessive, cultural heritage to
promote; it is an individualistic, friendly, place. Also, being European
Capital of Culture will help Lisbon, stuck on the Western extremity of the
continent and historically looking out to the ocean, shift temporarily to
the centre of the action. For almost 500 years the mainstream has passed it
by. Being Cultural Capital will not change that, but at least it makes the
locals think it might.
Naturally Lisbon is exploiting the title to undertake some necessary
renovation. Surprise, surprise, the docks area needs regeneration; the
picturesque Seventh Hill sector of crumbling 18th and 19th century mansions
is being converted into a cultural ghetto; museums are being spruced up; and
the main concert hall, the Coliseu, has been transformed into a cross
between the Albert Hall and a circus ring.
It was in the Coliseu that the year was officially launched last Saturday.
The event set the mood for Lisbon 94. As the grandees, all fur coats and
small cigars, jammed the tiny street, scores of clowns from theatre group 'O
Bando' hurled abuse at them from balconies and windows. Lisbon's culture
will have a vigorous populist ring, with massive coverage given to fado (an
exhibition, scholarly books, definitive recordings) and to cinema, including
the best 100 European films ever, shown over 100 days.
But if the opening concert was the signal for the locals to flock to the all
night bars and firework displays, it also showed that Lisbon looks to other
Europeans for cultural back up. The soloist on Saturday was Portuguese, the
pianist Pedro Burmester with a sensitive performance of Beethoven's' Emperor
concerto, but the orchestra was the LSO under Solti.
During the year the LPO, the Concertgebouw, the Munich Philharmonic and the
Czech Philharmonic will be among the visiting musicians, and Merce
Cunningham and Pina Bausch among the imported dance troupes. Even the
Portuguese admit that their operatic tradition is diminuendo. This can have
a positive side, as they will see for the first time productions of Peter
Grimes, Medee, and The Makropoulos Case, among other operas.
If the performing arts offer curiosities rather than mega events, visually
Lisbon is on a high. This is the city of ornate Manuelist architecture, and
the domestic tile, the azulejo, which glorifies so many buildings. Lisbon
intends the city to be an artifact in its own right, the setting in which
the restored museums present shows to attract the globally curious. The idea
is to start with the traditional and end with the contemporary, fusing them
in May with what looks like a stunning idea, an exhibition built around a
major work by Hieronymus Bosch 'The Temptations of St Anthony', and
revealing how it influenced the surrealist movement.
This week the programme got off to a significant start with an exhibition of
Angolan art. Here sculpture marries mythology through the rarest objects
brought back in the 19th century by missionaries and merchants from the
former Portuguese colony. It is the most spectacular gathering of the
heritage from this part of Africa assembled. The religious power of the
masks and carvings, which hardly disguise their sacrificial force, is as
great as their artistic imagination. They are more mysterious and foreign
than the passive images from further north in Africa which inspired Picasso.
In September comes 'The Day After Tomorrow', where the leading Portuguese
artists will hang alongside their international contemporaries. It offers an
excellent opportunity to distinguish the particular Portuguese character,
more serious, more reserved, than their Mediterranean neighbours.
In the 16th century the avant-garde came to Lisbon to be on hand when the
ships battled back with the first trawl of the wealth of Africa, Brazil,
India, China and Japan. The hope is that they will return in 1994. European
Capitals of Culture ideally fulfil two ambitions. They should draw in the
culturally inclined from overseas, who like their travel to contain some
spiritual discovery. They should also help the locals to find out more about
their community, past and present.
In most cases it leads to a great deal of noise signifying very little.
Lisbon has the advantage that any investment in the arts will make up for
years of indifference. It also has clear ideas about its domestic ambitions.
It wants the people to re-discover the Tagus, the river which was the source
of its prosperity and its pride, and it wants its idiosyncratic heritage to
be better known at home. The discriminating foreigner will make the trip
this year, but the real gain will be the laying of foundations which offer
the chance of a national renaissance. This will be built not only around the
restored buildings, but also in the comprehensive recordings of its music
from the 13th century onwards onwards, and in its literature.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Collecting: Maastricht turns up Trumps - Susan Moore looks
forward to this international fair which opens next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drastic changes were anticipated at this year's European Fine Art Fair at
Maastricht. The fair, which celebrates its 10th anniversary in its present
form, was to have implemented its long discussed 'rationalisation'.
Unsurprisingly, two improvements have proved too difficult to implement: the
re-organisation of the vast and labyrinthine floorplan at the Maastricht
Exhibition and Congress Centre (MECC), and a corresponding cut in the number
of stands.
'There were something like 16 proposals for different floorplans,' explains
board member Ben Janssens of London's Oriental Art Gallery. 'None met with
the exhibitors' universal approval.' So, the 'Union Jack' layout is still
with us - an ironic if unwitting motif for the town of the much maligned
treaty. As for the fair's reduction in size, it is a measure of its
commercial success that hardly any exhibitors could be persuaded to pull
out.
Happily, the reformers have made some progress in tackling the fair's one
weak line: contemporary art. No longer will one have to run the gauntlet
through a hotch-potch of dismal stands of unedifying, predominantly Dutch
contemporary art to enter the fair proper. Great effort has gone into
improving the quality of the exhibitors and the appearance of this area and,
crucially, the emphasis has moved away from contemporary art to the
established modern masters.
This year a number of leading international dealers have been lured to the
fair, largely thanks to the good offices of Leslie Waddington, who was
invited to join the Maastricht board last year. The Mayor Gallery, for
instance, from London has come with Roy Lichtenstein and Paul Delvaux;
Galerie Kaj Formsblom of Zurich has brought late Picasso and Miro and to
mark the 50th anniversary of Mondrian's death, Borzo of 's-Hertogenbosch
presents no less than 50 paintings by the Dutch master. The Marlborough
stand shows Bacon and Kokoschka; and Waddington, who was astonished by the
amount of business he did last year, offers a brutalist Appel and Dubuffet.
The improvements bode well for the fair, but Waddington believes it will
take two or three years to make Maastricht the pre-eminent modern art fair.
It is vastly to the organisers' credit - and a major factor of Maastricht's
continuing success - that it is genuinely and relentlessly self-critical.
Maastricht can also claim to be the one truly international art and antiques
fair - quite different from a national fair with a few distinguished foreign
guests to add extra cachet. The 1994 event comprises some 149 major dealers
from 10 countries. Almost half of last year's 40,000 visitors came from
outside The Netherlands.
Here, the emphasis is on content rather than presentation. The advantage
gained by low exhibiting costs is the profusion of large-scale glorious
tapestries, carpets and textiles in the Textura section. Antwerp-based
Bernard Blondeel is indeed coming well armed with tapestries this year,
among them a Gobelins representing the month of August from the series Les
Moins a Arabesque, woven for Louis XIV's daughter Marie-Anne de Bourbon,
Princesse de Conti.
Maastricht's great appeal is that one never knowns what one will find there
 -although the exhibits do have a markedly Northern character, most notably
in the picture section which always presents an unrivalled selection of
Dutch and Flemish Old Masters. Here it is possible to have too much of a
good thing, for exhibitors and visitors alike. One dealer last year claimed
he counted no less than 25 landscapes by Jan Van Goyen.
True to form, this year's highlights range from new exhibitor Matthiesen's
Jacob Jordaens to Agnew's Rubens oil sketch. More unusual is Milan-based Rob
Smeets' 'Venus at the Forge of Vulcan' by the 18th century Venetian
Francesco Fontebasso. Johnny Van Haeften's offering of Isaack Koedijck's
'Barber Surgeon tending a Peasant's Foot' must rank as the least enticing
prospect of the fair.
Alongside the specialist paintings and drawings, Textura and modern art
sections, are Oriental and Western works of art, Antiquities, books and
manuscripts and Le Haute Joaillerie du Monde.
Dealers of jewellery and objet d'arts like London's Ermitage tend to show in
the works of art section. This year they present no less than 100 Faberge
objects for sale.
Le Haute Joaillerie du Monde is altogether more glitzy. Harry Winston of
Paris and New York, master of the Hollywood-Hello] school of kitsch who has
given us real Judy Garland ruby slippers and the world's largest green
diamond, this year presents the tiara he created for the marriage of Marla
Marples and Donald Trump. Incorporated into the tiara are some 325 white
diamonds, 104.88 in carat weight. At Dollars 2.5m, it is costly memorabilia.
Even these baubles are in danger of being outshone by the loan exhibits this
year. 'Treasures from the Hermitage' presents a choice and wide-ranging
selection of 60 works of art from the legendary collections amassed by the
tsars. Some are leaving St Petersburg for the first time.
From the Siberian antiquities collected by Peter the Great comes a gold
griffon, its claws sunk into the back of a goat, dating to the 5th-4th
century BC. Boucher's 'Flight into Egypt', as delightful a confection as any
mythology, is here via Madame de Pompadour and Catherine the Great. The
latter's spectacular Old Master collection is also represented by a grand
van Dyck self-portrait and Ruisdael's 'The Swamp'.
There are desks by David Roentgen, and a harlequin games table by Abraham
and David Roentgen at Galerie Neuse. The other exhibits range from a Russian
icon and a Byzantine pyxis to the entwined soapy limbs of Rodin's Romeo and
Juliet.
Maastricht also offers lecture and music programmes. The latter also has a
Russian flavour. On March 18, the Kiev State Opera presents Moussorgsky's
Khovanshchina. Also running concurrently with the art fair is a new
international trade fair at MECC, Art Collecting and Protecting, presenting
equipment relating to restoration, storage, climate control, transportation
and the security of works of art.
The European Fine Art Fair runs at the Maastricht Exhibition and Congress
Centre, March 12-20. Opening hours 11am-8pm, 11am-6pm weekends. Tickets for
the private view, the fair and the handbook are available from the TEFAF
secretariat, Tel (073) 145165. Sabena World Airlines again offers all fair
ticket holders a 50 per cent discount on first and business class flights to
Brussels, and a courtesy shuttle service between airport and fair.

FT  05 MAR 94 / How To Spend It: Storing for the future - Lucia van der Post
looks at exciting plans for House of Fraser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To all those who have predicted that the end of the department store is
nigh, Brian McGowan, chairman of House of Fraser, wishes to send a message:
not only are the obituaries premature, he says, but House of Fraser is so
confident of its survival that it is planning to invest Pounds 80m over the
next three years in its future.
In case no-one has noticed, the Fayed brothers, who so offended Tiny Rowland
by paying Pounds 615m for House of Fraser in 1985, have already spent Pounds
120m on refurbishing House of Fraser stores. No-one, least of all the
Fayeds, does that if they do not think there will be a return.
To most city-watchers, Brian McGowan is best known as half of the duo that
built up Williams Holdings. The Fayed brothers managed to lure him away from
his fishing, tennis and skiing-filled retirement to nurture the House of
Fraser group - minus Harrods - to its reflotation next month.
'When I agreed to become non-executive chairman I expected to find a group
that had been milked, neglected and underinvested in, and found it was
simply not true. Cuts had been made. The group had been trimmed, more than
30 stores closed and the number of employees dropped. But all over the
country the big, old names were being polished, revitalised, new life
breathed into them.'
We all know that the department store is not what it was. Many grand old
names have bitten the dust - Marshall &amp; Snelgrove, Debenham &amp; Freebody,
Derry &amp; Toms and Pontings. Once upon a time a visit to one was a high point
in a fashionable lady's week and Lady Jeune, a fashionable woman-about-town
at the turn of the century, wailed about the overwhelming temptations of the
department stores.
Brian McGowan admits that it is probably a long time since most of us have
been overtaken by temptation in a department store and the top priority of
the new team at House of Fraser is to make the shops seductive once again.
Says McGowan: 'For years, department stores had the business to themselves.
Then came the rise of the boutique and the life-style merchandisers, such as
Next, which took business away from them because they hadn't got their act
together.
'To survive, they have to change, like everything else. We've got to make
them attractive places to go to, offer decent loos, somewhere for the kids,
a special feeling of belonging to a club that they like to drop in on.'
McGowan adds: 'We have to concentrate on service. Not just people being
pleasant but staff that know the products and care about them.
'But we have lots of things going for us. To begin with the group has some
wonderful names and buildings. Kendals of Manchester, Rackhams of
Birmingham, Frasers of Glasgow, Howells of Cardiff - these are marvellous
buildings, some a bit faded and in need of a facelift, but they are part of
the history of their cities.
'Then, demographics are on our side. Traditionally our customers come from
the more affluent members of the older age-groups - our 'core' customer
being between 35 and 54 - and as more of the population becomes affluent and
older our customer base is growing.'
Recent retailing history would seem to bear this out. Through the recession
the profits of the top 20 high street names - Next, Laura Ashley, The Body
Shop and the like - have tumbled while the top three store groups, John
Lewis Partnership, Debenhams and Fenwicks have been relatively stable.
In the years when House of Fraser was privately owned, profits were a
well-kept secret. As it prepares for reflotation at the end of the month it
has had to disclose its figures and most store-watchers were surprised to
find that operating profits at House of Fraser had risen in the last year by
24.7 per cent to Pounds 45m.
'It is true,' says Andrew Jennings, House of Fraser's managing director,
'that our return per square foot is relatively low but that gives us a great
opportunity to do better in future.'
For House of Fraser customers who long for more individuality and
personality in their stores the strategy devised by Andrew Jennings looks
promising.
He wants to restore local character to the stores. The days when central
buying decided what customers from Inverness to Plymouth would be offered
are over.
'Our stores range in size from 12,000 sq ft to 340,000 sq ft. They serve
country farmers, old ladies, young men, city dwellers, affluent and
not-so-affluent. Clearly they cannot and should not all be the same.' He is
fond of emphasising that 'House of Fraser is an umbrella not a mould'.
Andrew Jennings sees department stores now as 'a collection of speciality
businesses under one roof'. In other words, what they can offer the customer
is a sense of smallness of scale, of human proportion, of proper focus - all
qualities that attracted the department store customer to the better
boutiques. In addition, of course, the department store can offer diversity.
Between them McGowan and Jennings make a formidable team. Their ambitions
are immense. Quite simply they want House of Fraser to be the leading
upmarket store group in the UK by the end of the century.

FT  05 MAR 94 / How To Spend It: All white on the night - Lucia van der Post
has been thinking pure thoughts as she samples some fine linen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Ralph Lauren once memorably put it: 'White in design has no competition.
White in design owns its own world. For expressing purity - whether in a
beautiful linen suit, a cotton T-shirt, or a towel - white is simple,
elegant, and fresh.' Yes, yes and yes again.
Clearly Christian Rucker, lately of Harpers &amp; Queen's beauty department,
thinks likewise. Next week she launches a mail order business given over to
nothing but the delights of white.
The business, you will not be surprised to learn, is called The White
Company and it strikes me that she has hit on a small, exclusive and
desirable niche.
She offers a small range of household goods, mainly bed and table linen and
also some china, but the main criterion for selecting the products has been
quality and price.
There is about the company a sweet, old-fashioned air. There are pure white
cotton hand-embroidered sheets based on an antique design owned by a
collector of fine linens.
A set of double sheets is Pounds 107.50, king-sized is Pounds 115.50,
matching pillowcases are Pounds 21.50 for the standard Oxford and Pounds
28.50 for the continental size.
Plain linen sheets, which are usually hard to track down and cost a small
fortune when one does, are available at Pounds 205.50 for a double set, king
size is Pounds 305.50. Hemstitched, they are classically plain and
luxurious.
Thick white cotton bedspreads from Portugal cost Pounds 55.50 for the single
size, Pounds 75.50 for the standard double and Pounds 85.50 for the king
size.
Linen damask hand towels, a splendid wedding present, are Pounds 15.95 and
Pounds 19.95 while the crunchy white cotton towels are Pounds 15.50 for the
bath sheet, Pounds 9.50 for the standard bath size.
A set of four, hemstitched, pure Irish linen napkins is Pounds 42.95 and
there is a range of white bone china to go with them. Anyone who has tried
to buy linen recently will see at once what good value is offered.
The brochure will not be ready until March 15 but requests can be made now
by post to The White Company, 166 Bishops Road, London SW6 7JG or by
telephone on 071-384 1388.
Descamps household linens are always ravishingly pretty and Primrose
Bordier, its chief designer, originally sprang to decorative fame with
exquisitely pale and ethereal florals.
These days she, too, offers a purer, more streamlined aesthetic vision and
Ble (the name is French for wheat) is a subtle exercise in shades of cream
and white.
Prices are Pounds 98 for a double duvet cover, Pounds 55.90 for a double
flat sheet, Pounds 37.90 for a pillowcase, and from Pounds 18.90 for
embroidered hand-towels.
The full range can be seen at: The Boutique Descamps, 197 Sloane Street,
London SW1X 9QX (and by mail order); Liberty of Regent Street, London W1;
and Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1.
Those who sleep on the large feather pillows that are so prevalent in
continental Europe usually become fond of them and might like to know of a
reliable source.
Miller and Schultz imports high quality German pillows and bed linen. The
pillows are huge - 31 1/2 in by 31 1/2 in (80cm by 80cm) and are filled with
feather and down.
Large pure cotton pillow-cases to fit them have piped edges and button
fastenings. A goose-feather pillow and scalloped white cotton pillowcase
together cost Pounds 27.50. Duvet covers are also available at Pounds 19.95
while goose feather and down pillows (the same size) are Pounds 29.50.
All from Miller &amp; Schultz, South Kenwood, near Kenton, Exeter, Devon EX6
8EX. Tel: 0626-891672.
Anyone interested in the full aesthetic possibilities of white might like
White By Design a book by Bo Niles. Available in paperback (Pounds 14.99,
published by Stewart, Tabori &amp; Change), it is a visual and verbal
exploration of the many moods of white - from clean, streamlined and modern,
to soft, gentle and romantic.
There are rational, hard-edged buildings, exquisitely sophisticated
interiors, and soft, romantic rooms. Those longing to create tranquil,
graceful interiors to replace the frills and chintz will find it a great
source of visual inspiration.

TOKYO
MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
On the beach, young Japanese feel they have a freer hand in creating their
own image than they do elsewhere.
On Japanese beaches, and in Hawaii, young Japanese men and women can be seen
in swimwear of all styles and colours. Anything goes, from tight, black,
macho-man trunks to loose-fitting cut-offs in bright colours, for the men.
But increasingly, younger Japanese men are developing a clear taste for
loose-fitting clothes in bright colours that are the trademark of
Californian skateboarders. Surfer culture is also a strong influence on
young Japanese who can often be seen in mid-winter bobbing up and down on
the miserable waves like penguins trying to reach the shore.
The style favoured by many attached to the beach consists of a T-shirt about
five times too large, and very baggy cut-off shorts, often in a loud,
psychedelic design. Socks must also be longish, loose and, more often than
not, in shocking pink or fluorescent orange.
Footwear tends towards the heavy-duty trainer or mountain-climbing shoe.
Bangles, earrings and other accessories reminiscent of the hippy style in
the 1960s are also in vogue.
The popularity of Brazilian footballers playing in Japanese professional
teams has started a fad for colourfully woven wristbands called 'missanga'
or promise rings.
Fashion on the beach is just as varied and adventurous for the women, who
wear everything from leotards, cut to mid-hip, to swimsuits complete with
frilly skirt and bathing cap. G-strings and nudity, however, are definitely
out.
Japanese women do not seem to feel the same need to advertise designers on
the beach as they do in town.
The only names that speak loudly on the beach are Elle, after the French
fashion magazine, which can be seen on everything from bathing suits to
towels to thongs, and, usually much more discreetly, Moschino.
FRANKFURT
CHRISTOPHER PARKES
In our series on dress codes around the world, FT writers go to the beach
and find beautiful Americans, freezing Germans and lumpy Brits
The pictures on German fashion pages suggest that a slender young man
Nureyev-ing through the surf in an up-to-the-minute version of a Betty
Grable swimming costume is the apogee of unisexiness. The reality on the
windswept beaches of the Baltic, where the sea is very cold, is less
impressive. As a consequence, high-fashion swimwear is not at all common.
In spite of their well-deserved international reputation as beachwear
fashion snobs, this is a place where many Germans go and leave their peacock
tendencies at home with the cat. The beaches are fine and spacious, dotted
with clumps of windbreaks, and populated in the main by people intent on
having a bracing, healthy time.
They are places for extremists. For many, a Baltic holiday is preferably
spent bundled up in woollies, contemplating supper while patrolling the
shallows in bare legs and knobbly rubber bathroom shoes.
In spite of the chill breezes others eschew any bodily covering apart from
neatly trimmed hairy bits. They warm up by burrowing into shared foxholes
where they lie low, out of the wind, tanning parts other holidays cannot
reach. The observer or the voyeur can often detect their hidey-holes from
afar by the presence of a plume of smoke from a fire or barbecue.
Otherwise look out for the most extravagant of beach accessories: an
all-terrain buggy or Jeep. It will be draped with garish wet suits and
sailboards, and parked next to a makeshift rig of two poles set 20ft apart
and joined at the tops by string.
This is a clear warning for the squeamish to keep at a safe distance. Beach
volleyball played by teams dressed only in dabs of thick white sun-screen is
not a pretty sight.
PARIS
ALICE RAWSTHORN
In our series on dress codes around the world, FT writers go to the beach
and find beautiful Americans, freezing Germans and lumpy Brits
Anyone who wants to know how the French dress on the beach need look no
further than the fun-filled pages of Paris-Match magazine and the inevitable
pictures of the Monaco princesses, the elegant Caroline and her wayward
little sister, Stephanie.
Caroline, the uncrowned queen of the bon chic bon genre set, embodies the
chic side of Gallic beach style. Her trademarks are a series of sporty but
stylish swimsuits in black or white, a light tan, a hint of discreet gold
jewellery and little gold-rimmed shades, the 1990s successors to the Ray-Ban
Wayfarers she sported in the 1980s.
Then there is her entourage - her three exceptionally cute children, plus
assorted, but equally decorative, hangers-on, and Vincent Lindon, the
attractive actor she usually has in tow.
The children are as nattily dressed as their mother. The two boys race
around in bright bermuda shorts. Charlotte, the little girl, favours a
series of pastel pink swimsuits with co-ordinating water-wings. Lindon
completes the scene in an adult version of the boys' bermudas and little
gold-rimmed glasses, just like Caroline's.
Stephanie paints a very different picture - on and off the beach. She
typifies the other side of Cote d'Azur style, as the epitome of the
Eurotrash look.
If Stephanie wears anything at all on the beach, it will be a
brightly-coloured, badly cut swimsuit that shows too much flesh, or a little
bikini emblazoned with fluorescent swirls. Daniel, her former bodyguard and
now the father of her baby son, struts around in tight-fitting trunks of a
similarly lurid hue.
He and his girlfriend even share the same taste in beach accessories. Excess
is the name of their game.
They like lots of jewellery - gold chains for Stephanie, a medallion for her
man - together with deep-fried tans and his 'n' her's Ray-Ban Wayfarers: the
sort of shades that Stephanie's elegant elder sister discarded years ago.

PATRICK HARVERSON
In our series on dress codes around the world, FT writers go to the beach
and find beautiful Americans, freezing Germans and lumpy Brits
New Yorkers love the nearby beaches of Long Island, New Jersey and
Connecticut, but not just because they offer a welcome respite from car
fumes, crowded streets and humid summer days of 90-degrees heat.
Beaches are also popular because they offer a rare opportunity to disrobe
and display. Off come shirts, blouses, skirts and trousers and out come flat
stomachs, trim thighs, firm pecs and tight bums. All that time spent on the
stairmaster at the Health &amp; Racquet or the Atrium, or under a Park Avenue
plastic surgeon's knife, has to pay off somewhere. Where better than on the
beach.
Thus, when it comes to beach wear, body-conscious New Yorkers prefer
fashions that show off their gorgeous physiques to best effect. Less,
however, is not necessarily best in this respect. The shoelace-thin thong so
beloved of Californian or Mediterranean beaches is definitely not for New
Yorkers.
For women, swimsuits are preferable to two-pieces, unless it is something
retro such as a bronze bandeau-topped Calvin Klein bikini or a ruffle white
bikini by Norma Kamali - you know, the Hollywood starlet look. For
swimsuits, anything by Ralph Lauren is popular, as are the more eccentric
designs by the likes of Gottex and Trulo.
Life is less complicated for men who want to flash their flesh, and
thankfully New Yorkers are extremely unfussy in this department - monotone
white, black and blue trunks look best with the Johnny Weismuller body. For
the truly cool, however, the idea is to look as active and sporty as
possible, which is why so many men prance about on the beach in bike pants
worn under basketball shorts.
For those of us less Adonis-like in form, there is refuge to be found in the
perennially popular baggy shorts and T-shirt. It doesn't matter who designed
it, it just has to be wide, long and very, very loose - perfect cover for
the imperfect form.
LONDON
BRENDA POLAN
In our series on dress codes around the world, FT writers go to the beach
and find beautiful Americans, freezing Germans and lumpy Brits
Quite justifiably, most Britons do not believe in beachwear. They may have
moved on from the picture postcard cliche of rolled up trouser legs and
corner-knotted hanky, skirt bunched into knickers and blouse untucked, but
not by much.
Even the smartest and most hedonistic of young Britons are as puritanical as
their pragmatic elders in this respect. For an annual holiday of two weeks,
special clothes are hardly a sound investment.
Certainly, should it ever be made, it is not an investment which can be
repeated too often. Thus a British couple is instantly identifiable on any
of the beaches of the world. She is the one who has managed to defeat
DuPont. Victim of salt water, sun, detergent and age, the Lycra in her
10-year-old bikini has long since given up its claim to elasticity.
Unlike the Italians under the next umbrella whose brightly coloured,
ever-changing wardrobe of matching pareos, shorts, shirts, robes, leggings
and sculpted swimsuits, she deems flashy and ridiculous, she arrives at the
beach each morning in the same faded denim skirt or wrinkled leggings, the
same baggy, once-glittery T-shirt or limp singlet. She wants to be sure her
nice new clothes, the ones she is going to wear to do the market or hit the
disco, do not smell of sun tan oil.
Her consort is even warier. He is wearing his favourite baggy chinos, the
ones in which he gets under the car every Sunday morning, topped by his
favourite shapeless, colourless T-shirt, the one with the grease stain which
won't quite come out.
When he strips, he reveals saggy knee-length swimmers luridly patterned in
shades of purple, lime green and orange and secured perilously low on his
hips by a washing-machine-abused whitish cord. He is proud of the figure he
cuts in these low-crotched drawers. He actually gave up his ancient posing
pouch back in 1989 when everyone in Marbella was wearing long shorts and a
Swedish girl he met remarked on how sexy the holidaying Frenchmen looked in
them.
Both wear cheap, witty straw hats from the local market above their RayBans.
They will take them home to join the dozens already cluttering the hall
cupboard but they won't pack them for their next holiday. They like buying
new ones too much.
The same goes for footwear. He, of course, would be quite happy to wear his
trainers but the plastic jelly sandals in the market were too silly and too
cheap to resist. She, of course, always brings an extra carry-all to
accommodate her inevitable street-market purchase of 18 or so pairs of
brightly coloured shoes which look such fun in the sun and so tatty by grey
northern light.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Beware if offered a taste of paradise -
Experience has taught Giles MacDonogh which drinks to avoid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We had eaten in a pub. Now, the meal was over and my host went to the bar to
buy me 'something rather special'. He returned with a broad grin on his face
and a glass filled with a pale liquid. It must have been a quadruple
measure.
It had a synthetic smell of coconuts and a coarse, rum-like taste, not
unlike bad rhum-babas. He went to get the bill. While he was gone, I tossed
the drink into my coffee cup. I was foolish enough to believe that the
alleged 'espresso' would hide some of its more unpleasant characteristics. I
was wrong. It made the coffee undrinkable, too.
I had not forgotten my first taste of Malibu when, a few months later, I met
the brand manager. An adolescence spent reading Raymond Chandler made me
think the drink would originate in California, but I thought I should check.
'Where does it come from, your Malibu?' I asked. 'Malibu comes from paradise
and tastes like heaven,' said the brand manager. Then he smiled and added
that, in this instance, paradise was Harlow, in Essex, where the drinks
giant IDV had its headquarters.
I have seen a bit of Harlow in my time. If that was paradise, I thought,
then we had all better start looking into the other place before we shuffle
off our mortal coils. I, for one, was not going to put up with an eternity
of Malibu as nectar.
Malibu has been a big success but, for every drink like it, there have been
handfuls of bold conceptions consigned to the kitchen sink of history. What
happened to Bezique? Mirage? Midori? Where are Greensleeves and Topaz?
When I rooted around at the bottom of a cupboard the other day, I came up
with a miniature of something called Montezuma, which I do not recall having
seen on the shelves of any dingy bars these past few years. Amanda looked
even more peculiar. I opened the little bottle. Out came an unlovely brown
liquid which did not exactly recommend itself for drinking: over the years
it had curdled, and now looked like a cup of coffee left out in the sun too
long.
An ever-hopeful bad penny is the drink known as a wine cooler. Some of these
were launched one miserable, liquid summer when everyone was shivering under
their raincoats and the drinks 'sensation' proved a flop. There are still
plenty of them about, however, and Taboo has been hewn from the same rock.
Flavoured wines really succeeded only in their sparkling versions. There was
one named after a television station (or vice versa), and another called
'Peachy' which someone once described as 'smelling like the urine of a fruit
bat'. Wines such as Thunderbird and Concorde are rather more down-market;
almost at the level of meths. 'Thunderbirds are go,' says my local
off-licence manager, 'but Concorde gets you there rather faster.'
One of the most successful sections of the novelty drinks market has been
cream liqueurs. International Distillers and Vintners laughed all the way to
the bank with Bailey's, a concoction which has sired a mass of illegitimate
children.
In a shop recently, I encountered Irish Velvet and Carolans. The latter came
complete with a comforting inscription in Irish - a tongue used also to
recommend a complicated looking bottle called Sheridans. Sheridans is
actually two bottles welded together. One contains a white liquid, the other
black. You pour the black in first then top up with the white, like an Irish
coffee.
'It's actually rather good,' says the off-licence manager, but he doesn't
see it selling. 'They don't seem to have advertised it on television.' If
they are not careful, Sheridans could join Bezique and Montezuma.
One category of new drinks which excites my middle-aged rage is 'schnapps'.
These sweet, fruit-flavoured drinks bear no relation to the divine
distillates of central Europe. In Louisville, Kentucky, I was offered a
glass of schnapps as a nightcap and, thinking it a German spirit, I
accepted. It turned out to taste like a mixture of liquid sugar and
toothpaste.
Big companies such as IDV manufacture these brews in a desperate attempt to
capture the young drinker who haunts louche bars and nightclubs. The more
sensible of these probably drinks bourbon whiskey (with cola) or a
fashionable vodka, such as Absolut from Sweden.
In this world, fashion is everything; and if you fail, then a lot of sticky
liquid has to be poured away. Beer is one of the most fickle fashions of all
but, as I have had cause to say, it is generally the worst which tends to
catch on.
Perhaps I should make a rash prophecy for the rest of this year? More awful
American beers will hit the market. Someone will dig up Texas Lone Star or
Dixie. Worse, a brewer will begin to make America's most lacklustre beer -
Old Milwaukee - under licence.
In the meantime, you can bet your life that Cadbury's Cream Liqueur will not
take up even a millimetre of my shelf space.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: How to pick west coast hotshots - Jancis
Robinson reports on assorted developments in California wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When I heard that Australia's most prolific and forthright wine writer was
to write a California wine atlas on the basis of a single visit, I thought
it was a joke - especially since James Halliday has been a voluble critic of
some California winemaking practices.
This lawyer, vigneron, columnist and author of 25 books on Australian wine
had his own misgivings, according to an interview he gave the newsletter The
New York Wine Cellar. 'I quite frankly went to California with considerable
apprehension because I had had some personal difficulties with many of the
California styles. I wondered, first, how I was going to do justice to the
wines and, second, how I could write a book that people were going to buy.'
In fact, Halliday's Wine Atlas of California (Angus &amp; Robertson) is a
triumph - a lively portrait of an industry in transition peppered with
praise and judiciously spiked with cynicism. It is full of up-to-date
information and has some stunning photographs by Oliver Strewe. It is
overpriced in Britain at Pounds 40, however, and this is not the first wine
atlas with cartography as its weakest point.
Bob Thompson's The Wine Atlas of California with Oregon and Washington
(Mitchell Beazley) may be Pounds 15 cheaper and have clearer maps, but it
proves that the closer you are to a wine region, the more difficult it can
be to pick out its distinguishing marks. Emboldened by this observation, I
am daring to make the following generalisations:
FASHION: California is nothing if not fashion conscious. And, for the moment
at least, fine wine is varietal, named after the grape from which at least
75 per cent of it was made.
The hottest variety of the moment is Merlot, the Pomerol grape, perceived as
Cabernet Sauvignon (the Medoc grape) without the pain. Only Merlot managed
an increase in average California grape prices last harvest, and one market
analyst - they have such things in the Napa Valley - predicts that between
1987 and 1998, total sales of Merlot will have increased almost tenfold.
Duckhorn of Napa Valley was many years ahead of the pack on this one, and
Lay &amp; Wheeler, of Colchester, Essex, sells the 1991 version which is
well-balanced with a nice, dry finish for about Pounds 15 a bottle (fashion
has done nothing to depress Merlot prices). A California Merlot aiming more
exhibitionistically at a lush Pomerol style is Havens Reserve Merlot. Its
1991 is Pounds 16.74 at Bibendum, the wine merchant of London NW1 (tel:
071-722-5577). It hosted the Cheval-Blanc tasting described, incidentally,
by Edmund Penning-Rowsell last week - not the synonymous restaurant.
ODDBALLS: Rhone varieties such as Syrah, Mourvedre and Marsanne have been on
a roll in California for some time now (see Les Jumeaux 1991
Cabernet/Mourvedre blend from Jade Mountain, Pounds 11.50 from Morris &amp;
Verdin, London SW1, 071-630-8888, for sumptuous velvety intrigue).
The prototype Rhone Ranger is Randall Grahm, of Bonny Doon, who has moved on
in search of varietal thrills anew. He is heavily into Italian and Hungarian
varieties this season, and was heard muting his enthusiasm for the Friuli
variety Schioppettino with a wistful 'but the cardinal rule of selling wine
is that if you can't pronounce it, you can't sell it'.
Morris &amp; Verdin also has his delightful dry, characterful white Malvasia
Bianca Ca del Solo at Pounds 7.50. Why can't Italians put this much flavour
into white wine?
THE PEST: No mention of California is complete without the P word, or is it
a Ph word - phylloxera. The dreaded vine louse is destroying vines by the
thousand in Napa, Sonoma and other north coast areas, and Pierce's disease
is wreaking its own havoc.
Or, you can look at it the quintessentially California way as 'the chance of
a lifetime' to get the rootstock right at last, to plant the right variety
in the right place, with the right spacing and trellis system.
BIG BOY: Ernest Gallo dominates the American wine scene. It is a reflection
of his power that, while every other producer is trying to move discreetly
downmarket in search of turnover (typically with a second label or two),
Gallo is striding to the top of an already overloaded ladder of ambition,
notably in terms of pricing, but also in production techniques. 'Ah,
Gallo]', whisper California barrel salesmen in their dreams.
THE SURPRISE: Who would have thought that California would have had such
success with the capricious muse of red burgundy, Pinot Noir? Yet California
is one of the few sources of viable alternatives to Cote de Beaune wines, if
not (yet) the best of Cote de Nuits. Kistler's first Pinot, a 1991 from the
McCrea vineyard, is a rich, sensual treat at Pounds 17.59 from The Wine
Treasury of London SW6 (071-371-7131). Even better value is Pellegrini's
1991 Olivet Lane bottling at Pounds 8.89 from the same source.
Morris &amp; Verdin has the British allocation of Au Bon Climat's definitive
Pinots, while Raeburn Fine Wines of Edinburgh (031-332-5166) still ships
tiny quantities of some even rarer California Pinots.
Wine maker Saintsbury continues to turn out Pinots Noirs, with its lighter
bottlings of Garnet, regular Carnero, or the new Reserve label - from
Bibendum of London NW1, Adnams of Southwold, Suffolk, Bottoms Up and many
others.
For value, Fleur de Carneros, at about Pounds 6 from Weavers of Nottingham
and Majestic, is hard to beat.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Good value, fruity reds - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In search of good petit chateau red bordeaux? Then look to the Languedoc
where you can find a raft of good-value, hand-crafted red wines, with the
same sort of structure and fruit right through the middle.
The 1991 vintage was, unusually, a real success there.
Domaine Comte de Margon 1991 is a classily labelled Vin de Pays des Cotes de
Thongues: Pounds 4.67 from John Armit Wines of London W11 (071-727 6846).
This firm also has the more serious Clos l'Angely Minervois 1991 (from
Piccinini) at Pounds 5.67. This deep, brambly wine has the structure to
develop over several years but the softness to appeal now.
Other merchants which have cherry-picked the Languedoc include: La
Vigneronne of London SW7; the Wine Society, of Stevenage, Hertfordshire;
Adnams of Southwold, Suffolk; Lay &amp; Wheeler, of Colchester, Essex; and
Tanners, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire. JR

A book which will be well-received by travellers is Charles MacLean's Pocket
Whisky Book (Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 7.99, 192 pages). With a growing
number of malt whisky distilleries open to the public, this book will fit
into a glove compartment, a handbag or a jacket pocket. It is rare today in
that it gives almost as much space to blended whisky as it does to malts. In
both cases MacLean gives us rather more pithy history than other guides
currently on the market.
The tasting notes appended to the malts are rarely punchy and it is
occasionally hard to say what the author actually thinks of the whisky in
his glass. This is doubtless tactful to the distillers but may prove less
than helpful to the drinker who wants to know what to take home on a Friday
night. GM

Few exciting Bulgarian wines have come my way in the past year or so -
something to do with over-enthusiastic application of oak chips, in some
cases - but Safeway, as so often in eastern Europe, has something
exceptional. A 1992 Cabernet Sauvignon from the Krazen vineyard, made at the
Russe winery, has outshone Cabernets from some very famous wine-makers at
twice the price. It costs just Pounds 3.29 a bottle and is delightfully
concentrated and well balanced. At least, the bottle I tried was, but
consignments from the east can be inconsistent. JR
* * *
As one might expect from the Good Beer Guide, edited by Jeff Evans (Camra,
Pounds 8.99, 502 pages), there is a good deal of real ale propaganda
squashed into the introduction, but for the most part Camra's obsessions are
wise ones: opening hours, Sunday licensing and children. GM

There will be a celebration of British cuisine at the May Fair
Inter-Continental hotel, in west London, next month at which Michael Coaker,
the hotel's executive chef, will be cooking.
The event will run from April 11 to 23 and a British menu of four courses
and coffee will be available in the Chateau restaurant for lunch and dinner
at Pounds 30 a head, including a glass of house port. For further details
and reservations ring 071-629-7777. JJ

Hampshire country house hotel Chewton Glen is staging a series of Sunday
night dinners at which personalities as diverse as the jazz musician Ronnie
Scott and Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut, will be talking or
performing. For costs and details ring 0425-275341. There is a special
overnight room rate of Pounds 100 per double room for these events. JJ

FT  05 MAR 94 / Cookery: England's favourite pasta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturing tagliatelle in the privacy of your very own Smallbone kitchen
might be a late-20th century phenomenon. So, too, might be nipping out to a
supermarket for the latest line in multi-layered seafood lasagne. But it
struck me the other day that there is nothing new about the English passion
for pasta.
Macaroni, in particular, has been popular for centuries: indeed, macaroni
cheese is a national dish. It has been a nursery comforter for generations
of children and a traditional choice for Friday lunch in households where
meat was forbidden on Fridays. Until the 1980s, it was the only alternative
to an omelette that vegetarians were offered outside their own homes.
Macaroni is said to have come to Britain from medieval Italy, where it was
dressed commonly with soft cheese, sugar and cinnamon and served as a first
course. Gradually, the sweet elements gave way to more elaborate savoury
additions. By the 18th century, macaroni was the height of fashion in
Britain. Indeed, so smart was it that dandies were nicknamed 'macaroni'.
At that time, a favoured dish for balls and theatre suppers was Roman pie
(the word Roman in the title indicated the inclusion of macaroni, just as
Florentine implied spinach).
This pie was a mixture of sliced chicken, game birds, ham, tongue and
intensely-flavoured gravy, layered in a dish with macaroni bathed in a
creamy bechamel sauce, and sealed under a lid of puff paste to keep
everything moist and succulent.
It is a recipe to remember for Christmas - one of the best ways I know to
use up turkey and other festive meats.
Here are two of my macaroni favourites - recipes in which the pasta plays an
equal role with the other ingredients. Take your pick from chicken livers or
mussels, both luxurious but inexpensive.
MUSSELS WITH MACARONI, SCORCHED PEPPERS &amp; FENNEL (serves 4) Ingredients: 6oz
macaroni; 1 1/2 lb mussels; 3-4 tablespoons dry white wine (or water); 1
large red pepper, seeded and chopped; 1 1/2 plump heads of fennel, trimmed
and cut into chunks;  1/2 teaspoon fennel seed and a few strands of saffron,
pounded together with pestle and mortar, then soaked in 3-4 tablespoons
boiling water; 1-1 1/2 teaspoons cornflour mixed to a paste with 2
tablespoons cold water; 1 tablespoon or so of olive oil; 2-3 tablespoons
each snipped chives and flat leaf parsley.
Method: Clean the mussels and prepare the other ingredients as described.
Cook the macaroni in boiling, salted water. Meanwhile, heat a little oil in
a large, heavy-based pan and scorch the pepper and fennel. Lower the flame
and cook gently for a few minutes more until the vegetables are nearly
tender. Add the saffron and fennel liquid and the chopped herbs, and set
aside.
Towards the end of this time, bring the wine to the boil in a separate large
pan. Add the mussels, cover, and cook for around three minutes until they
have opened. Strain the liquor and measure. There should be 1/4 pt or so -
top up with water if necessary. Discard any mussels that have not opened and
shell the rest.
Pour the mussel liquor and the cornflour mixture into the vegetable pan and
bring to the boil, stirring. Boil for a minute or so until the sauce is
stickily thick. Away from the heat, add the cooked and drained pasta and the
mussels. Toss to mix, season to taste, and serve straight away.
CHICKEN LIVERS WITH MACARONI, HONEY &amp; LIME (serves 3-4) Ingredients: 6oz
macaroni;  1/2 lb chicken livers, cleaned, trimmed and cut into chunks;  1/2
lb main crop carrots, peeled and cut into small batons; 1 small onion,
chopped finely; 1 teaspoon or so finely-chopped ginger root; 1 generous
teaspoon runny honey; 1 teaspoon cornflour mixed to a paste with 1 generous
tablespoon freshly-squeezed lime juice; a dribble of olive oil; the
finely-grated zest of a lime; 2 or more tablespoons freshly-chopped
coriander leaves.
Method: When all the ingredients have been prepared as described, start
cooking the macaroni in plenty of well-salted boiling water. Warm the oil
with the ginger; add the carrots, honey and 6-7fl oz water; and cook until
the carrots are tender. Drain, reserving the liquor. Meanwhile, saute the
chicken livers in a little oil. Put the carrots and livers into a low oven
to rest.
Add a little more oil to the saute pan and fry the onion. Pour on  1/4 pt or
so of the carrot liquor and the lime and cornflour mixture. Cook, while
stirring, for one minute or so letting the sauce bubble and thicken. Add a
tablespoon or more of coriander and the drained and cooked macaroni. Then
tip the contents of the pan on to the chicken livers and carrots. Toss to
mix, check seasoning and scatter extra coriander over the top.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: A little rival for the giants -
Computing / Robin Brooker looks at a no-frills office package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN BROOKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Connect Software, a UK software developer, has taken a careful look at the
needs of the small office and produced a package, Office Manager, aimed
squarely at the 'Soho' (small office / home office) market.
Connect is pleased with its product, but it has to compete with giants such
as Microsoft, which markets Microsoft Office, a suite of packages with many
more features, many of which are of little use in a very small office and
cost nearly 10 times as much.
Office Manager combines contact management, letter writing, invoicing,
elementary stock control and document storage. You can use Office Manager on
its own or link it to Money Manager, with data moving between the two in
both directions.
The core of Office Manager is its database. Each database file holds only
500 records but this should prove no restriction for its potential users.
Two possible problem areas are in compiling customer lists and parts lists.
Organising the customer list into separate files for geographic areas
overcomes the restriction. Similarly, the parts list, taking motor spares as
an example, could differentiate between engine and electrical items.
Moving from one database to another is easy: Office Manager automatically
saves a file before loading a new one, thus eradicating the main danger when
dashing between files.
When creating invoices you can have your stock list on screen. As you add
the quantities to the invoice the stock list is updated automatically. You
can post the invoice directly to your Money Manager data file with just two
or three keystrokes.
Designing templates for invoices is simple. You can prepare them with plain
paper or for your own pre-printed letterheads.
Producing letters can be very quick using the text editor and all standard
letters can be individual templates. It then becomes a matter of choosing
the person you wish to send it to and telling the program which letter you
want to send - almost no typing required. As there is no typing, it leaves
little room for typographical errors. The mail merge facility is also much
easier to use than in the more sophisticated programs such as Microsoft Word
for Windows. The word processing facilities seem a little basic compared to
the larger programs and there is no spell checker, no thesaurus nor grammar
checker.
My one apprehension about the program is that it works under MS-Dos. This
has its benefits: the program will run on a basic PC with a hard disk. It
ran happily on an old Amstrad 1512, which is considered something from the
age of the dinosaur by many computer freaks.
Recent computer purchasers have been sold the idea that Windows is the
standard computer interface and that programs running under Ms-Dos are
difficult to use. The menu system of Office Manager is very easy to use. Any
user of Windows would have no problem using the program and the manual
describes how to install and operate the software from Windows' Program
Manager.
Office Manager's unique combination of facilities makes it suitable for a
wide variety of uses where larger programs can be both expensive and
cumbersome.
Office Manager costs Pounds 49.95 and is available from Connect Software, 3,
Flanchford Road, London W12 9ND. Tel: 081 743 9792 Fax: 081 743 8073

From his prefabricated wooden office, with a glorious view of the top of
Danby Dale, John Durham presides over a Pounds 2m business - yet he draws no
salary. He does not own anything: no house, no car, no personal bank account
 -not even money for retirement tucked away in a pension fund.
Durham runs Camphill Products, the trading arm of the Camphill Village
Trust. There are 35 Camphill communities, four of which produce a range of
goods in sheltered workshops that realise a profit - they prefer to call it
a surplus - of Pounds 217,000 a year.
The money is ploughed back into the work of the trust, which assists people
with social and mental handicaps to work and play a full part in the
communities it runs.
Durham's product range comprises 100 lines from 13 craft workshops, half of
them based at Botton village, at the head of Danby Dale, 18 miles from
Whitby in North Yorkshire.
Durham's two assistants pack, distribute and handle all the marketing for
the goods, which range from wooden toys, cradles and bricks made from timber
grown at Botton, to candles, soft toys, engraved glass, pottery and
copperware.
Sales of these goods, half of which are exported, total Pounds 320,000, a
significant part of the total Pounds 2.1m sales achieved by the workshops,
food centre, gift shop and bookshop at Botton.
Botton opened in 1955 and, in common with 80 other Camphill centres in 19
countries, it is run on principles laid down by the Austrian philosopher Dr
Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). Steiner's view was that therapeutic communities
should be run with, and not for, handicapped people. This is the case, it is
the world's largest village working with adults with a mental handicap.
Apart from housing the headquarters of Camphill Products, Botton produces an
award-winning cheese, nine organic breads, and 44 food lines. Many are on
sale in shops and other outlets as far away as Scotland and the south coast
of England.
Sixty per cent of the bread, cakes and biscuits produced in the bakery is
sold in shops in nearby villages and towns, and 90 per cent of the cheese,
yoghurt and curd cheese produced in the creamery goes to the outside market.
On a good cheese counter you will find the unpasteurised Botton hard cheese
on sale alongside the best Cheddars and Stiltons.
'The surplus from our trading operations goes towards our day-to-day running
costs,' said Durham, 52, who read geography and anthropology at Durham
University and worked in marketing at ICI before coming to Botton 17 years
ago.
The key to the commercial success of Camphill products is quality. 'When I
go out with my catalogue or attend craft fairs I do not make a point of
saying we are a sheltered workshop,' Durham said. 'I say: we have got these
products - buy 'em] Fortunately, people do. Ninety-five per cent of them are
sold outside Camphill communities.'
At Botton there are 155 mentally handicapped 'villagers' and 69 'co-workers'
or staff, who, like Durham, are unpaid but whose personal expenses are met
from common funds. There are 27 local staff who commute daily to the village
and draw a salary for performing tasks such as maintenance work, secretarial
duties, and working in the saw-mill alongside villagers.
Another key to the Botton economy is tourism. Drive up the dale to the
village centre and you will find a large car and coach park. Weatherproof
dispensers give out literature which explains the work of the community and
guides visitors to the gift shop, bookshop, coffee bar and grocery. At the
latter they can buy meat, reared on Botton's five farms, as well as cheese,
vegetables and Botton-packaged food ranging from jams and perserves to ice
cream, muesli, cordials, juices and sugar-free drinks.
Enter the coffee bar and you mingle with residents and co-workers, who live
communally in 30 houses in the 750-acre settlement.
The visitor pack lays a strong emphasis on the growing importance of fund
raising for building and long-term development.
Botton was founded in 1955, based on Botton Hall, a shooting lodge with 350
acres, and two farms acquired by the trust at nominal cost. The most recent
building is a strikingly modern Pounds 400,000, 150-seat chapel built
largely of timber. It replaced an annex to the community centre that had
served as a chapel for 18 years.
One of the other new buildings is the Pounds 250,000 print shop. Buildings
such as these come out of the community's capital fund, which is fed largely
by fund raising and donations, and which currently totals Pounds 1.2m.
The print shop is the home of a sophisticated mailing operation which
comprises nearly 50,000 'warm' donors and is the envy of many other charity
operations. It is handled by a Pounds 100,000 computer donated by Digital
Equipment Corporation. The print shop is increasingly undertaking outside
contract work.
'It costs about Pounds 200 to keep one of our villagers here for a week. It
is interesting that the Department of Social Security works on a figure
nearer Pounds 280 a week for someone with a similar handicap,' said Jeff
Balls, deputy chairman of the Camphill Village Trust who has been at Botton
for 22 years.
'Our villagers are largely supported by local authority grants. Together
with grants from the Department of Employment they comprise 65 per cent of
our total income. In a year Botton needs Pounds 1.7m to keep it going. We
reckon about 15 per cent of that comes from workshop sales, which includes
Camphill products, and 10 per cent from donations and fund raising. The rest
comes from other assorted sources.
'Fundraising keeps our capital projects account going. Currently this is
Pounds 1.2m. Without this we could not expand,' said Durham, who is also
chairman of the fundraising group.
'The important thing is that these figures should be set within the overall
context of our philosophy. Work here and at other Camphill communities is
carried out for the sake of the work itself and for the needs of the
community. We are working with people of limited talents and we aim to give
them an opportunity to contribute and to achieve some sort of fulfilment
through their daily work. Their fulfilment is probably greater than most of
us achieve on a day-to-day basis. We work not to generate cash but to meet
people's needs.'

FT  05 MAR 94 / Caught in a Russian labyrinth: Colin Walsh and his Georgian
wife took a romantic trip to St Petersburg. All went well until they tried
to leave. This is his account.
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN WALSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It began as a romantic idea. We would travel to St Petersburg, my wife and
I, on a second visit to the city where we spent our honeymoon in the summer
of 1992. Intourist, the Russian state travel agency, told us that Marina,
who is Georgian and holds a Soviet passport issued by the former Soviet
Union, would not need a visa for the trip. We left on December 17, intending
to return home for Christmas. We were ill-prepared for the ordeal that
followed.
When we landed in the afternoon it was already dark, with a light covering
of snow.
A young woman in passport control seemed about to wave us through when a
heavy man in the green uniform of the immigration service studied my wife's
passport, becoming hostile when she was unable to show a currency
declaration. In spite of his loud lecturing and a threat not to allow Marina
into the country, we passed through. I assumed this was typical of Russian
officials.
We spent a pleasant few days at the St Petersburg hotel, where our room
overlooked the frozen Neva. On our first visit to St Petersburg the fresh
summer days had seemed endless as we walked through the city or took boat
trips, planning our future together.
A year and a half later, St Petersburg wore an altogether sadder look. Night
came early and the poor street lighting made little impression on the
darkness. In the evenings we took a taxi along pot-holed streets to visit
Marina's mother. Time passed quickly. Marina bade an emotional farewell to
her mother and we left for the airport.
Our bags were checked in and we proceeded to passport control. A
severe-looking man in green uniform examined Marina's passport at length,
his expression becoming increasingly serious. 'Big problem,' he said loudly,
and disappeared.
He returned with the senior immigration officer, a large, pale young woman
with glittering brown eyes. These she fixed on my wife, lecturing her at
length, loudly and scornfully, and gesticulating with the passport.
I could not understand her, but my wife's sinking expression confirmed that
we were in trouble.
In panic, I demanded to know what the problem was. 'No English,' I was told
in reply. Marina was mesmerised by this hectoring official, who was telling
her that she 'didn't have the right to cross the border' and 'would never go
back to England'.
These terrible words induced such fear that Marina panicked and grabbed at
her passport (containing her precious British Home Office visas designating
her as my wife and giving her the right to UK residence). After a determined
tug-of-war, she won it back.
We still had no idea what was wrong. I could scarcely believe what was
happening. I tucked Marina's passport into my coat pocket, determined not to
let it go. Then an airline official explained why Marina was not going to be
allowed on the aircraft.
Her passport lacked an exit visa. Apparently she needed permission from
someone before she could leave Russia, but no-one would say who this was.
Our bags were unloaded. The time was approaching for take-off - without us.
I could not accept that anyone could block my wife's freedom to return home
with me. I telephoned the British consulate in St Petersburg and asked for
help. We still had a little time before the aircraft departed, and it was
vital that we were on it. Our money was almost all spent, and I did not
fancy spending Christmas in a Russian hotel.
To add to the tension, I discovered the consulate had moved to another
building. But eventually I heard a calm, thoroughly English voice breaking
through the insanity. After hearing my story, however, the consular official
was not encouraging. 'What do you think I can do about it?' he asked.
'We need some sort of diplomatic help,' I said. 'We're in a desperate
situation.'
After questioning me about the specific reasons why Marina was not being
allowed to go home, he told me that he believed it was sometimes possible to
buy an exit visa at the airport if one could find the right official.
Meanwhile, he would see what he could do.
I found Marina standing alone in the departure area, looking down at the
floor. I put my arm round her shoulder and we were led off in search of the
official who, we hoped, would be able to mark her passport with the missing
stamp. I assumed that it was merely a question of paying some money.
We entered a small room and met a thin young man dressed in a worn-out suit.
His manner was quiet and reasonable and he spoke English. What he said to
us, though, was far from reasonable. He would charge Dollars 110 to grant me
an extension to my visa and we would have to travel to Georgia to sort out
my wife's passport.
Prevented from leaving the country because of the obstacles placed in front
of my wife, I was to be made to pay to stay. They were also telling us to go
thousands of miles to a country we knew to be riven by internal conflict.
Experiencing fear and rage, but trying not to show it, I asked: 'Who has
made this decision?'
He replied: 'The senior immigration officer.' He suggested that we go and
see the ovir, a regional official, and told us that this important official
might be able to grant my wife an exit visa.
We found the senior immigration officer standing with a couple of other
officials, dressed in green, apparently with little to do.
I confronted her, getting Marina to translate. I demanded that the officer
put in writing her reasons for preventing my wife leaving the country.
She refused, saying they never wrote anything down. However, I noticed that
something had changed. They now seemed to be engaging in a two-way
conversation with my wife, and the decibel level was lower. I realised later
that this might have had something to do with a call from the British
official.
Even so, they remained intransigent. Marina would not be allowed to leave
without an exit visa. Our bags had been unloaded from the aircraft.
Dispirited, we picked them up and found a taxi back to our hotel in the
early darkness.
We rose early next day and I put on a shirt and tie, which I hoped would
make a good impression on the ovir, even if I froze in the icy weather.
Fortified with a good breakfast, we took a taxi to the British consulate.
Comforted by the sight of the British flag hanging limply in the still cold
air, we entered the consulate through the security door and I gave our names
to the young woman at reception.
It was clear that we were expected. She indicated a door through which we
passed to a waiting-room. After a long delay the consular official, whose
manner was capable and friendly, arrived. He looked at Marina's passport,
commenting that it was probably a good thing that Marina's citizenship was
recorded as Soviet rather than Georgian.
He said he would speak to the ovir on our behalf, putting forward the
argument that if Marina was regarded as Georgian, she did not need the
Georgian government's permission to leave as she had already left her
country, and if she were regarded as Soviet, then, as the Russians were
insisting on an exit visa, they themselves would have to provide one.
He left the room to make the call, returning to tell us that Nina
Vasilievna, at the ovir's office, had agreed to see us on any Tuesday - it
was Wednesday - but if we went there immediately she would see us straight
away.
Certain that our difficulties were almost over, we took a taxi to Ulitsa
Saltikova Shedrina and climbed the stairs to a huge room, bare of all
furniture except for a large desk at which was seated a grandmotherly
looking woman.
We assumed that she was the receptionist, told her that we had an
appointment to see Nina Vasilievna, and were surprised when she indicated
that that was her name. Marina began to explain the problem while Vasilievna
examined her passport. 'Aha] So you're Georgian]' she exclaimed. 'They told
me different. Go to Georgia and they will help you.'
I did not need Marina to translate, as the official's voice was laden with
sarcasm and her look unmistakably hostile. She stalked into another room,
presumably to show Marina's passport to someone else. Marina broke down in
tears, saying to me between sobs: 'Why did you bring me here, why, why?'
Vasilievna returned with the passport, indicated that the business was
finished, and began dealing with someone else. It was terrible to see the
effect on my wife. Almost in tears myself, I began shouting but my voice
sounded feeble in the gigantic room.
We arrived back at the British consulate downcast. We met the same official.
I said that I could not understand the logic of the Russian position. Their
requirement for an exit visa made sense only if the Soviet Union had somehow
been brought back to life. Georgia had broken away from the Soviet Union
before it was officially dissolved in December 1991.
Now, the Russian authorities were claiming authority over my wife by
insisting on an exit visa, while maintaining that they had no authority to
grant an exit visa because Marina was not Russian.
I noticed that the British official did not explicitly criticise the
Russians' behaviour. I asked if my wife could accompany me home under the
protection of the British government. He told me this was not possible as
Marina was not British.
I pointed out that according to her papers she was not a citizen of any
existing state. However, as she was married to a British citizen, and as
there was nobody else in St Petersburg to whom she could turn for help, she
was entitled to British assistance.
He left the room and returned a short time later to say that the Russians
had told him to 'back off'. He said again that as Marina was not British, he
could not apply any more pressure.
When she expressed her surprise and disappointment, he told her that it was
her problem, and that I was technically free to leave.
I was crushed by this interpretation of the rules of the game, which seemed
to leave the Russians free to do as they pleased with my wife, because she
was on Russian soil and not British. I tried to get across the idea that my
wife was my vital interest, and that the British consulate had a
responsibility to protect my interests as much as possible. But I was too
upset to state my case clearly.
Our ordeal was at last ended in Moscow, where we sought the assistance of
the Georgian embassy. They gave my wife everything she needed to escape -
which amounted to an extra couple of stamps on her passport.
We took a British Airways flight out of Moscow the same day.
I tried to understand what had gone wrong. I had met Marina in Tbilisi in
1992, and decided to bring her back to Britain for a holiday. I wanted to
marry her, but first I wanted to make sure that she knew what life was like
in Britain.
Marina had obtained a permit from an official in Tbilisi allowing a
'personal visit' abroad. We were married on my second visit to Tbilisi and
Marina joined me in Britain some weeks later, her documents having been
vetted by the home office.
She had no problem leaving Georgia via Moscow in 1992, but she had
inadvertently failed to get a 'permanent emigration' permit in her passport
to replace the 'personal visit' stamp which would soon expire.
This had been the cause of our difficulties in St Petersburg, but the
question remained - why were the Russians so keen to enforce Georgian
emigration regulations?
In spite of all the political changes, the reality for ordinary former
Soviet citizens is that travel abroad remains a distant dream.
Even if the cost is somehow met, the obstacles created by governments are
formidable. In a couple of years, Marina will be eligible for a British
passport.
Inside the front cover of a UK passport are inscribed noble and optimistic
words, redolent of a time when all you needed for world travel was a
passport and enough money. Times are changing.

FT  05 MAR 94 / As They Say in Europe: Lost in translation - James Morgan
attempts to cross the language barriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new Paris tabloid, InfoMatin, wrote the other day: 'All proposals designed
to legislate on the use of language give off a stale smell. And a regressive
one, because words have a capacity to fly in the face of those who persist
in acting as customs officers of the language.'
This was a response to the new bill to enforce the use of French on public
signs and in private conferences. The defence of the French language is an
item of recurring interest; there is, of course, only one real enemy of the
purity of the Gallic tongue: American English.
But elsewhere things are different. Unremarked by everyone outside Germany,
the Society for the German Language (GfdS) has admitted another bunch of
words. These are new German words rather than imports but the Germans do not
have 'douaniers' like the French - any old import can make itself at home in
Germany in about 10 minutes. One can write articles consisting almost
entirely of English.
German has a gift for fabricating new words in a way Americans might envy.
Each January the GfdS picks a 'Word of the Year'. The one for 1993 was
Sozialabbau which 'stands as a generic term for a series of euphemisms for
the difficult changes that have been felt in the lives of millions of people
in east and west Germany'.
This flexibility is something lacking in French. Mind you, there are words
that leave me stunned at the richness of French life: perhaps a reader can
help with one I came across years ago but have now forgotten. It means
someone who makes a living out of taking shoes apart and selling the bits as
spare parts. Then there is ramaillage, or 'the treatment of skins in
preparation for the manufacture of chamois leather'. Maybe this reflects the
infinite linguistic variety French reserves for such matters as food and
women's clothes.
Each language has characteristics which govern the way people think and
behave. It is widely believed that it is the people who create the language
but the opposite is true. Now, you may ask: if French is so good at
sensuality, which would seem to be the case, why is it identified with
clarity, precision and analytical brilliance? The answer is that the French
have to struggle against the grain of their language to obtain these skills.
They labour to make absolutely precise in 40 words what English makes clear
in four. Unless, of course, they are treating animal skins or tearing up
shoes.
(The same phenomenon can be seen in Japanese, whose structure is so at odds
with its script that its speakers have to develop fantastic brains to make
any sense of it.)
The besetting English sin is sloppiness. The language is so good at
conveying meanings and ideas with a minimum of effort (you get my drift?)
that nobody tries very hard. New ideas and words are drawn to it like whores
to a victorious army. From French, with its emphasis on eloquence and
elegance, one often makes a desperate effort to retrieve any sense at all.
It is hard to detect the difference between brilliant observation and the
charlatan, between the icon of postmodern obscurantism, Jacques Derrida, and
the dead doyen of modern Marxism, Louis Althusser. Only when translated into
English is it possible to estimate the true value of their works.
The Germans have a different problem. Their language imposes lunatic rules
of syntax and grammar. This strait-jacket has to contain a language whose
greatest gift is an astonishing capacity for metaphysical and abstract
expression. It is no accident that there is a certain kind of German which
produces words and phrases that remind one of madmen in uniform. Today's
language avoids such traps by accepting a new informality and offering open
house to foreigners in a manner that parallels the recent asylum laws. Those
foreigners, of course, never quite become German.
What the French and the Germans have in common is a certain distaste for
English. The poet and novelist, Kurt Tucholsky, wrote 60 years ago: 'English
is a simple but difficult language. It consists of loud foreign words which
are badly pronounced.' One uses it without loving it. Not so with French.
The journalist, Karl Gunter Simon writes, 'When two non-Frenchmen speak
French between themselves they are immediately mutually sympatisch. Whole
peoples love French even if they hardly like the French.'
There was a radio programme a few nights ago about English people living in
France and how they spoke French. They confirmed that they reserved French
for endearments and English for irony and sarcasm.
The emperor Charles V famously said: 'I speak Spanish to God, Latin to my
confessor, Italian to my mistress, French to my men and German to my horse.'
If he had known English he would have spoken it to his research assistant
and his PR girl.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Mysteries of the death cells: The Nature of Thing - Millions
of dollars are pouring into the study of apoptosis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Murder? Suicide? Plain old age? The way cells die - regarded for decades as
an obscure by-way of biology - has become a subject of burning scientific
interest.
Researchers are stampeding into the study of cell death and American venture
capitalists are racing after them, eager to pour millions of dollars into
biotechnology companies exploiting their work. They see it as a new route to
treatments for intractable diseases including cancer, Alzheimer's and Aids.
Scientists have known for many years that billions of cells die every day,
even in the healthiest people, to make room for new cells. But they have
only recently realised that all cells are programmed to perish by the same
process in every part of the body, from blood to brain, and in all creatures
from primitive worms to humans.
The process - which has the evocative name of apoptosis, from the Greek word
for the shedding of leaves - is really cell suicide. Once apoptosis has been
triggered, a cell destroys itself within a few hours. Its membranes break
down and enzymes split up the genetic material in the nucleus. At the same
time, the main body of the cell shrinks and breaks up into small pieces
which are eventually consumed by neighbouring cells.
Although three Edinburgh University cancer researchers - Andrew Wyllie, John
Kerr and the late Alastair Currie - had discovered apoptosis in the early
1970s, most biologists regarded it as no more than an interesting curiosity
until the late 1980s. They were more interested in the way cells divide and
grow and how they respond to germs and drugs than in their suicidal
behaviour.
The reason for all the excitement now is that research over the past five
years has shown apoptosis to be a far more widespread phenomenon with much
wider implications than anyone had suspected. Indeed, it turns out that all
cells are programmed to die in a clean and orderly way through apoptosis
when their time comes.
The other way a cell can die is through 'necrosis' - a much cruder process
of sudden and unprogrammed destruction following accidental injury, burns,
poisoning, asphyxiation or virulent infection.
Apoptosis plays a particularly important role at the very earliest stage of
life. It shapes the developing embryo in the womb, removing cells where they
are not needed. To take a simple example, it leaves clear spaces between the
growing toes of most animals; but in water birds the level of apoptosis is
reduced and webbing remains between the toes.
Another vital function of apoptosis - in embryonic development and then
throughout life - is apparently to maintain a natural selection process in
the body. 'What seems to be emerging from research is that the best cells
are selected for development and unwanted cells are removed,' Wyllie says.
The immune system depends on apoptosis to regulate the number of blood cells
available to defend the body against invading germs. Someone infected with a
new virus makes huge numbers of special cells to recognise and kill the
invaders; when the threat is over, almost all the defenders commit suicide,
leaving just a few to remember the virus in case it invades again.
So apoptosis is essential for maintaining a healthy balance between the
growth of new cells and elimination of old ones. If the balance is lost,
disease results.
One of the first scientists to popularise the role of apoptosis in disease
was Luc Montagnier, the French discoverer of HIV. He has been promoting for
several years the idea that the virus causes Aids by forcing too many
T-cells in the immune system to commit suicide.
Too much apoptosis may also be a cause of degenerative brain diseases such
as Alzheimer's; indeed, any apoptosis at all is bad news for the brain, as
its cells are the only ones in the body that do not renew themselves
routinely in adult life. Too little apoptosis, on the other hand, results in
the cell proliferation characteristic of cancer and the abnormal immune
reactions responsible for rheumatoid arthritis.
Hopes of intervening in the process - and shrinking tumours, for example, by
persuading their cancer cells to commit suicide - rest on finding the genes
that control apoptosis. In the humble nematode worm Caenorhabitis elegans, a
favourite subject for genetic research because of its simple structure,
Robert Horvitz and colleagues at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have
already identified 16 genes involved in apoptosis; some of these are
apparently related to human genes that may trigger or suppress cancer.
Horvitz chairs the scientific advisory board of Idun Pharmaceuticals (named
after a Nordic goddess who keeps apples bright and shining). It is one of
several biotechnology companies started recently in the US to commercialise
apoptosis research. Others include Apoptosis Technology and LXR
Biotechnology.
The prospect of manipulating cell death to cure cancer or prevent
degenerative brain disease may yet turn out to be an illusion. But the
existence of apoptosis companies shows that investors expect something to
come of it within a decade or so.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Travel: A walk through a Swiss valley - John Westbrooke
treks from the source of the Rhone and enjoys some madly picturesque scenery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WESTBROOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The beginnings of the Rhone are inauspicious. Far from the broad river
sweeping past the Roman remains of Provence, it starts life as a glacier in
the Swiss Alps, and a dirty one too.
Up near the point where the glacier melts and trickles down a cliff, you can
walk inside it. Locals have carved a passage about 100 yards long with a
chamber at the end, lit by the hazy blue light filtering through the ice
above. From the outside, though, the ice is a grubby grey from the earth it
rolls over, seemingly out of place in a country where every cow looks as if
it is polished twice a day.
Down below, however, is pure Switzerland, madly picturesque. The Rhone makes
its way along the Obergoms valley, through lush green fields between high
mountains, augmented constantly by other streams, gradually building up from
babbling brook to respectable river. You can even go rafting on it, though
you will see little resembling white water.
Not a lot of tourists visit the Obergoms. Villages are scattered down the
valley a mile or so apart, mostly farming communities with a Baroque church
and a few hotels. The average building is four storeys tall, with flowers
spilling over the balconies, and built of larch, wood which starts out
honey-coloured and after 20 years turns black. Some of the buildings are
very black - 500 years old and not a nail among them. Apart from
agriculture, the valley's main business is reputed to be providing the men
of the Vatican's Swiss Guard.
Life is not always tranquil: there can be a great deal of weather in Alpine
valleys. Take Obergesteln, second town down the Obergoms, which in three
centuries saw so much fire, flood and avalanche that a quarter of its
population moved to San Francisco, where they were presumably introduced to
earthquakes as well. We spent three fine days afoot, a little overcast in
the morning but nothing uncomfortable; a week later, the region was awash in
rainstorms.
But - bearing in mind that, in the words of one hotelier, there is no bad
weather, only bad clothing - it is exhilarating walking country, and
flexible: you can take the high road, the low road or the railroad.
A variety of paths lead down the valley, well marked and well maintained,
the distances given in hours. Plenty of sub-tracks lead off to the villages.
The highest ones take enthusiastic walkers up above the treeline. Lower ones
are mostly easy climbs through the woods, with frequent chocolate-box
glimpses of steeples and snowy mountains and the constant clanking of
cow-bells. The views are always pretty, and once in a while sublime. No
walking experience is necessary and, though a modest degree of physical
fitness would be useful, I managed without.
If you don't feel up to this, you can stroll through the almost flat fields
along the valley floor, and if even that is too much, bright red trains
glide along between the villages every hour or so.
Nor do you have to retrace your steps in the evenings. I walked with
Inntravel, which arranges for your luggage to be ferried on ahead to
whichever village you plan to stop at for the night. Instead of a full-scale
rucksack, you need carry only a bag big enough to hold a packed lunch. (And
a raincoat. Just in case.) Detailed written notes on the paths are provided,
sealed in plastic. Dress in layers.
The hotels are mainly family-run establishments, small and snug enough for
the skiing season. Food is mostly nourishing rather than elaborate, but you
can usually get a fondue substantial enough to keep you awake all night.
Swiss wines, little seen abroad, turn out to be an unexpected bonus.
One of the villages, Munster, is large enough to have proper hotels, and
even its own guidebook. Local teacher Pius Werlen prints it at home and
pastes in his own photos by hand, so each one is different. The Obergoms:
where even tourism is a handicraft.
Inntravel (tel: 0439-71111) offers walks, cycling and horse rides in
Austria, France, Norway and Italy as well as Switzerland; there is even a
beekeeping weekend in the Pyrenees. A six-night walking holiday in the
Obergoms starts at Pounds 476 including flights, less if you drive there.
Activities available locally include village and wildlife tours.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Travel: The view from the porch - James Henderson tours
South Carolina and finds the cool balconies are the best place to relax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The porch has always been central to life in the American south. It is a
fine place to take the cool evening air, to watch what goes by on the road
(standard entertainment before cable TV and air-conditioning began to take
people inside), or to relax after surveying the plantation. And some porches
are beautiful features in themselves - an expanse of wooden floorboards with
carved balustrades wrapped around entire houses.
In South Carolina the drawl is not as deep as in parts of Georgia or
Alabama, but there is plenty of 'y'all' and girls with sculpted hair and
fearsome finger-nails. There is also gracious hospitality and paternalistic
gentility.
South Carolina considers itself something of an aristocrat in the south
because it was the first state to secede from the Union. I touched down in
Columbia, the state capital, which lies about 100 miles inland. It is a
quiet town, hot and humid in summer. The centre has a mix of neo-classical
monumental buildings, brick-built commercial warehouses and a clutch of
sky-scrapers.
It is set out on a leisurely grid; in the 1770s it was thought that malaria
(as the name hints) was borne by pockets of stagnant air clinging in narrow
streets. More accustomed to close and busy European towns, I found Columbia
curiously agoraphobic.
With the buildings so sparse, the grand old town houses were set in
magnificent gardens. Many of the houses were burned when General Sherman
swept through the country taking revenge after the civil war, but some
survive.
There is a nice story about the First Baptist Church. Sherman particularly
wanted it torched because the ordinance of secession was prepared there. But
it was saved by a quick-thinking retainer. When the troops arrived he
assured them that they had the wrong building and promptly sent them round
the corner to the Methodist Church, which they burned instead.
A very personal view of the civil war was left by Mary Chesnut, the wife of
a confederalist general, in her Diary from Dixie. She tells of the war, of
politics and of the goings-on around her house, particularly of the day when
the president of the confederacy, Jefferson Davis, came to visit.
He was spotted by some local men and was persuaded to address the people of
Columbia from the front porch of their house. The Chesnut Cottage, a pretty
pink clapboard house with a triangular gable, also escaped the revenge
torchings and now offers bed-and-breakfast. It has been restored to its
condition of October 1864, the date of Jefferson Davis's speech.
There are a few concessions to the 20th century, among them
air-conditioning, but what you find in the Chesnut Cottage is typical of
many of the guest houses in the area and it is a pleasure to visit. It has
high ceilings and wide corridors to encourage a through-flow of air; the
polished floors are covered with rugs and the rooms are furnished with
antiques. Often you sleep in a Victorian four-poster bed. And there is the
personal service of a bed and breakfast establishment, which allows southern
hospitality to extend its enveloping welcome.
Columbia seemed to be full of cars, but then driving is part of the American
experience. I hired one and headed off at a stately pace on cruise control,
hermetically sealed and air-conditioned, with a rumbling stereo that made
the rear-view mirror shudder. I scanned radio channels, skipping from the
easy-listening love-rock stations to hard rap. The most entertaining,
though, was FM With Love from Jesus, with details of church meetings,
personal messages and songs.
If the town seemed agoraphobic, I soon discovered why. Most of the activity
has found its way on to the suburban roadside. The main arteries out of town
were a relentless line of strip-malls, muffler-stalls and cheery
restaurants, all set in spacious plots and advertised with vast billboards.
Through forests of long-needled pine I finally reached the neat lines of
plantations - peach and kiwi-fruit mainly, now that the cotton industry has
died in these parts. With the plantations comes the occasional grand house,
standing in a grove of trees to keep it shaded. Hammocks and chairs on
chains hung on the verandas.
I arrived in the town of Edgefield, discernable by a steadily denser line of
houses and businesses among the trees, leading ultimately to a quiet central
square and court-house.
I stayed at Carnoosie, a forbidding-looking house completely out of style
with the region - covered in Victorian conceits and with a steeply-sloping
roof in French style. It was formerly the home of a governor of the state.
But it was a welcoming house, with an acreage of wooden floor inside and
out. In spite of its ghostly appearance, it is not haunted, or so I was
told.
Carnoosie is run by a lady optician who owns two huge black poodles. Betty
Jean Wood spent most of her life in New Orleans, but she has returned to
Edgefield for her semi-retirement. With a little encouragement she told
stories of life, jazz and Mardi Gras. When I left she bade me return: 'You
come back any time and rock on the porch some more,' she said.
For such a small town, there are some pretty fancy houses in Edgefield. Some
are completely wrapped in two stories of wooden balcony, supported by
slender columns. But the most typical feature, as seen in Gone with the
Wind, is the grand classical facade, with a triangular pediment supported by
four columns. This is supposed to have originated up north, but was readily
adopted in the south because it provided extra shade and lent an air of
grandeur. I was surprised to discover that the pillars are mostly made of
wood and are hollow. They make a fine noise when you thump them.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Allocation of shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With reference to the allocation of one Zeneca share for each ICI share
held: would I, for capital gains purposes, be correct in reducing the
capital cost of my ICI shares by half and treating the resulting sum as the
cost of the Zeneca allocation?
No. The split has to be made on the basis of the market values (on the
quarter-up basis) on the first day of dealing in the Zeneca shares, June 1
1993, viz 631 3/4 p for ICI and 625 3/4 p for Zeneca.
The cost of the Zeneca shares is, therefore, 49.76143 per cent of the CGT
base cost of the ICI stock. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT13
(the indexation allowance for quoted shares). Any apportionment factors
which you may need also can be obtained from your tax office.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tenants in common
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife and I are joint owners of a house worth about Pounds 90,000 and
share investments worth about Pounds 220,000. When the first of us dies, I
understand the house will go automatically to the survivor. We have willed
most of our share of the investments to the surviving spouse in trust, then
to our grown-up children.
In order to reduce the liability of our estate to inheritance tax when the
second spouse dies, we are thinking of making ourselves tenants in common of
the house and leaving our share of it to a discretionary trust for the
benefit of the surviving spouse and our children. Would this work by
actually saving IHT?
Also, would it enable the surviving spouse to be sure of being able to
either remain in the house or sell it and buy a new one with the proceeds,
without the children claiming half as their share?
If the house is held as tenants in common, you each have a half share of the
property, now worth Pounds 45,000. By leaving that share to a discretionary
trust for the children, the gift would fall within the nil rate band and be
tax-efficient. The result would be that the house would be owned by the
trust and your wife.
By mutual agreement the house would be sold; one half of the proceeds would
remain in trust, the other half would go to your wife. It is within the
discretion of the trustees whether they distribute the cash to your children
or your wife (who would also be a discretionary beneficiary of the trust).
It is always possible in theory for the trustee who has an interest in a
property to force a sale of that asset, but that would require court action
and it is unlikely a court would sanction a sale if your wife were to be
made homeless. I suggest you consult a solicitor. He will be able also to
draw up the necessary documents should you go ahead with your plan.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Setting losses against gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife and I have a portfolio of shares in unit trusts. Most are in my name
but some are in joint names and some in hers.
'Capital gains' losses are of no value to her tax position because the level
of gains so far has been minimal. But the sale of some joint holdings this
tax year constitute losses on the indexed basis prior to last December, and
I would like to maximise use of these against gains made in my name. The
securities were purchased before the separate tax arrangements for wives
were introduced.
Is it possible for me to use the whole of these losses in my tax return, or
shall I be restricted to 50 per cent.
In the absence of clear evidence to the contrary (which presumably does not
exist in your case), it will be assumed that spouses have equal beneficial
interests in investments registered in their joint names. The answer,
therefore, is that only half the losses on the joint holdings are yours.

I have a protected tenancy of a property which is my main residence. The
landlord is offering me a substantial sum of money to surrender the tenancy.
Would I be liable to income or capital gains tax?
The answer probably is no, but you have not given us much to go on. If you

FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Warranties under fire - OFT to start
inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The high street can be a dangerous place for consumers who do not read the
small print and ask the right questions. Two forms of insurance sold
commonly by high street retailers were criticised by the Office of Fair
Trading and the Consumers' Association this week.
The OFT is to investigate the sale of extended warranties - insurance
policies sold with electrical goods which cover breakdowns after the
appliance's initial guarantee has expired. This follows complaints by a
Labour MP, Nigel Griffiths, that shops were hard-selling their own
warranties to customers without telling them about much cheaper warranties
from manufacturers. Some shops' warranties were said to be three times as
expensive as the manufacturer's version.
The OFT also will be looking at whether stores make clear what is excluded
by the warranties, such as accidental damage and cosmetic faults which do
not affect function.
Retailers argue that their policies are often more comprehensive: for
example, allowing replacement in some cases while the maker's warranty would
cover only repair. This, however, does not explain why consumers are not
given all the information and allowed to make a free choice.
Shoppers often are put under pressure from sales staff - who can earn hefty
commissions - to take out a warranty at the point of sale but, in fact, you
have a month after buying the product during which you can still take out a
warranty.
The Consumers' Association says that warranties are poor value in many
cases. The increasing reliability of electrical appliances means that many
never need repairs and, even when they do, paying for these as and when
necessary could work out cheaper.
Another sharp practice under threat is the inertia selling of credit
insurance - also known as payment protection insurance - tied to loan or
credit card agreements. This is supposed to cover repayments if the borrower
becomes unemployed or cannot work through ill-health.
A report this month in the Consumers Association magazine Which? attacks
credit insurance as over-priced and full of exclusions. It has often been
sold by inertia - borrowers have to tick a box or delete a paragraph of
small print if they do not want it. Naturally, many fail to spot this.
Which? says the premiums add an average 65 per cent to the cost of credit.
The OFT asked lenders to end inertia selling by the beginning of this year,
but not everyone has complied. Now, the office is threatening to review the
credit licence of any lender found still to be using inertia selling after
the end of this month.
As the practice is not actually illegal, however, consumers can do little if
they discover too late that they have had credit insurance foisted on them.
The contract is binding. The only exception is if, on checking the small
print, you discover that your situation is excluded: for example, if you are
unemployed, retired, or on a short-term contract.
If you come across inertia selling of this type of insurance, contact your
local trading standards office or the OFT.

<TEXT>
OFFSHORE INVESTMENT SIMPLIFIED by Robert HV Cooke Robert Hale Pounds 14.99
Sometimes, it is difficult to distinguish between clarifying subject matter
and simplifying it. Robert Cooke's Offshore Investment Simplified is a case
in point, sometimes assuming enormous knowledge from the layman, at other
times treating him with kid gloves. It is, in total, an informative and
readable look at an industry's attractions and pitfalls. Cooke is a
well-qualified financial adviser and is not frightened of imparting
heartfelt convictions on disparate sectors and the methods of the
professionals working within them.
Where it falls down is in the positioning. Is Cooke advising the
knowledgeable and critical reader on how to extend his portfolio to
investments in lower tax jurisdictions? Or is he speaking to the beginner
who is likely to consider 'offshore' a dirty word?
Cooke is capable of alternately exciting and stupefying. For instance, how
would the discerning reader respond to his remarks on economic liquidity:
'The supply of money is important. Even if you are firmly convinced that a
certain company has outstanding prospects and you wish to buy its shares, if
you do not have the money to do so, then you are not creating demand for its
shares by merely wishing.'
Cooke is happy to comment widely, often in anecdotal form. Readers are told
of his personal portfolio diversification, his currency hedging techniques,
and his ability to sort risk and proof assets from the depredations of
inflation.
He enjoys playing the detective, with mixed results. He has, for instance, a
sneaking suspicion that 'one or two' managers may be using their
international managed funds as a 'dustbin' for redemptions from other funds
to avoid dealing charges.
Later, he comes up with a questionable statement on offshore fund
performance, based on simplistic bull and bear market theories: '. . .
instead of it being regarded as a strange phenomenon that such a very high
proportion of funds which are top of the ratings in one year end the
following year near the bottom, it should rather be expected as a normal
occurrence.' Both comments may have some credence, but are improperly and
thinly argued.
Chapters are also disconnected, with no thematic thread. In chapter four,
Cooke tabulates the structural differences between unit and investment
trusts.
He then informs us that the table shows 'that investment trusts on average
have the edge by quite a wide margin over unit trusts when it comes to
performance.' If this is true, then why does he not furnish statistics to
support it?
But where Cooke takes the time to present his theories with evidence, he is
a credible sleuth - his thoughts on offshore banking, separate taxation and
inflation are original and refreshing. For instance, his personal experience
with the punitive charges of an offshore bank lending on an overdraft
facility is a real eye-opener.
Cooke would be the first to agree that one moment's good advice is another's
financial ruin. He is at pains to explain the importance of timing, and
devotes a chapter to it.
No one can blame the writer for chronological problems between writing
(early 1993) and publication. But Cooke mistakenly enters into market
predictions, which should be left to the newspapers. Entrenched firmly in
the trends of a year or two ago, his predictions for some markets,
especially the emerging ones, have become redundant. This is hardly edifying
for the critical investor and hardly informative for the uninformed.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Many happy returns . . .  - Know
your enemy, a user's guide to what makes the tax man's nose twitch / Your
inspector is really a caring, sensitive human being
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Q. Is he an ogre?
Quite the reverse. Like a dentist, the tax man is very aware of an image
problem and is keen to inflict as little pain as possible.
Q. What's he like, then?
Well, he's actually a very decent man. Honesty, common sense and fairness -
these are his watchwords. No one enters the Revenue burning with ambition or
craving wealth. He strives to apply the law consistently and even-handedly.
Things irresponsible or unprofessional appal him.
Q. So, is he desperately dull?
Who wants a flamboyant tax inspector? Bear in mind he has to have a working
knowledge of the Taxes Act (some 5,000 pages of it) and case law dating back
to 1875. These are not tomes which provoke excitement or laughter.
Q. Why on earth would anyone join the Inland Revenue in the first place?
Because it's there. Besides, the advertisement for graduate recruits used to
say 'No particular discipline preferred,' so every history graduate for
miles around applied.
Q. Is he a social pariah?
He doesn't yell about his job from the rooftops. On the other hand, people
chatting to a tax man over the Twiglets often find themselves wondering if
something-or-other is allowable against tax, the way a doctor is asked for
advice out of surgery hours. As such, it's almost a social asset.
Bear in mind, too, that the tax inspector is a left-leaning, fair-minded
Guardian or Independent reader who buys his clothes from Marks and Spencer
and has far more in common with Alan Bennett than Alan Sugar. This is not
the stuff of social leprosy.
Q. How helpful is he?
Very. If you're a Paye employee, your tax district is determined by your
employer and is likely to be processed by a large office in the provinces.
If you're self-employed, your tax man is usually local. Either way, there's
an individual - a living, breathing human being who spills coffee and burns
toast - directly responsible for dealing with your affairs.
You can find out who he is without getting embroiled in some Kafka-esque
nightmare, and you can actually talk to him. You'll be amazed how pleasant
he is. But, as in all big organisations, things can go dreadfully wrong -
there have been a number of recorded instances where people have visited
their local tax office and been offered a leaflet.
Q. What are the advantages of a career in the Inland Revenue?
Job security. As one tax inspector put it: 'One cannot readily foresee the
end of Inland Revenue.' It is big enough to ensure that merit is rewarded,
so dog isn't obliged to eat dog. Colleagues are helpful, confrontation is a
known quantity, and few inspectors suffer from stress.
Q. And disadvantages?
After years of service, you run the risk of going round the bend in a quiet
and subtle kind of way. Nothing is what it seems. Nothing can be taken for
granted. Nothing has a straightforward explanation.
The tax man doesn't glance at things, he peers at them inquisitively.
Cynicism comes by the lorry load. He becomes the ultimate lateral thinker,
which is useful for dealing with obdurate teenagers but not much else.
Q. How effective is he?
Frighteningly so. In 1992/3, the Revenue raised Pounds 4.6bn pounds from
'action taken against non-compliance.' That is the equivalent to the yield
from 3p on the basic rate of income tax. In the same year, it collected
Pounds 982m of capital gains tax at a cost of just Pounds 38.4m in
administrative fees.
Q. What does he aspire to?
Tax men aren't driven by desperate longings; otherwise, they wouldn't have
entered the Revenue in the first place. When the tax man dreams, he dreams
of early retirement. Of converting his garage into a wood-working shop and
producing reproduction antique furniture.
Q. Is he ever tempted to join the opposition?
During the 1980s, there was a massive exodus of inspectors throwing down
their felt-tip pens and joining accountancy firms or corporate tax
departments. The recession stemmed the flood and the Revenue itself has now
said: 'That's it, chum. If you leave, you can't come back.'
But a large number of tax men ease themselves into retirement with some sort
of part-time consultancy work.
Q. How does he catch people?
The tax man's nose. This refined and valuable proboscis - an almost mystical
organ - starts to twitch frantically when it gets within half a mile of
something dodgy on the tax return.
Q. Do the rich deal with a nicer class of tax man?
Yes, but only because wealth is relatively complex and you need more senior
(better trained, more intelligent etc) people to deal with it. But it's
nothing to do with class war: figures on a tax return are as meaningless as
Monopoly money.
Q. What makes the tax man angry?
Nothing. Almost nothing. Like the priest in the confessional, they've heard
it all before. But the tax man has a highly cultivated spirit of fair play.
If a large company or a wealthy individual is clearly getting up to
artificial shenanagins purely to avoid paying The Right Amount of Tax, well,
you're likely to put the taxman's proboscis out of joint.
Q. What turns him on?
Winning a disputed claim, especially if you're at inspector level where the
claim tends to be over a million quid. It's the intellectual challenge, the
piecing together of the jigsaw.
Q. What makes him miserable?
Routine paperwork and form-filling. A vast number of bureaucrats abhor
bureaucracy, yet still manage to lead happy and fulfilled lives in the
Revenue.
Q. And how do you make the inspector happy?
By speaking to him. He loves to be spoken to. And should you ever get the
urge to jot down a quick note of thanks, his cup would overflow. (See above:
'Tax men as toast-burning fellow humans').
Q. What does a tax man do when he's not being a tax man?
He spends much of his time commuting: the Inland Revenue is the backbone of
British Rail. But, for a bit of innocent enjoyment on the side, the tax man
will often settle down to a detective novel or study military history in the
Dark Ages.

<TEXT>
This is the first in a series by Richard Chant and Alan Sugden on all
aspects of capital gains tax. The four articles are intended to help private
investors in stock market securities work out their cumulative capital gains
during each tax year, and to describe the steps needed to minimise CGT
liability. These articles are written specifically for the serious stock
market investor although capital gains on other assets, such as second
homes, may also trigger CGT liabilities. Today, we set out the basic rules,
including chargeable gains and allowable losses.
CGT is charged on your capital gain when disposing of an asset, and capital
losses can be set off against capital gains.
They are known as chargeable gains and allowable losses and are the
difference between the net proceeds from disposal (or open market value if
the asset is given away) and the attributable gross cost of the asset when
it was bought (or the open market value if acquired otherwise).
The actual gross cost (or the value at March 31 1982) is indexed to allow
for the increase in the retail price index (RPI) - that is, inflation while
you have held the asset - to give the attributable indexed cost, but only by
the amount of inflation since March 31 1982.
A warning, though: Any calculations you make after reading this article will
need to be adjusted next week to take account of indexation.
Calculation of
chargeable gains
CGT payable on disposals in any tax year (April 6 to the following April 5)
is calculated in steps:
1. Work out the gain or loss on each asset disposed of during the year.
Where the asset is a security that has been bought and sold in the market,
use gross cost (cost plus expenses) and net proceeds (gross proceeds less
expenses).
Note that the date of the contract is the date of purchase or sale, not the
settlement date.
2. Subtract total allowable losses from total chargeable gains. This will
produce either a net allowable loss, which ends the calculation - such a
loss can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future net chargeable
gains; or a net chargeable gain.
3. Each person has an annual exemption, including children. Deduct the
annual exemption (Pounds 5,800 in 1992/93 and 1993/94) from the net
chargeable gain.
If this produces a negative figure or zero, there is no CGT to pay. If the
figure is still positive then:
4. Deduct capital losses brought forward (see below). This will produce
either a negative figure, which is the amount of losses that can be carried
forward to future years (there is no CGT to pay), or a positive figure,
which is the amount of chargeable gain on which CGT will be assessed.
The calculation must be done in the sequence shown. If, for instance, you
make a total of Pounds 5,000 chargeable gains and Pounds 2,000 of allowable
losses, you are not allowed to set the Pounds 5,000 off against your annual
exemption and carry forward the Pounds 2,000 losses to future years.
Net gains would be Pounds 3,000, less than the annual exemption, so there
would be no CGT charge and no losses to carry forward.
Note that none of this includes the process of indexation, and that no
unused annual exemption can be carried forward. The list of investments
exempt from CGT is shown below.
Calculating CGT payable
The tax liability on net chargeable gains (less the annual exemption) is
normally calculated by adding them to taxable income in the tax year and
working out the additional tax due (see box 1).
Investments that are
exempt from CGT
Gains (and losses) on the following investments are excluded from CGT
assessments:
Saye (save as you earn) contracts, but not the shares acquired if linked to
a share option scheme, as is often the case.
Premium Bond winnings.
Government stock (gilts).
Personal equity plans.
Bonuses from tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas).
Qualifying corporate bonds (QCBs). These are any debentures, loan stock or
bonds where the debt attaching to them is a normal commercial loan in
sterling and cannot be converted to any other currency.
The rules are not straightforward, though. Gains on QCBs acquired on or
before March 13 1984 are subject to CGT.
Losses on disposal of QCBs held on or issued after March 15 1989 are
allowable for CGT, but the original cost cannot be indexed to calculate
losses.
Offsetting trading losses
against capital gains
Since 1991/92, you have been allowed to set trading losses not covered by
all other income against chargeable gains in either the same or the
following tax year.
If, for example, you are self-employed and making losses over and above all
your other income, the excess losses in any tax year can be set off against
chargeable gains in that year and/or the following year.
Carrying losses forward
If capital losses are more than capital gains made in the same year, the
excess losses in that year can be carried forward indefinitely and offset
against gains in later years. For an example of how this works, see box 2.
Negligible value
The Inland Revenue keeps a list of securities which it deems to be of
negligible value. But the investor does not have to wait until the security
appears on that list before claiming for an allowable loss; he can do that
as soon as he considers that a holding in his portfolio is worthless.
When he does, and the security is not on the Revenue's list, it will
investigate.
If satisfied that the security is worthless, the Revenue will allow the
claim and add the security to its list. This allows later claims from other
holders to be agreed without further investigation.
Each quarter, the Revenue sends out lists of 'deemed' securities to its
local offices, various tax journals and specialist tax services (although
not the press in general) which then pass on this information to their
subscribers.
Twice a year, Extel Financial publishes a slim A4 size book called CGT
Capital Losses. It contains the Revenue's quarterly information plus a list
of companies that have gone into receivership but have not yet had their
shares deemed of negligible value.
The annual subscription is Pounds 53 (Extel Financial, tel: 071-251-3333).
If you want to know if a security is on the Revenue's list, but do not want
to subscribe to a specialist service, ask your local inspector of taxes (who
will have the latest quarterly list), or your accountant or stockbroker
(most of whom take a specialist service).
In the past, some investors have been slow to make claims on securities of
negligible value. There are two possible reasons:
1. They may think, mistakenly, that a security has to appear on the
Revenue's list before they can claim; this, as we have described, is not so.
In fact, if no shareholders ever claimed until a security appeared on the
list, it would never contain any securities: definitely a chicken and egg
situation.
2. They may have wanted to allow the indexed cost of the security to
continue growing with the RPI until they needed to claim the loss to offset
against gains.
This was quite a crafty move, but indexing holdings of negligible value was
ruled out by January 1994's Finance Bill for negligible-value claims made
after November 29 1993 (Budget day). In our view, this is a bit tough.
No CGT on death
When a person dies there is no charge on the net unrealised gains in their
portfolio although their estate is, of course, subject to inheritance tax.
Valuing a dead
person's estate
Securities in the estate are valued using the open-market value of each on
the date of death or, if that was not a working day, on the last day for
which the price was published before death.
The open-market value of a security listed on the London stock exchange,
including the USM, is the lower of:
1. The bid price of the security plus one-quarter of the spread (the
difference between the bid price and the offer price). This is known
colloquially as 'quarter up.'
2. The figure halfway between the highest and the lowest prices of bargains
recorded that day in the stock exchange's Daily Official List.
For foreign securities listed on a recognised stock exchange, the basis for
calculating the value of a disposal is very similar to that for a UK listed
security; the value is converted into sterling at the rate of exchange at
the date of death.
Selling assets from an estate
If securities are sold from an estate within 12 months of death, the
executors can elect that, for the purpose of IHT, the proceeds of the sale
can be substituted for the open market value at the date of death. But the
election has to be for all disposals during that 12 months.
This can be a very important concession if money has to be raised by the
executors and the market is falling.
Filling in your tax return
If your chargeable gains do not exceed the exempt amount for the year
(Pounds 5,800 in 1993/94), and the aggregate value of (or the net
consideration received for) the assets disposed of does not exceed twice the
exempt amount for the year (Pounds 11,600 in 1993/94), there is no need to
provide details of your capital gains and losses in the year (which include
gains and losses on assets other than stock market securities). You just
tick the box provided.
If either of these figures is exceeded, you must give details of each
chargeable asset disposed of, and the amount of chargeable gain. You might
also, if you wish, provide your tax inspector with your computations. The
new version of the annual tax return, form 11P, introduced in 1992/93, gives
a useful pro forma for doing each computation.
Date of payment of CGT
Your return should be sent to your tax office by October 31 following the
end of each tax year. CGT should then be paid by December 1 (or, if later,
by 30 days after the issue of the assessment).
Richard Chant is a tax partner at Bristol chartered accountant Solomon Hare.
Alan Sugden is the co-author of Interpreting Company Reports &amp; Accounts
(Woodhead-Faulkner, 4th (revised) edition, p/b Pounds 19.95).
Answers to the most popular general questions arising from this series will
be published after the final article. Please mark your envelope 'CGT Series
Question.' But we cannot provide detailed advice about personal CGT returns.
Next week: Indexation
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Table 1: CALCULATING CGT PAYABLE
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
In 1993/94 a wife who stays at home to look after her children
estimates that her total income, including tax rebates on her dividend
income, will be pounds2,800.
In 1993/94 the personal allowance is pounds3,445.
Her husband pays tax at the marginal rate of 40 per cent; he claims and
automatically receives the benefit of the married couple's allowance of
pounds1,720, as they have not elected to do otherwise (see footnote).
Her net capital gains so far this year after Indexation (which will be
explained next week) are pounds34,200 - an aunt left her some money and
she put pounds17,500 into British Airways shares at the time of the Gulf
War, taking her profit last month. She has no carried forward losses.
How much CGT will she have to pay, assuming she makes no further
disposals?
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
The calculation:
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Capital gain                                   pounds34,200
Annual exemption                                    (5,800)
Taxable gain                                         28,400
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Unused personal allowances can't be used to offset against capital
gains, so she starts at the bottom of the lowest tax band:
Tax band pounds           Tax rate %     Tax payable pounds
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
0 - 2,500                         20                    500
2,501 - 23,700                    25                  5,300
23,701 - 28,400                   40                  1,880
CGT payable in 1993/94                                7,680
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Allocation of Married Couple's Allowance. The wife can ask to
receive half the allowance, or they can jointly ask for the wife to
receive it all. If neither of these requests are made, the husband can
claim and automatically receive all the allowance which, in this case,
is clearly to their advantage.

<TEXT>
With gilt yields on a continued upwards move, at least half a dozen
companies have increased their annuity rates since last month. Some, such as
Norwich Union, have also reduced their rates and have disappeared from the
table along with Equitable Life.
Unfortunately, the Inland Revenue has provisionally stopped the launch of
Provident Life's flexible annuity. There should, however, be interesting
annuity products available in the second half of the year.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Age trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIE HAWTHORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Age has an important bearing on your income and tax. The most well known of
these effects is the age allowance. For people between 65-74, this is an
addition of Pounds 755 (93/94 figures) to the Pounds 3,445 personal
allowance (which everybody gets against any tax liability), and brings it up
to Pounds 4,200.
The personal allowance for single people aged 75 or over is higher at Pounds
4,370, and married couples get an extra Pounds 2,465 (65-74) or Pounds 2,505
(75 or over).
But what the Inland Revenue gives in one hand, it tends to take back with
the other. An income limit for the age allowance starts operating at Pounds
14,200.
When that figure is reached, every Pounds 2 of taxable income thereafter
reduces the age allowance by Pounds 1 until it gets down to the basic
personal allowance to which everybody, from birth upwards, is entitled.
For purposes of calculating the age allowance, all income is grossed up. And
it is on this gross amount that your tax liability (after allowances) is
assessed. Adding up your total income - on much of which you have paid tax
at source - can, therefore, give you a false idea of your tax liability.
Few payments are tax-free, even when received gross. It is easy to fall into
the age allowance trap, therefore, as the following example shows.
John and his wife Ann, both aged 66, have annual incomes of Pounds 15,000
and Pounds 10,000 respectively. She gets the Pounds 4,200 allowance but
John's income exceeds the age limit of Pounds 14,200 by Pounds 800.
Thus, he loses Pounds 400 (Pounds 800/2) from his Pounds 4,200 allowance,
and it goes down to Pounds 3,800.
His taxable income is, therefore, Pounds 15,000 less allowances of Pounds
6,265 - made up of Pounds 3,800 (personal) plus Pounds 2,465 (married).
Assuming he has no other offsetting allowances, John must pay tax on Pounds
15,000 less Pounds 6,265: that is, Pounds 8,730, instead of tax on Pounds
8,330.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions

<TEXT>
The markets may be having a shake-down but directors have begun to deal
again.
Goode Durrant, the transport group, cropped up over the past month when
directors started to buy. The shares have held their value despite the ups
and downs of the market; nevertheless, chairman DK Kingsbury has bought now
at these higher levels.
Siebe, in the engineering sector, has done well over the past three years.
Directors have been buying since the beginning of 1993 when the managing
director acquired stock at 490p. The most recent purchase was made at 608p.
The sale in Syltone was made following a period of out-performance of the
stock. JA Clegg, the chairman, sold 600,000 shares at 175p but retains more
than 1.8m.
Deep discount selling is seen as the future face of food retailing and
Shoprite has been at the forefront of the new style. The share price has
done well recently and CA Good, a non-executive director, has sold some
stock while retaining a sizeable holding.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Fixed rates edge up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rates on most fixed-rate mortgages are edging upwards, writes
Scheherazade Daneshkhu. The largest increase in the new fixed rates from
Abbey National is 0.4 of a percentage point.
The first-time buyer fixed rate of 6.99 per cent (7.3 APR) until January 31
1997 replaces a three-year, 6.69 per cent fix. The one-year, 5.25 per cent
(5.4 APR) and two-year, 6.25 per cent (6.5 APR) fixes are unchanged. Booking
fee is Pounds 90 and early redemption penalties are 30-90 days' interest.
Other customers are being offered 7.14 per cent (7.5 APR) to the end of
January 1997; 7.59 per cent (8.0 APR) until January 31 1998; and 8.6 per
cent (9.1 APR) until March 31 2003. The 6.39 per cent (6.7 APR) fix until
April 30 1996 is being continued.
Booking fee is Pounds 250 for the two shorter-term mortgages and Pounds 300
for the others. Early redemption penalties are 60-300 days' interest. The
mortgages are not tied to insurance products.
Barclays bank is offering first-time buyers 6.45 per cent (6.7 APR) fixed
until January 31 1997; the bank's life insurance policy is mandatory if the
mortgage is endowment or pension. Booking fee is Pounds 200 and the early
redemption penalty is four months' interest.
Fixed rates for other borrowers are 6.75 per cent (7.0 APR) until January 31
1997; 7.45 per cent (7.8 APR) to the end of January 1999; and 8.25 per cent
(8.7 APR) until January 31 2004. Booking fee is Pounds 300 for the 10-year
fix and Pounds 200 for the other two.
There is an additional Pounds 100 arrangement fee on all three fixes, which
is waived if you take out an endowment/pension or life insurance policy
through the bank. Early redemption penalties are between 4-7 months'
interest.
Woolwich has launched a five-year fixed rate of 7.65 per cent (8.0 APR). The
application fee is Pounds 295. The society has dropped the rate on its 7.25
per cent, three-year fix, introduced on February 25, to 7.10 per cent (7.4
APR). Application fee is Pounds 250. Insurance is not compulsory and the
mortgages are repayment, endowment, pension or Pep. Early redemption costs
3-6 months' interest.
TSB has a 10-year, 7.99 per cent fixed (8.5 APR) up to 75 per cent of the
value of the property. Arrangement fee is Pounds 295 and the mortgage is
tied to the bank's buildings and contents insurance.
Broker John Charcol's 6.99 per cent, five-year fix is available until the
end of March. For a Pounds 250 fee, costs for re-mortgage customers will be
covered, but borrowers must have a 25 per cent deposit.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Ready for any battle - RE Gee: sixth
in a series by Joanna Slaughter on fee-based advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any independent financial adviser who has served on Fimbra, the industry's
regulator, is likely to be battle-hardened. The experience could stand Ron
Gee in good stead.
Gee, who was deputy chairman of Fimbra from 1987-1990, is the founder of RE
Gee, a Shrewsbury-based firm of advisers established in 1972. Five staff -
including daughter Philippa, who joined four years ago - look after 1,800
personal clients.
Gee has just made a radical change in commercial strategy: he decided, after
more than 20 years as a conventional, commission-paid financial adviser, to
charge fees only. Reaction from clients has, so far, been very favourable
but he does expect to lose a few. 'There will be some for whom fees are not
appropriate,' he concedes.
The firm is not a total stranger to fees: it has been arranging one-off,
fee-based deals since the mid-1970s and has also operated some pilot
exercises with fees in recent years. These were charged on a time basis,
though, and Gee has decided against doing this again. Instead, he has opted
for a scale of fixed monthly retainer fees for clients whose affairs are
being monitored constantly.
Clearly, such fees depend on the complexity of a client's affairs but
minimum charges range from Pounds 25-Pounds 85, depending on what percentage
of initial commissions the client wishes the firm to retain. Gee decided to
offer this particular arrangement to existing clients because, as he puts
it: 'Fee-based advice is still relatively new in this area at least, and we
are trying to make the tablet a little easier to swallow.'
The firm also provides financial advice on a one-off basis - for example, a
client might want a pension transfer analysis or advice on residential or
commercial mortgages - and minimum fees here range from Pounds 125-Pounds
500. No execution-only work is undertaken.
Clients are drawn mostly from the West Midlands area, and 90 per cent
contact the firm because of recommendations from existing customers or other
professional advisers; indeed, prospective clients often are asked if they
want to bring their accountant or solicitor to the initial meeting.
'Many new clients have existing investment plans, and our first step is to
review them,' Gee says. 'You would be surprised what this turns up.'
Among recent horrors were 'life policies worth more than Pounds 1m
supposedly written under trust but with no trust registered. And a client
who had been sold a personal pension life policy with a major company, even
though he was a member of his company scheme.'
Gee adds: 'We like to look at all a client's affairs. We ask if they have
made a will, what National Savings they have, what sort of a person they
are. We are not just investment managers. We are financial planners across
the board.'
There is no hard and fast rule about acceptable minimum investment and
income levels, but Gee reckons: 'You are probably talking about Pounds
40,000 at least for pure investment. On income, Pounds 20,000-Pounds 25,000
a year would be the bottom end of the scale.'
No one at the firm handles client money. 'We stress peace of mind and there
is no discretionary management,' says Gee, 'but we have about Pounds 30m
under our stewardship.'
This stewardship includes liaising with stockbrokers (for those with equity
investments), asset allocation, and safeguarding clients from what the firm
considers to be inappropriate investments. Gee says: 'We do not, for
example, use single premium bonds apart from certain very specialised
circumstances, and we haven't done so for several years. Very often, these
bonds are just sold because of commissions.'
The firm belongs to the Society of Pension Consultants and does a lot of
work on planning and re-structuring pension schemes. 'Not too many people in
the provinces do that kind of thing,' says Gee, 'but, again, it is a matter
of structural rather than investment management.'
Gee probably is placed as well as anyone to discuss the development of the
IFA market, thanks to his stint on Fimbra. He concedes that this position
often was uncomfortable but believes Fimbra's accomplishments have been
considerable.
'What it did was take a totally unregulated sector of 15,000 firms and whip
it into something that had a fair degree of organisation,' he says. 'I would
say the quality of independent advice is far better than it used to be.
Certainly, it is totally different from what it was in 1972.'
Gee argues that a further reduction in the number of IFAs is inevitable,
however. 'I don't think the one and two-man business will survive. One of
the basic problems is that many IFAs are not businessmen, and I think lFAs
will have to go down the fee route to move forward. I think clients are
going to demand it.'

FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Latins make the running
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin America is the place for private investors to put their money this
month, if the UK investment trust industry is to be believed: the public
offers for three new Latin American funds open later this month (see details
at end of story).
UK fund managers are only following global investment fashions. The big
money managers who poured funds into Hong Kong and the rest of south-east
Asia last year are now finding those markets too expensive. Their new target
is Latin America.
Arnab Banerji, chief investment officer of Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging
Markets, is one such manager. He has been transferring money in his general
portfolio from south-east Asia to Latin America for the past four months. F
&amp; C also has a specialist Latin American trust.
The basic argument for investing in Latin America is that most economies in
the region are coming under control, and implementing sensible policies.
Political situations are stabilising and the North American Free Trade
Agreement brings the prospect of improved trade links.
Projected economic growth rates are not as high as south-east Asia - perhaps
5 per cent a year on average, compared with 6 or 7 per cent - but they are
far higher than most of the developed world. The stock markets of the region
have even greater potential as many companies remain under-valued by world
standards.
Many people may still think of Latin America as the basket case of the past
decade or two and are reluctant to entrust their money to the region. But
Banerji says: 'In 1930, Argentina had the fourth highest per capita income
in the world. The country grew at rates which made the Germans envious.' It
has done it once so it can do it again.
Mark Mobius, the highly-regarded strategist behind the Templeton Emerging
Markets trust, is also involved in Templeton's new Latin America trust. His
approach is to look for value.
Global weight of money tends to eliminate value from the markets it hits,
but Mobius remains happy to launch the new fund now.
He believes the flow of money will entice more companies into seeking a
listing, and governments will accelerate their privatisation programmes. But
Mobius is unlikely to be in there fighting for a share of the initial
offers.
'We want to buy when others are despondently selling,' he says. He buys
stocks cheaply on their way down, then sits on them as they rise again.
Templeton's strategy is for the long term, so Mobius is not afraid to stay
in cash until the moment is right to buy.
One question investors may want to ask is: why pick a specialist Latin
American trust rather than a general emerging markets trust?
The general rule is that the more diversified a fund, the less risky it
should be: the performance of a fund with investments in 20 countries will
be hit less hard if one market crashes than a fund which concentrates on
this market alone. So, a regional fund carries a heavier risk than a global
fund which can invest in Latin America when the time looks right but can
shift money around the world if needs be.
People more averse to risk may find a small investment in a general emerging
markets fund is exciting enough for their tastes. But if all your risky
money is in the Far East, you might want to shift a bit to the other side of
the Pacific. And, for gambling types with a little money to spare, now could
be the time to catch the Latin American wave.
Edinburgh Fund Managers: Inca trust. Offer opens March 11, closes March 25.
Minimum investment Pounds 1,000. One warrant for every five shares.
Morgan Grenfell: Latin American Companies trust. Offer opens March 9, closes
March 23. Minimum application Pounds 2,000. One warrant attached to five
shares.
Templeton: Latin America investment trust. Offer dates not fixed but likely
to open March 31, close April 22. Full details are not yet available. An
offer of new shares in the general Templeton Emerging Markets trust also is
imminent.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Next stop the world - Scheherazade
Daneshkhu on two new privatisation unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year, fund management groups met growing retail demand for emerging
markets funds with weekly launches; now, it is the turn of privatisation
issues. Fond memories of the UK government's privatisations in the mid-1980s
 -many of which proved excellent for generous returns, even after a short
period - have led to private investor interest in funds with the
privatisation label.
The large privatisation programme under way in several European countries,
particularly France, spawned two recent investment trusts from Kleinwort
Benson and Mercury Asset Management, both of them over-subscribed. The next
step beyond Europe is the world and two fund management groups, Guinness
Flight and Fidelity, have now launched Global Privatisation unit trusts. But
investors should ask themselves if these correspond to their needs.
Both emphasise the wider geographical area and stock selection opportunities
afforded by a global, rather than a European, fund. But since the two also
want to qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 annual general personal equity
plan allowance, they are restricted to holding a minimum of 50 per cent in
the UK and Europe.
Fidelity will invest an initial 75 per cent of its fund in Europe (35 per
cent in the UK), although it will increase its holding outside in due
course, while the European weighting for Guinness Flight is 65 per cent. The
exposure outside Europe is, therefore, not much greater than you can get by
investing in non-qualifying funds through a self-select Pep.
The attraction of the new funds will lie in an ability to produce returns
higher than those found in other European or international growth unit
trusts. But by focusing solely on privatisations, the choice of companies in
which to invest will be less than a more general fund.
Fidelity finds this too much of a restriction and will include companies
that benefit from privatisations. In the UK, this would mean a holding in
Mercury as well as British Telecommunications, since it was the
privatisation of BT which allowed Mercury to become a viable presence in the
UK telecommunications market.
'We are more comfortable running a portfolio with stocks other than
privatisation issues because it will give us a greater opportunity to give
better performance and a wider range of stocks to choose from,' says
Fidelity executive Mary Blair.
Guinness Flight is sticking to the pure definition of privatisation. Tim
Thomas, manager of the new trust, says: 'It does offer a bit of a
restriction; it probably means you buy half of all companies privatised in
Europe. But that will rapidly become less important as more issues come
through.'
These are not funds for income-seekers. The Guinness Flight trust will have
a yield of about 2 per cent and Fidelity says its yield will be between 1.5
and 2 per cent. Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, adds: 'They
have a place in a portfolio as a long-term hold and, on balance, I prefer
Fidelity because of the wider investment brief.'
Charges on the Guinness Flight fund are an initial 2 per cent if you invest
through the Pep. There are withdrawal charges of 3 per cent in the first
year, 2 per cent in the second and 1 per cent in the third. The initial
charge on a direct investment in the unit trust is 5 per cent, with a 1
percentage point discount until the end of March. The annual fee is 1.25 per
cent but the Pep carries a 1.5 per cent annual charge. The minimum
investment in the Pep is Pounds 3,000 or Pounds 1,000 into the unit trust.
Fidelity's Pep charges are the same. The initial charge outside the Pep is
5.25 per cent with an annual charge of 1.5 per cent. The minimum investment
is Pounds 1,000.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Copper tarnishes RTZ - The week
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IMI, the diversified engineering group, is expected to announce a small
increase in annual profits on Monday, probably around Pounds 70m for 1993
against Pounds 68m for 1992. It has been coping with rationalisation of its
fluid power operations and losses on computer activities.
More vigorous profits growth is held back by the state of continental
European economies, but there should be rising revenue from the UK and US.
Little better than break-even is expected from Fisons, the troubled
pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group, when it reports full-year
figures on Tuesday. Profits of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 70m will be
wiped out by re-structuring provisions, particularly at the loss-making
scientific equipment division.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, is expected to report net
attributable earnings for 1993 of around Pounds 300m on Wednesday, up from
Pounds 249m previously. The results will be hampered by weak copper prices
but helped by a strong performance from CRA, its Australian associate.
During the year the group has sharpened its focus on mining, buying Nerco's
US coal interests and disposing of Pillar, its industrial division, which is
expected to result in a Pounds 165m loss after writing back goodwill.
Full-year figures from Cadbury Schweppes, also due on Wednesday, will be
affected heavily by the group's recent acquisition programme, including
Aguas Minerals of Mexico and A&amp;W Brands of the US, together with last
September's rights issue. The net result could be a rise in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 333m to Pounds 400m, with perhaps Pounds 25m of the rise due to
the weakness of sterling.
Standard Chartered is expected to deliver its first strong and unflawed set
of results for several years on Wednesday, with analysts expecting pre-tax
profits to double from Pounds 197m in 1992 to about Pounds 400m for last
year.
Last year's 20p net dividend is expected to be covered up to four times by
earnings. The bank could feel the need to underpin its recently volatile
share price with a strong increase in the final dividend.
The City expects Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group,
to report improved pre-tax profits of Pounds 60m-Pounds 75m for 1993 on
Thursday. In 1992, losses were Pounds 184m pre-tax. Having launched a Pounds
307m rights issue last year, it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 31m for
the first half of 1993. At the interim stage, it forecast an unchanged
dividend of 5p a share for the full year.
Shares in BTR, the UK industrial conglomerate, have underperformed the
market by about 20 per cent since last August. This is likely to be
exercising its executives before the group's 1993 results on Thursday.
The company first unsettled the market by warning in September that the
outlook remained uncertain for any economic recovery in the group's second
half. Analysts duly trimmed their forecasts and the present expectation is
for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 1.38bn, compared with Pounds 1.09bn last
time.
Full-year figures from Hillsdown on Thursday will show a rebound from the
depressed Pounds 63.7m post-exceptional figure for 1992. However, the gain
against the reported pre-tax profit of Pounds 154.1m will be smaller - the
range of forecasts extends from Pounds 155m to Pounds 164m.
Profits on the disposal of non-core activities are likely to fuel a sharp
improvement at TI, the specialist engineering group, which is expected to
post pre-tax profits of up to Pounds 130m on Thursday, against a re-stated
Pounds 87.4m last time.
Interest in the Barclays results' announcement on Thursday is heightened
because it will be the first time that Martin Taylor, the new chief
executive, will have the chance to give his views after examining the
banking group thoroughly.
Because the bank cut its dividend last year as a result of making a Pounds
242m loss, analysts do not expect any increase. But the reduced dividend is
likely to be well covered, with analysts predicting pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 750m.

Midland Independent Newspapers pitched in this week with what appears to be
a significant opportunity for investors to take advantage of recovery in a
severely depressed advertising market. The group announced a flotation price
of 140p, valuing the regional newspaper publisher at Pounds 193m.
The historic price to earnings ratio of 19.5, based on a full tax rate of 33
per cent, compares favourably with both the sector average of 29.9 times and
multiples of comparable groups such as Trinity International and Johnston
Press.
MIN has won praise for its performance during recession. Since the Pounds
125m management buy-out in 1991, margins have more than doubled from 9 per
cent to 21 per cent. But the improvements may leave potential investors
wondering if most of the benefits of revitalising the group and improving
margins have been absorbed already.
Indeed, this is likely to be the case, except with newly-acquired titles
which offer scope for improvement in the short term.
MIN's main appeal lies in its exposure to classified and, in particular,
recruitment advertising. Even small increases in volumes are expected to
fall straight through to profit.
Longer-term questions centre on MIN's underlying potential in a historically
declining market. Regional newspapers are losing ground steadily to other
media in terms of both audience and their share of the advertising market.
Much will depend on MIN developing new opportunities. Meanwhile, the price
announced this week leaves many convinced the shares will trade on a premium
for the short to medium term.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: How lifestyles are likely to affect
your premium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a time when insurance brokers knew most of their customers
personally, bad habits and all, and could size up their risk level in a
moment.
That has been lost with the arrival of the computer age where the link
between broker or insurer and client is a slender telephone line and risk
assessments are based on bare details from a form.
Do not be surprised in future, though, if your insurance salesman starts
suddenly to get personal, asking if you are married or living with someone,
whether you have children, if you smoke, where you work, what exactly your
job involves, and whether you drive to work or leave your car at the
station. You might even be asked about its colour.
This is not idle curiosity - he could be trying to form a clearer picture of
precisely who the company is insuring and what factors are linked to high or
low claim rates.
Peter Friend, managing director of broker SelectDirect, says the correlation
between lifestyles and claim records is being examined very closely by many
companies. Information technology gives insurers the power to analyse their
own claims experience in more sophisticated ways, and carry out more
research into what questions they should be asking on their proposal forms.
Norwich Union is one company which has been investigating how different
lifestyle factors might relate to future claim rates. The results of this
research have not yet worked through into new policies or new questions on
the proposal form, but Norwich is studying the data carefully and product
developments could follow in the future.
Some things may seem obvious: surely someone who does 30,000 miles a year is
a bigger risk than someone who does 3,000? But if the 3,000 is made up of
lots of short commuting journeys into central London, and the 30,000 is
notched up cruising the empty highways of rural Scotland, the picture
changes.
Things are not always what they seem, or what long-standing conventional
wisdom would indicate. Take journalists, who traditionally have had to bear
heavy loadings for car insurance.
When this is analysed, it becomes clear that many insurers view newspaper
and television journalists (and, by association, anyone in media-related
professions) as hard drinkers who chase ambulances for stories or act as
unofficial chauffeurs to famous interviewees, who then sue for vast damages
when they are involved in an accident.
The mismatch between this image and the actual habits of the majority of
modern, desk-bound, rail-commuting journalists is so huge that you have to
wonder if underwriters base their ratings on the exploits of fictional
journalists from films and novels rather than direct experience.
No doubt there are other professions, or classes of driver, which have less
opportunity to protest in print but could also benefit from premiums linked
more closely to real lifestyles. Technology-aided rating refinements may yet
mean that insurers no longer have to take the broad-brush approach and tar a
whole profession with a small portion's bad record.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Shop around for the best car
insurance - Bethan Hutton finds a few telephone calls can result in serious
savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shopping around for motor insurance really pays. You might find a quote for
half your present premium if you just took time to make a few telephone
calls.
Research by Telesure, one of the new telephone-based insurance brokers,
found differences in premiums of more than 100 per cent in some cases, and
30 or 40 per cent in many. That can easily mean a saving of Pounds 100 or
more. 'I think that rating, overall, is very random,' says Simon Ward,
Telesure's chief executive.
Insurers set their rates in line with their own claims' experience. So, if
your insurer has had a lot of these from drivers with your model of car, or
living in your area, your premiums could rise. Another insurer with far
fewer claims would offer you a much better rate.
But if your renewal is due next month, and you start to shop around now, you
cannot rely on getting the same rate in a few weeks. Premiums can change
significantly from month to month, let alone year to year or between
companies.
There are many loyal (or lazy) customers who renew every year with the same
company assuming that, if their premiums are rising, other companies will be
raising rates in the same way.
Unfortunately that is not necessarily the case: your insurer will have no
compunction about bumping up rates for existing customers, while a rival
might be keen to attract new business and would make you a much better
offer. Most insurers will accept transferred no-claims bonuses, so you do
not have to feel tied.
The motor insurance market is just emerging from a period of steep price
rises - more than 20 per cent a year - to compensate for horrendous claim
rates due to crime and the recession. The industry is also changing shape as
the arrival of Direct Line, the cost-cutting, telephone-based direct
insurer, and its imitators force the old giants of the insurance world to
re-think their strategies.
Some sections of the motor insurance industry are now murmuring about a
price war. That could be exaggerated, but companies moving into the direct
insurance market need to grab a big-enough share of the market to justify
the huge investment in computer systems, staff training and so on.
The easiest way to build up market share is to offer low premiums, even if
that means making a loss for the first few years. And if direct writers are
lowering premiums, the rest of the industry will fight back.
So, consumers could benefit, at least in the short term. Indeed, things are
looking better for car owners than they have for some time.
If insurers want to avoid a price war, they may start trying to compete on
other factors, such as service - promising to offer smoother claims
procedures, for example. This appears to be the direction being taken by the
latest entrant to the direct market, Guardian Direct.
It is, however, far less easy for consumers to shop around for good service
than for low prices. The proof of good service really comes when you claim -
which, with any luck, will be long after you have made your choice.
There can be some confusion between direct insurers and telephone brokers,
especially as both tend to advertise widely with cheap insurance offers.
Direct insurers are those which sell only their own policies, and only
directly to the consumer over the telephone. They cut out third parties,
which reduces administrative costs, and should allow them to charge less.
Telephone brokers have access to quotes from many different insurers, and
use a computer to find the lowest for you. Some of them deal with a select
panel of a dozen insurers, while others quote for more than 100.
It might appear that telephoning a broker is always a better move than
calling a direct insurer - why get one quote when you can get a dozen or
more? But there is a catch.
The direct insurers - which can offer highly competitive rates for average
motorists - do not allow their policies to be sold through brokers. Some
insurers will not sell direct, while others offer different policies and
rates depending on whether they are sold direct or through a favoured
broker. There is no single number you can call to get access to every policy
from every insurer.
So, shopping around is still a time-consuming process, even though you can
now do most of it sitting in an armchair by the telephone. You might have to
resign yourself to an hour or two on the line to half a dozen direct
insurers or telephone brokers (to make it easier, many of them use freephone
or local rate numbers and operate extended office hours). You could then
spend the next morning or lunch break, checking how conventional high-street
brokers measure up, before making up your mind.
In the end, the time factor could give telephone brokers the edge. Giving
such details as your car's make and model, your address, occupation and
accident record over the telephone can take several minutes.
Unless your patience - or eagerness to save money - is boundless, you will
soon tire of repeating the same information over and over again.
A broker gives access to dozens of insurers in the time it would take to get
a single quote from a direct insurer; and as direct insurers proliferate,
you will not want to call them all.
Most of the telephone brokers do not charge directly for the service - they
take a commission if you buy insurance through them. But a couple of new
telephone-based companies are charging consumers more directly.
Insurance Selection charges Pounds 15 to find you the lowest quote from its
panel of 100 insurers. If the quote is not at least Pounds 30 less than the
renewal from your present insurer, the Pounds 15 is refunded.
OneQuote takes your details on a premium-rate telephone line (36p or 48p a
minute) and finds the lowest quote on its system before putting you in touch
with a local broker who is agent for that insurer.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Markets: Job figures trigger a sigh of relief - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After an anxious wait, Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief when the
February employment report was released yesterday.
In the financial markets, the monthly jobs report is always the most keenly
awaited of economic indicators, but this latest set of figures was deemed
especially important because of what had preceded its release: four days of
frantic trading in which stock and bond prices fluctuated wildly amid
growing investor concern about inflation, rising interest rates, and a
possible US-Japan trade war.
Thus, as the Labour Department was preparing to announce the February jobs
figures yesterday morning, Wall Street was holding its breath. A bigger than
expected rise in non-farm payrolls and the Federal Reserve might decide to
put up interest rates again. (The last monetary tightening came on February
4). A smaller than expected rise and the threat of a rate increase would
recede, at least for another month.
Yet, as often happens, the report served initially only to confuse, rather
than clarify, the situation for financial markets. The headline number was a
217,000 increase in non-farm payrolls, which was well above analysts'
forecasts. Also, the decline in the national unemployment rate - from 6.7 to
6.5 per cent - surprised Wall Street, which had been expecting no movement.
First reaction came from the Treasury market, where the price of the
benchmark 30-year government bond quickly dropped three-quarters of a point,
pushing the yield above 6.9 per cent. The initial assumption was that,
because the figures were strong, the Fed would tighten monetary policy
again, and soon.
The sell-off in the bond market, however, did not last long. When analysts
took a second look at the employment numbers, they noticed that the January
payroll figure had been revised downwards. Originally, payrolls were
estimated to have risen 62,000 in the first month of the year. Now, the
Labour Department says payrolls actually declined in January, by 2,000.
The new figure means that, in the first two months of this year, growth in
payrolls has averaged little more than 100,000, which is below the two-month
average recorded in the second half of 1993. For investors worried that
accelerating economic growth and a rapidly-growing labour market would
prompt another interest rate increase, this was good news.
There was more good news when the Bureau of Labour Statistics (the office
which compiles the monthly jobs data) said it might have to revise the
February payroll number downward as well. The BLS said that, because of
recent severe winter weather, a smaller than normal number of companies had
responded to its January and February surveys. When those companies which
were unable to respond in February finally report their employment numbers,
said the BLS, it is likely that the increase in payrolls will be revised
downward - as happened in January.
This was all positive for the Treasury market and, in turn, pleased stock
market investors who have been watching with growing dismay the steady rise
in long-term bond yields. Consequently, share prices more than held their
own on Friday morning, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sitting on a
20-point gain by midday.
Yet, the threat of another rate increase has not receded entirely. One of
the reasons the Fed tightened policy in February was that it wanted to curb
investors' inflationary expectations. By putting up interest rates earlier
than most observers had expected, the Fed hoped it could ease the market's
inflation fears and see a decline soon in long-term interest rates.
This theory, however, has proved invalid so far. Since the Fed's tightening,
long-term rates have climbed sharply. At the start of February, the 30-year
bond yield stood at 6.3 per cent. Today, it stands at well over 6.8 per
cent. If the Fed still believes it can lower long-term interest rates by
raising short-term interest rates, then logic dictates that the central bank
will try once again to dampen inflationary expectations with a rate
increase. Stock and bond market investors - yesterday's encouraging
employment report notwithstanding - must know this.
Then there is the little problem of a possible trade war with Japan. On
Thursday, President Clinton revived a provision that allows the US to impose
sanctions against countries with unacceptable trade barriers. Although this
was interpreted as a warning shot, the financial markets tremble at the
prospect of a trade war because sanctions would put up the price of Japanese
goods sold in the US. Given investors' obsession about inflation, this is an
unwelcome prospect.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Markets: Thunderbolt scatters investors - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Germans unveiled on Wednesday a whispering arrow and a roaring
thunderbolt, each with distinctly different effects on their respective
target markets.
The former, a magnetic levitation train under spasmodic development since
the 1930s, will make 'less noise than a Volkswagen minibus' as its whisks
passengers from Berlin to Hamburg at 250 mph.
The latter, the M3 measure of money supply under intense pressure since
German unification in 1990, scattered investors in its wake as news of its
20.6 per cent rise in January roared through global markets.
What with US growth, price and employment figures also giving investors
further opportunity to worry, it was another highly volatile week for
equities and bonds around the world. Buffeted by these forces, London stocks
rose on the first and last days of the week but had a couple of sharply down
days in between. The FT-SE 100 index swung some 80 points during the week
but ended only a net 3.2 points down at 3,278.
The Footsie has now retreated 242 points, or 6.9 per cent, since its record
high of 3,520.3 on February 2, two days before the Federal Reserve unleashed
an interest rate rise in the US and resulting market mayhem around the
world.
For all the earnest efforts of analysts to decouple UK and European bonds
from US bonds by arguing that inflation and growth trends over here argue
for falling interest rates, European bonds have taken a hammering. UK gilts
have fared worst. They notched a negative 3.47 per cent total return in
February, the sharpest drop among the 13 biggest bond markets around the
world.
The clear consensus is that the bond market sell-off has been greatly
over-done. Fears of inflation and sharp tightening of policy by the Fed are
excessive; worries about the Bundesbank's inability to cut German interest
rates soon because of the runaway money supply are unfounded. Once the Fed
raises rates slightly and European central banks resume lowering their own,
stability will return to bond and thus stock markets.
Into this soothing balm dropped this week a challenging report on
commodities, inflation and the markets by Kleinwort Benson. 'We regard the
sharp rise in global bond yields as warranted by the fundamentals,' says
Albert Edwards, Kleinwort's global strategist who had accurately forecast
the markets' recent turmoil.
For the first time all 15 prices in Kleinwort's commodity index are rising.
A year ago, only seven were rising. The index, which boasts a higher
correlation to OECD GDP growth and world industrial production than
competing indices, has shown a dramatic rise over the past year. When the
index has reached this level in the past, the growth rate of OECD industrial
production has accelerated to 5 per cent or better within a year.
'Rarely has (the index) reached its current level without inflation turning
decisively upwards in the next year to 18 months,' the report concludes. 'We
also suspect that non-US bond markets will continue to be adversely effected
by the global inflation threat.'
Kleinwort is gloomy enough to advise investors to hold substantial cash. To
satisfy the remaining equity component in its assets allocation, it is
steering investors towards markets likely to spring positive earnings
surprises: only Japan and the UK qualify on that score for a hefty
overweight position.
The steep fall in UK share prices over the past month certainly makes stocks
look superficially better value in terms of price / earnings ratio and
dividend yield. Both yardsticks have retreated from the uncomfortable levels
they clocked at the market's peak. The rare, fervently bullish analysts such
as James Capel, have been joined recently by many others.
In spite of all the mayhem in the markets, trading volumes have been
relatively light on down days while up days have encouraged quite wide
buying from investors. Some of them, of course, will be trying to ride every
twist and turn of the market, so exacting can be the measures to which fund
managers have to perform.
The point was driven home this week by the news that last year pension fund
managers achieved, on average, a 27.9 per cent rise in their equity
portfolios against a rise of 28.4 per cent in the FT-SE-A All-Share Index.
For many, the cause was being underweight in shares of HSBC, parent of
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Midland Bank.
HSBC was the star results reporter of this week. Pre-tax profits rose 51 per
cent to Pounds 2.58bn within which Midland quadrupled its profits to Pounds
844m. The group's full-year dividend rose 24 per cent to 23.5p. Rather
disturbingly, though, Pounds 1.1bn of the profits came from foreign exchange
and capital market trading. It admitted this was a performance it was
unlikely to repeat this year, even with a Pounds 26bn bond portfolio.
In the home-grown UK corporate sector, the news was positive almost without
exception. In the engineering sector, Vickers said it had 'turned the
corner' although GKN is still being dragged down by the slump in continental
European vehicle production. Cookson (industrial materials), Zeneca (drugs),
Associated British Ports (port operations and property), Serco (business
services), General Accident (composite insurance) and T. Cowie and Henlys
(car dealers) reported sharply higher 1993 profits.
Ladbroke, the hotel, casino and betting group, cut its dividend for the
first time in its 27-year pubic history and took hefty writedowns on its
properties. But investors had long ago priced in these reforms of new
management and the shares have been one of the best performers this year.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Markets: The Abbey, safe as houses - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the bank sector were a group of children, Abbey National would be the one
playing quietly on its own, while the others rushed around getting into
scrapes together.
Now almost five years old as a banking group - after a previous existence
going back 150 years as a building society - Abbey still has many of its
former characteristics. These help to explain why its performance has been
steadier than those of its competitors.
The disadvantage of such steadiness, however, is that it lacks the
opportunities for rapid growth in bouncing back from disastrous mistakes.
Abbey's 25 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in 1993 announced this week,
is relatively small compared with the recovery of other banks such as TSB,
Midland and National Westminster.
Over 1991 and 1992, Abbey's share price outperformed the FT-SE-A Banks Index
as the other bank stocks were more dragged down by the recession. Their
exposure to bad corporate loans, for example, had a greater impact on them
than did Abbey's to bad mortgages. As the other shares fell, their dividend
yields rose relative to Abbey's. But over the last couple of years, the
major clearers have recovered more rapidly than Abbey, reversing the
relative trends on share prices and dividends.
This is not to say that Abbey has made no mistakes: the 1993 results gave
two clear examples of making up for lost ground, in the Pounds 30m
exceptional charge for the disposal of the Cornerstone estate agency, and
the fall in provisions for bad debts in the UK to Pounds 119m (Pounds 227m).
The benefits from these recoveries will not recur on the same scale, but the
Pounds 99m provisions on the European side for 1993 will fall this year,
boosting pre-tax profits for the current year.
With only limited further gains to be reaped for falling provisions,
however, the question is where Abbey's future growth will come from.
Hugh Pye, of BZW research, believes that Abbey is one of the few in the
banking sector which will achieve underlying growth in the coming years,
from increases in profits for the life insurance business and the treasury
operation.
Scottish Mutual, a wholly-owned life-insurance subsidiary, contributed
Pounds 40m to pre-tax profits in 1993, while Abbey National Life contributed
Pounds 21m. Pre-tax profits from the treasury operation rose sharply to
Pounds 145m, from Pounds 100m in 1992.
Peter Toeman, banking analyst at Hoare Govett, is more sceptical about the
future contribution these two elements of the group can make, and emphasises
the competition for the core UK retail banking operation which is putting
pressure on the group's net interest income. UK retail banking accounted for
Pounds 618m of the Pounds 704m pre-tax profits.
Toeman says that even if Scottish Mutual and Abbey National Life provided an
extra Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m in pre-tax profits this year, a 10-basis-point
fall in the lending margin would cut Pounds 60m from Abbey's profits.
John Aitken, analyst at UBS, questions how sustainable the treasury profits
are. Even those who believe they will continue to grow believe that they
will not grow as rapidly as they did in 1993.
Whatever doubts analysts may have about Abbey's future growth prospects,
however, they are agreed on one matter: Abbey pays good dividends.
Each year since its conversion, Abbey has raised its full-year net dividend
per share. The 1989 dividend of 5.7p per share compared with the 14.0p
dividend for 1993, shows compound growth beyond that of Lloyds bank, the
best performing of the major clearers, where the 1989 dividend was 13.3p per
share compared with 22.1p in 1993.
It has, however, been able to maintain that consistency only by changing its
policy that dividends should be covered by earnings three times. The 1993
dividend is covered by earnings just 2.1 times.
This emphasis on income may suggest that Abbey's relationship with its
shareholders is still reminiscent of that of a building society and its
members. If it is to produce livelier prospects, both Abbey and its
shareholders may have to accept that greater rewards come only with greater
risks.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: More bonus rates announced - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two more insurance companies have announced this year's bonus rates for
with-profits policies. Axa Equity &amp; Law has increased terminal bonus rates
for policies of 20 years or more, but cut them for terms of less than 15
years.
This means that the maturity value of a with-profits endowment policy taken
out by a man aged 29 paying Pounds 30 a month would be Pounds 62,660 after
25 years, up 3.1 per cent from last year, but Pounds 6,478 after 10 years,
down 3.8 per cent.
Scottish Amicable is one of the few insurers to improve payouts on 10-year
policies. Reversionary bonuses on most of the company's policies are lower,
but maturity values have mostly increased.
A 25-year policy on the above basis would be worth Pounds 59,678, up 0.1 per
cent, while a 10-year policy would pay Pounds 6,244, up 1.1 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Zones have earned a reprieve from the Revenue. These are 25-year
investments but sponsors of enterprise zone trusts have been able to provide
an exit to private investors much sooner through the sale of a lesser
interest. In January, the government threatened to disallow this but last
week relaxed the rule, so that investors would be able to leave after seven
years. Johnson Fry, Matrix Securities and Capital Ventures have announced
new EZT launches in the wake of the Inland Revenue's new measure.

</HEADLINE>

House prices increased by 2.2 per cent last month, the biggest monthly gain
since September 1988, according to Halifax, the largest mortgage lender. The
figures conflict with Nationwide, the country's second largest building
society, which said that UK house prices on average fell by 0.6 per cent in
February compared with January. Prices are still well below their 1989 peak.
The societies are in closer agreement on the annual rate of increase, with
Nationwide reporting 3.2 per cent and Halifax 3.8 per cent. Both are
forecasting an increase in house prices of 5 per cent by the end of the
year.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Markets: When it pays to be suspicious - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some 35 years ago, American investment guru Benjamin Graham* wrote: 'An
elementary requirement for the intelligent investor is an ability to resist
the blandishments of salesmen offering new common-stock issues during bull
markets.' Unfortunately, far too many private investors have failed to take
heed.
New issues flooded on to the London market in 1993 and have continued this
year; March alone will see newcomers worth more than Pounds 3bn. The list is
eclectic enough to fit most fancies - department stores, housebuilders, drug
developers, even a Ghanaian gold miner - and some of the prices asked pay
scant regard to the market's recent queasiness. But, as usual, many private
investors are putting more effort into tracking down the newcomers than
searching for good value among companies quoted already.
It would be unfair to suggest that all the newcomers will be bad
investments, but it is sensible to be even more selective than normal when
buying new issues. In the first place, these tend generally to come in waves
near the top of a bull market. So, even if they are good companies, you are
likely to be buying into the stock market at a bad time.
Second, all too many companies arrive with the best of their growth behind
them, or when stock market expectations for their type of business are
unrealistically high. Sometimes, the major shareholders are looking for a
profitable time to offload a lot of their shares, perhaps to repay debts
incurred in an earlier buyout. To quote Graham again: 'Most new issues are
sold under 'favourable' market conditions - which means favourable for the
seller and, consequently, less favourable for the buyer.'
Anyone doubting that issues flow fastest in a bull market needs only to
remember the mid-1980s or look around him now. But is there any evidence
that new issues are generally expensive relative to other companies quoted
already on the market?
Academic research suggests that, on average, they outperform on the first
day after the issue but do substantially worse than the market over the next
few years. Over a three-year period, US issues lagged by 30 per cent and
those in the UK by a comparatively modest 11 per cent**. Companies that
started best tended to finish furthest behind.
A couple of surveys conducted by the Investors Chronicle in the mid-1980s
added some detail to this pattern. They showed that share prices of many of
the most fashionable issues performed a parabola - they went up like a
rocket for a few months but then burned out. But the surveys also showed
very large variations in performance between different companies. The
general message seemed to be that, provided you were selective, buying new
issues need not be disastrous.
That conclusion still begs an important question, though. Can private
investors actually buy shares during the launch period and at the issue
price?
Doing so has become increasingly difficult. Popular issues which are open to
the public tend to be heavily over-subscribed. All too often, private
investors either receive no shares or a derisory number.
Then, too, many issues seem to have become 'shares for the boys.' Smaller
companies sell all their shares through placings with large institutional
investors - which means that private investors' first opportunity to buy
them is in the secondary market after the price has risen. This week, even
House of Fraser, hardly a minnow, announced that it is making only a quarter
of its issue available to private individuals. The odds are becoming
weighted ever more heavily against the private buyer.
But several of the latest crop of launches are investment trusts. Indeed,
the three largest have raised a remarkable Pounds 1.5bn between them.
Perhaps investors who buy new funds have a better chance of success than
those taking a direct stake in individual companies. After all, the
interests of fund managers, unlike those of the promoters of individual
companies, ought to be identical with those of investors.
A recent study by the London Business School*** suggests that new investment
trusts behave very much like other new companies. Rather illogically, their
share prices tend also to go to a (small) initial premium over the launch
price. Over the longer term they tend, on average, to underperform both the
UK market as a whole and their chosen sector.
The study shows no correlation between early strength and subsequent
weakness. But, again, there is a marked variation between the records of
individual trusts.
The flaw in all such research is that there is no guarantee that past price
patterns will be repeated. This is particularly relevant with investment
trusts, where discounts were still common when the LBS study was started.
Overall, though, the evidence still suggests that if you want to try your
hand at new issues, it pays to be suspicious, if not paranoid. Or, as Graham
puts it: 'New issues have special salesmanship behind them, which calls for
a special degree of sales resistance.'

FT  05 MAR 94 / The British miner's broken home: It is 10 years since the
last miners' strike. Since then, nine out of every 10 pits have stopped
producing. It is not only coal that has been lost. A whole culture is
disappearing with it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was at a National Coal Board function in Yorkshire in the late 1970s that
I heard an old miner, a union official at Bentley Colliery, disputing
vigorously with one of the board's engineers. When the engineer left I
commented on the robustness of the old man's attack.
'I'm not bothered,' he said. 'Anyway, I'll be retiring soon.'
'What will you do then?'
'Oh, I'll read some philosophy,' he replied. 'Kant, mostly.'
It emerged that after years working down the pit he had gone to Oxford
University as a mature student to read philosophy, politics and economics. I
assumed he had attended Ruskin, the trade union college.
'No,' he said, 'Balliol.'
'May I ask what degree you got?'
'Well, it were a First.'
More startling than this admission was the fact that this man simply could
not adjust to the prospect that had been opened up to him in the south; he
went home to his own community and back down the pit.
It could not happen today. For one thing, Bentley Colliery, which was then
proudly displaying the latest in hydraulic pit prop technology, closed last
December. No private operator has shown an interest in it.
Ten years ago this week, it was the announced closure of another South
Yorkshire pit, Cortonwood, that set off the longest and most bitter strike
in the miners' history. They fought for a year in defence of their jobs and
communities but were divided and finally crushed.
Even when the strike ended, a year later almost to the day, neither the coal
board (now British Coal) nor the National Union of Mineworkers foresaw just
how savage the contraction of their industry would be. From 170 deep mines
employing 175,000 men in 1985 the state industry has shrivelled to 17
working pits employing fewer than 11,000 men. Of the 28 other mines which
British Coal has offered to lease to the private sector, one has started
producing and up to seven others may be reopened.
At its peak, just before the first world war, coal provided employment for
1m men, a tenth of the male working population. Britain was the world's
biggest coal exporter: its 3,000 mines produced half the coal in Europe, a
fifth of world output. The long retreat was inevitable as the steam age
passed, American and other coal competitors emerged and Britain's
manufacturing dominance faded; but it was partly arrested by two world wars
and, in the early 1970s, by the Opec cartel's quadrupling of oil prices. The
promised reprieve has been scotched by the government's decision to
privatise the electricity generators, to permit the 'dash for gas' as an
alternative fuel, to subsidise nuclear power and - finally - prepare the
pitiful remnants of the coal industry for privatisation next year.
But it is not only coal that has been lost. A whole culture is disappearing
with it and it is a loss that many non-miners nostalgically regret. The
public may have been outraged by the sight of picket line violence and
fearful of the revolutionary rhetoric of union leaders, but has shown
remarkable tolerance of the miners' demands and sympathy for their decline.
It was a public outcry in the Tory shires which forced Michael Heseltine,
president of the Board of Trade, to retract his announcement in October
1992, that 31 pits must close. (The number of pits closed since then is more
than 31, but the rundown has attracted much less attention.) When during the
1974 miners' strike, Edward Heath called his 'who rules?' general election,
the voters, in spite of their fear of 'political strikes', rejected him.
Even after suffering power cuts in the 1972 strike the public seemed to
agree with Lord Wilberforce that the miners deserved to be moved to the head
of the manual earnings league.
Some of this support is based on romantic sentiment, owing more to the books
of D H Lawrence and George Orwell than to familiarity with modern mining. As
Alan Mardghum, branch secretary of Wearmouth colliery (closed before
Christmas), said: 'In the south of England they still view coalmining as a
little lad of 12 gettin' down the pit with his pony and pushing tubs of coal
around. People need to be aware that it's a high-tech, highly-competitive
industry that's been butchered.' (The last pit ponies surfaced last month
when Ellington colliery, the remaining pit in the north-east, was closed.)
The popular image, says Professor Vic Allen, one-time amanuensis of the NUM
left, in his book The Militancy of British Miners, is of 'hard, unrefined
men, distinct and separate from other workers, hewing in mysterious dungeons
of coal; of dirty, strange men, in some ways frightening and for this reason
repellent, yet attractive because they are masculine and sensuous.'
Such romantic stereotyping has often worked to the miners' advantage, of
course. During the 1972 strike, Lawrence Daly, the NUM general secretary,
was heard shouting down the phone to the leader of a group of pickets who
were refusing to give up the social delights of being billeted with Essex
University students.
Yet the monochrome image of taciturn, blackened musclemen is often resented.
Olive Fowler, a former secretary of miners' leader Arthur Scargill, who now
works at Yorkshire Art Circus, a local authority-sponsored workshop in
Castleford, said the group had published three miners' autobiographies which
had only one feature in common: all three men knew Latin (one had Greek and
Hebrew, too). Another miner had exhibited his charcoal sketches of
underground scenes at the Royal Festival Hall in London, and had sold every
one.
If the public has relished the cultural pyrotechnics of mining communities,
miners themselves have always been ambivalent about the job. No doubt, it
was the difficulty, danger - and formerly poverty - of the work that created
the impressive structure of self-help, charity and solidarity in pit
villages. There were Christmas parties for the pensioners, trips to the
seaside and cheap booze at the welfare club. There were bands and parades
and festivals, such as the Durham Miners' Gala now struggling to survive
into its 110th year, where Labour politicians were permitted to address the
rank-and-file of the movement.
The miners' union was a social institution, recorded Will Paynter, the Welsh
miners' leader, in his autobiography: 'Harassed wives who had fallen behind
in hire-purchase instalments on some household goods, or had accumulated
arrears of rent . . . would require letters to be sent. Many times have I
appeared in the local court to testify as to the character of a man or child
who had fallen foul of the law.'
But if there was a choice of other work, miners often looked for it. A boy
who tamely followed his father down the pit was not necessarily seen as a
recruit to the praetorian guard of the proletariat, says Robert Houston,
former editor of The Miner, the NUM journal - he might just be too thick to
get a job anywhere else. The youth in the working men's club with his hand
round a pint of bitter is not necessarily a miner: he is just as likely to
be a hairdresser. But escaping was never easy.
Neil Greatrex, leader of the Nottinghamshire-based Union of Democratic
Mineworkers, wanted to join the army as an engineering cadet. His mother was
keen but his father refused to sign the paper, saying: 'What's good enough
for me is good for you.' Because of the union split, Greatrex's father
stopped talking to his son at the start of the strike, and died five years
later without relenting - an example of how the 1984-85 strike tested
solidarity to destruction.
Some, like Houston, escaped into journalism. Others found an exit via the
colliery brass band into professional music. Football has profited
enormously from Scottish mining: the same coalfield delivered up Sir Matt
Busby, Bill Shankly, Jock Stein and George Graham, the present Arsenal
manager. From the north-east coalfield came, among others, the Charlton
brothers and Bobby Robson. They say in the north that if you wanted a good
team all you had to do was go and shout down the nearest pit-shaft.
The same austere climate produced some remarkable political leaders - who
did not in most cases seek to enter the House of Commons; indeed, parliament
was often seen by ambitious union men as a place to which rivals could
safely be dispatched. Sometimes, as in the case of Lawrence Daly, this
extra-parliamentary skill was combined with extraordinary intellectual flair
and gift of oratory. The passion for self-education, especially in Scotland
and South Wales, was most marked on the political left. Professor Allen
observes haughtily that 'there are no books by any of the right-wing leaders
of the National Union of Mineworkers.'
The emphasis on miners' education was a feature of Scargill's rise to power
in Yorkshire: young men, chosen, one suspects, as much for their socialist
militancy as for their intelligence, would attend lectures in Sheffield and
Leeds to debate the distinction between delegatory and representative
democracy.
Naturally, the Communist Party took particular interest in the miners. Yet,
despite the emergence of men such as Abe and Alex Moffat in Scotland,
followed by Michael McGahey (whose father was a founder member of the
British party) or of Arthur Horner, Will Paynter and Dai Francis in Wales,
there was always the feeling in party circles that these men were miners
first, revolutionaries second.
When the Welsh communists, according to a party veteran recently, warned the
King Street comrades that coalmining was in terminal decline they were
simply contradicted.
McGahey, a fine orator who was on his first soap-box at the age of 13, liked
to intone the dogmas - 'as Lenin said, once the line is clear, organisation
is everything' - but showed a certain lack of attention to deep doctrinal
matters. During one lunch-break when he was presiding over the Communist
Party congress in London - it was the year the British party chose the
Eurocommunist road and the Kremlin had sent a full member of the politburo
to observe - McGahey seemed to be more interested in press coverage of a
local pit dispute.
His own annual conference was a model of democratic centralism, or what he
called a 'unanimity conference', leaving plenty of time for discussion of
other matters - history, people, world affairs. On one evening, discovering
the correspondents of the Financial Times and Morning Star playing snooker
in an upstairs room, he growled: 'Ye're dissipatin' yer youth. Come doon and
have a drink wi' me.'
For all the media attention men like McGahey had received during the 1960s
and 1970s, the left was always in a minority on the NUM national executive
until after Scargill's rise to power. Historically, too, the miners were
slow to move towards socialism, according to the historian Michael Jackson,
being the last big union to leave the Liberal Party for the Labour Party
(which Keir Hardie, another Scottish miner, was instrumental in creating).
The union, he says, was always pragmatic and ready to co-operate - even in
the contraction of the industry - in order to show that the much-desired
nationalisation of 1947 had 'worked'.
The last NUM president, Joe Gormley, epitomised this strategy of managed
decline. Gormley was the last person to promote national strikes - although
he put himself adroitly at the head of his men when, as in 1972 and 1974,
the dam was about to burst - and the first to promote market-related schemes
such as the incentive bonus payments that put money into miners' pockets.
His close relationship with Lord Ezra, former chairman of the coal board,
was seen by the Thatcher government as more like connivance and was one of
the factors which prompted its decision to confront and destroy the power of
the union.
It has been a long ascent and a long decline for the miners. At the
beginning of the 17th century they lived no better than slaves, says the
historian of the Scottish miners, Robin Page Arnot. They lived in hovels of
unspeakable squalor, were denied the right of habeas corpus and were buried
in separate ground. Nearly 400 years later, on the eve of the 1984 strike,
they were among the best-paid manual workers in the country, with access to
mortgages, cars and foreign holidays, the rewards of advances in technology
and productivity.
But the rules of the game had changed, decades of uncertain government
intervention had come to an end and, with the militant, uncompromising
Scargill at their head - to this day he will not acknowledge what happened
as a defeat - the NUM was confronted and its power destroyed. This political
drubbing was followed by commercial retribution, leaving today a swathe of
ghostly pit yards and derelict villages round the country for fresh-faced
sociology students to pick over. Perhaps some of them will win Firsts at
Oxford.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Post chief stresses rewards of sell-off for staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, has promised his workforce
shares and dividends if the government privatises the corporation.
Writing in Courier, the staff newspaper sent yesterday to all 180,000
employees, Mr Cockburn said the sale of the Post Office would give it the
freedom to compete internationally.
'It would allow us to give shares and dividends to all employees, thus
sharing the rewards of success,' he writes. 'Make no mistake, that would be
a lot better than staying in the public sector without the freedom we need.'
Mr Cockburn's message to staff marks the first time he has come out publicly
in favour of privatisation. He believes the alternative of remaining in the
public sector without commercial freedom in its business activities is the
worst possible option. His comments follow a Treasury decision to continue
to refuse the Post Office the commercial freedom it is seeking to compete
with private-sector mail and parcel carriers.
Mr Peter Hain, the Labour MP sponsored by the Union of Communication Workers
 -which represents Post Office employees - said: 'There appears to be a
pincer movement between the Post Office management and Michael Heseltine to
soften up the workforce and the public for privatisation.
'They know that privatisation is bitterly opposed by the workforce. This is
an all too transparent attempt to bribe them; I don't think it will work.'
Mr Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, recently told the trade and
industry committee he favoured privatisation of the Royal Mail, but had been
prevented from changing its ownership because of 'political considerations'.
Since the government first announced its review of the Post Office's future
in 1992, the management, advised by the UK merchant bank Schroders, has been
working on its favoured option of a management buy-out.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Fall in US jobless hailed as sign of strong growth trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fall in US unemployment was greeted by administration officials yesterday
as further evidence that the economy was set on a strong growth path.
Wall Street edged higher in response to the better-than-expected figures
which showed unemployment at 6.5 per cent last month compared with 6.7 per
cent in January, in spite of fears that freezing weather would halt hiring
in many sectors.
'Given the very severe weather conditions in January and February over much
of the country, this shows a continuous good, steady expansion of job
growth,' said Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished 7.88 points up at 3,832.3. The
bond market fell at first on the basis of the jobs data. The benchmark
30-year Treasury bond ended up  1/16 at 92 5/8 to yield 6.829 per cent.
UK equities moved up behind gains in government securities of around a full
point at the long end of the scale. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 31.5 up at
3,278 on moderate volume. Leading continental bourses extended their
recovery with an average gain of about 1 per cent.
Increasing confidence that European bond markets can decouple themselves
from US Treasury securities underpinned hopes that UK base rates could soon
be cut further.
UK government bonds ended the day about  3/4 of a point higher. Gilts
shrugged off overnight weakness in the US Treasury bond market, dropped on
the US employment news at lunchtime, but rallied. German government bonds
rose by more than half a point.
The US Commerce Department said yesterday that its index of leading
indicators, designed to predict economic trends roughly six months ahead,
rose by 0.3 per cent in January, helped mainly by improved consumer
expectations. The leading index has risen steadily for six months, but some
of its components, such as share prices and consumer expectations fell in
February.
Strong US growth in the fourth quarter of last year has aroused inflation
fears. Revised figures this week showed annualised growth of 7.5 per cent.
But Ms Laura Tyson, the chief White House economist, said yesterday: 'Not
only is current inflation extremely modest, but the fundamentals, the things
that explain future inflation - wage patterns, productivity growth, import
prices, energy prices, for example - all remain well-behaved.'
On jobs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said non-farm payroll employment had
recovered from January's weather-related weakness with 217,000 new jobs, far
stronger than most forecasters had expected. The biggest gains came in
services and retailing.

FT  05 MAR 94 / US trade move on Japan sparks fears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The US decision to reactivate its Super 301 trade law provision, opening the
way for sanctions against Japan, was greeted with concern yesterday in
Europe and Asia.
Sir Leon Brittan, European Union chief trade negotiator, was disappointed at
President Bill Clinton's renewal of the provision allowing the US to single
out countries for sanctions. 'The European Union will be examining the
import of these measures very carefully,' he said.
One senior European Commission official said the renewal of Super 301 could
signal a new, tougher US trade stance, based on bilateral muscle.
The US move sparked anxiety from South Korea and Australia, which feared a
setback to free trade. The revival of Super 301 was 'regrettable at a time
when countries are expected to engage in more liberal trade', said a Seoul
government spokesman.
He said trade disputes should be settled under the World Trade Organisation,
to be set up as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
not by the 'domestic legal procedures of one nation'.
Mr Bob McMullan, the Australian trade minister, warned: 'We don't support
the US opening up the Japanese market in a unilateral and retaliatory way.'
In Japan, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said unilateral
trade action against another country would be contrary to WTO rules. But
Tokyo recognised 'the need for a restrained response', he said. Japan would
continue to work on plans to open markets. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime
minister, promised to redouble efforts to cut regulatory trade barriers.
Asian leaders were assured by Mr Jeffrey Garten, US undersecretary of
commerce for international trade, that US problems with Japan 'were quite
unique'.
Frances Williams adds from Geneva: Mr David Woods, spokesman for Gatt, said
the reinstatement of Super 301 should be viewed with 'a sense of
proportion'. It should not be assumed a trade war would follow, and there
was no evidence the US intended to violate Gatt rules.

FT  05 MAR 94 / MEPs may vote for even stricter car exhaust rules: Brussels
faces rejection of emissions legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Commission officials have given a warning that legislation setting
new car emission standards may be abandoned because of opposition in the
European parliament.
The parliament will vote on Wednesday on the Commission's package - already
accepted by ministers - which would cut petrol and diesel car exhaust
emissions substantially in 1996 compared with 1992 levels.
But after the parliament's environment committee demanded stricter emission
standards last month, Commission officials fear the parliament will reject
the legislation in its present form.
Mr Reinhard Buscher, a member of the European Commission's industry cabinet,
says if the measure is rejected, it will 'mean more delay which will make it
very hard for industry to comply with the 1996 standards'. He believes the
parliament is attempting to use the issue to illustrate its new
post-Maastricht political muscle.
The parliament's committee resolutions are being roundly condemned as
ill-judged and unrealistic by Europe's motor industry, assembling in
Switzerland for next week's Geneva motor show.
Leading industry figures say the tighter standards proposed could not be
achieved technically within the 1996 deadline.
MEPs yesterday denied deliberately seeking to challenge the Commission over
the affair, and maintained that the new proposals were based on genuine
environmental concerns.
But with most of the majority socialist and Christian Democrat parliamentary
groups expected to vote against the current package, along with the green
parties, they agreed that there was a very good chance of a vote in support
of the amendments.
The amendments include demands that:
Emission levels for 1996 are made more stringent, with specific new levels
set for 1999 of half the 1996 levels and a commitment to establish tougher
levels after 2000.
Member states should be free to use fiscal incentives to encourage their own
car manufacturers to meet the target levels at a faster rate than the EU
guidelines.
Legal limits should be set for CO emissions.
To block the current package, at least 260 out of the total 518 deputies
serving in the parliament need to support the demands for further
amendments. The socialist group has 198 deputies and the Christian Democrats
162.
If the parliament rejects the measure, the only solution to the stalemate
will be to use the new conciliation procedure established under Maastricht
treaty - the first such environmental case taken to the procedure.
But that is unlikely to produce results before autumn at the earliest.

FT  05 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Scottish Power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A price tag of Pounds 17m for 50 out of town stores hardly looks excessive,
given that they would cost more than that to build. On that basis it is
difficult to accuse Scottish Power of overpaying for Clydesdale. On the
other hand, this is electrical retailing, which has cost the Regional
Electricity Companies an estimated Pounds 100m in the past five years. The
fact that not even the specialists such as Dixons and Comet are earning a
decent living ought to cause a chill around Scottish Power's kilt.
Electricity companies may be stuck with their high street chains, but that
is hardly a reason to propagate the problem.
Electrical retailing suffers because individual purchases are large and
goods are identical in each store. Price-checking is thus worthwhile, and
price competition becomes the primary selling weapon. Only when a new
technology is temporarily in short supply, or economic conditions are
booming, do retailers make much money.
Given the poor characteristics of the business, and Scottish Power's
declared caution about diversification, it is thus surprising that it is
expanding. The company has persuaded investors that its management has been
upgraded and is well trained for new challenges. It has bought sensibly in
gas and is looking rationally at telecoms. But since this form of retailing
has been a graveyard of many ambitions, investors may be forgiven for
feeling a little queasy.

FT  05 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Abbey National
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the market upheavals it is difficult to tell whether Abbey National's
22 per cent dividend increase will be sufficient to reverse its 30 per cent
under-performance against the banking sector over the last two years. That
happened partly because other banks, with a worse bad debt record, were
perceived as having greater recovery prospects. But Abbey also needs to grow
as well as pay large dividends. Sensibly, it has now turned its back on
rasher forms of diversification, such as estate agency and French commercial
property lending. It could go back to basics and buy a building society.
The stock objection is that the mutual structure of societies makes them
difficult to acquire. Yet, provided members are given sufficient incentive,
they can probably be persuaded to de-mutualise. A predator could offer
members of most societies several hundred pounds apiece and still acquire
the business at book. The amount needed to swing the vote pales into
insignificance with the goodwill that could accrue if the same predator were
trying to buy another bank.
Banks like Lloyds and TSB are also occasionally mentioned in connection with
building societies, but it makes particular sense for Abbey. The trend
towards more liberal rules on wholesale funding by societies means others
may soon enjoy the same Eurobond funding opportunities which it acquired
with conversion to plc status. If Abbey waits for societies to de-mutualise
voluntarily before buying, it might miss the boat altogether. Depending how
it is carried out, de-mutualisation can confer protection against takeover
for the five ensuing years, a privilege which Abbey itself is still, just,
enjoying.

FT  05 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Cookson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cookson's management has done a fine job pulling the company back from the
brink. The business has been slimmed down from the sprawling conglomerate of
the 1980s and the balance sheet repaired, albeit courtesy of two rights
issues. Gearing is below 30 per cent and Cookson is generating net cash
before disposals, so the financial position looks secure. Full-year growth
in operating profits of 18 per cent, excluding the favourable impact of
currencies, also testifies to success in eliminating losses while keeping
the lid on costs.
But with the trading margin already up to 8.4 per cent by the year-end,
Cookson will find that rate of progress difficult to sustain. The final
stages of loss elimination should push the margin up towards 9 per cent, not
far short of the company's stated double-digit target. The focus thereafter
will have to shift towards expanding sales. An underlying 5 per cent
turnover increase last year was more than respectable given difficult market
conditions. More will be required to maintain forward momentum.
With around half its turnover in the US, Cookson should be an early
beneficiary of recovery. Other acts of good housekeeping - such as
increasing the proportion of UK profits to avoid writing off additional
advance corporate tax - would also help earnings. With the shares at a 20
per cent price-earnings premium to the market average, though, Cookson will
have to live up to a growth-stock billing.

FT  05 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Sound and fury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For all the hoo-ha in the markets this week, the FT-SE 100 index finished a
mere 3.2 points down. Even long gilts, the proximate villain of the piece,
only fell by around three-quarters of a point. This is hardly the stuff of
savage bear markets, but the volatility in bonds and equities is enough to
make many investors nervous. From a chartist perspective, the last week's
price movements could mark the kind of churning which occurs around a market
peak. There has been international selling, and it is a brave fund manager
who steps in and buys now.
Yet while the low point of UK and US bond yields has almost certainly
passed, inflation is unlikely to force bond yields up substantially. As the
UK recovery is ticking along and there is plenty of slack still in the
system, growth should feed through to strong earnings increases without much
extra price pressure. The corporate reporting season now well under way
shows earnings rising in line with expectations and dividends, if anything,
rising faster. There are thus strong counter-weights which may support
equity valuations.
Still, given the uncertainty, there is likely to be something of a hiatus in
the market. Stock selection will also be important. Interest-rate sensitive
yield stocks, such as utilities and even food retailers, have lagged behind
since the bond market turned. Early-cycle growth stocks like media, which
should see the best of the near-term earnings rises, may continue to attract
attention. Investors will, however, have to overcome an aversion to what
already look like sky-high ratings.

FT  05 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs after mixed jobs
report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
After an indecisive start, US share prices rose across the board yesterday
in the wake of a mixed February employment report that was seen as mostly
positive for equities, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.88 at 3,832.30, but
off its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended
up 1.73 at 464.74, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished 0.83
higher at 466.48 and the Nasdaq composite 5.97 firmer at 790.55. Trading
volume was 312m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1,271 to 807.
For an increasingly nervous stock market, yesterday's keenly-awaited
February jobs data ultimately proved to be good news. At first, however, it
looked anything but, with bond prices tumbling after the Labor department
announced a 217,000 increase in monthly non-farm payrolls, and a drop in the
civilian unemployment rate from 6.7 per cent to 6.5 per cent.
The rise in payrolls was much bigger than expected, and the decline in the
jobless rate came as a surprise, prompting the bond market to worry that the
strong numbers would persuade the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates
again to stop the rapidly growing economy from pushing up inflation.
A second glance at the data, however, proved more rewarding. Among the
positive aspects were a sharp downward revision in the January payrolls
number and a weaker-than-expected worker earnings figure. Consequently, the
bond market bounced back impressively from its early losses, with the yield
on the benchmark 30-year government bond dropping from above 6.9 per cent to
end near 6.83 per cent.
Stocks also benefited. After a mixed start, share prices turned decisively
higher around mid-morning, and just before midday the Dow was sitting on a
gain of more than 20 points before it edged lower during the afternoon. The
stock market was ultimately pleased with the February jobs report because
while it showed continued strength in the labour market, it was not strong
enough to spook the bond market. Stocks were also cheered yesterday by news
of a 0.3 per cent rise in leading economic indicators.
Among individual sectors, car stocks continued to outshine the wider market.
Chrysler put on Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 59 3/8 , General Motors added
Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 62 1/8 , and Ford climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
65 1/8 .
Financial stocks, which have been hit hard recently by concern about the
impact of rising interest rates on bank and brokerage company profits,
rebounded. Citicorp rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 39 1/2 , Chemical added
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 36 1/3 , Chase Manhattan firmed Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 31 1/2 , and NationsBank rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 47 3/4 .
On the Nasdaq market, technology sector leaders were mostly higher, with
Apple up Dollars 1 at Dollars 36 3/4 and Intel up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars
69 5/8 .
Canada
Toronto stocks closed up on positive sentiment and a slightly higher gold
price.
The TSE 300 composite index rose 28.31 points to 4,398.56 in volume of 61.3m
shares. On the week, the index was up about 35 points.
Utilities, mining and industrial products gained 1.53 per cent, 1.43 per
cent and 1.40 per cent respectively, and banks, consumer products and energy
were flat.

FT  05 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: New threat to turbulent US financial
markets - Renewed volatility after two years of relative calm is making
matters worse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After enjoying mostly plain sailing throughout 1992 and 1993, investors in
US stocks have encountered some rough seas in the past month.
The turbulence of the past few weeks has been particularly unsettling
because the year started so well. In January, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average climbed more than 200 points, or almost 6 per cent, to a record high
of 3,978.36. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, a broader measure of market
performance, advanced by 3.5 per cent to a peak of 481.61.
The end of January, however, proved to be the lull before the storm. In
February, share prices struggled to keep their footing. The Dow fell 150
points, or 3.7 per cent, during the month, and the S &amp; P 500 declined by 3
per cent.
The sudden change in climate was prompted by the Federal Reserve's decision
on February 4 to raise short-term interest rates by pushing the Federal
funds rate up from 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent. It was the first tightening
of monetary policy in five years and, although a rate increase had been
expected on Wall Street, the timing caught investors off guard.
The move was seen as an attempt by the Fed to keep long-term interest rates
low by displaying its readiness to take pre-emptive action against the
threat of inflation. It was also partly a technical manoeuvre, designed to
bring real interest rates (nominal interest rates minus the rate of
inflation) back up from near zero to more historical levels.
The rate increase, however, has had a disastrous impact on bond and stock
market sentiment. Bond prices have tumbled, and yields have jumped amid
growing concern that the heady pace of recent growth is stoking inflationary
fires within the economy.
Some analysts on Wall Street are appalled at this mess. Ms Nancy Kimelman,
chief economist with Technical Data, says: 'There should be no question in
anyone's mind that the move in the funds rate from 3 per cent to 3.25 per
cent, intended to reduce inflationary expectations, failed miserably. Not
only has the bond market responded to the rise in short-term rates by
jacking up the yield on the long bond by 75 basis points, but markets around
the world, which have been rather complacent about inflation, are now
focused almost entirely on the prospect of renewed inflation. The question
is: will the Fed try this again?'
To make matters worse, financial markets also now have to contend with the
threat of a trade war between the US and Japan. On Thursday, President
Clinton reinstated the 'Super 301' provision to US trade law that allows the
government to impose trade sanctions against any country which employs
unfair trade restrictions on US goods and services. The bond market is
particularly fearful of a trade war because it could lead to a sharp rise in
the price of imported Japanese goods, which would only fuel inflation
further.
If declining prices have not been bad enough for investors, the return of
volatility is also making their lives miserable. While 1992 and 1993 will be
most remembered for the stock market's impressive performance, and the
unprecedented flows of investor cash into the equity market, those two years
also marked an extraordinary period of stability in share prices.
Mr David Shulman, the chief stock market strategist at Salomon Brothes in
New York, highlighted the unusual lack of volatility in the last few years
in a recent report. He found that share price volatility, as measured by the
percentage difference between the S &amp; P 500's peak and trough of each year,
was remarkably low in 1992 and 1993, measuring 11.8 per cent and 9.8 per
cent, respectively. Both were record lows for volatility, and compared with
an average volatility in the S &amp; P 500 since 1934 of 28.4 per cent.
Mr Shulman explains the sharp drop in volatility between 1992 and 1993 by
pointing to a decrease in correlation between the S &amp; P 500 and its
constituent industry groups. While traditionally, the index's industry
groups have tended to move as one (when auto stocks do well, so do drug
stocks, when transportation stocks are weak, so are financials), in 1992
group correlation began to fall sharply as the different sectors started
dancing to different beats.
The main reason for this, says the Salomon analyst, was high share
valuations, which forced money managers to rotate holdings rapidly in a
continual search for sectors that were either cheap or had price and/or
earnings momentum. The end result was less correlation between industry
groups, so less volatility, because when one sector did well, another
performed badly. The two cancelled each other out, leaving the S &amp; P 500
little changed.
In the past month or so, however, volatility has begun to return, with the S
&amp; P 500 groups moving in tandem once again. This helps explain why, since
the February rate increase, the market has been up sharply one minute, and
down just as sharply the next - a consequence of many sectors moving in the
same direction.
Why is this happening? Mr Shulman ventures that it is both a statistical
regression to the mean, and the result of an economic recovery that is
finally beginning to look more normal. And when the economy returns to
normal, so does the pattern of share price movements.
The message in all this is that investors should expect more volatility in
coming months. This is a worrying prospect, because in the past, when
periods of unusually low volatility have come to a close, they have more
often than not been followed by a decisive movement in the stock market.
With share prices so high, Mr Shulman warns that the decisive movement this
time is likely to be downward. For investors, more stormy seas may lie
ahead.

FT  05 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses continue
an uncertain recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses continued their recovery yesterday, but strategists took a dim view
of immediate prospects, writes Our Markets Staff. Nomura said 'sell Europe';
and while Goldman Sachs stayed positive about global equities on a 12-18
month view, it reckoned that a further correction of 5 to 10 per cent could
be on the cards for the continent.
FRANKFURT looked good, with the Dax up another 22.19 to close the week only
0.7 per cent lower at 2,060.09, and bridging the rest of the gap in the
post-bourse where the Ibis-indicated close was 2,076.76.
However, this was not a convincing rally, said Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck
Finck in Dusseldorf: equities moved on futures trades rather than
fundamentals.
Turnover fell from DM9.5bn to DM6.8bn. Schering fell another DM12.50 to
DM995.50 for a 5 per cent drop on the week, reflecting worries about
capacity and competition for its Betaseron multiple sclerosis drug.
PARIS reacted to the US jobs data with a late kick higher, pushing the
CAC-40 index up 24.28 to 2,178.69, a 1 per cent rise on the week. Turnover
was FFr4.2bn.
A number of stocks which had been battered in mid-week were pulled higher on
bargain hunting: Elf Aquitaine adding FFr4.50 to FFr412.50 and UAP FFr4.40
to FFr184.70.
Canal Plus put on FFr35 or nearly 4 per cent to FFr998 as the media group
announced that it had formed a strategic alliance with Bertelsmann of
Germany.
AMSTERDAM ended the week almost where it started, the AEX index rising 1.84
to 414.25.
The improvement in sentiment was largely the result of good results on
Thursday from DSM and Philips, which continued to rise yesterday. The
chemical group added Fl 4.30 to Fl 116.00, while Philips put on Fl 1.60 to
Fl 51.60, but off a session high of Fl 53.50, as some profits were taken.
KBB, the department store group, firmed Fl 4.10 to Fl 118.10 on a 17 per
cent gain in 1993 operating profit.
ZURICH recovered another 2.2 per cent as results from Credit Suisse proved
above most expectations. The SMI index added 61.8 to 2,865.2 leaving the
market, 5.6 per cent lower after the first three days, only 2.2 per cent
down over the week.
CS Holding put on SFr11 to SFr647 as analysts began revising upwards their
estimates for its preliminary results due on Tuesday. Banks are seen as the
key to the market's direction next week: heavy US selling of the sector was
responsible for the market's weakness early in the week.
Motor-Columbus rose SFr120 or 8.7 per cent to SFr1,570 on the sale of its
Swiss cable television subsidiary.
MILAN remained in positive territory, the Comit index adding 2.87 to 652.55,
little changed on the week.
The market took heart from news that net inflows for Italian mutual funds
remained at a record level in February. But the mood was bruised by a later
announcement that Italian car deliveries fell 15 per cent in February from
the year earlier. Fiat retreated from a day's high of L4,785 to finish L55
ahead at L4,771.
MADRID was led higher by construction stocks on government approval of an
infrastructure plan. The general index closed up 5.35 at 335.16, a fraction
lower on the week.
STOCKHOLM fell behind the pack, the Affarsvarlden General index rising only
5.80 to 1,513.10, 1.4 per cent lower on the week. Astra A fell SKr5 to
SKr171, after an intraday low of SKr160, after the German authorities
proposed to withdraw approval for intravenous use of the company's
anti-ulcer drug, Losec.
BRUSSELS featured a 13 per cent gain in the steelmaker, Clabecq, as the
Bel-20 index rose 9.81 to 1,489.30, 0.8 per cent lower on the week. Clabecq
advanced BFr146 to BFr1,248 on its late Thursday forecast that it would
return to a positive cash flow by mid-1994, following losses last year.

FT  05 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises 1.8% in
volatile region
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investors failed to react to the decision by the US government to reinstate
the Super 301 trade provision, and share prices gained ground on active
buying by arbitrageurs and investment trust funds, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average rose 360.14, or 1.8 per cent, to 19,966.00, up 0.8
per cent on the week, having fallen to a low of 19,627.96 in the morning and
peaking at 20,052.11 in the afternoon.
Investors, who had expected the yen to rise on the announcement of the
revival of Super 301, were relieved after the Bank of Japan's heavy yen
selling intervention kept the currency from rising against the dollar.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 19.96 to 1,622.29, while
the Nikkei 300 rose 3.98 to 299.30. Volume totalled 294m shares against
410m.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.39 to 1,341.11.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y30,000 to Y958,000, along with other
multi-media related stocks. NEC rose Y24 to Y1,020 and Sony gained Y120 to
Y6,180.
Arbitrage buying supported banks with Industrial Bank of Japan rising Y50 to
Y3,310 and Fuji Bank gaining Y30 to Y2,290. Brokerages were also firm, with
Nomura Securities up Y20 to Y2,290 and Daiwa Securities advancing Y50 to
Y1,730.
Hitachi, the day's most active issue, lost Y2 to Y925, posting its third
consecutive fall on profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 260.63 to 22,069.16 in volume of 104.7m
shares. Roundup
There were a spread of performances among the region's markets yesterday.
HONG KONG remained volatile with the market again moving upwards, helped by
steadier activity overseas. The Hang Seng index gained 116.16 to 9,918.19,
down 1.8 per cent over the week.
Turnover fell to HKDollars 4.7bn from Thursday's HKDollars 5.3bn.
Domestic investors concentrated on property stocks, with the sub-index
improving 389.64 or 2.13 per cent, to 18,648.57. Investors are anticipating
strong results from property companies later this month.
SEOUL fell for the fourth consecutive session, the composite index shedding
5.61 to 896.55, a week's loss of 2.5 per cent. Turnover rose to Won459.4bn
against Thursday's Won429.4bn.
Export-oriented companies went against the trend: Samsung Electronic rose
Won100 to Won71,100 and Hyundai Motor Won600 to Won42,300.
TAIWAN firmed 3.9 per cent on reports that the central bank would raise the
Dollars 5bn ceiling on combined foreign investment in the market.
The weighted index rose 215.13 to 5,672.87, only marginally higher across
the week. Turnover was impressive at TDollars 73.1bn from Thursday's
TDollars 38.7bn. The financial sector climbed 6.3 per cent, while
electronics were favoured by foreign investors.
MANILA fell across the board, the composite index dipping 91.23 to 2,606.82
as turnover rose to 823.6m pesos from Thursday's 817.9m. The market has
fallen nearly 12 per cent since last Thursday - the market was closed on
Friday - with foreign institutional investors remaining absent and domestic
retail investors selling heavily.
PLDT lost 25 pesos to 1,865, after a drop of 50 cents to Dollars 66.75 on
overnight trading in New York.
AUSTRALIA retreated sharply on worries over a possible rise in US interest
rates. The All Ordinaries index dived 34.6 to 2,116.8, a week's loss of 1.5
per cent. The market is now at its lowest level since December 24 1993.
BOMBAY lost 4.4 per cent, partly in continued reaction to Monday's budget
and worries over falling prices of Indian global depositary receipts on
international markets. Brokers commented that this might stop foreign
institutional investors from buying in the Indian bourses. The BSE index
shed 175.07 to 3,806.65, bringing its fall since Monday, when budget
proposals were presented, to 11 per cent.
BANGKOK rose on strong buying of financial stocks. The SET index put on
18.87 to 1,359.25, off 4.2 per cent across the week. Turnover was Bt7.7bn.

FT  05 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Stocks brush off fear of Federal
Reserve move - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market rounded off a nervous week in good form as bond prices
moved higher in Europe in spite of renewed weakness in US Treasuries. Fears
that the US Federal Reserve might tighten policy again in the wake of
yesterday's employment and economic indicators were brushed off in European
markets, and sentiment strengthened at the close when Wall Street, too,
turned higher.
Share prices opened nervously but began to advance as bond markets
strengthened across Europe. The FT-SE Index was ahead by about 14 points
when the US economic statistics flashed across the screens in London trading
rooms.
The increase in US payroll numbers was only slightly above market tolerance
levels, while modest increases in earnings levels were received without
strain. US bonds began to ease but UK government securities, taking their
lead from German bonds, moved higher. Gains in share prices were extended,
although dealers stressed that trading volumes were unimpressive.
The pace quickened towards the close as Wall Street responded favourably to
benign money market moves by the Federal Reserve and by the close of
business in London the FT-SE Index stood at 3,278.0, plus 31.5 on the day.
The Dow Industrial Average was then about 20 points up.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended the week only a few points down as bond markets,
including UK gilts, have recovered confidence after the heavy falls suffered
last week. Sentiment is still nervous, but traders hope that Europe may have
disengaged itself from US factors for the time being, and that the expected
tightening of credit policy by the US Federal Reserve will not prevent cuts
in European rates. Reductions in UK base rates are still thought likely,
perhaps when the April tax increases hit UK consumers.
The UK government bond market responded vigorously to the improvement in
Frankfurt. By the close, long-dated gilts were a full point higher, with the
short dates, which reflect base rate hopes, ahead by  1/8 or so. UK traders
were impressed yesterday to see European bond markets apparently decouple
from US Treasuries, although Mr Nick Knight warned that Friday afternoon was
not the best time to make such judgments. He continues to advise selling
into strength in UK equities, and sees little immediate improvement in bond
markets in Europe.
Mr Sushil Wadhwani, at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, fears a
further 5 to 10 per cent correction in global markets in the near term
although he still predicts 10 to 15 per cent returns on global equities from
current levels over the next year.
Interest also returned to the FT-SE Mid 250 stocks yesterday, taking this
Index ahead by 20.3 to 3,927.3, a gain of 7.4 on the week. But a Seaq
trading total of only 581m shares, against 676.1m on Thursday, indicated a
good deal of caution among the institutions. Retail, or customer, business
in equities was worth Pounds 1.41bn on Thursday, a comfortable but not
excessive level by comparison with this year's daily averages.
The stock market has seen only moderate selling pressure during the latest
setback and this week has brought clear indications that the institutions
were willing to buy stock at what several broking houses have identified as
a cheap market for equities.

FT  05 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: British Steel firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnover in British Steel rose to 9.5m as the shares put on 4 to 141 1/2 p,
after Thursday's positive meeting with a select group of analysts.
Engineering group Siebe closed 9 ahead at 616p, following a bullish
presentation at SG Warburg. TI Group improved 13 to 430p, in sympathy with
Siebe.
Motor dealer Henlys Group, cheered the market with a turnaround in full year
figures. The shares hardened 7 to 352p, after it reported profits of Pounds
7.3m, against last year's loss of 2.1m. The company also announced a
one-for-four rights issue at 280p, to raise Pounds 25.8m for expansion.
Among transport stocks, news of a writ for British Airways dampened
enthusiasm for the stock, leaving it to move against the market trend. The
shares gave up 5 1/2 to 434 1/2 p, after trade of 5.4m.
The spectre of big losses following the heavy losses and wild swings in
bonds and gilts over the past few weeks continued to cast a shadow over the
financial areas of the market.
In the high street banks Barclays, due to report preliminary figures next
Wednesday, suffered from intermittent bouts of selling pressure, the shares
eventually closing a net 6 off at 512p after good turnover of 5m. The bank
is expected to report pre-tax profits of upwards of Pounds 800m compared
with last year's Pounds 242m loss.
Standard Chartered, reporting on Tuesday, and heavily sold throughout the
week following HSBC's preliminary figures last Monday, fell a further 17 to
1112p with turnover reaching 1.2m shares. Analysts expect Standard to
achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds 400m-plus.
HSBC, given a rough ride by the market despite its excellent figures, staged
a good recovery, the shares bouncing 20 to 856p. Lloyds managed a minor gain
at 578p while TSB were also chased up and settled 6 higher at 249p.
Hambros was the outstanding performer in the merchant banks, the stock price
racing up to 385p before closing a net 9 higher at 379p in the wake of the
optimism on the UK housing market expressed by associate Hambro Countrywide.
SG Warburg dropped to 820p early in the session before stabilising and
closing only marginally easier at 826p. Smith New Court, the securities
house and one of the London market's biggest marketmaking houses, rallied to
end the day a net 10 higher at 404p.
Union, the discount house, dropped 6 to 176p following news of the proposed
Pounds 11m rights issue.
Pearson was one of the best performers in the media sector closing 25 up at
693p, after news of Pounds 33m investment in a theme park in near Barcelona,
Spain. BZW also reiterated their buy stance on the shares saying that in a
fully-valued sector Pearson was one of the few with scope to surprise when
it reports on March 28, while a conference earlier in the week in Paris was
said to have offered good news on BSkyB.
Reuters continued to gain ground adding 44 more at 2078p, with analysts
divided over whether it was buying ahead of the four for one share split
scheduled for April 18 or a follow through from good figures and the recent
buy recommendation from Smith New Court.
But the general feeling was the sector is due for a period of quiet
consolidation and profit-taking. 'It's time to let some of the hot air out,'
said one.
Shares in Goldsborough Healthcare, the nursing home, hospital and homecare
group, struggled on their market debut, opening around the 160p level and
making heavy weather before picking up to close at their issue price of
170p. Goldsborough was hived off from Kunick, the leisure group.
Calmer views on interest rate prospects kept the retailing and stores sector
quiet, although in line with the firmer trend across the market. Food
retailers were particularly strong, with Sainsbury up 12 to 379p and Kwik
Save up 8 to 612p as nervousness elsewhere turned buyers towards consumer
stocks. WH Smith rose 8 to 513p, with Morgan Stanley putting the stock back
on its buy list. Analyst Nicholas Bubb said that the company looked like
solving its two problems of Our Price and Do-It-All, with the former being
merged with Virgin Retail and a package being assembled to dispose of the
latter. He revised his 1994/5 forecasts up from Pounds 142m to Pounds 148m.
Kingfisher rose 8 to 604p and Marks &amp; Spencer was up 7 to 426p.
Leisure stocks had a quiet day, with Rank Organisation rising 19 to 1100p
ahead of its share split on March 14. Turnover in Ladbroke, the casino and
hotels group, down  1/2 at 198 1/2 p, was slightly higher than average at
5.7m, as the market further absorbed Wednesday's results.
Good results and a positive post-results meeting with analysts saw Cookson
Group jump 13 to 266p. Volume rose to 5.6m.

FT  05 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sector led by Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pharmaceuticals sector was led by Glaxo, which also took the accolade as
the FT-SE 100's best individual performer and the market's heaviest traded
stock as the shares raced higher on news that the German authorities are to
ban the use of the intravenous-type anti-ulcer drug Losec, manufactured by
Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals company. It was emphasised by analysts,
however, that the intravenous form of Losec is only a small part of overall
sales of Losec. The German ban on the intravenous form of Losec came amid
concerns about possible damage to patients hearing and sight.
Losec has long been viewed as the biggest market threat to Glaxo's
anti-ulcer drug, Zantac. The Losec news came during an afternoon global
conference call organised by Astra.
Mr Andrew Porter, pharmaceuticals specialist at UBS, the securities house,
said the latest developments regarding Losec would be seen as good news only
in the near-term until the Losec details are clarified. He did emphasise
however, Glaxo's 'exceptionally attractive' yield. Mr Peter Cartwright,
pharmaceuticals specialist and head of research at Williams de Broe, the
stockbroker, described Glaxo as 'the most attractive stock in the UK
pharmaceuticals sector.'
Glaxo shares raced up to 712p, before closing a net 25, or 3.7 per cent,
higher at 707p. Turnover of 13m was the highest single day's activity in the
stock since the group revealed sharply better than expected interim figures
on February 17. SmithKline Beecham put on 5 to 396p.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar firmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve yesterday kept interest rates unchanged after the
release of a mixed set of employment data, writes Philip Gawith.
Foreign exchanges had eyes for little else beyond the figures which last
month prompted the Fed to increase its Federal Funds rate by 25 basis
points, subsequently throwing financial markets into turmoil.
Ever since markets have been obsessional in their focus on US inflation
prospects and the prospect of a further tightening of policy. Although the
217,000 increase in February jobs was well above expectations, it was offset
by other inflation indicators such as average hourly earnings.
Continuing speculation about another credit tightening helped the dollar
close higher in London at DM1.7198 from DM1.7088 on Thursday.
The D-Mark was mixed in Europe yesterday, finishing lower against the
Belgian franc, the Italian lira and the French franc, and stronger compared
to the Irish punt and the Spanish peseta. It closed just over a pfennig
weaker against the dollar at DM1.7198.
Attention was focused on the industrial dispute in the engineering sector.
Employers and unionists met last night in a late attempt to stave off
industrial action next week.
Going into the talks Mr Klaus Zwickel, head of the IG Metall union, told
Reuters: 'The probability of a strike is very large. This is the last chance
to avert it.'
The Portuguese escudo finished unchanged in London at Es102.3 to the D-Mark
after the central bank cut its emergency lending rate, for up to Es100bn of
one-day funds to resident banks, by  1/2 point to 11.00 per cent from 11.5
per cent. The little used rate was previously cut by a similar margin on
January 19.
The dollar started the day strongly after President Clinton's resurrection
on Thursday evening of Super 301 - the provision in US trade law allowing it
to impose sanctions on countries with trade barriers.
Part of the reason for dollar strength was support from the Bank of Japan,
assisted apparently by buying from US funds and Japanese life insurers.
Analysts said Japanese insurers sold yen to shift some of their
yen-denominated assets to other higher yielding overseas assets.
Traders said interbank short-covering also helped the US currency, while the
market appeared to be modifying its view that any intensification of the
trade dispute was bad for the dollar.
In terms of yesterday's figures, the headline increase in the non-farm
payroll was partially offset by the downward revision of the January figure
from a 62,000 rise to a 2,000 decline. Hourly earnings rose by only 0.2
cents and the working week fell to 34.3 hours from 34.8 hours.
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with around Pounds 400m of
late, unspecified assistance, bringing total help for the day to Pounds
1.369bn. This compared with its latest forecast of a Pounds 1.5bn liquidity
shortage, revised down from Pounds 1.7bn earlier.
With the D-Mark under pressure, sterling gained against the German currency
to finish in London at DM2.5629 from DM2.5546. It finished slightly lower
against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.4903 from Dollars 1.495.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper brightens LME
gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper shone dimly through the London Metal Exchange gloom this week. As
prices of most base metals tumbled the exchange's flagship contract rallied
to end Dollars 27.25 up at Dollars 1,914.75 a tonne for three months
delivery.
Copper's relative strength was built on the solidity of support below
Dollars 1,870 as tonne revealed by a sharp fall in the first half of the
week. Signs of a tightening nearby supply situation fuelled the rise
yesterday, when the cash discount against three months metal narrowed from
Dollars 19 to Pounds 13.25 a tonne. A week earlier it had stood at Dollars
23.
Supply tightness was also behind the only other LME rise on the week - for
aluminium alloy. As the market responded to scrap shortages (the contract is
based on secondary aluminium), falling stocks and forward technical
tightness the three months price yesterday touched Dollars 1,225 a tonne,
the highest since its launch 17 months ago, and the cash discount (or
'contango') against metal for delivery in three months, which in mid-week
stood at Dollars 18 a tonne, turned into a Dollars 10 premium (or
'backwardation').
By the close the three months price was back to Dollars 1,217.50 a tonne, up
Dollars 45 on the week, and the backwardation had moderated to Dollars 5 a
tonne.
The primary aluminium contract also made ground yesterday as investment fund
buying helped it to recoup some of the losses suffered early in the week on
disappointment that producer representatives meeting in Ottawa had only
rubber-stamped output cutting proposals drafted last month in Brussels.
In the absence of further cutback announcements from producers adding to the
three months price dipped to Dollars 1,270 a tonne at on point, before
closing yesterday at Dollars 1,302.50, down Dollars 12 on balance.
The LME's heaviest loser was lead, with the three months position closing
yesterday at Dollars 455.50 a tonne, down Dollars 33 overall. Yesterday's
Dollars 4 fall was attributed to technical selling after chart analysts said
Thursday's break of support at Dollars 460 a tonne had confirmed a 'head and
shoulders' formation, signalling further falls.
Negative chart factors also hit the zinc market, sending the three months
position to Dollars 934.25 a tonne, down Dollars 39.25 on the week.
Gold's reputation as a haven in times of economic trouble took another knock
this week as turmoil in the financial markets failed to prevent a break
through the bottom end of its recent trading range.
The London bullion market price was fixed yesterday morning at a three
months low of Dollars 375.65 a troy ounce before closing at Dollars 376.60,
down Dollars 2.10 on the week. 'It suggests a fund is getting out,' one
dealer told the Reuter news agency.
After a shaky start coffee futures were rescued on Thursday by Brazil's
announcement that it was set to fulfil its obligations under the
multinational export retention scheme after reaching a new financing
agreement with producers and exporters.
The success of the retention plan, agreed last September, in lifting coffee
prices out of the doldrums had been undermined recently by Brazil's
continuing failure to put into store the full 20 per cent of its export
shipments required under the scheme.
Before the Brazilian announcement May delivery coffee was quoted at Dollars
1,216 a tonne at the London Commodity Exchange, but by Thursday's close it
was up to Dollars 1,232 and yesterday it moved on to Dollars 1,248, up
Dollars 13 on the week.

FT  05 MAR 94 / International Company News: Isuzu Motors link with Suzuki to
be dissolved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Isuzu Motors, the Japanese truck and commercial vehicle maker, and Suzuki
Motor, the largest minicar producer in Japan, have agreed to dissolve their
business ties after almost 13 years.
The agreement, which frees each company to sell its stake in the other,
highlights the growing willingness of Japanese companies to unwind business
ties which have outlasted their usefulness. Susuki holds a little over 1 per
cent of Isuzu shares and Isuzu just over 2 per cent of Suzuki.
Isuzu, which is 37 per cent owned by General Motors of the US, and Suzuki,
in which GM has a 3 per cent stake, formed their business and capital link
in 1981 with the blessing of GM and in the hope that as fellow members of
the American group a tie-up would bring significant benefits.
However, the link has only led to a deal in which Suzuki provided Isuzu with
vans on an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) basis and one in which
Suzuki's commercial vehicles were manufactured at an Isuzu facility in the
UK which it jointly owned with GM.
The former resulted in just 1,500 vans being made between 1986 and 1988
while the latter led to 72,000 vehicles until last year. Both projects were
abandoned after the vehicles proved unpopular.
The two companies have had difficulty finding new joint business
opportunities and none have been formed since August last year. Isuzu is a
maker of trucks and large commercial vehicles while Suzuki makes cars under
1000cc.

FT  05 MAR 94 / International Company News: Microsoft issues new MS-DOS
after verdict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft has moved quickly to issue a new version of its widely used
personal computer operating system software, MS-DOS , following last week's
verdict in a Los Angeles court that the company is guilty of patent
infringement.
Last week, Microsoft was found to have infringed patents held by Stac
Electronics, a small California software company, and ordered to pay Dollars
120m in damages. The patents cover data compression technology used to
double the storage capacity of a personal computer hard disk.
Stac is seeking an injunction to halt Microsoft's sales of programs
containing the offending technology. These include MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2, the
operating system software that is normally installed in new PCs before they
are shipped from factories.
Microsoft said that it has begun sending English language copies of MS-DOS
with the data compression feature removed to 1,300 PC manufacturers
worldwide.
Other European language versions will follow within a few days.
Microsoft said that in light of the verdict it was also removing data
compression from several other products. Most users will not notice the
changes, the company said.
Stac has asked the court to force Microsoft to withdraw all offending
products shipped since February 1. This would include Microsoft software and
PCs pre-loaded with software that is currently on the shelves of computer
stores.
However, Microsoft said that it does not anticipate any 'material'
disruption of the supply of any of its products.
Microsoft continues to deny patent infringement and said that it will ask
the judge to overturn the jury verdict and, failing that, it will appeal.

FT  05 MAR 94 / International Company News: Micro compact car set for 1997
launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STUTTGART
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz, the German executive and luxury carmaker, and SMH, the Swiss
watchmaker, are aiming to launch a 'micro compact car' in Europe by 1997-98.
The two companies are to form a joint venture incorporated in Switzerland in
which Mercedes-Benz will hold a 51 per cent stake and SMH, the maker of
Swatch watches, 49 per cent.
The combination of the prestigious German luxury carmaker and SMH, the
company which masterminded the rescue of the Swiss watch industry with the
development of the high quality, low-price Swatch, is unprecedented in the
world automotive industry.
The two groups are aiming to open up an entirely new segment at the bottom
of the car market for a two-seater urban micro car that would be only 2.5m
long (significantly shorter than the 3.05m Rover Mini) allowing it to be
parked in congested cities head-on to the pavement in the gap between other
parked cars. It is expected to cost less than DM20,000 (Dollars 11,739).
Mercedes-Benz disclosed yesterday that it had been working on concepts for a
micro city car since the early 1980s. It unveiled yesterday two prototype
micro compact cars that have been designed and developed at its California
design studio.
The expertise of the Swiss watchmaker, which has been working for more than
three years on its own Swatchmobile project for an environmentally friendly
city car, is chiefly in the development of a hybrid electric/petrol
propulsion system, in micro-electronics, low cost modular production, and in
the marketing of high volume low-cost fashion products, like the Swatch.
Mr Nicolas Hayek, chairman of SMH (Ste Suisse Microelectronique et
d'Horlogerie) and the creator of the Swatch revolution in the world watch
industry, said the joint venture would aim to sell the micro city car
worldwide.
The name of the new car and the possible distribution channels were still to
be developed by the joint venture, said Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive of
Mercedes-Benz.
A separate franchise would be created which could use both the Mercedes-Benz
and the Swatch names.
Mercedes-Benz's decision to press ahead with the development of a micro city
car comes only a few months after its announcement that it planned to
develop a small four-passenger car sized between a Ford Fiesta and a
Volkswagen Golf.
A concept small car, the Vision A-93, was unveiled last year, and the small
car - to be sold under the Mercedes star - is scheduled to enter production
at Mercedes-Benz's Rastatt plant in south-west Germany in 1997 with a volume
of up to 200,000 cars a year.
Mr Jurgen Hubbert, director of the car division, said that a production
version of the micro car would be around 2.5m long and 1.4m wide. The car
would be high to create inside space. There would be room for two passengers
and some luggage and the car would meet all the safety and emissions
standards of larger cars.
The short but high shape of the car will allow the engine and gearbox to be
positioned under the passenger compartment. Mercedes-Benz is aiming at a top
speed of 140kph for the micro car, a range of 500km and acceleration of zero
to 100kph in 13-14 seconds. Petrol, electric and hybrid propulsion systems
are possible.

FT  05 MAR 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa sell-off may get under
way this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government yesterday reaffirmed its commitment to privatising
Lufthansa, and indicated that the process could get under way this year.
An official from the finance ministry told the Reuters news agency that the
government intended to give up its majority holding in the airline in 1994,
although details of how it will take its stake below 51 per cent have yet to
be worked out.
The comments from Mr Eckart John von Freyend, director of government
holdings at the finance ministry, follow recent indications from Mr Theo
Waigel, finance minister, and Mr Matthias Wissmann, transport minister, that
the privatisation process will begin this year.
Although Lufthansa is keen to be privatised, the move away from state
ownership is currently blocked as a result of a dispute over the financing
of pensions for Lufthansa employees. Lufthansa is likely to have to make a
substantial contribution to VBL, the government employee pension fund, in
order to help finance the pensions when the group leaves the public sector.
Privatisation is unlikely to be effected via a direct sale of government
shares in the airline: it is more probable that Lufthansa will hold a large
rights issue in which the government will not participate, thereby diluting
its stake.
Lufthansa is to seek shareholder approval to raise capital at its annual
meeting on July 6; a one-for-three rights issue at current share prices
would raise DM1.7bn (Dollars 960m) and lower the government stake to about
40 per cent.

FT  05 MAR 94 / International Company News: Credit Suisse rises 53% despite
provisions jump

Credit Suisse, the flagship universal bank within the CS Holding financial
services group, has reported a 53 per cent rise in consolidated net income
in 1993 to SFr1.46bn (Dollars 1.02bn) in spite of an 81 per cent jump in
loss provisions to SFr2.8bn.
The figures are distorted by the effects of the acquisition of Swiss
Volksbank early last year, although the main business trends - huge gains in
income from trading and services more than offsetting depressed interest
income and the cost of bad loans - stand out.
Trading income, the largest source of group profit, soared 118 per cent to
SFr3.4bn. The London-based 50 per cent owned derivatives subsidiary, Credit
Suisse Financial Products, more than doubled its net income to SFr444m.
Commission income, mainly from asset management, jumped 54 per cent to
SFr2.6bn. Interest income was up 20 per cent to SFr2.8bn but solely due to
the consolidation of Volksbank. Both banks saw declines in their interest
income. Excluding Volksbank, profit before taxes and provisions was up 62
per cent to SFr4.6bn. Including Volksbank, the figure was SFr5.1bn, up 79
per cent.
Volksbank, which was close to collapse when CS made its SFr1.6bn agreed bid
in January, 1993, was also responsible for SFr727m of the SFr1.26bn growth
in the group's provisions. In addition, the group provided a SFr270m
extraordinary contribution to Volksbank to enable it to show a nominal SFr2m
net income.
Total Credit Suisse group assets at the year end were up 34 per cent to
SFr232bn.

FT  05 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banks to step up pressure on
Walt Disney

<TEXT>
The Euro Disney banks plan next week to step up pressure on Walt Disney, the
US entertainment company, to reduce its entitlement to royalty payments and
other fees from the troubled leisure group.
Representatives of 63 international banks in the Euro Disney loan syndicates
yesterday met in Paris to be briefed on the progress of negotiations over
its FFr13bn (Dollars 2bn) emergency financial restructuring between their
steering committee and the Disney companies.
The meeting, which lasted all day, was a continuation of a previous session
on Wednesday.
The steering committee, led by Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque
Indosuez, has for the past fortnight been holding informal negotiating
meetings with Euro Disney and Walt Disney.
One of its main objectives is to ensure that the US group plays a larger
part in the final restructuring package thereby sharing the burden of
rescuing Euro Disney.
Walt Disney has set a deadline for the completion of the rescue. However, it
is understood to be willing to continue its financial support for Euro
Disney after that date, providing the banks have agreed to an outline deal.
The banks yesterday were given a full presentation of the investigative
audit into Euro Disney that they commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick, the
consultancy group.
KPMG endorsed recent changes in the management of the EuroDisneyland theme
park.
The banks, which had originally considered recommending radical changes in
Euro Disney's strategy and senior personnel, issued a statement saying that
the lossmaking group was 'moving in the right direction'.

Brierley Investments, of New Zealand, reported a 24 per cent rise in
earnings to NZDollars 140.4m (USDollars 79.9m) for the six months to
December 31, from NZDollars 112.7m a year ago.
The improvement was in spite of providing for a NZDollars 36m loss on the
sale of the group's 27 per cent interest in Dominion Breweries.
Directors said the main contribution to the rise in trading profits by
NZDollars 6m to NZDollars 148m was an improved performance from the
company's main investment, Mount Charlotte in the UK, and good performances
from Air New Zealand, Carter Holt Harvey, Sealord Products, and Australian
Consolidated Investments. They said the profit increase was achieved in
spite of reducing shareholdings in subsidiaries.

FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Tussauds invests Pounds 28m in Spanish
theme park
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Tussauds Group, a subsidiary of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times,
is investing up to Pounds 33m in a theme park that will open at the resort
town of Salou, south of Barcelona, next spring.
The UK group is to make an initial Pounds 27.5m investment to acquire a
40.01 per cent stake in the theme park, known as Tibigardens, with an option
to acquire a further 10 per cent within five years of its opening.
Tussauds will obtain the contract to manage Tibigardens and provide Pounds
9.8m in loans for start-up costs. The venture represents its first big move
outside the UK where it owns Alton Towers and Chessington World of
Adventures.
Tibigardens is a smaller scale Euro Disney and aims to draw some 3m visitors
from April to October.
A key attraction for Tussauds is understood to be the potential partnership
possibilities it offers with Anheuser-Busch, the US food and drinks group
whose leisure arm, Busch Entertainment, designed Tibigardens and owns 20 per
cent of its equity.
Busch Entertainment runs nine theme parks in the US and chose Salou as its
first European investment shortly after Walt Disney opted for Marne La
Vallee, near Paris.
The other shareholders are La Caixa, Spain's leading savings bank, and
Fecsa, the local electricity utility.

FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Power accelerates growth with
Clydesdale buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Power believes it has accelerated its expansion into the English
electrical goods retail market by several years through the acquisition
yesterday of 50 out-of-town superstores from the receivers of the Clydesdale
Group, which collapsed at the end of January.
The deal, along with the sale of Clydesdale's rental book for Pounds 8.3m to
UK Consumer Electronics, part of Granada Group, means the break-up of the
Clydesdale chain which failed because of under-capitalisation, poor sales,
and a costly expansion programme in England.
Grant Thornton, the receivers, should realise up to Pounds 42m from the two
deals, and hopes eventually to achieve asset sales of about Pounds 70m.
Creditors are owed about Pounds 80m.
It said the bid from Scottish Power was the best of three substantial
offers.
The purchase of the superstores in the Midlands and the north of England is
part of a deal worth up to Pounds 34m under which Scottish Power will
acquire 36 superstores in England and 14 in Scotland. It will pay Pounds
16.9m for the stores themselves, and up to Pounds 17m for their stock,
subject to a physical check.
The deal means that Scottish Power will increase the number of its
superstores in England from two to 38, and in Scotland from 12 to 26. Its
retail operation, which includes a number of stores selling brown as opposed
to white goods, as well as 90 high street shops, made an operating profit of
Pounds 4.5m last year on sales of Pounds 90.2m.
Mr Duncan White, one of Scottish Power's two chief operating officers, said
yesterday that it had been proving difficult to secure the space it needed
for its expansion on retail parks. That problem was now solved, he said.
The company said it was not able to bid for the whole group because that
would have raised monopoly issues with the Office of Fair Trading, given its
market share in the Scottish white goods market, estimated at over 30 per
cent. It held discussions with the OFT prior to concluding the deal with the
receivers to establish what would be acceptable.
The receivers are negotiating with potential purchasers of Clydesdale's loan
book, which it hopes will realise Pounds 25m, and have received expressions
of interest for some of the high street stores.
Mr Allan Griffiths, one of the receivers, said the deals with Scottish Power
and Granada would secure the jobs of 600 of the 1,400 Clydesdale employees.
Consultations with staff on possible redundancies will begin on Monday.

FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs push Coutts Consulting
into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restructuring costs pushed Coutts Consulting Group, the career consultancy,
outplacement and residential training company, Pounds 4.89m into the red at
the pre-tax level for the year ended December, against a profit of Pounds
1.22m last time.
At the operating level, however, the group was Pounds 701,000 in the black,
including an Pounds 823,000 loss on discontinued operations, mainly
accounted for by the bank training division, sold to Euromoney Publications
last June. This compares with Pounds 1.77m, including a loss on discontinued
operations of Pounds 616,000, in 1992.
Turnover from continuing operations climbed from Pounds 14.9m to Pounds
16.7m. Discontinued operations contributed Pounds 1.75m this time, compared
with a previous Pounds 4.77m.
The career management and outplacement operations increased profits from
Pounds 2.19m to Pounds 2.33m before exceptional operating costs. Turnover in
the division rose from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 14.1m.
Sir Kit McMahon, chairman, said that the problems which had been holding the
company back had been resolved.
Orders and management figures for the first two months of this year 'are
both encouraging and our cashflow is strong'.
The group said all the main objectives of the reorganisation had been
achieved - the termination of its costly long-term lease in London's
Docklands, which resulted in a total charge of Pounds 6.45m; the capital
reconstruction that had been hampered by Mr Barry Topple, the former chief
executive; and the disposal of the training division, which resulted in a
Pounds 1.29m gain.
Debt has been reduced from Pounds 6.28m in June to just over Pounds 6m at
the end of the year, and the group expects the strong cashflow to continue
the reduction.
The Pounds 1.3m proceeds from the sale of Winkfield Place, expected to be
completed at the end of this month, will also be used to reduce borrowings.
Losses per share were 20.56p, compared with earnings of 1.85p.
Sir Kit said the board was 'devoting its efforts' to the need to pay off
arrears on the preference dividend and to resume ordinary dividends.
The group said all outstanding issues with Mr Topple, who owns 70 per cent
of the preference shares, had been resolved.
He has been paid Pounds 180,000 for the termination of his contract and been
recompensed for some legal expenses.

FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Union launches Pounds 10.9m rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union, the City discount house, yesterday announced a Pounds 10.9m rights
issue to restore shareholders' funds following its disastrous foray into
asset leasing.
The 2-for-5 issue is priced at 150p, and up to 7.6m new shares will be
issued.
The shares fell 6p to 176p.
The announcement follows Union's recent return to profitability under a
revitalised management. Mr George Blunden, chief executive, described the
cash call as a 'balance sheet rebuilding exercise'.
He said Union's discount house had been forced to turn down orders because
of Bank of England regulations on capital adequacy. Shareholders' funds had
fallen from Pounds 81m to Pounds 37.5m between 1991 and 1993.
The cash call may prove to be an interim measure, as it will shore up
capital in existing discount operations, rather than fund development of new
fee earning businesses.
'The future growth is about fee earning services, not raising capital to
build trading positions in the market', Mr Blunden said.
The rights issue represents the final stage in a turnround in Union's
business since Mr Blunden joined the board in June 1992 from Warburg
Securities' discount house. The company suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds
24m and Pounds 16m in 1991 and 1992 respectively, resulting from the poor
performance of its asset leasing businesses.
New management was forced to sell businesses to survive, including
Winterflood, the profitable stockbroking subsidiary.
The company plans to build upon its long-established money markets client
base, by developing fund management, equity and gilt-edged marketmaking,
derivatives and consultancy businesses.
Its discount house and leasing business provided the bulk of the Pounds 4.5m
pre-tax profit in 1993, but future growth will come from new businesses.
Analysts expect profits to reach Pounds 6m in the current year, and initial
forecasts suggest the 1995 outcome should exceed Pounds 7.2m. On a
post-rights price of 168 1/2 p, the shares are trading at a p/e of 10.5 and
a discount to an adjusted net asset value per share of 182p. Brokers expect
the issue to be strongly supported.

FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: NTL expands in Pounds 6.6m deal
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NTL, the broadcast transmission and telecommunications company, has bought
an organisation specialising in mobile communications for emergency services
in a Pounds 6.6m deal, writes Raymond Snoddy.
DTELS was a government agency which used to be part of the Home Office. It
installs and maintains mobile communications from 56 sites around the UK and
employs nearly 500 people.
The deal means that NTL will be the majority supplier of mobile
communications for the emergency services.
A total of seven bids were received for DTELS, although in the end the
battle was between NTL - which is expected to have a turnover of about
Pounds 120m this year - and Pell Frischmann, the consulting engineers.
Later this year, NTL will consider whether to apply for a flotation
following completion of three years' accounts as a private company.

FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: US advance helps lift Cookson 59% to Pounds
95m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strengthening US markets, particularly in the final quarter, helped Cookson
Group, the specialist industrial materials company, to report a 59 per cent
increase to Pounds 95m in pre-tax profits for 1993.
The results compared with restated profits of Pounds 59.9m and highlighted
the refocusing of the group over the past few years under Mr Richard Oster,
chief executive.
Earnings per share rose by 51 per cent to 12.1p (8p) and the proposed final
dividend is lifted 10 per cent to 3.3p, making a total of 6.3p (6p).
The shares gained 13p to 266p.
Cookson's electronic materials and plastics businesses, both of which have a
large presence in the US, led the advance with operating profits up 63 per
cent and 48 per cent respectively.
Turnover increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 1.43bn (Pounds 1.24bn) including
Pounds 759.3m from the US.
Mr Oster said the market growth experienced by the group in the US and east
Asia during the first half of 1993 continued and, in some markets,
strengthened in the second half.
Commenting on the outlook, he said: 'So far in 1994, market conditions
remain similar to those experienced in the last quarter of 1993. The US
continues to perform strongly in most areas, the UK is improving and
continental Europe appears, on the whole, not to be getting any worse'.
The disposal of non-core businesses added about Pounds 7.9m to the pre-tax
result. Excluding these gains, and the effects of currency movements,
pre-tax profits increased by 34 per cent. At constant exchange rates
turnover increased by 5 per cent and operating profits were 18 per cent
higher.
Overall, operating profits grew by 32 per cent to Pounds 110.5m (Pounds
83.4m), which helped lift the return on sales to 7.7 per cent (6.7 per
cent).
Electronic materials contributed Pounds 36.7m (Pounds 22.5m) to operating
profits while plastics provided Pounds 19.7m (Pounds 13.3m). The ceramics
division was flat at Pounds 34.7m (Pounds 34.4m) while engineered products,
buoyed by the US-based precious metals business, improved to Pounds 19.4m
(Pounds 13.3m).
Net interest costs declined to Pounds 23.4m (Pounds 27.2m).
Following the successful Pounds 185.6m rights issue a year ago and the sale
of some non-core businesses, year-end gearing dropped from 76 per cent to 28
per cent.

FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Turnround to Pounds 15.8m at Hambro
Countrywide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hambro Countrywide, the estate agent and financial services chain, yesterday
announced its return to profitability in 1993, as a result of increased
house sales and profits from investment disposals.
Mr Harry Hill, joint managing director, was confident of strong sales growth
in 1994, and said the company was keen to acquire a sizeable estate agency
chain to add to its network of 446 offices.
The company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.8m (Pounds 1.58m deficit)
last year, after five consecutive years of losses. Turnover rose from Pounds
90.8m to Pounds 96.9m.
The results were significantly lifted by the Pounds 12m profit from the sale
of investments in Hambro Legal Protection and Hambro Countrywide Security.
The estate agency division cut losses from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 2m, and
has started to open new offices, reflecting renewed confidence after years
of retrenchment.
The company owns Hambro Guardian Assurance, which became a fully-fledged
life assurance company in October upon the expiry of a five-year link with
Guardian Royal Exchange on reassurance and policy administration.
Life assurance activity contributed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 10.7m (Pounds
10.8m), and Mr Hill expected the decoupling from GRE to boost profitability.
Hambro's strategy is to sell financial services, mortgages, and
property-related services through its estate agency network. The key to
rising profits is, therefore, rising house sales.
During 1993, Hambro sold 47,275 houses, a 21 per cent increase over 1992.
In the first two months of the current year, Hambro has achieved a 34 per
cent increase in the number of house sales in the hands of solicitors.
Hambro is cash neutral. Mr Hill said the company was keen to pick up 200 to
300 new offices from one of several unwilling owners of estate agency
chains.
A final dividend of 0.25p is proposed, making a total of 0.75p for the year.
Earnings per share amounted to 4.43p (0.67p losses).

FT  05 MAR 94 / International Company News: James Crean in the black with
IPounds 15.9m
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A turnround from pre-tax losses of IPounds 15.4m to profits of IPounds 15.9m
(Pounds 15.3m) was announced by James Crean, the Dublin-based industrial
holding company, for the year to December 31.
The 1992 loss was after an exceptional IPounds 32.4m charge for the
write-off of IAS, an aircraft leasing subsidiary. There was an exceptional
IPounds 300,000 charge in 1993 relating to a disposal.
Operating profits dropped by 8 per cent to IPounds 22.2m on turnover up 8
per cent at IPounds 245m.
The company said that competitive market conditions had squeezed margins,
especially its office products division.
However, Mr Brian Molloy, chief operations officer, pointed to the overall
sales growth across the group which he said was indicative of a lifting of
recessionary conditions and should bring 'a sharp upswing in margins' in its
wake.
Net borrowings at the year-end were IPounds 77.8m (IPounds 69.7m). Last
month the group announced a 35-for-100 rights issue, together with a
convertible loan stock issue, to raise a total of IPounds 62.8m before
expenses. This will be used to reduce gearing to 40-50 per cent, leaving
between IPounds 15m and IPounds 25m for acquisitions being sought in the
food sector in the US and electrical wholesaling sector in the UK.
Inishtech, the 70 per cent-owned subsidiary which earlier this week
announced an 11 per cent growth in pre-tax profits to IPounds 8m,
contributed 40 per cent of Crean's profits. Crean has announced its
intention to acquire the remaining 30 per cent of Inishtech through a share
swap, but Inishtech's independent directors have now indicated that they
will seek a cash alternative in any offer. This could absorb a significant
part of the funds being raised for other acquisitions.
Earnings per share, after goodwill amortisation and exceptionals, were 20.6p
(76.1p losses). Unadjusted earnings were 27.4p (29.3p).
A final dividend of 7.865p (4.635p) is recommended for a total of 13.5p
(12.5p).
COMMENT
Crean has seen its turnover almost double in the past five years, but
profits and earnings per share have been declining since 1989 while gearing
has leapt to 83 per cent. Shareholders are now to be called upon to clean up
the balance sheet, through a rights issue at a tempting 20 per cent discount
to the current share price of 325p. Fully diluted earnings of 25p per share
can be expected in 1994, giving a prospective p/e of 13, cheapish for the
sector, but maybe rightly so given performance to date.

FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Henlys recovers and seeks Pounds 26m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henlys Group, the motor trading and bus and coach manufacturing and
distribution company, plans to raise Pounds 25.8m through a 1-for-4 rights
issue at 280p.
The group, which yesterday also reported 1993 results showing a profits
turnround and a raised final dividend, said proceeds would be used to
strengthen the balance sheet and to expand the core motor division, both
organically and through acquisition. The shares rose 7p to 352p.
Higher new and used car sales and a turnround in the bus and coach business
underpinned the recovery. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.31m compared with a
restated loss of Pounds 2.08m in 1992 when the group was hit by Pounds 2.18m
of exceptional charges, including costs of fighting off a hostile takeover
bid from T Cowie.
Turnover grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 372.2m (Pounds 331.1m), led by the
motor division which lifted sales from Pounds 265.3m to Pounds 306m.
Operating profits more than doubled to Pounds 9.17m (Pounds 3.8m) with the
motor side contributing Pounds 7.28m (Pounds 5.77m), largely as a result of
improved trading.
New vehicle volumes increased by 18 per cent with retail sales up 13 per
cent, while used car volumes grew by 19 per cent.
Coach manufacturing and sales operations recorded an Pounds 1.89m operating
profit, compared with a Pounds 1.97m loss, on turnover little changed at
Pounds 66.2m (Pounds 65.9m). Yesterday the group acquired from Charterhouse
Development the 50 per cent of the Roadlease Contracts financing business
which it did not already own for Pounds 50,000.
Pre-tax profits were further boosted by a Pounds 250,000 gain on property
disposals, a Pounds 286,000 (Pounds 257,000) share of profits of Roadlease
and a sharp reduction in net interest costs, which fell to Pounds 2.4m
(Pounds 3.95m), reflecting lower interest rates and reduced borrowings.
Net borrowings fell by Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 16.1m at end-December,
representing gearing of 32 per cent. Proceeds of the rights issue, fully
underwritten by Charterhouse, will be used to virtually eliminate term debt,
reducing gearing to about 2 per cent.
Panmure Gordon is stockbroker to the issue.
COMMENT
Although the resurgence of the car market has helped, Henlys' management
deserves credit for steering the group back to profit. Although some 80 per
cent of group profits now come from sources other than new cars, forecourt
sales still drive the rest of the motor business. The rights issue is well
timed and deserves support since it should enable the group to fully
capitalise on the recovering market and to expand geographically through
acquisitions. Pre-tax profits could reach about Pounds 11.7m this year
producing earnings of 19p and the board is predicting 7.5p of dividends. The
shares have gained almost 250p over the past 12 months and now trade on a
prospective p/e of 18.5.

FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Litho Supplies up 30% as sales start to
improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first signs of recovery in the commercial printing industry helped boost
profits by 38 per cent at Litho Supplies, the printing products distributor
which came to the market last November.
Maiden results of the Midlands-based group showed pre-tax profits ahead to
Pounds 4.63m (Pounds 3.35m) in the 12 months to December 31.
The rise was fuelled mainly by rising sales in southern England in the last
quarter, which helped overall turnover improve 10 per cent to Pounds 60.2m
(Pounds 54.7m).
Mr John Byford, joint managing director, said that before last September -
when demand started to increase - trading conditions had been patchy at
best.
'We began to see an upturn at the end of last year, but it has not been a
dramatic improvement,' he said.
The pick-up, however, was enough to push year-end profits 7 per cent ahead
of flotation forecasts of Pounds 4.33m.
Of the three distribution arms, sales by the electronic equipment division
showed the sharpest increase, up 87 per cent to Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 4.5m).
Turnover rose by a more modest 4 per cent in consumable products such as
film, chemicals and printing plates. The division continued to dominate the
business, accounting for Pounds 49.1m (Pounds 47.3m) of sales.
Mr Byford said an improved performance by these two businesses helped offset
weak sales of traditional printing equipment, down Pounds 200,000 at Pounds
2.7m.
Together, the divisions contributed to a 21 per cent increase in operating
profits to Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 4.72m).
The results were also boosted by a cut in interest payments following the
group's decision to use most of the proceeds of last year's Pounds 14.1m
placing and intermediaries offer to cut borrowing to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds
10m).
Earnings per share were 12.9p (8.6p) and a dividend of 0.7p is payable for
the period between flotation and the year end.
The shares, placed at 190p last year, were unchanged at 274p.

Waterman Partnership Holdings, the consulting engineer, nearly doubled
pre-tax profits from Pounds 56,000 to Pounds 106,000 in the half year to
December 31.
In London the group continued to trade profitably and a number of new
commissions were won. However, the volume of international work decreased
because of recession in western Europe and political instability in Russia.
Turnover rose to Pounds 3.98m (Pounds 3.62m). Earnings per share were static
at 0.2p and an unchanged interim dividend of 0.5p is declared.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of British Data Management, the specialist data management
and storage group, showed a near-10 per cent improvement from Pounds 1.6m to
Pounds 1.75m in the six months to end-December.
Turnover increased to Pounds 8.18m (Pounds 7.04m), reflecting a full
contribution from the three commercial data management businesses acquired
last year.
At the operating level profits rose to Pounds 2.06m (Pounds 1.65m),
principally because of the replacement of rental charges with
correspondingly higher interest costs from the acquisition of property
previously held on leasehold terms. The interest cost on the acquisition
loans amounted to Pounds 210,000, pushing the total charge up from Pounds
53,000 to Pounds 311,000.
Earnings per share were 5.7p (6.3p). The interim dividend is raised to 1.65p
(1.5p).

FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Inspec market float gives Pounds 100m
valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inspec Group, the speciality chemicals company which was a Pounds 40m
buy-out from British Petroleum 18 months ago, confirmed that it is coming to
the market via a placing and intermediaries offer valuing it at over Pounds
100m.
The flotation will raise just under Pounds 50m - the limit for an
intermediaries offer - of which about Pounds 37m will be new money. The
offer price will be announced on March 17.
The FT-SE 100 index has fallen almost 6 per cent since Inspec announced its
plan to go public a month ago, but Mr John Hollowood, chairman, said the
market weakness would have little impact on the flotation.
Inspec will use the proceeds to pay off expensive buy-out debt and Pounds
5.45m of deferred consideration to BP.
Following the flotation, there will be debt of some Pounds 7m and net assets
of Pounds 22m, to give gearing of about 32 per cent. Mr Hollowood said that
after-tax profits for 1993 would have been Pounds 7.5m on a pro-forma basis,
including a full year from recent US buy Allco and flotation proceeds.
Sir Charles Tidbury, former chairman of Whitbread, has joined the board as
non-executive deputy chairman and Mr Julian Sheffield, chairman of Portals,
is to be a non-executive director.
The flotation is being handled by Morgan Grenfell with Cazenove as brokers.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Emily Bronte would very likely have
approved of wind farms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ANNE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Nigel Spivey in his article 'Bronte country can go with the wind'
(Arts: February 26/27) is right to send up the illustrious literary
environmentalists who wrote to the Times Literary Supplement on February 18
to call upon the government to ban further wind farms within a 20-mile
radius of Haworth.
It may be that there was no place to liberate Emily Bronte's mind quite like
the moorland round her home; but that does not mean we can expect to
liberate our own minds by returning there, still less by seeking to ensure
the skyline does not change. In any case, it appears from her poems that
Emily was more interested in the wind (the 'blast') than the skyline, and
nobody is suggesting the turbines damage wind.
It is possible that, if she had been living 150 years later, Emily would
have approved of the wind farms. Charlotte Gerin in her biography (Oxford
University Press, 1978) describes how the task of investing the legacies she
and her sisters received from their aunt in December 1842 fell to Emily, and
how that strong-minded person took shares for her sisters and herself in the
York and North Midland Railway Company, which had been started in 1839. It
would appear Emily Bronte was not afraid of innovations.

Sir, I have a customer in Malaysia to whom I have sent the following letter:
'Dear Mr Wong,
Everyone in this country is sorry to hear that Malaysia is placing a ban on
British products, in our view totally illogically because the English press
is not controlled in any way by the British government.
'There seems only one way for the normal businessman to bring this home to
your citizens and I am afraid that is by the simple decision not to buy
anything else from your country. We will not, therefore, be buying any more
bookcases and it is a pity because they are a good product and they are
beginning to sell well.'
I suggest that similar letters from other readers could only be beneficial]

Sir, I am second to none in my admiration of Sir Owen Green's remarkable
leadership of BTR, but I was disturbed by some of the statements he made
during the Pall Mall Lecture on UK corporate governance last week, as quoted
in your article 'Cadbury Critique' (February 25).
Sir Owen's lack of enthusiasm for non-executive directors is clearly the
exception that makes the rule in the context of BTR's splendid financial
record.
In his own words, Sir Owen is a 'pre-Cadbury practitioner', and may I
suggest that he lacks any real experience of non-executive director
contributions to company success. Having myself served on several listed
company boards on both sides of the Atlantic I must say that to suggest that
non-executive directors 'must blunt the competitive edge and deflect the
entrepreneurial drive which characterises participation, let alone success
in a free market' is ill-informed nonsense.
On several occasions I have been involved with change at the level of
chairman and chief executive which was greatly welcomed by executive
colleagues who were unable to initiate the necessary action.
More importantly, in all my experience the outside board directors have
demonstrably broadened the vision of the board and, above all, encouraged
entrepreneurial drive and development of the company.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Codswallop, but a big deal for Norway: Spanish demands for
fish are a hurdle to EU membership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By HUGH CARNEGY and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to imagine many Spanish fishermen wanting to venture to the bleak
waters of the Arctic, where the shoals of Norwegian cod run beneath the icy
surface.
But the fear of raiders from the south plundering its jealously guarded fish
stocks this weekend stands between Oslo and an agreement with Brussels on
terms for Norway's entry to the European Union.
While its Nordic neighbours, Sweden and Finland - together with Austria -
concluded accession accords last Monday, Norway held out against demands,
led by Spain, that it relax its stubborn insistence that is has 'no fish to
give' to the EU's fishermen.
To outsiders, Norway's dogged attitude on fish may seem hard to fathom. The
Spanish demand for 14,000 tonnes a year from Norwegian waters compares with
Norway's total annual catch of more than 2m tonnes. Fish is an important
export industry for Norway, but it accounts for less than 3 per cent of
gross national product.
Many Norwegians - especially in the business community - privately
acknowledge that to sacrifice the wider economic and political benefits of
EU membership on the fishmonger's slimy slab would be a big mistake, the
more so now that Sweden and Finland are well on the road to joining.
But few question the political judgment of Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the
prime minister, in attaching so much importance to winning a deal that
satisfies Norway's demands on fish.
Though it was long ago dwarfed in economic importance by the North Sea oil
and gas industry, fishing has remained important to Norway. This is partly
for sentimental reasons. The image of the rugged fisherman making his living
on the far-flung fringes of northern Europe is as much a part of the
national culture as the tough mountain skier.
However, there is also a practical issue at stake. A broad political
consensus in Norway favours keeping alive the hard-pressed communities of
the distant northern coastal regions - and these communities still depend to
a large extent on the sea fishing industry.
The industry has been in long-term decline. This has been considerably
offset by the rapid growth of fish farming - but farming still employs only
about one-quarter of the 26,000 people who work in the fishing fleet.
Meanwhile, fish stocks - and catches - in Norwegian waters have been rising
in the past five years thanks to Norway's own quota system and stock
management. Hence it is reluctant to make any concession to Brussels that
might threaten the achievements to date.
Mrs Brundtland's minority Labour government recognises the political
significance of the fisheries issue. In 1972, Norwegians rejected joining
the European Economic Community, as the EU then was, in a referendum, after
Brussels adopted a common fisheries policy without consulting Norway.
The prime minister of the day, Mr Trygve Bratteli, had staked his Labour
government on winning a Yes vote and was forced to quit. Labour was deeply
split internally on the issue, and lost a subsequent election.
It is an experience that Mrs Brundtland and her colleagues in the Labour
party do not want to repeat. With the party rank and file, like the
electorate as a whole, still deeply divided on the merits of EU membership,
a 'defeat' on its fish demands could make it almost impossible for the
government to win another promised referendum on membership.
Mrs Brundtland has therefore been extremely careful throughout the
application process. She has said all along that, if she does not win good
accession terms, she will abandon the process and settle for Norway's
existing membership of the European Economic Area, which gives many of the
trade advantages of full EU membership.
But in spite of this tactical stance, Mrs Brundtland is determined to get
Norway into the Union. Those close to her say she is convinced of the
long-term economic benefits of being inside the Union, as well as the
political and security advantages for Norway, which is a Nato member
bordering Russia.
'She also thinks it would be a catastrophe - a real catastrophe - for Norway
if Sweden and Finland join and we find ourselves outside and isolated,' says
a senior Labour member. Apart from the lack of influence Norway would then
have in Europe, it would risk losing investment in the Nordic area to its
neighbours.
The three-time prime minister - she first held office in 1981 - has
therefore been plotting to overturn the result of the 1972 referendum since
the late 1980s. She secured approval for the 1992 application to the EU at a
party convention - thereby gaining an important mandate that averted
internal Labour splits. She successfully steered Labour through last
September's general election when the anti-EU Centre party became the second
largest in the Storting (parliament). Labour not only held on to office, but
increased its number of seats.
That left Mrs Brundtland clear to prepare for the present negotiations. The
next few days will determine whether she has succeeded in winning a
favourable accession accord - as now looks likely - or whether she herself
will fall into the tangled netting of Norwegian-EU relations.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: A lesson for the self-righteous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SINISA SAVIC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Doesn't your editorial 'False moves in Malaysia' (February 28) confirm
that Kuala Lumpur's response was justified whatever the consequences?
The Malay government is reacting to the proposition that the British and
other Western governments are more civilised, have greater respect for human
rights and generally always know better. The contrast between the British
'free' press and the Malay press expresses the same idea: 'the wogs' do not
understand the subtleties of the democratic process.
It is quite ludicrous to imagine a 'free' British press. Does anyone recall
the coverage of the Gulf war, the grovelling before the Cook report, the
demonisation of the Serbs? The muzzle is in place; the difference is that
the leash is invisible.
At least the Malaysians have shown some self-respect, and taught the
self-righteous a lesson.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Wrinkle, wrangle eastern Star: Simon Holberton and Kieran
Cooke on Murdoch's Asia problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely has Mr Rupert Murdoch had to tread so carefully as in Asia this week.
Attention has focused on the role of the Murdoch-owned Sunday Times in
provoking Malaysia into curbing trade with British companies. The
London-based newspaper alleged that UK businessmen, anxious to win contracts
in Malaysia, were involved in discussions about possible under-the-table
payments to Malaysian politicians, including the prime minister, Dr Mahathir
Mohamad. The Sunday Times denies suggesting Dr Mahathir sought, or was paid,
a bribe.
But eight months after his News Corporation paid Dollars 525m for a
controlling interest in Star TV, the Hong Kong-based satellite broadcasting
company, Mr Murdoch's involuntary role as Dr Mahathir's bete noire is not
the only problem facing the media mogul, whose plans for global expansion
focus largely on Asia.
In Hong Kong this week, Star has in effect been excluded from the nascent
cable TV market after a dispute with Wharf Cable, the colony's only cable-TV
provider. The row centred on the terms on which the latter might have
carried its programmes.
In Taiwan, an important business partner has pulled out of an agreement to
provide Star with up to Dollars 120m of advertising revenue over four years.
Mr Murdoch's problem is not a lack of viewers. An estimated 200m people in
39 countries across Asia and the Middle East - including India and China,
the two most populous countries in the world - tunes in to Star daily. His
difficulty is in making the venture profitable. And that requires Mr Murdoch
 -who has made a virtue of thumbing his nose at the establishment - to find
a modus vivendi with Asia's political leaders.
Many of them, like Dr Mahathir, who has tried to block Star broadcasts to
Malaysia, oppose the free flow of information. They are sceptical about
western popular culture and have the political power to hinder Star's
expansion into new markets. With China this week announcing tighter rules on
access to satellite television, the likelihood is increasing that Mr Murdoch
will drop the BBC's World Service news from Star's network as a sop to
political leaders unused to unfettered news programming.
The News Corp chief does not have much time. The head start Star had, as the
first satellite broadcaster in Asia, is being challenged. Time-Warner, the
US media company, hopes to forge an alliance with Television Broadcasts
(TVB) of Hong Kong, the biggest terrestrial broadcaster in the colony, to
launch a competitor satellite network. The US company is discussing
investing about Dollars 150m in TVB for a 9.9 per cent shareholding.
Mr Gary Davey, Star's newly appointed chief executive, says: 'Almost
everyone in the world media industry is talking to each other about business
ventures in this region. This will be the year when some of those ventures
firm up and we have a clearer idea what the long-term picture will look
like.'
Media observers believe that a combination of Time-Warner's management
expertise, TVB's contacts in Asia and its Chinese-language programme library
will be a powerful rival to Star.
Given the importance of Asia to his business strategy, Mr Murdoch's decision
to set up a home in Hong Kong is characteristic. He moved from Australia to
the UK in the 1960s after his acquisition of The News of the World; and to
New York and Los Angeles after he embarked on a series of US acquisitions in
the late 1970s.
Each venture has brought its own set of worries, and Asia is no different.
This time, the immediate problems include:
The setback to Star's hopes of introducing pay-TV caused by its dispute with
Wharf Cable. Star needs to be carried by a Hong Kong cable system, as cable
is the most profitable way of distributing and collecting fees for
programmes. In theory, Hong Kong, where incomes are on first-world levels,
should have been the easiest country in which to launch such a service. A
decision in January by Satellite Television Marketing, Star's advertising
sales agent in Taiwan, to use the change in the broadcaster's ownership as
an excuse to terminate an agreement to provide advertising revenue
equivalent to about a quarter of Star's forecast income over the next four
years. STM wanted to end the agreement, because the target sales figures
were proving over-ambitious.
The failure of the STM alliance is a particularly savage blow, because Star
has, as a result, lost its association with the Koo family, which owns STM
and is one of Taiwan's most powerful business empires. Star is believed to
get the largest share of its revenues from Taiwan, a country where western
companies face difficulty in doing business without a local partner. Star is
now trying to sell its own advertising space in Taiwan, having decided
against forming an-other alliance.
The vulnerability of Star's broadcast lic-ence, which Mr Murdoch does not
own outright. He owns 63 per cent of a company, which in turn owns 48 per
cent of Hutchvision, the holder of the licence to 'uplink' Star's signal
from Hong Kong to a satellite.
Mr Li Ka-shing and Hutchison Whampoa, the conglomerate he controls, own the
remaining 52 per cent of Hutchvision. This lack of control probably explains
why, on his recent trip to India, Mr Murdoch canvassed the idea of a
separate 'uplink' from the sub-continent.
Star is also susceptible to political interference. Mr Murdoch is well aware
of the hostility some Asian leaders have towards western television. Last
September, he wrote in The Times of London, which News Corp owns, that
advances in communications had proved 'an unambiguous threat to totalitarian
regimes everywhere'.
Subsequently, Mr Murdoch has been buffeted by a stream of criticism from
Asian leaders about Star's programming. On a visit to India last month,
where Mr Murdoch met Mr PV Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, a
government spokesman said the country's image was often tarnished by bias in
the foreign media.
Mr Lal Krishan Advani, president of India's opposition Bharatiya Janata
party, complained that many of Star's programmes were unacceptable and
'could have a serious impact on the cultural outlook of the people'.
Dr Mahathir says Mr Murdoch and the western media are trying to incite
unrest: 'Their main idea is how to create friction and instability, so that
if we are unstable, they can compete with us.' Indonesia, where Mr Murdoch
was last week talking to local companies about joint ventures, is also
taking measures to control satellite broadcasts.
But the biggest threat to Star could come from China, both in Hong Kong and
on the mainland. When Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997,
Beijing will hold the whip hand over the colony's regulatory framework. If
Star wishes to retain its broadcasting licence, which expires in 2003, it
will have to beware of disseminating programmes that offend Chinese
sensitivities.
On the mainland, the tighter rules announced this week by Beijing's Ministry
of Radio, Television and Film will, for example, allow access to foreign
satellites only to hotels catering for foreigners and public institutions,
such as financial, media or educational organisations.
The China Communist party's concerns are likely to have been exacerbated by
research conducted for Star by the Chinese State Statistical Bureau, which
showed that the service may have up to 100m viewers on the mainland.
Ms Chen Zhili, chief of propaganda for the Chinese Communist party in
Shanghai, said recently: 'The main task is to preserve the national culture
against pornography and negative programmes.' Star's repeated transmission
of BBC footage from the Tiananmen demonstrations of June 1989 was an 'insult
to the Chinese people', she said.
During his India trip, Mr Murdoch began the process of rapprochement with
China, saying: 'The Chinese are very sensitive about international news and
we have to work out a way of dealing with this. We haven't yet been able to
do that.' An indication of how far Mr Murdoch is prepared to go to reach an
agreement will come when he decides whether Star should continue
transmitting the BBC's World Service news. The News Corp chief is
considering dropping the BBC, and either airing no news service on Star or
carrying an international version of his European Sky news service.
But complaints about Star by Asia's rulers appear to extend beyond its news
service, encompassing the Simpsons, a comic cartoon series about an
anti-establishment family, and much of its predominantly US programming.
As Mr Murdoch roams Asia from his new base atop Victoria Peak in Hong Kong,
it is tempting to write off his regional ambitions. That may be rash, given
his reputation for pulling off successes in difficult circumstances. But the
range of political and business obstacles he faces make his task formidable.

FT  05 MAR 94 / The word on the street: Andrew Taylor and John Willman on a
rise in house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The talk over the smoked salmon and chablis at Hampstead dinner parties this
weekend might revert for the first time in six years to a favourite topic -
UK house prices.
With the news this week that prices were again rising faster than inflation,
for the first time since 1989, home owners may be discussing trends in the
market with a new sense of optimism. Between 1983 and 1988 home-owners saw
the nominal value of their investment double.
With the collapse of the housing market, prices dropped by about 14 per cent
on average between mid-1989 and early 1993 - and by double that in some
areas. Almost 2m people found themselves living in homes worth less than
their mortgage - trapped by negative equity. Those who fell behind with
mortgage payments were unable to sell, leading to unprecedented levels of
repossessions.
Home-owning - seen in the 1970s and 1980s as a sure-fire way of making money
 -had lost its lustre. But the long-awaited recovery is now under way, says
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at brokers UBS.
'We are no longer bumping along the bottom of the housing market,' he says.
'We have now begun to climb the hill.'
On Wednesday, Halifax, the UK's largest building society, reported a 2.2 per
cent rise in house prices in February, the biggest monthly gain since
September 1988. The number of homes sold has also risen sharply, according
to the Inland Revenue, which records the completion of sales.
There is good news, too, from the construction industry, with builders
reporting that work started on 186,400 new homes in 1993 - nearly a fifth
higher than the previous year.
But the recovery will be uneven, cautions Mr Wriglesworth. Halifax's latest
figures conflict with a report on Tuesday by Nationwide, the country's
second-largest building society, which said average UK house prices had
fallen by 0.6 per cent in February.
The societies' figures for the previous two months also differed. But the
two broadly agree on the annual rate of increase. Nationwide reports a 3.2
per cent price rise in the 12 months to February 1994, Halifax 3.8 per cent.
This modest growth has been sufficient to lift some home owners out of
negative equity. The Bank of England estimates the number of households
stuck in this trap has fallen almost a third from the peak. But many others
will have a long wait until their homes are worth more than the amount of
their mortgage - especially if they bought just before prices crashed.
For the 300,000 buyers estimated by the Woolwich Building Society to have
held back from buying during the slump, house prices now look like a
bargain. The average house price is now just over 3 1/2 times average
earnings, having peaked at almost 4 1/2 times in 1989. Today's low interest
rates mean the cost of buying a house for a first-time buyer is lower than
for decades - 26 per cent of average income, according to the affordability
index produced by TSB, the bank.
But no '1980s-style housing boom' is likely, says Mr Wriglesworth. He
predicts price rises of 7 per cent for each of the next two years as the
market bounces back, but then 'medium-term stagnation'. One reason is the
caution of lenders after the slump in prices. At one stage, more than
800,000 borrowers were in arrears with mortgage payments. About 300,000
homes have been repossessed over the past five years, leaving building
societies and banks with large amounts of empty property, often in poor
condition.
Even if lenders were tempted to relax their lending practices, insurance
companies would veto a return to loans of up to 100 per cent or more of the
value of a home. Insurers guaranteed repayment of the top slice of such
loans through mortgage indemnity policies - and paid out Pounds 2bn in 1991
and 1992, as repossessed homes were sold for less than the debt on them.
The result is that it is becoming difficult to borrow more than 95 per cent
of the value of a home.  First-time buyers now need Pounds 5,000 for deposit
and expenses to get onto the bottom rung of the ownership ladder.
The main dampener on house-price inflation over the rest of the decade will
be decreasing demand from younger buyers as a result of the falling birth
rate, says Mr Martin Ellis of Woolwich building society. The number of 25-
to 29-year-olds - the age-group of most first-time buyers - will fall from
4.7m in 1991 to 3.7m in 2001.
'Over the rest of the decade, we expect prices to rise in line with
inflation,' says Mr Ellis.
If that is so, it will be welcomed by economists, who believe the house
price roller-coaster has been responsible for amplifying the stop-go cycle
in the UK economy.
'When house prices forge ahead, owners increase their mortgages and spend
the money on luxury goods,' says Professor Duncan MacLennan of Glasgow
University. 'In 1988, for example, equity withdrawal injected over Pounds
20bn into the economy, the equivalent of over 7 per cent of consumer
spending.
'When house prices drop, equity withdrawal naturally falls, depressing
demand generally. Home owners also tend to save more in housing slumps,
because they feel less secure financially.'
Despite cautious predictions from observers, Prof MacLennan worries that the
underlying causes of instability in the UK housing market remain. Chief
among these is the absence of alternatives to home ownership for most
people.
There are signs the decline in the privately rented sectors has been halted.
But with just 7 per cent of homes in this form of tenure, it is one of the
smallest in Europe. And the chances of the sector expanding have been
diminished by the government's failure to offer tax incentives to landlords.
As for the public rented housing provided by local authorities and housing
associations, it is subject to long waiting lists. Hence it is hardly
surprising that more than 80 per cent of all households say their preferred
form of tenure remains owner-occupation.
And with home ownership still hovering at about 65 per cent, there is
clearly a large unmet demand for home ownership that could fuel any future
house price rises. Dinner tables may yet hum to excited talk of double-digit
house price inflation if that demand is to be satisfied.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Self-destruct landmines do not
guarantee protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS HINTON and Mr DAVID BRYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The FT is to be congratulated for pointing out that landmines cause
carnage among civilians in many countries around the world ('Effort for
global ban on landmines', February 28). The review of the international law
governing the use of landmines, the UN's 1980 Inhumane Weapons Convention,
beginning in Geneva this week, presents an opportunity to protect future
generations of civilians from these terrible weapons.
The existing international law has numerous faults. It only seeks to
restrict the use of landmines, not their production and export. Restricting
use is an almost futile task once they are in the hands of most of the
world's combatants, especially given that there is no monitoring or
enforcement system. Further, existing law applies only to international
conflicts, when the great majority of anti-personnel mines are used in
internal conflicts.
Your article mentions that anti-personnel mines might be improved by adding
self-destruct mechanisms. We have grave reservations about an exception
being made for such devices. Self-destruct mechanisms are not foolproof.
Independent experts estimate that failure rates are likely to be about 10
per cent. Thus, a minefield originally containing 100 mines will still
contain 10 deadly mines. The land will still be a death-trap, unusable to
local populations.
And mine clearance operations will still be dangerous, expensive and
time-consuming, since it must be assumed that every mine is still armed. For
the first time in more than a decade, national delegations attending the
review process, including the UK delegation as observers, have the
opportunity significantly to tighten the present UN Convention to protect
innocent civilians. It would be a tragedy not to do so.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Taking stock after a fright: Peter Montagnon examines the
storms spooking the world's financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something perverse about the way stock markets as well as bonds
plunged around the world on news that US growth surged to 7.5 per cent in
the final quarter of last year.
After all, companies are supposed to thrive in a growing economy. It boosts
their earnings, which ought to be good for share prices too. In other
circumstances news that the US was doing well - reinforced as it was on
Tuesday by a positive survey of industrial purchasing managers - might have
been sufficient to send a glow around the world.
That this time was different is a measure of how markets lost touch with
reality as they raced ahead late last year. Now, as the shock starts to
abate, two questions arise. Will the liquidity return that fuelled that
earlier, apparently effortless rise? And have markets fallen far enough to
reflect underlying economic reality once again?
The US Federal Reserve's decision to tighten monetary policy on February 3
was a turning point for equities. Since the end of January the US equity
market, measured by the Standard &amp; Poors Composite index, has fallen 4 per
cent, but falls in Europe have been larger. The UK's FT-SE-A All-Share has
fallen 6 per cent. German shares are down 5 per cent, while French equities
have fallen by 7.
Warning signals had already appeared in bond markets in January. These
markets, too, had been driven up by cash-rich buyers - not just US mutual
fund investors seeking a higher return than available at home but by
large-scale professional investors using borrowed money to punt on
ever-growing capital gains.
Because they are so heavily leveraged, such investors, known colloquially as
hedge funds, cannot afford to let any losses mount. At the first sign of
trouble they must, often on the instructions of their bankers, cover their
positions. Once that process starts losses can snowball. Markets then find
themselves in a vicious downward spiral.
Insofar as this explains the problem, bond markets are not reflecting a
basic shift. Though yields have risen by over 1 percentage point in the UK
this year, nearly 1 point in France and Germany and half a point in the US,
there is no immediate sign of inflation returning. Indeed, it is likely to
fall further in Europe. Arguably, bonds now offer attractive real returns.
There is little chance hedge funds will return in a hurry, though. Nor did
yesterday's US unemployment data do much to allay fear that signs of the US
economy over-heating could prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten further.
Not only might that choke off the US recovery. Higher deposit rates would
reduce the incentive for US investors to put money in mutual funds. With
their Dollars 2,000bn assets, these funds have been large players in world
financial markets. They might invest less abroad and even repatriate
existing investments.
Opinions differ on where the markets go from here. 'The fundamentals aren't
bad,' says Mr David Hale of Kemper Financial Companies. 'It's really a
psychological shock.' He believes the speculative froth has merely been
blown off markets previously driven up by a surfeit of liquidity. 'This
situation is still very manageable. It's not something which can't be
corrected over time.'
Mr Nicholas Knight, London-based strategist of Nomura Securities, is less
sanguine. 'You haven't yet seen the culmination of this,' he says. 'The real
interest rate environment has changed. Period.'
A striking feature of market turbulence is that prices have been pushed
lower by selling of futures. The volume in cash markets has remained low,
suggesting many investors still hold more securities than they want. Mr
Knight, more pessimistic than most, fears their first inclination could be
to sell into any rally. Even further cuts in European short-term interest
rates would then fail to give a sustained boost to bonds or equities.
Perhaps these contrasting attitudes reflect the fact that the US seems less
threatened than Europe. Markets there have fallen less sharply. Economic
recovery has brought a rise in corporate profits which made the peak
price-earnings multiple of 26 on US equities look less stretched than those
in Europe.
It is still possible that, after acting early to combat inflation, the Fed
may have to tighten less this time than in previous cycles. That could
eventually mean a soft landing for bonds and equities as well as for the
economy. And if US investors become more risk averse, their first instinct
will be to drop more exotic investments abroad before familiar holdings at
home.
For Europe, still struggling to recover from recession, the malaise has been
ill-timed. Stock markets across the continent had been driven to record
levels by the presumption of recovery. That is now threatened by fears that
the Fed's move may delay cuts in European short-term interest rates and by
the rise in real long-term rates that has occurred in the bond markets.
'European equities are discounting high (economic) growth, which we don't
think will happen,' says Mr Richard Davidson of Morgan Stanley. Most
vulnerable to disappointment, he says, are the markets of southern Europe.
Corporate earnings prospects are better in the UK, Switzerland and the
Netherlands.
Another problem is that the withdrawal of hedge fund buying from the bond
markets has exposed the high borrowing needs of governments. Though the UK
covered this year's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement easily, funding next
year's deficit may prove harder even if it drops to a forecast Pounds 38bn.
Higher real interest rates may be needed to woo buyers of government debt.
Savers would have less money over for equities, whose attraction would
diminish.
Even those who believe European bond markets have fallen to the point where
they offer value are uncertain when buying will return in force. 'No one in
the whole world would disagree these markets are cheap,' says Ms Alison
Cottrell of Midland Global Markets. 'People just think they'll get cheaper.
So far they've been right.'
Bond markets yesterday recovered some of their poise since their falls in
mid-week. Some say this could be the first sign of an end to the buyers'
strike; others that the rise is mainly technical. For a real change in
sentiment, investors must be persuaded that Europe can decouple from the US
trend, so that interest rates can fall again.
That requires decisive action by central banks, which may be difficult while
the Bundesbank remains spooked by 20 per cent growth in German money supply.
Without lower short-term interest rates, though, there is little chance of a
meaningful bond market recovery. European economies would also continue to
stagnate and budget deficits to grow. That is not a friendly climate for
equities.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Man in the News: Return of Hezza the Prezza - Michael
Heseltine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
His cabinet colleagues had approached the Scott inquiry into arms-related
sales to Iraq with a mixture of annoyance and trepidation. Mr Michael
Heseltine treated it as a pleasant day out. The president of the board of
trade took along his elegant wife Anne to pose, smiling, for the cameras
before facing his inquisitors. He turned in a bravura performance.
The message was clear. If there was blame to be apportioned for the
government's dubious role in what has become known as the arms-to-Iraq
affair, it would not fall on Michael Heseltine. He had played by the rules.
The bundles of documents laid out before Lord Justice Scott proved his
point.
The reaction among Tory MPs in the bars of Westminster was summed up in one
oft-repeated phrase: 'He's running.' For what? For the key to No 10 Downing
Street, if the bus chasing Mr John Major finally knocks down the prime
minister.
Hezza the Prezza had staged another political comeback. Prematurely written
off after the fiasco 18 months ago over coal industry closures, and once
again last summer after a heart attack, he is fully recovered and is not
about to celebrate his 61st birthday this month by announcing his
retirement.
He is not the favourite to replace Mr Major if a vacancy does arise after
the Conservatives' expected trouncing in this summer's local and European
elections. Despite the furore over impending tax increases, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, remains the front-runner. Mr Heseltine deposed Lady
Thatcher: there are some in the party who will never forgive him.
The Prezza, anyway, is dismissive of the latest speculation: 'I think it's a
lot of garbage,' he insists. 'John Major will lead us into the election and
he will win it.' He will campaign hard alongside the prime minister in the
summer elections.
Mr Heseltine is similarly contemptuous of rumours he has been wining and
dining Mr Major's opponents on the Tory right. He has not: 'People just
invent these things.'
But whatever the protestations, he is now rated a strong second to Mr
Clarke. The bookies have shortened his odds. He is worth a bet.
Mr Heseltine has reinforced that point all week. His appearance on Monday
before Lord Justice Scott was followed two days later by a combative House
of Commons performance. Brushing aside a Labour onslaught on the erosion of
Britain's manufacturing industry, he almost convinced sceptical observers
that the government had a coherent industrial strategy.
To hear him speak in the debate about BMW's recent acquisition of the
nation's last volume car manufacturer was almost to believe that he had
planned the deal himself. No matter that a few years earlier he had insisted
that the British car industry was a vital strategic interest. We should not
have been surprised. Mr Heseltine is a political heavyweight in a cabinet
with more than its fair share of lightweights.
By Thursday night, he was ruminating on the future of western capitalism in
the annual Lord Stockton lecture. It escaped nobody's attention that the man
once branded by Thatcherites an interventionist decided to emphasise the
role of the private, not the public, sector in ensuring future prosperity.
He attacked overregulation in the European Union and even offered a hint
that he was no longer quite so wedded to the European exchange rate
mechanism. For one seasoned Westminster observer it was too much: 'It's
bloody shameless.'
If Mr Heseltine is to take the ultimate prize he must win the support of the
Tory right. His instinctive pro-Europeanism and industrial interventionism
has always been shot through with a streak of ruthless nationalism. No harm
in emphasising that now.
But it was his appearance before Lord Justice Scott that most convinced
Conservative colleagues that he is running. The political timebomb in the
inquiry is not buried in the argument over whether the government secretly
changed the rules covering sales of defence-related equipment to Iraq. The
most dangerous allegation is that ministers were ready to see three
businessmen sent to jail unjustly to cover up its own complicity.
Other ministers, including Mr Clarke, who signed Public Interest Immunity
certificates to withhold documents from the court, insisted they had no
option. Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, had issued a legal
instruction.
Not so Mr Heseltine. He had strongly resisted the same instruction. He had
agreed eventually to sign only after imposing conditions. He had voiced his
determination not to be involved in any cover-up.
It was the approach of a battle-hardened politician: one who had learnt
during the row over Westland which led to his abrupt departure from Lady
Thatcher's cabinet in 1986 that you should never take unnecessary risks.
But his evidence outraged Sir Nicholas and left a number of colleagues
feeling sore. Mr Heseltine was cast by the press in the role of knight in
shining armour - other ministers as weak or conniving. Mr Clarke, after all,
has promised to resign if his behaviour is faulted.
For his part, Mr Heseltine insists that the media got it wrong: there was
nothing in his public evidence that had not already been sent to the inquiry
by his department.
He had taken a different decision about his immunity certificate because the
secret Whitehall papers it covered were more revealing than those shown to
other ministers. He had conveyed his misgivings to colleagues at the time.
All true, but not enough to convince everyone of his good intentions: 'I
don't know whether he is running. But I do know he didn't do the rest of us
any favours at Scott,' was the judgment of one minister.
For the moment speculation is running ahead of reality. The Conservative
party might decide that casually discarding another prime minister is not
the way to win back the British electorate. In the event of a contest, Mr
Clarke still has a powerful hold over the centre and left of the party at
Westminster. So Mr Heseltine may yet be denied the office he has sought all
his political life. But that is no longer certain.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Leading Article: A question of risk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When central bankers gather in Basle on Monday for their monthly meeting at
the Bank for International Settlements, they are widely expected to discuss
the role played by hedge funds during the recent upheavals in the markets.
Given the lack of knowledge about these largely unregulated and heavily
borrowed outfits, that is no bad thing. But the central bankers might be
well advised to spend more time on the growth of proprietary trading,
whereby supposedly more conventional members of the banking fraternity have
been backing speculative positions in the markets with their own capital.
Both commercial banks and investment banks have reaped a rich harvest from
trading in bonds over the past three years. This was partly because fixed
interest paper underwent a fundamental and continuing valuation adjustment
on the basis of the profound disinflationary forces that were sweeping
through the world economy. But it also reflected the fact that the US
Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan had signalled to the banking
community that it could mismatch the maturity of its assets and liabilities
to an unusual degree without losing any sleep at night.
As long as the Fed was seeking to recapitalise the banks after the debt
binge of the 1980s, it was safe to borrow short from depositors and invest
longer in US Treasury stock. In effect, it offered a cast-iron safety net to
bankers and anyone else who chose to exploit the speculative opportunity in
a yield curve where short-term interest rates were significantly below
long-term rates.
What has become apparent since the Fed changed the direction of monetary
policy early last month is that this seemingly riskless form of speculation
was a much more potent influence on bond markets than anyone had recognised
at the time. That is one of the messages in the market shakeout.
Dangerous activity
No one in world bond markets is cushioned from risk any longer. The Fed's
gigantic exercise in market rigging is over, and borrowing for speculation
in fixed interest paper is a dangerous activity again. Because they are so
highly leveraged, the hedge funds were quick to feel the pain from the Fed's
small increase in rates and to appreciate that the rules of the game had
changed. But there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that the response from
commercial bankers has been slower.
In large organisations, success provides the material for the creation of
bureaucratic empires; and bureaucrats do not find it easy to curtail their
own activities. The risk is that, while central bankers are busy worrying
about the counterparty risk that commercial banks run in dealing with hedge
funds, the proprietary traders in their own backyard may have failed to
adjust their activity to a new level of risk.
Remain stagnant
None of this means that underlying economic factors are irrelevant to recent
events in the markets. The rise in real bond yields around the world from 3
per cent to 3 1/2 per cent clearly owes a great deal to fears that the US
recovery will spark some renewal of inflation. Technical factors, on the
other hand, provide the more plausible explanation for the way European bond
and equity prices have fallen more than those in the US over the past month.
And it is hard to believe that the world is heading for a serious capital
shortage when fiscal policy is being tightened across the Group of Seven
industrialised countries, with the exception of Japan, and the European and
Japanese economies remain stagnant.
The disinflationary story remains solid enough. The problem for markets is
to work out what level the story implies for bond yields now that the
pursuit of capital gains on leveraged bond portfolios has ceased to be a
leisure activity. The problem for businessmen is to adjust their investment
plans to realistic expectations about future returns. All the signs are that
they take a different view, in Britain at least, from the bond markets.
To take an obvious recent example, National Westminster Bank still feels
that it can achieve a return on equity of 17.5 per cent when the gilt market
is assuming a long-term rate of inflation of about 4 per cent. If the gilt
market is right, NatWest will have to take exorbitant risks to achieve that
return. Leading British industrialists appear to be similarly reluctant to
reduce target rates of return, which says little for the credibility of UK
monetary policy. Who has it wrong - bond market investors or business
leaders?
There can be no short-term answer to that question, any more than there can
be an early end to the market upheaval that followed the Fed's change of
monetary course. Market psychology is entirely defensive, with good news
precipitating price falls just as readily as bad news. The panic that
followed the publication of freakishly bad German money supply figures this
week was a measure of the nervous temperature of this market. The tectonic
plates continue to shift.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Hedges hog the limelight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hedge funds have been widely seen as one of the causes of volatility in the
financial markets. Here is a guide.
What are hedge funds and who manages them?
They are pools of money aggressively managed by highly paid specialists, and
are usually highly leveraged. This means they use borrowed money in addition
to their capital and specialised instruments such as futures to increase
their exposure to the markets, thus magnifying potential rewards or losses.
The hedge fund industry is by no means homogeneous. Originally, funds were
meant to be 'hedged' - in other words, protected against adverse market
movements. However, the term is often used now as a blanket description for
leveraged funds which move in and out of the world's equity, bond, currency
and commodity markets several times a day.
There are hundreds of hedge funds, mostly managed in the US, where many
sophisticated trading techniques were developed. Investors are usually of
the 'high net worth' variety - individuals who can put a minimum of Dollars
1m into a fund. The headline-grabbers tend to be big funds such as George
Soros's Quantum Fund, which has an estimated Dollars 10bn under management,
Steinhardt Management, run by Michael Steinhardt, and Julian Robertson's
Tiger Management. But there are also scores of relatively small funds with
Dollars 2m or less under management.
Successful funds with a track record of generating average returns of more
than 30 per cent a year have encouraged investors to jump on the bandwagon,
prompting new funds to mushroom. But these investments can be risky, and
result in heavy losses.
Why are the funds in the news?
Last year, some funds made gains of as much as 70 per cent, having
positioned themselves for the rally in government bond markets and the
effective breakdown of Europe's exchange rate mechanism.
But, this year, the funds have been wrong-footed by sharp and unexpected
market movements: the Japanese government bond market fell heavily in
January; the yen appreciated against the US dollar in February following the
collapse in US-Japanese trade talks; and the snail-like pace of interest
rate easing by the Bundesbank caused the prolonged rally in the European
government bond markets to stall.
Heavy losses were exacerbated by the highly leveraged nature of the funds.
To halt losses, some funds started selling, which depressed prices in the
bond markets. Further sales were made to finance positions in the futures
markets, where additional payments have to be made when prices fall sharply.
Why are banks keen to do business with hedge funds?
It is lucrative business: many hedge funds trade in large amounts, trade
often, and trade across a whole gamut of products including cash, futures,
options and other financial instruments.
What strategies do they employ?
Some fund managers track computer charts showing market movements, basing
investments on expectations of small technical shifts. Others follow their
hunches and bet on the direction of currency and bond markets based on broad
economic analysis.
Do hedge funds pose a risk to the world's financial system?
At the moment they are everybody's favourite whipping boy. True, they pour
in or pull out vast sums which can rock the markets. But banks have also
been heavy sellers recently. Central banks and other regulators have long
been concerned about market volatility and the potential threat posed by
leveraged financial instruments to the financial system. They are also
concerned that banks, which lend to hedge funds, could be hit if funds go
under.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Financial markets will not affect interest rates says
Chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for further cuts in UK interest rates are unlikely to be affected
by the turbulence of international financial markets, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor of the exchequer, indicated yesterday, Paul Cheeseright writes.
At the end of a week when markets have been buffeted by a surge of
inflationary fears in the US and surprising money supply figures in Germany,
Mr Clarke stressed the independence of UK rate policy.
'When I make decisions about interest rates I don't look first of all at the
international scene. I consider what is the medium-term outlook for the
British economy, have a look at what's happened to our money supply, what's
happened to our exchange rate and what's happening to asset prices and the
economy generally here,' he said.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Brown forces issue on to agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, struck a populist chord - and a blow for
his prime ministerial aspirations - when he attacked excessive boardroom
salaries this week.
But the real credit for forcing the issue on to the political agenda belongs
to Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, who raised it last autumn in his
shadow budget.
Mr Brown has concentrated his fire on the substantial increases in executive
salaries that have occurred in most of the privatised water and electricity
companies.
He has also pointed out that many former cabinet ministers, including those
involved in the privatisation process, have been beneficiaries.
However, Mr Brown has reserved his most pungent criticism for the
discretionary share option scheme, launched in 1984, which many companies
use to give executives tax-efficient rewards.
Mr Brown says share options worth more than Pounds 12bn have been issued to
a small number of highly-paid executives at a cost to the exchequer of about
Pounds 1bn over the next five years.
That would provide about Pounds 200m a year if the scheme was abolished  - a
handy contribution to the Pounds 10bn a year that Labour says can be raised
by closing tax loopholes.
Labour's claims have been dismissed as fanciful by the government, which
says that most of Labour's so-called tax loopholes are inventions.
Ministers also argue that Labour is wrong to suggest that all the
beneficiaries of the scheme are highly paid.
The Inland Revenue says that more than 585,000 employees were granted
options under the scheme between 1984 and 1992, with an average value of
just under Pounds 19,000.
The scheme is popular with executives because the options are free of income
tax, provided they are exercised between three and 10 years after they are
issued.
It allows for grants of options worth up to Pounds 100,000, or four times
the recipient's salary, and the price can be as low as 85 per cent of the
market value. The only tax payable is capital gains tax when the shares are
sold.
According to the Revenue, the tax receipts forgone amount to between Pounds
30m and Pounds 55m a year; the cost was Pounds 45m in 1991-92, the latest
year for which figures are available.
The figures represent the difference between the income tax revenue which
would have been payable if the scheme did not exist, and the amount of CGT
actually paid.
The CGT liability is lower than the notional income tax liability because no
CGT is payable on the first Pounds 5,800 of taxable gains.
Labour increases the total of revenue forgone by including the benefits to
spouses of option holders, to whom options can be transferred.

FT  05 MAR 94 / What next as telephones head for the museum: BT weighs up
its options in the networks race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications is at a crossroads. Either it goes ahead with the
next generation of network modernisation, or it risks being left with local
networks inferior to those of the cable companies building combined
television and telephone networks in Britain's urban areas.
That is the subtext to this week's confirmation by BT of a series of trials
this year into video-on-demand and other interactive services.
Until now, BT has insisted that a government ban on it providing
entertainment services on its network until at least 2001 made it uneconomic
to invest in taking fibre-optics into the local network - the critical
investment for interactive network services.
Instead, it said it planned to offer a video-on-demand service using its
existing copper local network, upgraded with ADSL electronics.
However, in its trials it will pilot both ADSL and fibre technologies. In an
FT interview last week, Dr Alan Rudge, BT's development director, stressed
the commercial potential of fibre not just for entertainment, but for
information and travel services.
Two trials are planned - a trial with 70 BT employees in Kesgrave, near
Ipswich, followed by a commercial trial later in the year covering 2,500
residents.
For the companies chosen to develop equipment, the stakes are enormous.
Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecoms manufacturer, has won the contract
for the ADSL equipment. Alcatel, the French supplier, will provide the fibre
technology.
Three US companies - Oracle, nCube and Apple Computer - will supply software
and hardware. Oracle will provide software and systems integration services;
nCube will provide multimedia server hardware; and Apple Computer will
supply 'set top boxes' to decode the digital multimedia signals. Whatever
system is used, the programmers will be a critical link in the chain.
For the initial trial, more than 250 hours of programming will be available;
suppliers include the BBC, Carlton Communications, London Weekend
Television, Thames TV, Picture Music International and Granada. BT is also
seeking a supplier for Hollywood movies.
Figures in the region of Pounds 15bn are cited for the cost of taking fibre
into the local network nationwide - perhaps more if BT decides to go the
whole hog and lay fibre into the home.
BT can afford such sums with ease. Capital investment has fallen from Pounds
3.1bn a year to Pounds 2.1bn since 1990, as its digitalisation programme has
wound down.
The key question it faces is the cost of not investing if broadband services
take off and today's 'plain old telephone' becomes a museum piece.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Nissan falls foul of soccer land row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunderland Football Club yesterday won an important part of its fight with
Nissan over the club's plans for a Pounds 70m sports, entertainment and
conference centre on land beside the Japanese carmaker's Pounds 900m plant.
In a report made public before next Thursday's meeting of Sunderland city
council's environment committee, councillors are recommended to give the
club's project outline planning approval.
The recommendation is a blow to Nissan, which has argued that the complex
would block expansion and jeopardise its component delivery and production
methods.
However because the club's proposal for green-belt land is a major departure
from Sunderland's present development plan, the application must be referred
to Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, who may announce a public
inquiry.
Yesterday the report's author Mr Ed Robson, Sunderland's director of
architecture and planning, said it had been a difficult decision.
Mr Robson - a Newcastle United supporter - was co-ordinator for the Wearside
local authorities which 10 years ago this month clinched the Nissan project,
the UK's biggest inward investment of the 1980s.
In his report, he says Nissan did not indicate when the plan for future
expansion was being prepared; nor could the site be protected for Nissan
simply by withholding planning consent for other developments.
Mr Robson's report concludes that the application would bring significant
economic and employment opportunities and private-sector investment, provide

Sunderland and the region.
Nissan said it did not wish to pre-judge next week's decision, but welcomed
the possibility of a public inquiry.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Mayhew strikes against veto threat to peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Political parties in Northern Ireland will neither be allowed vetoes nor be
able to place 'impassable procedural barriers' in the way of political
progress, according to Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary.
In a speech clearly aimed at Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, and
Northern Ireland's unionists, he told an audience at Trinity College in
Dublin yesterday evening, that there will be no 'short cuts' to an agreement
for new constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland and that there will
be no backtracking on the Downing Street declaration.
In what appeared to be an indirect response to Sinn Fein's concerns,
expressed at its annual conference last weekend, that the declaration gives
unionists a means to block the pathway to any political progress, Sir
Patrick said: 'No one will be allowed to erect impassable procedural
barriers to progress. The path of peaceful persuasion is open to all, on the
basis of their democratic mandates.
'But those who choose to stay in their cul-de-sacs can have no veto over
progress.'
The Sinn Fein leader, Mr Martin McGuinness, told the FT last weekend, that
if the British government were to clarify that unionists do not have such a
veto, then this could break the current stalemate and lead to an IRA
ceasefire.
Sir Patrick emphasised that any change to Northern Ireland's constitutional
status, can only come about with the consent of the majority living there,
and not as a result of the majority wish in the island of Ireland as a
whole. He said that an 'overwhelming majority' of people on the island
supported this view, as evidenced by recent opinion polls.
But there remained no predetermined outcome to any future talks and nothing
would be ruled in or out.
'If Northern Ireland is to cease to be part of the UK (or) if there is to be
a united Ireland, then that is a question which can only be determined by
all the people living in Ireland, North and South,' he said.
Agreement and consent of a majority in Northern Ireland would be necessary
for any change, as stated in the joint declaration, Sir Patrick added.
'It is self-determination, in other words democracy, that shall prevail . .
. no one should claim a veto to override that,' he said.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Fears over housing after drop in loan approvals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of mortgage loan approvals - regarded as an important
forward-looking indicator for the mortgage market - fell in January,
compared with December, underlining the fragility of the housing market
recovery.
Seasonally adjusted numbers for loan approvals dropped to 74,000 in January
from 80,000 in December, according to figures published yesterday by the
Bank of England.
The total of loans approved, again seasonally adjusted, was flat at Pounds
4.3bn for both January and December. January figures for gross and net
lending by banks, building societies and centralised lenders were also down
on December.
Gross lending stood at Pounds 4.1bn (Pounds 4.8bn in December) and net
lending fell slightly to Pounds 1.56bn from Pounds 1.64bn.
There are signs, however, that building societies are regaining some of the
market share they have lost to the banks, which had success in promoting
fixed-rate mortgages last year.
According to the seasonally adjusted figures, building societies achieved 70
per cent of net lending in January, compared with 57 per cent in the last
quarter of 1993. The societies' market share of loan approvals was 65 per
cent in January, against 60 per cent for the last quarter of 1993.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said
the lending figures were consistent with the house price rises being
reported at present, but showed there would be no return to boom conditions.
Lending by banks and building societies in January was even weaker than
previously estimated, according to the Bank of England, which has revised
its seasonally adjusted estimate for sterling M4 lending to the private
sector in January.
It estimated that lending was Pounds 100m instead of Pounds 200m. The
original estimate was well below City forecasts of Pounds 2.6bn. The overall
estimate for M4 growth, the broad measure of money supply, is unchanged at a
seasonally adjusted 5.5 per cent in the year to January.
The figures shed some light on dealings in the gilts market, which has been
falling since the start of the year.
Mr Don Smith, an economist at Greenwell Montagu, said the figures showed
that domestic institutions sold Pounds 396m of gilts in January, whereas
overseas investors bought Pounds 1.05bn. These figures referred only to the
cash market, he added.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Potential bidder for pit urges early sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A potential bidder for the last pit to close in north-east England is
pressing for British Coal to start the sale process.
Mr Crispian Hotson, chief executive of the Ryan Group, the Welsh-based
private mining company, said yesterday his company had written to British
Coal asking when and how it planned to advertise Ellington, in
Northumberland, for sale and urging it to give potential bidders access to
the pit quickly.
Ellington closed last month with the loss of 1,100 jobs. It is being
maintained in anticipation of a possible sale.
'It would be better for all if Ellington is found to have a future to embark
on it as soon as possible,' said Mr Hotson yesterday.
British Coal's remaining working deep mines and its opencast operations are
to be sold in five regional packages. Twenty-eight closed pits have already
been offered separately for lease and licence, but three which shut very
recently, including Ellington, are to be offered 'in parallel' with the
regional packages.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday it had not yet been
decided whether they would be part of the packages.
The coal industry privatisation bill is likely to receive royal assent in
the summer; the DTI expects to invite potential bidders for the regional
packages to register their interest in a few weeks. They will then be given
more information.
Ryan and British Alcan Aluminium - the UK subsidiary of Alcan of Canada -
which uses coal from Ellington in its adjacent smelter, announced in January
they were considering a joint bid for the north-east package.
Mr Hotson, who expects three or four bidders for Ellington, said yesterday
he was 'cautiously optimistic' his consortium would place a bid. But no
final decision on Ellington could be taken until his team could get
underground. He envisaged, he said, significant capital investment, giving
Ellington a long-term future.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Research adds fuel to top pay row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The basic pay of top executives has risen far more quickly than that of
clerical workers since the Conservatives came to power, according to
research published yesterday.
The result follows criticism of high pay rises in Britain's boardrooms by
politicians of all parties.
The research, by Hay Management Consultants, says pre-tax clerical salaries
have increased by 333 per cent since 1978-79 while basic salaries at
executive or director level have increased by 416 per cent.
The gap is likely to be wider in view of bonuses paid at boardroom level,
and the gap in take-home pay is wider still, as top earners have benefited
more from tax cuts than those lower down the scale.
Research by P-E International, the management research organisation,
suggests that senior executives in the food, drink and tobacco industries
got the biggest percentage increases in basic salaries last year - 8.3 per
cent in the year to July 1993, compared with 4.4 per cent in financial
services and 7.5 per cent in util-ities.
The P-E study allows comparisons between chief executives and managers, but
does not cover other groups of employees.
Mr Nick Boulter, a director of Hay, said executives' pay had grown more
rapidly in recent years, but clerical pay had doubled between 1971 and 1976
while that of executives rose only 50 per cent.
A recent index of executive pay by Sedgwick Noble Lowndes showed that
bonuses and perks (excluding share options) could add as much as 40 per cent
to an average executive's salary.
This is partly responsible for the growing gulf between gross earnings of
chief executives and average earners, illustrated in the management pay
review chart published this week by Incomes Data Services. Gross earnings
include bonuses.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Thorp decision likely to stir nuclear review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is expected to launch its long-awaited nuclear review soon,
probably within the next month, following yesterday's High Court decision to
allow the opening and commissioning of the Thorp reprocessing plant.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is believed to be taking
an increasing interest and wants to leave open the possibility of
privatising Nuclear Electric, the generating company, before the next
election.
Civil servants estimate that a decision on privatisation would need to be
made by the summer if the sell-off is to be achieved before the next general
election.
That puts pressure on the Department of Trade and Industry to announce the
terms of reference for the review as soon as possible.
The review has been held up both by inter-departmental disagreement over the
terms and by the judicial uncertainties created by Greenpeace's action in
the High Court.
However, the delay appears to have shifted ministerial preferences towards a
more wide-ranging review than was originally planned.
Last year ministers were tending towards a narrow review which focused
mainly on the prospects for privatising the nuclear power industry.
This was strongly opposed by Nuclear Electric, which believes that its
ambitions to be privatised would be best served by a review which included
wider factors, such as environmental considerations.
The review is now likely to cover the balance sheet of the nuclear power
industry, the assets and liabilities, and treat privatisation as just one of
several options available.
The back-end costs, including decommissioning and reprocessing, are also
likely to be scrutinised. Another issue to be resolved, either as part of
the review or alongside it, is that of contracts between the generators and
British Nuclear Fuels for reprocessing.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, rebuked Nuclear Electric recently for its
high profile campaign to be privatised.
He made clear his support for the privatisation of the generation industry
in the long run but raised questions about the practicability of it
happening quickly. The future of the industry would be in the private
sector, he said, but added that the question was how and when it got there.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Court demands Pounds 34,000 for deliberate radioactive leak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear Electric was yesterday fined a total of Pounds 34,000 for
deliberately leaking radioactive gas into the atmosphere.
The case, the first prosecution of its type in Britain, followed an incident
at the Wylfa magnox power station in An-glesey, north Wales, last July.
Magistrates at Amlwch, Anglesey, also ordered Nuclear Electric, which
admitted two charges under the Radioactive Substances Act 1960, to pay costs
of Pounds 20,170.
Mr Martin Warren, for HM Inspectorate of Pollution, said sulphur and carbon
gas leaked after a 130lb grab on a refuelling machine fell nearly 40ft,
landing close to a fuel rod of radioactive uranium.
An air sample from the building showed the radiation level nine times above
an internal action level. Some air was released into the atmosphere over two
hours. A few hours later, internal radioactivity being more than five times
above the action level, a further amount of air was released, Mr Warren
said. Power station staff released the gas without considering the
information available, and did not know the wind direction or the potential
for serious environmental harm, he added.
Mr Wyn Lloyd Jones, for Nuclear Electric, said the company reported the gas
release immediately. Mr Mike Williams, Wylfa station manager, said yesterday
that it was a minor breach and there was no hazard to the population or the
workforce.

FT  05 MAR 94 / PowerGen mothballs generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PowerGen, the electricity generator, is to place one generating unit in
reserve at each of Richborough, Ince and Fiddler's Ferry power stations with
effect from the end of this month.
The company said the move would enable it to cut costs while retaining the
option to burn alternative fuels.
Under current operating conditions the affected units are forecast to have
minimal generation. Their withdrawal, the company said, would enable it to
make savings through reductions in maintenance costs, use of system charges
and business rates without affecting its ability to meet forecast demand.
Richborough and Ince are PowerGen's only plants where orimulsion, the
bitumen-based fuel, is burned - but the company said it would continue to
burn about 1.3m tonnes a year in the units still open at the sites.
The registered capacity of PowerGen plant available to the grid system as a
result of the move of the units into reserve will be reduced by 1,080
megawatts.
PowerGen said withdrawal of this plant would not prejudice the possibility
of these units being considered for disposal under the recent undertaking
given by PowerGen to Offer, the industry regulator, to use all reasonable
efforts to negotiate the disposal of about 2,000MW of its coal- or oil-fired
plant within two years.
When generating plant is put in reserve, PowerGen says, it is not available
for operational use. However, under certain circumstances it would be
possible to recommission it if future market conditions made it economically
viable to do so.
The Treasury will shortly appoint a merchant bank to advise on the sale of
some or all of its shares in the electricity generators National Power and
PowerGen, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said in a
written answer yesterday. Subject to market conditions, the sale would take
place in 1994-95.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Smith targets rising crime for elections push
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's campaign for the May local government elections will focus sharply
on public anxiety about rising crime, Mr John Smith, the party leader,
signalled yesterday.
Mr Smith told a rally of London Labour candidates and MPs that the party's
plans for economic revival would win votes in 'massive numbers' at the
elections.
He promised better transport and health services for the capital, and
confirmed Labour's plans for a city-wide local government to replace the
defunct Greater London Council.
But Mr Smith's speech concentrated on increases of 287 per cent in
burglaries and 174 per cent in violent crime in London since the
Conservatives came to power in 1979.
He ridiculed the fresh approach to crime prevention outlined last week by Mr
John Major, the prime minister, which included plans for prickly bushes
around buildings to deter thieves.
'Burglars throughout Britain are now quaking in their boots at the prospect
of this latest bold, indeed draconian, initiative by the prime minister,' he
said.
Mr Smith said the government had no strategy to combat crime except 'talking
tough'. At the same time, it was dismantling programmes such as the safer
cities and urban redevelopment initiatives which helped to prevent crime.
'Drug education officers' posts are being cut; local authorities are being
forced to cut youth services; mentally ill people are left to roam the
streets with tragic consequences. And the prime minister shakes his head and
wrings his hands at the rising crime rates,' said Mr Smith.
Mr Smith promised a 'concerted strategy to smash the culture of despair,
hopelessness, drugs, violence, poor education and poor job prospects in
which so many young people live'.
He said Labour would establish a separate London police authority, create a
new category of racial violence offences, and set up a national campaign to
combat drug abuse.
Mr Smith said no one should seek excuses for criminal behaviour, but Labour
would tackle the poverty, deprivation, and squalor that provided fertile
soil for crime to flourish.
The tone of Mr Smith's speech reflects a growing belief among Labour leaders
that the party has neutralised the Tories' traditional advantage on law and
order issues.
Mr Smith carefully followed the approach pioneered by Mr Tony Blair, shadow
home secretary, who has promised that Labour would be tough on both crime
and the causes of crime.

FT  05 MAR 94 / How the plant will operate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Final tests in preparation for shearing the fuel rods, the next stage of the
commissioning of Thorp, have already begun. Shearing - or cutting up - will
probably go ahead within the next month.
The first fuel rods for reprocessing at Thorp arrived in 1988 and have since
been stored in ponds to allow short-lived highly radioactive isotopes to
decay.
Some of the fuel has already been moved to the 'head-end plant' where it
will be sheared into smaller pieces and dropped down a chute to a basket
suspended in nitric acid.
Dissolved fuel is transferred to the chemical separation plant where the
uranium and plutonium are parted from the waste. The uranium and plutonium
are then separated from each other, and converted to solid form for storage
and eventual re-use.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Lawyers welcome part-timer ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's landmark House of Lords ruling on employment rights for
part-time workers was an important confirmation of the rights of pressure
groups to challenge the compatibility of UK law with European legislation,
lawyers said yesterday.
Law lords rejected government attempts to limit those rights. The government
had argued that the Equal Opportunities Commission had no standing to seek a
judicial review and that such proceedings could not be used to get a
declaration that the government was breaching EU law.
Lawyers said yesterday that if either argument had succeeded it would have
been a very retrograde step.
Mr David Pannick QC, who had been examining the implications of the European
Court ruling, said the judgment reaffirmed the law as set out in the 1992
Factortame case. In that case Spanish fishermen successfully applied for a
judicial review seeking a declaration that the 1988 Merchant Shipping Act
was contrary to EU law. It also confirmed the liberalisation of the scope of
judicial review in recent years.
'It has never really been in doubt that if a person with a proper interest
can show the government is in breach of EC law they are entitled to use
judicial review proceedings to ask the court for a declaration that it is,'
said Mr Pannick.
Other lawyers said the judgment could lead to an increase in the number of
politically controversial cases brought by pressure groups.
Lord Lester QC, counsel to the Equal Opportunities Commission, said that
although the judgment was not ground-breaking in the strictest sense, it was
still a very important clarification.
The law had been thrown into doubt by the Appeal Court when it gave judgment
in this case last year. The judgment stressed the role to be played by
statutory and non-statutory lobbies in this area, he said.
In one respect the case did break new ground - it was the first time an
English court had reviewed the rationality of legislation rather than its
legality, Lord Lester said.
In the Factortame case the court looked at the domestic law and read it
against the EU law to see whether one conformed with the other. But in this
case the court was looking at the impact of the legislation - at the
economic and social justification for it.
Lord Lester said that role was typically played by constitutional courts,
such as the US Supreme Court, but was a new departure for English courts.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Lobby groups left to carry green banner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Though Greenpeace lost its 14-month battle to halt Thorp in the High Court
yesterday, the case suggests that pressure groups rather than opposition
political parties provide the main challenge to the government's
environmental policies.
'There is no question that the people the government has been worried about
right through the whole Thorp affair are Greenpeace, not Labour,' said one
official at the Department of the Environment.
Thorp, one of last year's most controversial industrial issues, presented
Labour with a dilemma. The party's policy is to phase out nuclear power, but
the plant, which employs 2,000 in a region of high unemployment, is in the
constituency of Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary.
Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment spokesman, called Mr Cunningham's support
for Thorp a 'legitimate constituency view'. But according to Mr Andrew Lees,
campaigns director of the pressure group Friends of the Earth, the overall
effect was that Labour was 'stunningly silent - they managed to keep their
heads down, that's all'.
Critics feel that the recurrent conflict between jobs and being green
prevents Labour developing a coherent environmental strategy. For example,
Labour opposes the rapid shutdown of the coal industry even though this cuts
emissions of carbon dioxide and the threat to global warming. But according
to Mr Dieter Helm of Oxera, the forecasting group, Labour's plans for more
energy efficiency 'provide only a short-term answer and duck questions of
long-term energy policy'.
The Liberal Democrats produced a clearer line on Thorp. Mr Simon Hughes,
environment spokesman, used the debate adeptly to call for more public
access to environmental data. But they too have sometimes seemed reluctant
to acknowledge the costs of curbing pollution.
Mr Scott Barrett, lecturer in environmental economics at the London Business
School, said: 'Their concerns about putting value added tax on household
fuel are hard to understand as they have advocated pretty big environmental
taxes.'
In contrast, Whitehall officials credit the pressure groups with having
forced the government to re-examine Thorp's future, even if they did not
eventually change its mind. Part of that influence, officials make clear,
was the pressure groups' increasing use of the courts. Officials say
Greenpeace's threat of legal action last summer prompted a second public
consultation into the plant, delaying the go-ahead by several months.
Legal action by lobbyists has been rare in the UK compared with the US,
where powerful groups such as the Sierra Club, the San Francisco-based
ecology group, keep large legal teams on retainer. Court action has begun to
appeal to UK campaigners partly because of the amount of UK and European
legislation passed in the past decade.
Mr Lees, who said that Friends of the Earth would step up lawsuits against
the government and companies, added that 'European regulation has given us a
particularly good lever'.
A second reason is the groups' growing financial muscle. Greenpeace UK
received Pounds 6.6m last year in donations before fundraising costs, and
Friends of the Earth about Pounds 4.5m on the same basis.
But Thorp also displays two factors which could eventually jeopardise the
pressure groups' success. In the Thorp case, the judge ruled that Greenpeace
and Lancashire County Council did not have to pay the government's costs,
but normally the costs of losing such cases are formidable.
The second threat is that the campaigners' agenda may increasingly be moving
away from their supporters' concerns, which could eventually undermine their
ability to raise funds.
Lord Melchett, director of Greenpeace UK, said that while Greenpeace's
policymakers had felt Thorp was a priority, its members may have cared more
about whaling and toxic waste.
Mr Lees also acknowledged a gap: 'We have pretensions beyond representing
our members - we are acting in loco parentis for the future.'

The first enterprise zone trust for industrial property development is
expected to bring enhanced financial benefits to the Scottish economy,
according to Scottish Enterprise, the economic development body.
It says the scheme - in the Lanarkshire enterprise zone - is unique in the
UK.
Akeler Developments of Leeds, which is to raise Pounds 20m from private
investors through an enterprise zone trust, will pass most of the financial
surplus it makes on an 250,000 sq ft industrial development at Blantyre to
Scottish Enterprise. That will be used on economic regeneration in
Lanarkshire and elsewhere.
In return Scottish Enterprise and Akeler will form a partnership which could
lead to Akeler's involvement in other industrial developments.

Spending on research and development rose by 4 per cent from Pounds 12.2bn
in 1991 to Pounds 12.6bn in 1992, the Central Statistical Office said
yesterday. In real terms, spending was unchanged in 1992 and represented
2.12 per cent of gross domestic product.
R&amp;D spending for civil purposes was Pounds 10.4bn, 5 per cent higher than in
1991. Spending for defence purposes was Pounds 2.3bn, down 1 per cent.
The government funded just over a third of all R&amp;D in 1992, nearly 30 per
cent of the civil R&amp;D and just under two-thirds of the defence R&amp;D.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Judge warns on Lloyd's claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's Names suing the London insurance market for alleged negligence over
recent losses might not be fully compensated even if they win their cases,
the Commercial Court judge in overall charge of the litigation warned
yesterday, John Mason writes.
Mr Justice Cresswell said: 'It is necessary to impress on the parties to the
Lloyd's litigation that there is a distinct possibility, even if the claims
are sound in law, that there may be insufficient money to satisfy them all.'
The total for all claims against Lloyd's exceeds Pounds 3.5bn. Lloyd's
estimates that following the decision by Names - the individuals whose
assets support the insurance market - to reject its Pounds 900m compensation
settlement offer, the maximum amount of cover available to meet court awards
is about Pounds 1.1bn.
Mr Justice Cresswell, who has just completed a review of the progress of the
litigation, said the Commercial Court would continue to meet the
'considerable challenge' of the Lloyd's litigation.
However an appropriate balance had to be kept between the demands of those
actions and other cases brought before the court.

FT  05 MAR 94 / New-car registrations surge by 14.75%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's insistence that economic recovery is on course received a
boost yesterday from statistics showing a further surge in new car
registrations.
Registrations were 14.75 per cent higher last month than in February last
year and commercial vehicle sales appear to be firmly on the mend after
their steepest post-war recession.
In another positive development, the statistics, issued by the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders, indicate that there has been no slump in
diesel car sales following a government-commissioned report, published in
January, which said there should be 'concern' about the long-term urban
pollution effects of a rising population of diesel cars.
The total new car market share taken by diesel cars reached 23.3 per cent
last month, up from 15.5 per cent in the same month last year. 'There
appears to have been no adverse effect at all,' said Citroen UK, which has a
leading share of the diesel market.
The lack of a downturn in diesel suggests that the cars are bought primarily
for economy. Carmakers also maintain that the report, by the Quality of
Urban Air Review Group, underestimated the technical progress that has been
made in cleaning up diesel emissions.
The 145,710 new car registrations in February - up from 126,984 the same
month a year ago - followed a 20 per cent year-on-year jump in January, so
that registrations in the first two months of the year, at 344,235, were
17.92 per cent ahead of the 1992 period's 291,923.
'These figures confirm continuing growth in the market as manufacturers
benefit from growing consumer confidence,' said Mr Roger King, the society's
public affairs director. Commercial vehicle registrations rose last month by
8.1 per cent to 16,312, following a rise of 1.3 per cent in January.
The negative side of yesterday's statistics was a rise in the share of the
market taken by imports. They accounted for 57.54 per cent, compared with
53.78 per cent the previous February.
Sharply rising imports of Vauxhall's Corsa from Spain and Ford's Mondeo from
Belgium were among the main factors for the rise. The Mondeo, with 27,566
registrations, is leading the best sellers' list after the first two months,
Second is Ford's Escort at 26,477 and third is Ford Fiesta at 22,623. Then
came Vauxhall Astra, 20,376; Vauxhall Cavalier, 20,064; Vauxhall Corsa,
16,707; Rover 200 15,312; Renault Clio, 9,378; Peugeot 405, 8,976; in tenth
place is Rover Metro with 8,828.

FT  05 MAR 94 / MGN plans to control Independent until 1999
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mirror Group Newspapers, part of a consortium bidding for control of the
Independent, would have the responsibility of running the newspaper as a
business until 1999, under proposals sent to shareholders last night.
This would include drawing up draft budgets and three-year rolling business
plans but not editorial involvement.
MGN, a group of founders led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, El Pas of Spain
and La Repubblica of Italy have offered 355p a share for the company. There
is also a MGN share and cash deal worth 329.75p.
The consortium says it believes it is 'a matter of great urgency' that it
takes control of Newspaper Publishing, the company that owns both the
Independent and The Independent on Sunday.
It says both the commercial and financial condition of the company 'is
deteriorating rapidly', exacerbated by the continuing uncertainty over its
future.
The Department of Trade and Industry is still considering whether or not the
bid should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
MGN has undertaken that Independent advertising revenue for the next three
years from this July shall not fall below that of the year to June this
year.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Iraqi expert to be MI6 chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH, DAVID OWEN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An intelligence officer understood to have won his spurs gathering
information on the Iraqi weapons procurement network is to be the new chief
of MI6.
The Foreign Office announced yesterday that Mr David Rolland Spedding, who
turns 51 on Monday, has been appointed to the Pounds 82,925-a-year job as
head of Britain's secret intelligence service.
Mr Spedding is a career diplomat and civil servant specialising in Arabic
affairs. He was heavily involved in the Gulf War effort. It is understood he
has not given evidence to the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
This is the first time a new chief has been announced and only the second
time the head of MI6 has been named. Sir Colin McColl, the present chief,
was named in 1992 when Mr John Major, the prime minister, decided that the
intelligence services should be put on a statutory footing.
Two weeks ago the intelligence services bill, which will make MI6 more
accountable to parliament, received an unopposed second Commons reading. The
Lords have already approved it.
Mr Spedding will take over the service's 2,000 employees in September, after
a year as its director in charge of operations. Mr Spedding joined the
service in 1967 and trained as an Arab specialist in Lebanon.
Although he has spent most of his intelligence career in the Middle East or
specialising in Arabic affairs in London, he was posted to Santiago, Chile,
from 1972 to 1974.
The Foreign Office said Mr Spedding was chosen as the 'best man for the job'
although it was not revealed whether there was a shortlist for the post. It
is expected he will serve for the same length of time as Sir Colin - about
five years. The openness that marked the announcement of Mr Spedding's
appointment only extends so far, however. Unlike Ms Stella Rimington, the
head of MI5, who was photographed last summer, Mr Spedding will not be
posing for cameras. The Foreign Office said: 'Forget about photographs. I
don't think you can count on it.'
Mr Spedding will assume the top job shortly after MI6 moves its headquarters
to a Pounds 230m building at Vauxhall Cross in south London.
His appointment came two days after the Kremlin accused a senior manager in
Russia's arms industry of passing defence secrets to MI6 officials in the
British embassy in Moscow.
Mr Spedding attended Sherborne school in Dorset, where Mr David Cornwell,
better known as the spy novelist John Le Carre, was also educated.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Economy hopes on 'unique' Scots zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first enterprise zone trust for industrial property development is
expected to bring enhanced financial benefits to the Scottish economy,
according to Scottish Enterprise, the economic development body.
It calls the scheme - in the Lanarkshire enterprise zone - unique in the UK.
Akeler Developments of Leeds, which is to raise Pounds 20m from private
investors through an enterprise zone trust, will pass most of the financial
surplus it makes on a 250,000 sq ft industrial development at Blantyre in
Lanarkshire to Scottish Enterprise. That will be used on economic
regeneration projects in Lanarkshire and elsewhere.
In return Scottish Enterprise and Akeler will form a partnership which could
lead to Akeler's involvement in other industrial developments, and Scottish
Enterprise will guarantee investors the rental income on the factories for
up to 10 years.
Scottish Enterprise says it was able to secure this deal because of strong
interest in the Lanarkshire zone among enterprise development specialists.
The enterprise zone trust is marketed by Capital Ventures of Cheltenham,
Gloucestershire, an enterprise zone trust sponsor.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Liverpool oilfield supply base named
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West Hornby Dock in the port of Liverpool has been chosen as the site for a
shore supply base to support the Liverpool Bay oil and gas development.
The base will be the main point through which equipment and materials will
pass on their way to the offshore site during the project's construction,
drilling and operational phases. The first oil should begin to flow in
November 1995. The first gas is due a month later.
Competition for the supply base was fierce, with at least eight west coast
harbours vying for the contract. About Pounds 40m will be spent each year to
support the Liverpool Bay development once it becomes operational. Between
20 and 25 permanent jobs will be created at the base, said Hamilton Oil, the
field's operator.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Local newspapers look to multimedia as sales slip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The regional newspaper industry has launched its biggest study of multimedia
and the implications of electronic publishing for the future of newspapers.
Average circulation decline in the regional press has been 1 per cent to 2
per cent a year over the past 20 years and there are widespread worries
about the future of print.
The first stage of the project, organised by the Newspaper Society through
consultants Meta Generics, will scrutinise existing consumer and advertising
markets and assess the likely impact of technology in the next seven years.
A technical trial of electronic publishing concepts with a small number of
consumers may start next year to gauge interest in new services from
newspapers.
Mr Richard Beamish, director of development at the Newspaper Society, which
represents England's local and regional newspapers, has been looking at
research in the US and believes there are no magic solutions on offer.
'I think we are talking more about enhancing the product than producing a
different one,' he said.
Newspapers in the US already provide several thousand additional services -
either by audio or by fax - although at the moment these only account for
about 2 per cent of revenues. For instance, for a subscription of Dollars
2.95 a month readers can get five faxes a month providing more information
on chosen stories.
But Mr Brian Sallery, a director of Meta Generics, believes that as
competition from the electronic media intensifies the regional press may be
in a stronger position than national newspapers because it is 'more
targeted, more localised'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton is to lose one of his staunchest supporters in
Congress with the retirement of Senator George Mitchell, leader of the
Senate Democratic majority.
Mr Mitchell was due to make a televised announcement last night in his home
state of Maine that he would not stand in November's election, and would
leave the Senate when his term expires next January.
'I can say that he is one of the finest, ablest people I have ever known in
any kind of work,' Mr Clinton said yesterday, adding that Mr Mitchell would
be 'very difficult to replace'.
A former judge, Mr Mitchell was elected as majority leader in 1988 and set
about besting his Maine neighbour, Republican President George Bush, on
taxes, nominations and foreign policy.
When Mr Clinton took office, Mr Mitchell was instrumental in winning votes
on the budget, the North American Free Trade Agreement and legislation to
provide for mandatory leave in case of family illness.
Although Senator Wendell Ford of Kentucky is currently second in command of
the Senate Democrats, the way could be open for one of the younger
generation of Democrats to move up to the leader's job. Senator John Breaux
of Louisiana, Senator Thomas Daschle of South Dakota and Senator John Kerry
of Massachusetts are possible candidates.
Besides beheading the Democratic leadership in Congress, Mr Mitchell's
retirement also threatens the party's 56-44 majority in the Senate, which
was already expected to erode in November's elections. He would have won in
a landslide, but without him Republican Congresswoman Olympia Snowe is the
likely front-runner in Maine.
Mr Mitchell had been widely reported to be interested in becoming
commissioner of baseball, but he said in his announcement last night that he
had no job lined up.
Democratic officials said he was in good health and had simply grown tired
of the job.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Middle East peace process on the rack: The Hebron massacre
has left PLO leaders enfeebled and put the talks with Israel in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In public the leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Tunis this
week have expressed deep anxiety over the prospects of salvaging the peace
process in the aftermath of the Hebron massacre. In private Mr Yassir
Arafat, the PLO chairman, and his close lieutenants are near to desperation.
Not since Mr Arafat's famous White House handshake with Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
the Israeli prime minister, to seal the outline accord on Palestinian
self-rule and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, has the credibility
of that deal looked in greater jeopardy. Neither, in the eyes of Mr Arafat's
rioting constituency in the occupied territories, has that of the
Tunis-based PLO leadership who negotiated that deal in secret Oslo talks.
Mr Arafat will not have needed the television pictures of Palestinian
militants burning his effigy last week to impress on him the gravity of the
threat to his already waning authority within the territories. Several PLO
leaders in Tunis also received threats to their lives from Palestinian
groups this week.
But the uncomfortable truth for Mr Arafat and his colleagues is that, from
their distant villas in suburban Tunis, they see little they can do to
inject any impetus to the peace process.
The Palestinian negotiators of the Oslo accord say they cannot hope for the
minimum popular support for resumed talks without, at the very least, more
substantial guarantees for the protection of Palestinians from militant
settlers than Israel has so far offered. For this, they are depending upon
the unlikely prospect of these being volunteered by the Rabin government, or
perhaps forced upon it by international and, specifically, US pressure.
Palestinian support for the Oslo accord, and for Mr Arafat himself, were
diminishing fast enough in the territories before the Hebron massacre.
Twelve weeks have passed since the supposed deadline for the start of an
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho without the PLO leadership having
anything to show for it on the ground.
Even the ever-optimistic Mr Nabil Shaath, the chief PLO negotiator in the
Gaza-Jericho talks, felt that three more painstaking weeks of talks were in
prospect to complete the deal before the Hebron killings landmined the
process.
Since Hebron, PLO leaders now speak of the situation in the territories as
'explosive' and 'volcanic'. According to Mr Ahmad Quorieh (Abu Ala), one of
the negotiators and most ardent proponents of the Oslo deal, 'the seeds of a
real conflict have been sown'. The PLO leadership in Tunis is watching with
horror the potential for a renewed, full-blooded  - and for them
uncontrollable - intifada (uprising), and one largely founded on frustration
with their efforts.
Senior PLO officials see no way out of the crisis other than by politically
acceptable measures from Israel, a return to negotiations on the
Gaza-Jericho accord, and its swift implementation. 'That accord will be
enough if the Israelis begin to take real measures that people can see,'
says Mr Quorieh, who also warns that the whole process may be at stake if
the original April 13 deadline for withdrawal is missed.
And although some PLO leaders said this week that these talks can only
resume if Israel begins to discuss the future of the settlements in the
occupied territories - which is unlikely - they have in fact set far more
modest 'requirements' for returning to the peace table. These are an
'international presence' to ensure security for Palestinians and 'further'
disarming of militant settlers than Mr Rabin has offered.
PLO officials say they cannot believe these gestures are beyond the Israeli
cabinet's ability to deliver. 'Both we and the Israelis took a risk when we
entered into this process,' says Mr Abed Rabbo. 'We have to take a risk
now.'
In fact, the PLO is also taking a risk with what it considers the modesty of
its 'requirements'. PLO leaders express the hope, rather than any firm
conviction, that if they are met and talks resumed, this might be enough to
quell the anger in the territories. But as one Tunis-based diplomat puts it:
'How much cheer will the people in the territories get from seeing the
resumption of talks, when all they've seen from them is delays?'
If the Gaza-Jericho talks can somehow be hauled back on track, the premium
will be upon concluding them rapidly. But this will be difficult. Not only
is there much to resolve in the security talks - Israeli officials have not
been as optimistic as Mr Shaath in this respect - but parallel talks in
Paris on the economic aspects of self-rule are much further from resolution.
In addition, diplomats in Tunis seriously doubt whether the PLO would be
ready by April 13 to assume their responsibilities after an Israeli
withdrawal. A Palestinian police force is far from readiness, committees and
administrators remain to be named. And while the post-Hebron crisis commands
the full attention of Mr Arafat and his small coterie of trusted leaders,
decisions on these and a host of other matters are being further delayed.
In the meantime, the PLO leadership can only lobby and hope that the
political mood in the occupied territories does not spin irrecoverably out
of their control. For the moment, neither Mr Arafat nor the other executive
committee members of the PLO sound optimistic.
Three weeks ago the PLO chairman said he thought the peace process was
losing credibility. This week, asked whether Palestinians would back him if
he simply decided to resume the peace talks in the absence of further
concessions, he replied: 'No, frankly. No. Because the peace process has
lost credibility.'
Mr Arafat knows his own credibility in the territories is also now in the
gravest doubt. And barely anyone believes the present fragile peace process
could survive the final loss of that.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Thais pick GEC-Alsthom consortium: Anglo-French group to
enter negotiations to build Dollars 1bn rail network in Bangkok

The company planning to build a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) elevated railway
network for Bangkok announced yesterday that it had chosen a consortium
including GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, as priority
bidder for the turnkey construction contract.
Mr Kasame Chatikavanij, chairman of Bangkok Transit System Corp (BTSC), said
he was confident that construction of the system could start 'within the
next few weeks'.
Details of the turnkey contract must be negotiated within one month, and if
the talks fail BTSC can approach the other three consortia; one is led by
Siemens, one by Itochu and the other by Mitsui.
The contract price for building the 24km system is expected to be about
Bt26bn (Pounds 690m), while the total project cost up to the time trains are
supposed to start running in early 1997 is put at Bt37bn.
Executives of BTSC - a subsidiary of the Thai property group Tanayong which
was awarded a 30-year 'build-operate-transfer' concession by the Bangkok
authorities - insisted there would be no problem with financing the deal, in
spite of protests by international bankers over the the Thai government's
handling of a separate Dollars 1bn project to build an elevated motorway.
'We have more than 100 per cent coverage of the total project cost
requirements,' said Mr Edward Chow, BTSC chief financial officer. 'We are in
a chooser's position rather than in a worried position.'
Between a quarter and a third of the cost will be covered by equity.
Tanayong has also raised Dollars 130m through a convertible eurobond issue,
and expects to launch a baht debenture on the Thai stock market worth
another Dollars 100m. The International Finance Corporation is also expected
to help fund the project.
The construction consortium will procure supplier credits covering its
costs. Paribas is leading a group of banks backing GEC-Alsthom's bid. The
consortium also includes Italian-Thai Corp, a Thai construction company,
BTSC and GEC-Alsthom directors dismissed fears that the project would not be
able to pay for itself, arguing that there was great suppressed demand for a
mass transit system in a city as large and as congested as Bangkok.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Inkatha decides to register for all-race elections

<TEXT>
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the conservative Zulu leader, last night sent an
envoy to Johannesburg to register his Inkatha Freedom party for South
Africa's first all-race elections, but other right-wing leaders said they
would not register before the midnight deadline.
After a frantic day of bilateral meetings between African National Congress
officials and leaders of right wing groups, the right was in disarray and
insisting on an extension of the midnight cut-off to allow it to take a
final decision.
Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the hard-right Conservative party, said his
party would not register, but he was under heavy pressure from younger CP
members of parliament and Gen Constand Viljoen, the more moderate Afrikaner
Volksfront leader, who are believed to wish to enroll for the poll. The CP
may split if Mr Hartzenberg continues to insist on a boycott.
Officials of the Afrikaner Volksfront and the conservative Bophuthatswana
black homeland said both groups would register if the deadline was extended,
but this was ruled out by the Independent Electoral Commission.
Still, politicians might intervene to allow a change in the date for
registration if they believe this would tempt more moderate conservatives to
enter the poll, and split the right wing alliance.
Inkatha's decision to register was hedged with conditions. Chief Buthelezi
said the move was 'provisional' and did not necessarily mean it would take
part in the poll.
After a six-hour meeting the party's central committee passed a resolution
rejecting the constitution. Chief Buthelezi said he would only begin
electioneering once there had been international mediation of South Africa's
constitutional dispute.
The ANC and Inkatha have agreed to this in principle, but battles lie ahead
over who the mediators should be and whether mediation should be binding.
The constitutional gap between Inkatha and the ANC remains large, and
mediation is likely to yield a positive result only if one or the other side
is prepared substantially to abandon its demands.

<TEXT>
The African National Congress's determination to engage the South African
business community in the task of reconstruction and development has stepped
up a gear with an appeal for co-operation with the private sector by Mr
Tokyo Sexwale, who is expected to head the country's most powerful
industrial region after next month's elections.
Mr Sexwale, top of the ANC's list of provincial candidates, told a meeting
of 44 prominent businessmen that the Pretoria-Johannesburg area, where he
would be in charge, was 'the engine room' of the South African economy. 'If
I put one foot wrong I'll sink it. We don't want your votes, we want your
wisdom.'
He warned the audience - which included Mr Sol Kerzner, chairman of the Sun
International gambling and casino empire and Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of
Anglo American's gold division - that it was essential for ordinary South
Africans to be given a far bigger stake in the economy. 'If you give them
politics, a flag .. and you think that's change, you are merely preparing
for a second, more deadly, revolution,' he said.
It was also vital for South Africa to become competitive internationally for
fear of being 'eaten for breakfast' by Pacific Rim countries. The meeting
was the first in a series of provincial ANC business leadership forums and
was followed by a closed discussion session where debate drew a warm
response from businessmen. 'If the previous government had done the same
thing we would be much better off today,' said Mr Dorian Wharton-Hood,
vice-chairman of assurer Liberty Life.
Mr Sexwale's comments come amid growing concern from some quarters that the
business community has not done enough to voice its vision of economic
development and has failed to table an industrial strategy of its own.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Setback as Japan's surpluses rise again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes that Japan's current account and trade surpluses had peaked were
dashed yesterday when both recorded record highs in January.
The finance ministry announced that the country's balance of trade in goods
and services had increased by 30.9 per cent in dollar terms during January
compared with the same month last year.
In yen terms, the current account surplus increased for the first time in
six months, up 16.8 per cent to Y761.7bn.
The ministry attempted to play down the increase, pointing out that
January's figures tended to be volatile because of holidays and that there
had been an additional day of business this year.
The current account surplus reached a record Dollars 6.83bn before seasonal
adjustments. Exports rose 6.9 per cent to Dollars 25.36bn, while imports
increased only 3.3 per cent to Dollars 17.09bn. The surplus had fallen in
November last year by 20.6 per cent, but rose the following month.
Meanwhile, Japan's contentious trade surplus - excluding services - rose
15.1 per cent to a record Dollars 8.26bn during January. The figures were
inflated by the falling value of the dollar. However, the surplus widened
even in yen terms, up 2.7 per cent to Y921.5bn.
The upward trend continued during the first 20 days of February. The trade
surplus increased 1.4 per cent to Y731.2bn compared with the same period
last year, said the ministry. Exports fell 7.5 per cent to Y2,134bn, while
imports fell 11.5 per cent to Y1,402bn. In dollar terms the trade surplus
increased over the same period by 15.4 per cent to Dollars 6.674bn. Exports
rose 5 per cent to Dollars 19.4bn, while imports increased 0.3 per cent to
Dollars 12.7bn.
Presenting the government's budget yesterday, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the
Japanese prime minister, predicted the trade surplus would fall from
Y15,400bn (Pounds 98.1bn) to Y15,000bn. The current account surplus would
shrink, down from Y14,400bn to Y13,800bn, Mr Hosokawa said.

FT  05 MAR 94 / US angered by arrest of Chinese dissident
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday issued a strong protest against China's arrest of a
prominent dissident, warning that it would 'cast a pall over the planned
visit' to Beijing next week of Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of
State.
President Bill Clinton said the US strongly disapproved of the arrest, which
he described as 'certainly not a helpful action.'
Mr Wei Jingsheng, who was released last September after 14 years in prison,
was detained yesterday after meeting last week with Mr John Shattuck, a
senior US human rights envoy.
The arrest of Mr Wei, who was a leader of the Democracy Wall movement in
1978-79 and is probably the Chinese dissident who is best known outside
China, seems certain to impair the chances of Mr Clinton deciding to renew
China's most favoured nation trading privileges in June.
Four other leading dissidents were also reported to have been detained.
Mr Clinton last year extended China's MFN status for one year, on condition
that it meet US demands for free emigration and an end to the use of prison
labour in exported goods, and make progress in other areas such as the
release of political prisoners, the protection of Tibetan culture and
allowing outside radio broadcasts.
While Clinton administration officials have indicated some encouragement at
the steps the Chinese government was taking, they have also repeatedly
warned that China has not yet done enough to fend off revocation of MFN in
June.

<TEXT>
The US is expected to act swiftly in ordering inspection system delays of
French exports in a tit-for-tat trade dispute over US fresh fish exports. US
fisheries say that since February 5, France has blocked fish, shipped in by
air, by instituting a cumbersome inspection and testing regime and other
paperwork requirements.
Exporters have sought to get around the blockade at French airports by air
freighting their products to other European destinations and trucking it
into France. However, they have been warned that this fish too will now be
seized for inspection.
A spokesman for the National Fisheries Institute said trade officials have
promised decisive action quickly under an emergency provision of US trade
law. They said the retaliation is likely to mirror the French actions, with
increased inspections of French products like wine and cheese. The option of
levying import duties remains viable.
The US has drawn up a list of products for retaliation. A decision by Mr
Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and President Clinton is said to
be imminent.

The French government is said to be responding to strikes and violent
protests by its fishermen against cheap imports. It has offered to lift the
inspections but has yet to act.
US officials said a communication received Wednesday from France was
considered 'non-responsive'.
Because so many of their traditional fish species are 'fished out,' US
fishermen had begun exporting 'under-utilised' species - like skate and
dogfish - which are not popular in the US. Millions of dollars worth have
been left rotting in French storehouses.

Mr Zhu Rongji, Chinese vice premier, yesterday ended a 10-day visit to
Japan, with promises of continued economic support from Tokyo, but a tougher
line on aid.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japanese foreign minister, told Mr Zhu, the architect of
Chinese economic policy, that the size and terms of Japan's next package of
official yen loans would be conditional on Beijing's efforts to produce
environmental projects and clearer information on military spending. Japan's
current five-year Chinese aid package, worth Y810bn, runs out in 1995 and is
to be succeeded, on Tokyo's insistence, by two shorter term packages of two
and three years. Japan's switch to making aid to China more conditional is
line with a new directness in Tokyo's attitude to China on human rights,
defence spending and pollution.

Japan, with promises of continued economic support from Tokyo, but a tougher

Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japanese foreign minister, told Mr Zhu, the architect of
Chinese economic policy, that the size and terms of Japan's next package of

current five-year Chinese aid package, worth Y810bn, runs out in 1995 and is
to be succeeded, on Tokyo's insistence, by two shorter term packages of two
and three years.
Japan's switch to making aid to China more conditional is line with a new
directness in Tokyo's attitude to China, especially on human rights, defence
spending and pollution. 'We are looking for a more mature relationship,'
said a foreign ministry official.
However, Japan is eager to support China's economic reforms and maintain
good relations with this increasingly powerful neighbour. As evidence of the
seriousness with which it views its China ties, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the
Japanese prime minister is to visit Beijing on March 19.
The economic stakes are high. China is the fastest growing destination for
Japanese foreign investment, with 490 projects worth Dollars 1.07bn in 1992,
nearly double the Dollars 579m in the previous year, according to the
finance ministry. To this, Japanese businesses added another Dollars 695bn
(Pounds 476bn) in the six months to last September.
Mr Zhu, who met 240 senior executives during his visit, is widely seen in
Japan as a guarantor of Chinese economic stability and of the safety of
Japanese investment there. Trade is also growing fast, so that Japan last
year became China's biggest trading ally - with two-way trade worth Dollars
37.8bn - and China became Japan's second largest commercial partner after
the US.

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese political history was unobtrusively made yesterday when plans for
the most radical change to the political and electoral system in post-war
years became law.
Revisions to four political reform acts were approved without debate by the
upper house of parliament, spelling the end of Japan's unique multi-seat
constituency system, held to be a big factor in fostering the corruption
which has discredited Japanese politics in recent years.
This brings to an end a five-year struggle, which brought the downfall of
two governments, caused the end of 38 years of Liberal Democratic Party rule
last summer, and then nearly killed the new coalition government of Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa.
The plans had to be revised after the upper house voted against them in
January, forcing Mr Hosokawa to agree a watered down version with the LDP.
Japan's new political laws stipulate that the lower house, the more powerful
of the two chambers, must have 500 seats - down from the present 511 - of
which 300 will be chosen from single seat constituencies and 200 by
proportional representation. The upper house is chosen through the same
mixed voting system.
Corporate donations will not be banned, as Mr Hosokawa had originally
wanted. Instead, companies will be allowed to donate Y500,000 per year to
politicians and fund raising organisations.
The next stage will be for an independent panel to draw up the new
parliamentary constituency boundaries. This is politically sensitive because
many politicians will have to rebuild support from scratch in new
constituencies as a result. New boundaries are expected to take between six
and nine months to prepare, paving the way for a general election under the
new system by next autumn at the earliest.
John Burton adds from Seoul: The South Korean parliament yesterday passed
political reform legislation meant to reduce corruption in election
campaigns.
The new election law is the latest measure by President Kim Young-sam to end
corruption among politicians and bureaucrats.
Lower spending limits will be imposed on candidates, including won 22.5bn
(Pounds 18.6m) for presidential campaigns and won 53m for parliamentary
elections. An election will be nullified if a candidate exceeds the campaign
spending limit. Government subsidies to political parties will also be
increased to reduce the dependence of candidates on outside contributions.
The use of campaign donations to bribe political candidates has been a
common feature of South Korean elections.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Radical MPs held in Turkey

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Five Turkish MPs representing the radical Kurdish-based Democracy party were
arrested yesterday as they left Turkey's National Assembly after a vote on
Wednesday stripped them of their parliamentary immunity.
They face the death penalty for espousing the Kurdish cause.
With rebels of the Kurdish Workers' party (PKK) fighting an increasingly
bloody war of independence in south-east Turkey, legal moves in Ankara
against the region's MPs will further alienate the Kurdish community.
Parliament's decision, expected for some months, followed a motion submitted
by the True Path party of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. However, the timing
was clearly to coincide with local elections on March 27, where a hardline
stance towards the Kurds is expected to be a vote winner.
According to the public prosecutor's submission to parliament, seven Kurdish
deputies - two were arrested on Wednesday - have been charged with making
separatist propaganda in speeches in Turkey and abroad. One deputy also
faces charges of harbouring an alleged Kurdish guerrilla, although the case
against the guerrilla has been dropped through lack of evidence.
Parliament has also voted to remove the immunity of a deputy of the
Moslem-backed Refah party for slandering Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal
Ataturk, and threatening the secular nature of the state.
Last night two of the MPs were released; the others had still not been
formally charged. Appeals were lodged with the Constitutional Court, which
has 15 days to decide on the legality of parliament's action.
To many observers the deputies' seizure by anti-terrorist police, after they
had taking refuge for two nights in the assembly's corridors, provide a
reminder of state powers to curb the freedom of speech in Turkey, which is
seeking membership of the European Union.
European governments are unlikely to issue a formal protest until the
appeals process had been exhausted.
When elected to parliament on the Social Democratic ticket in 1991, the
Kurdish deputies, originally 18 in number, were seen as a potential informal
channel between the government and the rebels. But the party was quickly
branded as a PKK mouthpiece and since then DEP members have faced widespread
intimidation. One MP was killed last year, and a number of local party
officials have been killed in the region.
With municipal elections approaching, a stand off is developing between
Turkey's two main communities. Last week the DEP announced it would not
field candidates for the elections, after bomb attacks on their offices. The
PKK has also threatened to target all candidates and voters.

Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, is urging European Union
agriculture ministers to ban British livestock and beef exports because of
what he said were the dangers of so-called 'mad cow disease', a Health
Ministry spokeswoman said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn.
If a special meeting of EU ministers fails to agree an immediate ban,
Germany will unilaterally impose restrictions because of the risk that
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, could spread to people.
The spokeswoman said Bonn proposed to ban imports of live animals as well as
entrails and meat. She said a working meeting of EU officials would hold
talks on March 8 and that a ministerial meeting would follow some time after
March 21 to discuss a ban.
In a television interview on Thursday, Mr Seehofer said Germany had to take
maximum precautions to protect people's health. This meant a ban on animals
and meat imports from Britain into Germany. 'The talks will be very
difficult,' he said. 'The British and (other EU countries) believe the
current measures are sufficient, but I don't believe that.'
Mr Seehofer said the use of cattle entrails in the production of baby food
was of concern. 'Here too - irrespective of whether the EU agrees or not -
we will ban the use of entrails (in the production of babyfood).'
In December the Berlin-based Federal Health Agency advised the government to
ban British beef as tests had shown that BSE could pass from cattle to
felines, suggesting it was possible the disease could spread to people.
BSE causes dementia and rapid death in cattle in the same way as the
incurable Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) attacks the human brain. Some
British health experts have warned that the country faces an explosion of
CJD because of the abundance of cattle infected with BSE, but a link between
the two diseases has not been proved.
Mr Seehofer said there was as yet no cause for hysteria. 'If in a few years
a ban turns out to be superfluous because we find out that BSE cannot spread
to people, so much the better.'

FT  05 MAR 94 / UK edges closer to sending extra troops to Bosnia

Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday edged the London
government closer towards committing extra troops to the United Nations
force in Bosnia.
He said in a speech in Scotland that 'the need is clear, as is the strain on
British troops already there'. He stressed though that Britain would not act
alone if others refused to respond to the UN appeal.
His remarks came after General Sir Michael Rose, commander of UN forces in
Bosnia yesterday stepped up his pleas for more ground troops.
Gen Rose and his officers, who are increasingly concerned that the fragile
ceasefire will gradually break down, warned 'there are people who are
prepared to go back to war'.
'We are already strained and the thing will get more difficult as we go
ahead. All you need is one group opening fire,' he said in Vitez,
headquarters of the British forces.
A British Ministry of Defence official in London said growing reluctance by
western governments to send more ground troops would be 'simply exploited by
(the Bosnian Serb, Croat and Moslem) commanders on the ground. Our
hesitation will be perceived as weakness and indecisiveness.'
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said yesterday that Serb militia were
raping and killing citizens in the northern city of Banja Luka.
No country has yet said it will unreservedly send more troops in response to
a request by Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN's special envoy to the former
Yugoslavia. Mr Akashi called for at least 4,000 troops for the Bosnian
capital of Sarajevo, and a further 6,000 - a conservative estimate according
to military strategists - to shore up the ceasefire in Bosnia.
'We do not know how long we have to stay, and we still do not know what our
goal and mandate is,' a UK official said. Britain already has 2,500 troops
in Bosnia.
The French Defence Ministry is considering a 'roll-over' policy. Troops, due
to replace those on the ground, might be sent earlier to complement them.
'It would be a great help if this was the case, but it would be a temporary
solution,' a UN official said.
In Washington there are few signs the Clinton administration, Congress or
the public will support sending troops before any overall peace settlement
is in place.
Michael Littlejohns, UN Correspondent in New York, adds: The UN Security
Council last night approved a plan to break the siege of Sarajevo and
restore 'normal life' there.
Acting under the enforcement provisions of the UN Charter its resolution
requests freedom of movement for civilians in the city and unhindered relief
deliveries.

FT  05 MAR 94 / IG Metall in last-ditch strike talks: Engineering union
issues list of companies to be hit first

<TEXT>
Full-scale negotiations between Germany's engineering workers and employers
were relaunched last night in an attempt to head off what would be the
industry's most serious strike for a decade.
Leaders of IG Metall, the engineering trade union, agreed to the talks
yesterday morning, but also gave the go-ahead for strike action to begin at
6am on Monday.
The first sign of progress came when both sides emerged after seven hours of
talks at 1am this morning to report back to their national executive
committees. An official said: 'All parts of the package are now back in
discussion.'
The union's regional headquarters in Hanover also issued a list of 22
companies, involving some 11,000 workers, which will be first hit by strike
action in the state of Lower Saxony. Top of the list are the Man bus plant
in Salzgitter, and Linke-Hofmann-Busch, the Preussag subsidiary which
manufactures wagons for Germany's ICE high-speed train.
Mr Zwickel said the union would take every opportunity to avoid a strike,
but he expressed doubts the latest round of talks would lead to an
acceptable wage compromise at the last minute.
However, he added that IG Metall would 'leave no stone unturned to try to
keep the engineering workers out of an all-out conflict' He blamed the
employers for the current impasse, saying they had refused to abandon their
'unacceptable positions.'
Gesamtmetall, the employers' national federation, is calling for real cost
cuts from the pay round, and has served notice of cancellation of the
existing contract on holiday bonuses - which has most incensed the workers.
As a result, the Lower Saxony engineering workers voted by a hefty 92.2 per
cent in favour of strike action in a ballot this week. Nonetheless, the
union is aware that in a steep recession, with rising unemployment, its
position is weak.
No big suppliers to the German car industry are involved, although they
amount to 40 per cent of engineering employers in Lower Saxony.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Yeltsin tries to steer a middle course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday called for 'stability, order and
co-operation' in an attempt to calm growing tension in the country. His call
signalled that radical economic reform was even more unlikely in the
immediate future.
His speech to government, party and regional leaders, and a later one by Mr
Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, proposed a strategy balanced
between macroeconomic controls and industrial support to try to stem falling
production and avoid 'reform at any price'.
The two men ended up, however, calling for quite different year-end
inflation targets - with Mr Yeltsin insisting the former target of 5 per
cent a month by the end of 1994 still stood, and Mr Chernomyrdin proposing a
looser 7-9 per cent.
The International Monetary Fund, whose team returns next week for further
talks on releasing a further tranche of Dollars 1.5bn, has insisted on 5 per
cent. Finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialised countries
meeting in Frankfurt last weekend backed strict IMF conditionality - a move
which appears to make remote any further IMF assistance in the near future.
The annual budget, passed in principle by the government on Thursday,
envisages a deficit of Rbs61,000bn, or 10.2 per cent of GNP - compared with
a claimed deficit in 1993 of 10.7 per cent of GNP. Though hailed by western
financial observers in Moscow yesterday as relatively brave, it is also
being greeted as merely an opening salvo in a process of bargaining over
credits which has already begun with large sums being demanded by the
agricultural sector.
Mr Yeltsin, who referred to the amnesty of the parliamentary rebels - former
vice-president Mr Alexander Rutskoi and parliamentary speaker Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov - as a decision which 'seriously violated the constitution, the
law and moral standards', nevertheless proposed to MPs a 'memorandum for
civic peace'. He views this as a document which would bind the parties to
'responsibility' for their actions - though in what way is as yet unclear.
In their speeches, both Mr Yeltsin and Mr Chernomyrdin preserved many
reformist elements - and the prime minister even allowed himself to shout at
Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman and an ally, for weakening
the state by handing out credits with too liberal a hand.
'Future Russian generations will never forgive us if we leave them with a
weak country,' he retorted to Mr Gerashchenko's contention that inflation
was a lesser evil than mass unemployment.
Mr Gerashchenko said that choosing to fight inflation meant mass
redundancies - while support for industry meant higher inflation.
Martin Wolf adds: Boris Fyodorov, Russia's tough former finance minister,
said in London that if the west were to start pouring money into Russia now,
it would be a great mistake. 'Money must be given not on promises, but on
deeds,' he insisted.
The IMF and finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries should wait to see first what budget was adopted and then whether
the government managed at least three months of sound financial policies.
Mr Fyodorov admitted that the government's financial policy had been more
restrictive than previously, but only because it had demonstrated 'total
inaction in the last two months'. Meanwhile, the central bank 'had become
much more monetarist', since his departure from the ministry. This was
mainly because Mr Gerashchenko did not want to take responsibility for
credit expansion, but wished to be commanded by government.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Curbs on foreign banks may ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for relaxation of the tight rules governing foreign banks in
Russia appear to have improved following talks with the authorities and
foreign bankers.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, yesterday told a meeting
of government ministers and party leaders: 'I think life will force us to
take a new approach towards competition with foreign banks. Hothouse
conditions do not seem good for our bankers.'
A decree issued last year permits a few foreign banks to operate under tight
restrictions; it limits foreign banks to handling accounts of non-residents
only - cutting out the growing Russian business and personal market as well
as joint ventures.
Foreign bankers believe their lobbying for a more liberal regime has been
paying off, and that Mr Chernomyrdin's remarks may herald more banks
entering the arena or existing banks taking a wider spread of clients.
The licences issued by the central bank to all but one of the banks allow
all types of transactions - but the decree tightly limits them.
Russian banks are small by international standards and offer a limited range
of services with an emphasis on money trading. They fear the unrestricted
entry of large western institutions would hit their market.
Moscow yesterday confirmed its intention to pull out troops from Estonia by
the agreed date of August 31 - but only if a dispute over the fate of 10,000
Russian military veterans were settled to its satisfaction. Estonia has so
far been determined not to pay social security to the army pensioners. It
claims most of them are not - as Moscow says - elderly, but are
young/middle-aged ex-counterintelligence or airborne troops who pose a
security threat to the state.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have warned their European Union
partners they will not be able to get their parliaments to admit four new EU
members if Britain and Spain insist on the same voting rules of a Europe of
12 for a union of 16 countries.
Sweden, Finland and Austria agreed on Tuesday the terms on which they will
enter the EU next January. The Union resumes membership negotiations
tomorrow with Norway, which is holding out for special treatment in
sensitive areas such as fisheries resources.
But the issue of the so-called 'blocking minority' - the number of votes
needed to block legislation in the EU's Council of Ministers - could decide
whether the enlargement goes ahead at all. The British and, with nuances,
the Spanish want to keep the existing value of their votes in the qualified
majority voting system. Under this system, which allocates votes in the
Council according to the size of states, two large states and one small one
can combine their votes to block the rest.
Foreign ministers of the 12 must resolve the voting controversy when they
meet in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday.
By Thursday the European Parliament will decide whether to proceed with its
mandatory ratification of the accession treaty in time for the newcomers to
enter in January. The parliament has said it will not go ahead if the voting
rules stay as they are.
The four newcomers will have difficulty selling EU membership to their
citizens in referendums each has pledged to hold this year. But now the
voting dispute has raised a new obstacle at the level of national
parliaments - all of which have to endorse the wider Union.

Milan magistrates are investigating alleged undeclared transfer fees paid by
the cup-winning AC Milan football club, owned by media magnate and aspiring
politician Mr Silvio Berlusconi.
Their investigations centre on the 1992 transfer from Turin to AC Milan of
the highest paid Italian footballer, Gigi Lentini. Lentini was questioned
this week about his transfer payment publicly, said to be at least L22bn
(Pounds 8.91m), and allegations from his old Turin club that up to L6.5bn
was not declared.
The transfer of Lentini is already under investigation by Turin magistrates
who last year arrested the former Turin chairman, Mr Gian Mauro Borsano, on
charges of accepting alleged illicit payments over player transfers.
However, the involvement of Milan magistrates has taken the case a stage
further and focuses the spotlight on the activities of AC Milan itself.
According to well-publicised leaks from Milan magistrates, Mr Borsano is
alleged to have confessed to receiving L6.5bn from AC Milan to facilitate
Lentini's transfer. Of this, L5bn, he alleged, came from a Liechtenstein
bank. He is also said to have confessed to illicitly pledging Turin club
shares with its AC Milan competitor for three months as a guarantee that
Lentini would be transferred.
Mr Adriano Galliani, AC Milan director, has brushed aside the investigation.
In a separate development Turin magistrates have arrested two French
citizens, Mr Roger Flamant and Mr Maurice Bansay, respectively chairman and
managing director of the French retail group Trema, on corruption charges
related to the development of a huge shopping mall, Le Gru.
This is believed to be the first time foreign nationals have been arrested
in Italy during corruption investigations.
The Trema group has developed the Le Gru complex in a 60/40 venture with
Euromercato, part of the Standa group controlled by Mr Berlusconi's
Fininvest empire. The two French executives are alleged to have paid about
L1.5bn to political parties to help obtain the licence for the project.
Although both had previously offered to co-operate with the magistrates,
they were arrested following suspicions they were tampering with the
inquiry.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and Poland yesterday agreed to resume direct flights between London
and Warsaw on March 13, ending a long-running dispute that has suspended
direct air services between the two countries for the past four months.
The dispute arose when British Airways sought to add a second daily flight
on the London to Warsaw route. Although the UK flag carrier said it was
entitled to double its weekly flights under the 1988 aviation agreement
between the two countries, Poland rejected the plan. The UK government
retaliated by banning the London services of Poland's national carrier, LOT.
Under yesterday's agreement the two carriers will each be able to offer nine
flights a week from March 13. This will increase to 12 flights a week during
the summer season, which starts on March 27 and runs until November, and
then drop back to 10 flights a week during the winter season.
The compromise agreement includes a mechanism to increase the number of
services next winter if there is sufficient passenger demand.
Mr Zbigniew Kiszczak, deputy president of LOT, said the agreement was 'a
clear Polish success'. The airline was happy to have preserved the principle
of 'parity and equal benefits' in the talks.
The Poles were especially pleased to have wrung agreement from BA on having
the additional British morning flights leave Warsaw in the late morning,
arriving in London too late to catch a transatlantic connection.
LOT's fears that it would lose passengers on its direct flight to Chicago to
BA have been at the root of the dispute, which cost the carrier Dollars 1m
(Pounds 675,600) in revenue. Since the dispute began LOT has seen a 17 per
cent rise in passengers on its transatlantic flights.
Following suspension of direct air services, travellers between London and
Warsaw have been forced to fly via a third country, more than doubling the
journey time.

Full-scale negotiations between Germany's engineering workers and employers
were launched last night in an attempt to head off what would be the
industry's most serious strike for a decade.
Leaders of IG Metall, the engineering trade union, agreed to the talks
yesterday morning, but also gave the go-ahead for strike action to begin at
6am on Monday.
The union's regional headquarters in Hanover also issued a list of 22
companies, involving some 11,000 workers, which will be first hit by strike
action in the state of Lower Saxony. Top of the list are the Man bus plant
in Salzgitter, and Linke-Hofmann-Busch, the Preussag subsidiary which
manufactures wagons for Germany's ICE high-speed train.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, IG Metall leader, said the union would take every
opportunity to avoid a strike, but he expressed doubts that the latest round
of talks would lead to an acceptable wage compromise at the last minute.
However, he added that IG Metall would 'leave no stone unturned to try to

He blamed the employers for the current impasse, saying they had refused to

Gesamtmetall, the employers' national federation, is calling for real cost

As a result, the Lower Saxony engineering workers voted by a hefty 92.2 per
cent in favour of strike action in a ballot this week. Nonetheless, the
union is aware that in a steep recession, with rising unemployment, its
position is weak.
No big suppliers to the German motor industry are involved, although they
amount to 40 per cent of the engineering employers in Lower Saxony. Apart
from Man and Linke-Hofmann-Busch, other companies targeted include two
Mannesmann subsidiaries, Kabelmetal, and Otis escalators.

Mr Gerashchenko said that choosing to fight inflation meant mass

Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting finance minister, however, said that inflation
had come down from 22 per cent in January to 13-15 per cent this month - and
that the government would now follow a centrist course, avoiding shocks and
pushing enterprises 'gradually' to the market.
Mr Chernomyrdin said that a law on bankruptcies would have to be adopted and
said that his government would tread on a 'razor's edge' between rising
inflation and falling production. However, the substance of his speech was
to commend moderate reform - and was greeted by Mr Sergei Glaziev, a former
trade minister and strong critic of the radical reformers, as laying the
basis for consensus between the government and the parliamentary majority.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former first deputy prime minister and leader of the
liberal Russia's Choice political party, said Mr Chernomyrdin's journey
along the razor's edge was unnecessary. 'There is no such dilemma. Economic
decline is by and large caused by our failure to adhere to tough monetary
policies.'
Martin Wolf adds: Boris Fyodorov, Russia's tough former finance minister,
said in London that if the west were to start pouring money into Russia now,
it would be a great mistake. 'Money must be given not on promises, but on
deeds,' he insisted.
The IMF and finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries should wait to see first what budget was adopted and then whether
the government managed at least three months of sound financial policies.
Mr Fyodorov admitted that the government's financial policy had been more
restrictive than previously, but only because it had demonstrated 'total
inaction in the last two months'. Meanwhile, the central bank 'had become
much more monetarist', since his departure from the ministry. This was
mainly because Mr Gerashchenko did not want to take responsibility for
credit expansion, but wished to be commanded by government.
This inaction would not last, argued Mr Fyodorov. 'Inflation may accelerate
to 30 per cent a month by the autumn,' he forecast, far above the targeted
level of 10 per cent. At that point, he argued, Mr Yeltsin, who was trying
to distance himself at present, would feel obliged to intervene.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Thorp N-plant given go-ahead by High Court: BNF wins 17-year
battle to open reprocessing works
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Nuclear Fuels won a 17-year battle to open and commission its Pounds
2.8bn Thorp reprocessing plant yesterday when the High Court dismissed a
challenge that the government acted unreasonably and irrationally last
December in approving its start-up.
The reprocessing of spent fuel at the north-west England plant, which has
contracts with Japan and Germany but is opposed by other countries,
including Ireland, could begin within the next month.
Yesterday's ruling on a challenge by Greenpeace, the environmental group,
and Lancashire county council, also clears the way for the government to
launch its long-awaited review of the nuclear industry. Terms of reference
may be published within the next month.
Although Greenpeace said the campaign against Thorp would continue, it and
Lancashire council are unlikely to appeal against the ruling. That means BNF
has emerged victorious from a legal battle that began in 1977 with a public
inquiry in Sellafield, Cumbria, where Thorp is located.
Mr Justice Potts decided against ordering Greenpeace and Lancashire to pay
BNF's legal expenses. He said it was an 'unusual and indeed exceptional case
of great public interest' and the two plaintiffs had won an important point
of law. That was a reference to his ruling that government lawyers had
'erred in law' when they argued that ministers were not legally bound to
justify the need for Thorp.
In fact, the judge ruled, the question of justification had been properly
considered and the court would not intervene. Even so, Greenpeace believes
his ruling will help them in future nuclear cases and in the nuclear review.
The judge also emphasised the need 'to properly inform the public' on
matters such as Thorp.
On the main issue, Greenpeace and Lancashire argued that the government
acted irrationally by not holding a second public inquiry. Without that,
they said, no authorising authority could properly agree to the proposed
'dramatic increases' in radioactive emissions which Greenpeace believes
could result in many deaths.
Dismissing the challenge, Mr Justice Potts said Mr John Gummer, environment
secretary, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, had acted within
their powers when they authorised BNF in December to discharge radioactive
emissions from the thermal oxide reprocessing plant into the air and the
Irish Sea.
Mr Justice Potts said in a 78-page judgment: 'It may be thought that a
minister sensible to the scale of representations . . . and the desirability
of allaying public anxiety would have directed an inquiry.' That was not an
issue for the court.
Mr David Bonser, Thorp director, said the decision provided secure long-term
jobs for 500 employees. Thorp would make a profit of about Pounds 500m in
its first 10 years of operations, the company said. The decision was also
welcomed by the GMB general workers' union.
Tokyo Electric Power Company was delighted with the decision.
Mr Chris Rose, for Greenpeace, said Thorp was a threat not only to Britain
but to the safety of the world.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Malaysia refuses to budge over ban on contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia yesterday refused to reconsider a ban on giving British companies
government contracts.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, said that as long as the
British press continued telling what he considered to be lies, his
government would not alter its position.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, while disappointed with the Malaysian
decision, said it would not be reacting. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary,
had decided to let 'the dust settle' before trying to re-establish contacts.
However, ministers were reported to be irritated over the Malaysians'
refusal to lift their ban after the British High Commissioner in Kuala
Lumpur briefed the Foreign Office on Dr Mahathir's reaction. If the ban
continues the government may consider retaliation, although 'we are not at
that point yet', said Mr Hurd.
Downing Street said Mr John Major, the prime minister, continued to believe
the Malaysian move was shortsighted and not 'remotely justified'.
Malaysia announced the ban last week in retaliation for what it said was
'the patronising attitude and innuendoes' contained in British media reports
on Malaysia. In particular the Malaysians attacked a recent report in The
Sunday Times suggesting that a British construction company had discussed
offering a Dollars 50,000 (Pounds 34,000) bribe to Dr Mahathir in the hope
of winning a contract. Dr Mahathir has denied knowing anything about such
payments. 'I am not that cheap in the first place,' he told a news
conference last night.
Mr Andrew Neil, the editor of The Sunday Times, said yesterday: 'I am
disappointed that the Malaysian prime minister has not got off the hook on
which he impaled himself.'
Mr Neil said he had written to The Times to make clear that The Sunday Times
had never accused Dr Mahathir of taking a bribe, in the hope that it would
allow the Malaysians to 'depart from the field with honour'. He said his
paper would continue to investigate stories in Malaysia.
Dr Mahathir said Mr Neil's letter had only added insult to injury.
British companies are likely to lose many millions of pounds' worth of
contracts. The Malaysians have already said British companies will be
excluded from a MDollars 12bn (Pounds 2.95bn) airport project outside Kuala
Lumpur. Trafalgar House, Balfour Beatty, Gammon and G-Mats (part of GEC), in
partnership with Marubeni of Japan, had been assured of much of the work on
the airport.
Some Malaysian businesspeople have privately expressed concern that the
government's move might affect the inward flow of foreign investment and
invite retaliatory action.

FT  05 MAR 94 / PM denies unions a voice on Bank's governing body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major has refused to appoint a trade union leader as a non-executive
director of the Bank of England, breaking a tradition dating from the Bank's
nationalisation in 1946.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said last night the prime minister appointed
Bank directors on the basis of their 'individual expertise' and not to
'represent other institutions'.
However, the Trades Union Congress said: 'The prime minister's decision
means the Bank of England will now lack a voice representing ordinary
working people and this will damage its credibility.'
The matter will be raised in the Commons on Monday by Mr Alistair Darling,
Labour's spokesman on the City of London. 'It is deeply regrettable that the
government has abandoned the bipartisan approach to the Bank's governing
body,' he said.
Over the past few weeks, Mr Eddie George, the central bank's governor, and
his deputy, Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, tried hard to persuade the prime minister
to reappoint Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering
union, for a further four-year term as a non-executive director.
Mr Laird's work as a director had impressed Mr George and his colleagues. He
was appointed to the Bank's governing body in 1986 by Lady Thatcher, the
prime minister of the day, with the support of Mr Nigel Lawson, then
chancellor. He was given a second four-year term in 1990.
Mr Major's office told the Bank that reappointing Mr Laird for a third term
would set a bad precedent. The prime minister considered another union
leader as a replacement but did not appoint him. However, Sir David Scholey,
chairman of SG Warburg, was appointed for a further four years although he
has been a Bank director since 1981.
Mr Laird and the industrialist Sir Adrian Cadbury, the other outgoing
director, will be replaced by Sir David Cooksey, chairman of the Audit
Commission and Advent, a venture capital company, and Ms Sheila Masters, a
partner in chartered accountant KPMG Peat Marwick and a member of the
chancellor's working group on private sector finance.
The TUC never directly nominated union officials to the Bank, but it was an
unwritten tradition that a union figure would serve as a director. What
particularly irritates the unions is that Mr Major's decision came the week
that the TUC 'relaunched' itself with the aim of broadening its appeal
across the party political spectrum.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, spoke to the TUC's
public services conference on Thursday, the first time in many years that a
Conservative minister had addressed a TUC conference. Mr David Hunt,
employment secretary, has agreed to speak at a TUC employment conference in
July.
But Mr Major's government has snubbed the unions before, most notably in
1992 when it decided to abolish the National Economic Development Council.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: The challenge that paid off - Debbie
Harrison on Rothschild Asset Management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rothschild Asset Management is the main investment management company within
the Rothschild Group, one of the world's leading independent merchant
banking and asset management organisations. Although the company has not
been rated by Standard &amp; Poor's, several of its funds have achieved S &amp; P's
top AAA award.
As a unit trust personal pension provider, Rothschild is one of the most
successful financial institutions to challenge the virtual monopoly held by
the life assurance offices in this multi-million pound market. Its
combination of clear charges, flexibility and good performance pushed the
Rothschild managed personal pension plan rapidly to the top of the league
tables.
Apart from Rothschild, the only other unit trust personal pension provider
now is Gartmore, while Murray Johnstone offers company unit trust pensions.
Fidelity, which withdrew from the individual personal pensions market
recently, is to enter the company market soon.
To the consumer, there might seem little to choose between a unit trust
personal pension and a life office unit-linked plan since, in both cases,
premiums buy units in a chosen fund and the price of these units goes up and
down depending on the performance of the underlying assets.
The charging structure of the two products is quite different, though. As a
unit trust group, Rothschild can pay only single premium commission of 4-5
per cent to advisers selling its products. This is financed out of the
bid/offer spread, which is levied on all contributions throughout the term.
On top of this, there is an annual management fee of 1 per cent.
Unit-linked plans also have these charges. But there are extra 'initial' or
'capital' unit charges in the early years which are used to pay the adviser
the commission that would be earned over the entire term of the plan. On top
of these extra deductions, there are policy fees and administration charges.
The point to note about unit trust personal pensions is that the charges are
explicit and there are no penalties if the contract stops early. This does
not necessarily mean they are cheaper than unit-linked plans over the long
term but unit trust pensions do offer genuine portability without penalty.
The Rothschild managed personal pension fund, which invests in a portfolio
of equities, bonds, gilts and deposits, came 11th out of 83 managed funds in
the latest Money Management survey*. Looking at results on a year-by-year
basis, however, the performance is rather volatile. The fund was a top
performer between 1988 and 1992, then took a dive. By 1993, it had slipped
into the bottom 25 per cent of funds. The UK major companies equity fund had
a similar downturn.
According to marketing director Peter Rees, the investment philosophy of the
personal plans mirrors that of the institutional pension funds. 'This leads
us to invest predominantly in high-quality equities which, over the long
term, should provide a consistent, above-average return while the fund
benefits from the enhanced marketability and security afforded by this
significant bias in favour of blue chip stocks,' he says.
'A side effect, however, has been that the fund did not participate in the
strong gains shown by second-line stocks (smaller companies) over the past
12 months and so has tended to underperform in the short term. Nevertheless,
we remain convinced that the basic strategy is correct.'
The group offers a range of funds investing in American, European and
Japanese markets. But, for investors approaching retirement, it suggests
using the managed, gilt and deposit funds to consolidate gains. A phased
switching to these funds over the seven years leading up to retirement can
be arranged. But the gilt fund, which achieved a top quartile (top 25 per
cent) position in 1989, has performed below average ever since, while the
deposit fund has performed consistently below average since its launch in
1988.
Although small in numerical terms, the 1,600 Rothschild transfer plans
account for more than 20 per cent of its total personal pension business.
Rees points out that most of the transfers came through independent advisers
who were responsible for assessing each case. He adds: 'We now issue warning
letters to all customers who come to us directly and who are considering
transferring their pension. These letters outline the main points to
consider in a transfer and recommend that clients seek full advice from
their employer and/or an independent adviser.'

Charges: At present life office illustrations of what your investment
may produce use a standard basis for charges set by Lautro (the Life
Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation). To reveal the impact
of real charges on the final fund of Rothschild Asset Management's
managed unit-trust plan, we asked for illustrations using actual charges
for a man aged 45 who expects to retire at age 65 (ie, a 20 year
contract), paying (a) Pounds 200 per month and (b) a stand alone single
premium of Pounds 10,000. Illustrations using Lautro standard charges,
which in fact are much lower than charges used by most providers, are
shown in brackets. The last illustration gives a theoretical value if
no charges were made. The growth assumptions are Lautro's standard 6
per cent and 12 per cent.

The charges on Rothschild's plan over the full 25 year period are about
average for the industry. However, unlike most life office plans, there
is no heavy weighting of charges in the early years of the plan and so
there are no penalties on decreasing or stopping premiums, early
transfer or retirement.

FT  05 MAR 94 / The Long View: Optional extras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems that Kenneth Clarke, the sharp-eyed chancellor of the exchequer,
has noticed that one or two top British businessmen appear to be paying
themselves too much. The same conclusion has been reached, at last, by some
of the institutional shareholders who have tolerated the amazing escalation
of boardroom pay over the years.
The case of John Cahill, the retiring British Aerospace chairman, who has
taken a Pounds 3.2m profit on share options after failing to complete the
term of his contract, is just the latest of many. The newspapers are full of
stories of escalating salaries, backed by profits on share options which
have often been enjoyed not just by brave and skilful risk-takers but by the
bureaucratic bosses of privatised monopoly utilities.
To the politicians there is the extra niggle of the constantly widening
differential between their pay and that of the private sector elite. Every
attempt to raise the salaries of MPs and ministers arouses public fury. But
the implied reduction in the incentive to take up a political career, and
the progressive reduction in quality of those in politics, is rarely
discussed, however obvious it is becoming.
Institutional investors are especially concerned because it happens that
many companies will be replacing their executive share option schemes in the
coming months. This is because many 10-year plans were implemented in 1984,
after changes in the tax legislation, and are due for renewal.
The option scheme replacement season got off to a bad start with an argument
over the proposal last month by the big unit trust group M &amp; G. This was
declared in breach of the official institutional guidelines. But M &amp; G went
ahead anyway, which was especially significant because until a few years
ago, when led by David Hopkinson, it was a leader in promoting the
principles of good corporate governance.
M &amp; G's alleged sin was in linking its options simply to the share price.
But because the share price of an investment management company effectively
represents a geared-up play on the stock market, the options will become
very valuable in a bull market regardless of whether the company is doing
well. The big shareholders insist that options should only become valuable
when the performance of the company can be shown to have improved against a
clearly defined benchmark.
Another fund management company, Gartmore, which was recently floated, is
seeking to devise a more complicated plan. Probably its formula will provide
that the options will not become exercisable unless the share price has
performed at least in line with the average All-Share Index constituent, and
will not reach full value unless the shares are among the top 25 per cent
for performance.
Institutional investors are seeking to organise themselves in order to block
nonconforming executive share option schemes. With many companies they will
be able to do so (although they were powerless at M &amp; G where the scheme was
voted through by a big shareholder, a charitable trust). The proxy battle is
a messy and undignified way of imposing shareholders' wishes, however. The
institutions' preferred method of gaining control over the explosion of top
executives' pay and bonuses was set out in the report of the Cadbury
committee, in the shape of a remuneration committee made up of non-executive
directors.
In theory the paragons on such a committee are raised above the normal
pressures of greed and envy and can lay down objective judgments. The
practice is different. Sometimes these non-executive directors are executive
directors of other companies. They are simply approving each others' pay
increases. Even when not personally slotted into the spiral, they are under
pressure to go along with what is happening elsewhere.
Institutional shareholders are subject to conflicts of interest. Many of the
big ones are listed, and have highly-remunerated chief executives who are
not particularly keen to make low-paid examples of themselves.
The idea behind option schemes is that they should reinforce the common
interests of shareholders and executives. When companies are no longer run
by proprietors but by their poorly-supervised hirelings there is a need to
design rewards that reflect shareholders' objectives. Otherwise, managers
will, for instance, go on empire-building sprees that do nothing for the
share price or earnings per share.
The institutions cannot agree on exactly how option schemes should be
designed. Those based on earnings targets are criticised (by M &amp; G, for
instance) on the grounds that the figures can be cynically manipulated.
Alternative approaches based upon beating market indices or sector average
performances are also flawed, because they may encourage short-termism and
may simply reward good fortune, as with the monopoly privatised utilities.
Declining industries may need good management too, but will not readily get
it if remuneration depends on beating the share price trends in growth
sectors.
Consequently the pension funds are hedging their bets by requiring that
companies devise their own customised performance objectives and obtain
shareholders' approval. But this does not exactly sound like decisive
leadership, and could leave managers struggling to understand what their
evasive proprietors really want; the uncertainty looks like providing
something of a bonanza for expensive consultants.
As for those schemes devised a decade ago, they appear to have encouraged a
relatively good UK stock market performance by international standards, but
they expire in circumstances in which UK companies are arguably
overdistributing and underinvesting. Doubtless, the well-paid managers have
been correctly respecting the priorities of their institutional
shareholders.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Cemex to take control of
Venezuela producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cementos Mexicanos (Cemex), the big Mexican cement company, has agreed to
purchase a controlling stake in Corporacion Venezolana de Cementos
(Vencemos), Venezuela's largest cement producer for about Dollars 300m.
Cemex said a price, and the number of shares it would buy, had not been
fixed. However, it is widely expected that Cemex will pay about Dollars 300m
for its stake.
Vencemos has a stock market value of Dollars 510m. Cemex is expected to pay
a premium for control.
Vencemos has 50 per cent of the Venezuelan cement market, and 30 per cent of
the concrete market. Last year, it sold 2.8m tonnes of cement and exported
another 1m tonnes.
Mr Eugenio Mendoza, the head of Grupo Mendoza, said the alliance with Cemex
would help increase domestic sales and sales to the Caribbean.
The purchase marks a further step in global expansion for the Mexican cement
company, which is the fourth-largest in the world. Cemex, already the
dominant producer in Mexico, has operations in the US and, through its
Dollars 1.85bn purchase of Valenciana and Sanson in 1992, is the largest
producer in Spain.
Mr Lorenzo Zambrano, chief executive of Cemex, said the purchase was
consistent with the company's strategy of 'acquiring important stakes in
companies that operate and have a leadership position in developing
countries with strong perspectives of growth in the demand of cement and
concrete'.
Mr Zambrano said Cemex would focus on expansion in Latin America in the
short and medium-term, and Asia in the medium and long-term.
The purchase will increase Cemex's overall cement capacity to about 40m
tonnes. It said its control of Vencemos would enable the company to reduce
costs and improve profit margins.

The Czech government yesterday retaliated against Slovakia's imposition of a
10 per cent import tax by unilaterally devaluing the special currency used
for Czech-Slovak trade, Reuter reports. The Czech government devalued the
Czech crown used within the special clearing currency by 3 per cent.
Slovakia yesterday introduced a 10 per cent tax on imports of many consumer
goods to curb its mounting trade deficit, which totalled 26.7bn crowns in
1993. Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister (left), said the Slovak tax
was a 'semi-devaluation' of the Slovak crown.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Report criticises Italian minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A parliamentary report has criticised Mr Nicola Mancino, Italian interior
minister, for lacking proper control of the domestic intelligence service.
The report, given to parliament in mid-February but published yesterday, was
prompted by concern that the intelligence services had been acting as a law
unto themselves and lacked adequate ministerial and parliamentary
supervision.
This followed the discovery of wide misuse of the organisations' funds and
suspicions that members of the services had been involved in the planting of
last summer's bombs in Florence, Milan and Rome. In the past nine months
magistrates have arrested a number of senior figures in both the domestic
and military intelligence networks on grounds of misuse of funds at present
totalling L60bn (Dollars 35.5m).
The report says Mr Mancino lacked 'effective control' and received only
episodic information on the activities of the domestic intelligence service
(Sisde). More often than not, he was told only after operations were over.
However, his supervisory role was handicapped by the 1977 laws setting up
the Sisde, which gave its officials virtual autonomy. Mr Mancino yesterday
claimed the report vindicated him.
The misuse of intelligence funds has concerned both budgeted money and
secret monies annually made available to the Interior Ministry.
The allegations have even been directed against President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, who was a Christian Democrat interior minister from 1983 to 1987.
The president has consistently denied these suggestions and Rome magistrates
again yesterday said he was not on the list of persons under investigation.
The Ciampi government last July initiated a reform of all the security
services, bringing them under the direct control of the prime minister's
office. But a big shake-up can only come after the March general elections
under the next parliament.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Dutch rulers do badly in election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local elections have dealt a blow to the Netherlands' two ruling parties
ahead of the May general election.
Support for the Christian Democrats (CDA) of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the prime
minister, fell to 25 per cent of the vote on Wednesday from 33.8 per cent in
the last local elections in 1990.
Their coalition partners, Labour, led by Mr Wim Kok, the finance minister,
attracted 20.4 per cent of the vote, down from 26.2 per cent.
According to final results on Wednesday night, the main winners were the two
largest opposition parties, the right-wing Liberals and D66, a centrist
party, as well as a number of smaller parties, including those with
far-right views.
If these results were translated into parliamentary seats, CDA and Labour
would lose their majority in the 150-member lower chamber, with their
combined number of seats falling to 71 from 103 in the 1989 general
election.
This means that if they wished to continue their coalition after the May
election, they would need to bring a third party into government.
However, the local elections are not entirely a reliable guide to future
voting because the results were influenced by local issues and parties that
will not figure in the general elections on May 3.
Mr Kok described the results as a 'serious disappointment'. Labour's
traditional supporters have been angered by the party's agreement to
unpopular reforms of the social welfare system, particularly in the area of
disability insurance.
The CDA was hampered both by the growth in unemployment and by the impending
departure from national politics of Mr Lubbers, whose 12 years in office
make him the longest-serving prime minister in Dutch history.
Another feature of the local elections was the strong showing by far-right
parties which tend to espouse a xenophobic line on immigration and political
asylum.

FT  04 MAR 94 / US under pressure on Bosnia as UN requests 10,000 more
troops

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is coming under increasing pressure to send ground forces to Bosnia,
following a request by the United Nations for an extra 10,000 troops to
shore up the republic's ceasefire.
General Jean Cot, head of the UN's peacekeeping forces in the former
Yugoslavia, said it was a 'strange and not very courageous idea' that the US
would consider sending troops only after a peace settlement was secured.
Gen Cot said it was essential for the US, followed by Britain and France, to
send troops 'immediately', implying that the ceasefire in Sarajevo, the
Bosnian capital, and in other parts of the country was running on borrowed
time. France, followed by Britain, have between them 6,500 troops in Bosnia.
Britain yesterday held out the possibility it might send more troops. But
amid signs of a cabinet split and fears of a potential backlash in the
Conservative ranks, it rejected a request from General Sir Michael Rose, the
UN commander in Bosnia, for immediate reinforcement of Britain's 2,500
troops.
Responding to the latest UN plea for an extra 10,650 soldiers to join the
13,000 already in Bosnia, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said further
British help would be proportionate to and contingent on increased
participation in the peace effort.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, warned
that without the extra troops fragile ceasefires could otherwise collapse.
Gen Rose reinforced the warning by saying his troops were now operating 'on
a wing and a prayer'.
In the Croatian capital Zagreb, Mr Akashi said: 'We are profoundly disturbed
by the lukewarm and negative response to date (for more troops). Its a real
test case for member states to show whether their protestations for peace in
Bosnia are really backed up by concrete actions.'
US diplomats argued this week that the preliminary agreement in Washington
between Bosnia's Croats, Moslems and the Croatian government would in fact
require fewer ground troops. 'Since this agreement would be more benign, it
would need fewer troops, so the US might not have to sign on,' a US diplomat
said.
But UN officials yesterday said refusal or reluctance by western governments
could be exploited by Bosnian Croat, Moslem and Serb military commanders on
the ground.
Gen Rose has told Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, that he needs
more British troops with experience of Northern Ireland. But a number of
senior UK ministers - said to include Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, have hitherto opposed greater
British involvement on the ground.
The need to consolidate the ceasefires comes amid further talks between
Bosnian Croats and Moslems and Croat officials. They are due to meet in
Vienna today to try to draw up maps and structures to implement a federation
for one part of Bosnia which will have a loose arrangement with Croatia.

<TEXT>
The Sao Paulo stock market staged a partial recovery early yesterday after
falling 6.4 per cent on Wednesday over fears that foreign investors will
have to pay a financial operations tax of up to 25 per cent on new money
entering the country.
The fears followed passage of a measure which gives the government the
option of introducing the tax if necessary to stem a rush of foreign capital
into the country which could jeopardise the government's current
anti-inflation plan.
The central bank also introduced stricter rules for Brazilian companies
wanting to issue Eurobonds and other fixed income securities. The bank
decreed that the financial operations tax (IOF) could in future be levied on
all exchange operations, including equities investment.
Stock brokers believe that no restrictions on equity investment are
imminent. If the government decides to take further action it will first
target Eurobonds and other debt instruments by increasing their IOF tax
rate, they said.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Survey of World Tyre Industry (7): Spinning wheel of
misfortune - The Japanese crisis and the effect on other Asian nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese tyre industry, Asia's largest, is in a spin. The sector is
suffering from a massive collapse in demand caused by the worst domestic
recession since 1945. Simultaneously, high costs and the inexorable rise of
the yen is undermining the ability of Japanese tyre manufacturers to export
their way out of trouble.
The crisis threatens to create a fundamental shift in production from Japan
to other Asian countries. The trend is part of a more general trend of
'hollowing out' of Japanese industry, as manufacturers relocate production
in the low-cost fast-growing Asian markets.
The decline of the Japanese tyre market, the world's second biggest, has
been precipitous. Last year was the third that demand and production fell
and the drop last year was the worst on record. Output has fallen from a
peak of 166.7m tyres in 1989 to less than 150m units last year. Meanwhile,
the amount of rubber consumed has dropped from 1.031m tonnes in 1990 to
922,000 tonnes in 1993, according to the Japan Automobile Tire
Manufacturers' Association (Jatma).
The sector has been undermined by a collapse in demand in both the original
equipment market - supplying domestic car manufacturers - and in the
domestic replacement market. Tyre shipments to domestic vehicle constructors
fell 12.1 per cent last year to 50m units. That fall mirrors a 10.2 per cent
drop in Japanese vehicle production, according to data released by the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Meanwhile, the collapse in the
replacement market has exacerbated the industry's plight. Sales fell from
67.6m in 1992 to 60.9m last year.
Imports have also been adding to Japanese manufacturers' woes. Although
imports fell about 5 per cent to slightly less than 14m units last year,
they nevertheless increased market share in a falling market.
In spite of the massive overcapacity, no Japanese manufacturers have closed
plants over the past 12 months. However, Mr Akira Suzuki, Jatma's executive
director, says extended maintenance periods have cut operating rates from
more than 90 per cent in 1992 to just over 80 per cent last year.
The leading Japanese manufacturers include Bridgestone, with about between
45 and 50 per cent of the market, Yokohama Rubber (about 20 per cent),
Sumitomo/Dunlop (about 20 per cent), Toyo Tire &amp; Rubber (about 10 per cent)
A sense of crisis has been created in the industry, not only because of the
drop in output, but also falling prices and shift in product mix as
consumers demand greater value for money. Bridgestone says the price
structure has been deteriorating quite quickly.
Most worrying for the industry has been the fundamental shift in consumer
attitudes in the replacement market. Whereas in the past Japanese consumers
almost unquestioningly bought the most expensive brands, this is no longer
the case.
'Consumer behaviour has changed very fast since the depression. Shoppers are
shopping around and brand loyalty has been weakened. This is very new for
the market,' says Mr Pierre Sivan, president of Nippon Goodyear. He explains
that Japanese consumers tend to buy four replacement tyres at a time and
that consumers no longer feel as obliged as they were to substitute the
original fit with the same brand.
New ranges of high-performance intermediate tyres have proved highly
successful over the past three or four years, according to Mr Sivan. These
have captured about 70 per cent of the high performance sector which
represents about 15 per cent of the entire passenger tyre market.
However, these intermediate tyres, which are between 10 per cent and 15 per
cent cheaper than the top-performance products, have not been immune from
price cuts. In January, when new lines were introduced, the new products
came in at the existing price, and the old products were further discounted
by about 10 per cent, says Mr Sivan.
Further evidence of the change in consumer attitudes is the rapid growth of
mass merchandisers such as Autobacs and Yellow Hat. These up-market stores,
which stock tyres, wheels and in-car entertainment systems, do not offer
significant discounts to traditional mom-and-pop shops, according to Mr
Sivan. However, they offer a huge product range against which small local
suppliers find it difficult to compete. 'These don't look like a place for
tyre-kickers,' explains Mr Sivan.
The growth of mass merchandisers has been swift. Estimates of their present
market share range from 15 per cent to 20 per cent, compared with only 7 per
cent five years ago.
The increasing concentration of distribution channels could help foreign
manufacturers such as Michelin and Goodyear, which have paltry market shares
given their size elsewhere.
First, manufacturers marketing to mass merchandisers do not require the huge
sales forces traditionally required to reach traditional tyre retailers.
Second, the merchandisers are beginning to develop their own brands which
could be manufactured by foreign groups.
'Non-Japanese companies have a window of opportunity in Japan that they have
not had for years,' says Mr Sivan. 'Most of the handicaps we have had have
not disappeared, but are nevertheless no longer as significant as they
were.'
The main disadvantage for foreign groups has been the absence of local
manufacturing, says Mr Sivan. But Japanese companies are now looking
increasingly at locating their own manufacturing elsewhere in Asia.
Japanese groups' manufacturing is being driven overseas by the rapid growth
of the consumer markets in Asia, the location of automotive manufacturing
there, and the low costs of operation. Labour costs, which represent about
50 per cent of manufacturing costs, are particularly less expensive outside
Japan. One manufacturer estimates the cost of labour in China is 1 per cent
of Japanese levels.
Bridgestone, Asia's largest producer, already has plants in Taiwan,
Indonesia and Thailand. It is opening a construction plant in Thailand that
should increase its local production by 35 per cent. The group is also in
the process of doubling capacity in Indonesia. The company says it is now
turning its attention to rapidly developing markets such as China, Vietnam
and India.
Mr Sivan at Goodyear says the opportunities in China are immense. But it is
important for western groups to be vigilant about Japan, which remains and
will remain Asia's most important market for many years.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Survey of World Tyre Industry (8): Where bicycles rule the
roads - China's huge potential is hampered by regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's tyre industry - designated a future cornerstone of the national
economy - is facing uncertain times.
It is at once a market offering huge potential - the number of cars per
person is one of the lowest in the world, at just 6.5 per head, and local
production is heavily bent towards the older bias tyres - and a market
hampered by the government's credit squeeze and measures to protect the
domestic industry.
The market is split in two - bicycle tyres, where demand is seen to be
flattening (although there are still around 38m to 40m bikes being made and
sold each year), and the burgeoning market for motor vehicles. Even
China-based tyre makers are starting to reduce their dependence on bicycle
tyres which offer only thin margins.
However, Mr Stephen Codron, executive director with Shenzhen China Bicycles,
reckons demand for two-wheeled vehicles will remain a feature of the
mainland market - albeit with 50cc motors attached. His company, which
churns out some 2.6m bikes a year, buys tyres from three manufacturers in
Guangdong province. Two of these are Taiwanese joint ventures.
The replacement tyre market is enormous, he says. 'Just look at the roads.
They are not up to the standards of the west and tyres are always bursting
so there is a great market for spares, especially in bicycle tyres.'
Car sales were among the first to crack when Beijing launched measures to
tighten credit in a bid to cool the economy. In August, 79,800 vehicles were
sold, 10,000 fewer than in July and 27,000 fewer than in June. Prices also
came tumbling down: by last October Santanas were going for little more than
Yn180,000 (USDollars 20,672), compared with Yn220,000 three months earlier.
Mr Frank Jiang, sales manager at General Motors Beijing office, said: 'Sales
are not very good at present, because of the effect of the crackdown on the
vehicle market.'
The group is assembling 2,000 vehicles a year in China for domestic usage.
However, potential demand for passenger cars in China is estimated to reach
1.2m units by 2000.
Of the foreign tyre producers, Bridgestone has the dominant market share in
Asia as a whole. China's own output of tyres is far lower than that in the
US, Japan, former USSR and South Korea.
According to Swiss Bank Corporation, total industrial output by the tyre
industry is around Yn25bn (USDollars 2.9bn). The ratio of the newer, more
technologically advanced radial tyres to bias tyre production is around 1:9.
Mr Lawrence Ang, China analyst with SBCI Finance Asia, says most of the
foreign auto tyre makers' participation in China is limited to technology
transfer arrangements with domestic counterparts.
He says that while Michelin and Goodyear have been searching for suitable
China partners for some time, only Pirelli is reported to have set up a
venture with Beijing Tyre Factory.
The only other active foreign investor in the industry is China Strategic
Investment (CSI), a Hong Kong-listed company specialising in asset trading,
which has invested in five tyre ventures - two of which were listed under
holding company China Tire on the New York Stock Exchange last year.
Foreign manufacturers without a China partner face crippling import duties
of up to 45 per cent in addition to a strict permit system, according to
SBC, and - thanks to the high accord placed on the sector by Beijing - this
is unlikely to diminish hugely even as China attempts to rejoin the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
Mr Ang said: 'China will do some things to reduce barriers, but what tends
to happen even in other countries is that joining GATT does not necessarily
mean a reduction in tariffs. It is not necessary to open up the whole market
to foreigners.
'Especially with the tyre and auto industry, which the government terms a
cornerstone industry, partly because of its military importance. They would
abolish the permit situation, but that does not mean that foreigners can
export tyres into China freely: other administrative measures will come into
force.'
He said it is a belief in this programme that is prompting foreign
manufacturers to tackle the market from a different angle, mainly by setting
up joint ventures.
In China, tyres are classed as one of the 29 strategically important
production materials and their production therefore receives considerable
attention and support from the government.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Survey of World Tyre Industry (9): Mini-market gets up and
goes - The Argentine industry which is growing fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina barely registers in the world tyre market. But, like other Latin
countries, its relatively small domestic market has shaken off decades of
torpor and begun growing at a rapid pace.
In the last three years domestic output has grown by a third, reaching 6.3m
units in 1993, with each of Argentina's four tyre companies holding about
one quarter of the market. Total sales, including imports, was worth Dollars
520m last year.
The industry's sudden expansion began soon after Mr Domingo Cavallo
announced early in 1991, just after his appointment as economy minister,
that he would make Argentina's peso convertible. This, plus aggressive tax
reduction, privatisation and liberalisation policies restored consumer
confidence and led to an explosion in demand for every conceivable product -
including cars and tyres.
The economy has expanded by one quarter since 1991 and Mr Cavallo is
predicting a further 6.5 per cent growth this year. The car industry is
hoping it can push sales to 500,000 units in 1994, an increase of almost 50
per cent over last year.
Few business people in Argentina think the economy can continue growing at
its present rate. However, tyre companies are optimistic that the fast
growth in car sales - which are projected to grow at an annual rate of 5-6
per cent to the end of the decade - will mean a steady growth rate for them
as well.
That is the good news. The bad news is that with the elimination of
once-impenetrable trade barriers, margins have narrowed, competition has
grown and costs remain stubbornly high.
This presents serious challenges for Fate SA, Argentina's only independent
tyre maker. It is competing not only with multinationals Firestone, Goodyear
and Pirelli but with increasingly aggressive exports from multinationals in
Brazil.
Argentina and Brazil, together with Uruguay and Paraguay, are setting up a
regional trade block called Mercosur that has already substantially reduced
trade barriers between the four.
This has allowed companies operating from the far larger Brazilian market to
attack the local market. Imports have grown by 40 per cent since 1991 to
capture almost one fifth of the market, with the Brazil-based multinationals
in the lead.
Privately-held Fate is fighting back by cutting jobs, reducing costs and
investing cautiously. Restructuring and import competition pushed it into
the red, and it only recently returned to profit. It lost Dollars 14m in
fiscal 1992, Dollars 7m in 1993 and this year hopes to earn Dollars 2-3m.
The long-term outlook naturally depends on the future health of the wider
economy. Companies expect growth to settle down to more sustainable rates
soon.
But businesses still complain of an uncompetitive exchange rate. They also
want the government to reduce high operating costs by reforming Argentina's
rigid labour laws and further reducing the corporate tax burden and
controlling the escalating cost of utilities and services that are less
exposed to imports.
It is hard to see how Argentina's tyre industry can survive in its present
shape. Four manufacturers seems too many and in the case of Fate, a wholly
family-held company, it is hard to see how it can survive in a market
dominated by giants.
The pace of trade integration with Brazil will be a vital factor in deciding
the industry's future. Argentine tyre companies are already narrowing their
range of products and meeting the market's needs with imports from Brazil
and further afield. By the same token, once the Brazilian market returns to
normality, negligible exports should pick up allowing Argentine companies to
gain economies of scale.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Survey of World Tyre Industry (6): Tradition takes a back
seat - The US industry has had to respond to new demands by shoppers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years, a simple philosophy guided the big US tyre makers: if your
product sells in Detroit, it will surely sell on Main Street. When the time
came to replace worn-out tyres, the reasoning went, car owners were most
likely to buy the brand chosen by the factory as original equipment.
Over the past few years, however, confidence in this passive approach to the
Dollars 18bn US replacement market has slipped. Shopping habits in the US
have changed, and the emphasis on value is stronger. 'For a lot of people, a
tyre is a tyre is a tyre,' says Mr David Garrity, an analyst with McDonald &amp;
Company Investments in New York.
The trend has forced some of the big tyre groups to sell their wares in
chain stores and warehouse clubs. It has changed distribution patterns in
other ways, too. Larger tyre outlets, which can offer lower prices, have
flourished, while mom-and-pop operations have consolidated or languished.
Paradoxically, consumers have shown a willingness to pay extra for air bags
and other optional equipment to enhance safety. That demand has encouraged
tyre groups to strengthen their brand images and intensify their research
and development programmes.
Goodyear, last of the big US-owned tyre groups and the north American leader
with Dollars 5.4bn in sales, has shown the most imagination in responding to
changes, analysts say.
The company broke with tradition in two crucial ways. It decided to offer
its products at Sears, Wal-Mart and other big chains, putting them in direct
competition with its network of 3,500 company-owned stores and independent
dealerships.
Second, Goodyear decided to forgo tradition and introduce its new Aquatred
tyre directly in the retail market. Its bet that consumers would be willing
to pay a premium price for Aquatred's safety features paid off handsomely
last year.
US operating income, excluding special items, climbed by more than 10 per
cent to Dollars 590.5m, while operating margins jumped to 10 per cent of
sales, from 6 per cent in 1991. The improvement comes at a time when
foreign-owned rivals are under pressure to boost market share by cutting
prices to the bone.
With prices down, Goodyear has succeeded in lowering its costs through
'controlled downsizing', says Mr Garrity. By reducing manpower and its debt
burden, the company has had the wherewithal to invest in the marketing and
research aspects of the business.
The other big tyre groups - Uniroyal Goodrich (owned by Michelin),
Bridgestone/Firestone and Continental/General - have been at a financial and
competitive disadvantage because they have been struggling to integrate
their operations since the big consolidation a few years ago.
Those difficulties are apparent at Michelin. The French parent, hit by its
exposure to the depressed European market, has accelerated its effort to
wrest concessions from unionised workers at its Uniroyal plants.
Despite its advantages, Goodyear was not the only group to show improvement
in the replacement market. Mr Saul Ludwig, an analyst at Roulston Research
in Cleveland, reckons that Bridgestone/Firestone finished the year with the
best gain, followed by Goodyear. He credits a long-overdue decision by the
Japanese-owned group to promote the Firestone brand name, one of the
country's oldest, after vacillating over the issue since acquiring the US
operation in the late 1980s.
Nevertheless, competitive shifts in the tyre business are neither sweeping
nor easy to quantify. 'It is very difficult to get cold, accurate data on
the foreign-owned companies,' says Mr Gary McManus, of Kemper Securities in
Chicago. He estimates that Goodyear, Michelin (including Uniroyal) and
Bridgestone each commands 20 to 25 per cent of the replacement market.
Part of the reason competition is so keen is that the replacement side is 'a
zero-growth game', as Mr Ludwig describes it. Sales to customers replacing
worn-out treads showed almost no growth last year. The stagnation reflected
comparisons with a usually robust 1992, when the market expanded by about 3
per cent. High inventories carried over by retailers further restrained
growth. With the excess drying up, Mr Ludwig predicts a sharp 4 per cent
gain in 1994 on the replacement side.
Although a bit less glamorous, the Detroit trade remains the tyre industry's
bread and butter business, and 1993 was a year of feasting. After a long
slump, the Big Three US car makers have enjoyed a remarkable upturn, and the
companies supplying them have tagged along for the ride.
In 1993, US sales of so-called original equipment tyres - fitted on cars and
trucks during their assembly - surged 14.7 per cent, according to Mr
Garrity. In parallel with the cyclical trend in motor vehicle production,
the jump in original equipment (OE) sales represents an acceleration of a
tentative recovery which began the previous year, following a three-year
downturn which hit bottom in 1991.
In the OE market, a tyre maker's fortunes rise and fall with the performance
of the particular carmakers it supplies. With automakers ordering parts from
fewer sources, a few big tyre groups have tightened their grip on a segment
in which prices have stabilised. Goodyear was a winner on this side of the
business, largely because it supplies Chrysler - star of the car industry -
with 84 per cent of its tyres, according to Modern Tire Dealer.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Survey of World Tyre Industry (5): Pressure still high -
Problems facing European manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's tyre industry will look back on the early 1990s as one of the most
difficult periods in its history, according to Mr Carlo Banchieri,
deputy-chairman of Pirelli Tyre Holding. Market conditions and pressures on
profit margins are certainly the toughest that he can recall in some 30
years spent in the industry.
Mr Banchieri's sentiments are echoed among executives of other leading
European tyre groups, who see little prospect of the pressures easing in
1994. 'Anyone looking for a place to rest is making a terrible mistake,'
says Mr Bill Sharp, president and general manager of Goodyear's European
operations. 'This has become an industry where there is no finish line.'
Since the late 1980s, intensive efforts have resulted in slashed costs and
increased efficiency, under pressure from vehicle makers, themselves
desperate to reduce costs. They have been seemingly bent on paring the tyre
industry's margins on original equipment supplies to the bone. 'We are
requested to assure price reductions for one, two, three years in a brutal
way. And the tools with which cost reductions can be achieved have already
been used,' says Mr Banchieri.
If there is some consolation, he suggests, it is that there is emerging a
greater sense of understanding of each other's problems between vehicle and
tyre makers which bodes well for the future once the present near-crisis in
Europe's motor industry is past. 'The transparency between the motor
industry and us as suppliers is much greater than in the past.'
Little more than 12 months ago, almost the entire European industry, already
much slimmed down since 1990, thought its problems were ending and that the
region would make a steady recovery from recession. Instead, with the
exception of the UK Europe's vehicles markets underwent their steepest
collapse since the second world war.
New car sales finished 1993 nearly 15 per cent lower than in the previous
year; truck sales fell by nearly 30 per cent. And as some of the threads of
the European monetary system unravelled, so did the industry's hopes of
establishing stable pan-European pricing and manufacturing policies.
Inevitably, the collapse of demand in the original equipment sector has
served to increase price competition in the numerically much larger
replacement tyre market, where margins are typically higher. It is in this
replacement market that most of the industry's profits are made. Thus the
industry's partially successful efforts to raise replacement market prices
in 1992 have been largely negated, and it has only recently begun to try
again. It is not, however, looking to any substantial market growth this
year.
Michelin, Goodyear and Pirelli all believe that the decline in vehicle sales
has halted - borne out by slightly higher sales in January - but that any
upturn this year will be small. Truck sales may grow by as much as 7-8 per
cent after last year's precipitous drop, says Goodyear's Mr Sharp, but car
sales are unlikely to rise by more than two or three per cent.
Against this background, the industry is operating at only around 80 per
cent of capacity in Europe, even after a number of rationalisations and
cutbacks by all the leading participants.
Adding to its worries are the growing level of cheap imports from outside
western Europe, mainly from Asia and eastern Europe. These now account for
about 25 per cent of Europe's total 215m units a year tyre market - up from
around 15 per cent a few years ago, and underline the industry's concern
about the relatively high total labour costs of producing in Europe when EU
'Social Chapter' provisions are included. Nevertheless, 'we can't wait for
someone else to fix our problems', says Goodyear's Mr Sharp.
Thus the past year has seen Goodyear rationalise heavily within Europe,
closing its Brussels headquarters, moving its core management team back to
the parent HQ in Akron, Ohio, and other key 'hands-on' staff to its
principal technical centre and manufacturing operations in Colmar-Berg,
Luxembourg. One plant near Heidelberg has also been closed. Michelin,
Europe's market leader, is in the middle of a big drive to take FFr3.5bn
(Dollars 580m) out of its costs by the end of this year, involving job cuts
totalling nearly 6,000 at plants in Europe. This follows a FFr3bn
cost-cutting programme in 1991 and 92.  Michelin executives say these
actions are helping lift productivity by around 5 per cent a year.
Continental, the big German tyre maker, has its tyre manufacturing well
spread around Europe and thus has not been too hard hit by the relative
strength of the D-Mark and Germany's now notoriously high labour costs.
Corporate strategy is to continue to concentrate Continental's premier tyre
development and manufacturing inside Germany, but to take advantage of lower
production cost plants elsewhere in Europe for more mass market products.
Even so, more than 2,000 jobs went last year and its tyre distribution
operations have been heavily rationalised. Pirelli, still feeling the
lingering effects of its attempted takeover of Continental, has closed
plants in Italy and Greece, and cut back manufacturing operations in the UK.
However, the situation is far from one of unrelieved gloom.
Messrs Banchieri, Sharp and others in the industry maintain that a flurry of
new products is offering the potential for higher margins in the replacement
market, and that some at least of the price increases likely to be
introduced this year can be made to stick.
Much of the new product, such as Goodyear's Aquatred rain tyres and
Pirelli's P5000 Vizzola, is pitched at premium aftermarket sectors, where
private customers are prepared to pay extra for specific performance
attributes.
But there is also a concerted drive by the big participants to compete more
effectively in the cheaper sector of the market under increasing threat from
imports.
Thus there is increasing use of second or third tier brand names owned by
the majors, and which can be sold more cheaply without devaluing the
'flagship' brand's image. Thus Pirelli, for example, is using its Ceat and
Courier labels to broaden its market presence, while Michelin has introduced
Tiremaster and Goodyear is making greater use of its Lee and Kelly brand
names.
Taken together, the various actions are expected to sustain the European
industry in its present shape, with no more significant mergers or
acquisitions, over the next difficult two years.
After that, industry leaders see some of the pressures easing and capacity
utilisation much improved. 'Three years out from now, there should be a good
balance,' concludes Goodyear's Mr Sharp.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Survey of World Tyre Industry (3): Black is taking on a
grey-green hue - New compound promises significant saving in fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Tyres are not only round and black, they are turning green.
For an industry fighting fiercely for competitive advantage in every product
area, the arrival of the 'green' tyre - defined by its performance not its
actual colour - is being viewed as one of the most significant developments
since the advent of radial tyres to replace the cross-ply.
Using silica in its compound instead of the traditional carbon black, it
offers the advantage of significantly less rolling resistance than a
conventional tyre without compromising the very high levels of grip and
handling which modern tyres achieve.
Michelin, which is already producing such tyres, estimates that if the EU
car population switched to green tyres, total EU car fuel consumption would
fall by 5 per cent, or well over 1bn gallons, a year. This is based on a
reduction in rolling resistance of 30-35 per cent for the silica-based
tyres, so dramatic is the difference.
Such tyres are a particularly important development for North America, where
car makers have to meet minimum fuel economy standards for their vehicle
ranges - the Cafe (corporate average fuel economy) rules.
Whereas big companies such as Ford and General Motors can balance their
fuel-slurping big cars like Lincolns and Cadillacs against their small
economy cars to meet the required average, companies specialising in the
large executive and luxury sectors find the Cafe rules much harder to meet.
Failure to do so requires sometimes substantial financial penalties.
The 'green' tyres are, therefore, a boon to companies such as Jaguar,
Mercedes, BMW and Rolls-Royce - and Mercedes is specifying the new tyres
across most of its North American range.
A key element of the 'green' tyre's attractiveness is that the silica allows
it to retain good wet-weather performance, traditionally one of the big
stumbling blocks of previous attempts to make low rolling resistance with
materials other than carbon black.
'It might not be as big an innovation as radial tyres 30 years ago but there
is no question that green tyres are important', says Pirelli's
deputy-chairman, Carlo Banchieri. However, Pirelli does not see a complete
conversion to green tyres overnight.
There are two reasons:
One is that, even more than with most other conventional tyres, the 'green'
tyre needs to be developed with the new car for which it is intended, so
that its ride and handling behaviour complements that particular model's
weight distribution, suspension characteristics and other factors. 'Green'
tyres do not, therefore, lend themselves to simple wholesale substitution on
all manufacturers' model ranges.
The other is that large-scale production of such tyres requires significant
re-engineering of manufacturing plant and equipment to take account of the
differing characteristics of silica from carbon black.
However, as an interim step Michelin, Pirelli and others also see good
market prospects for what the industry is coming to call 'grey-green' tyres.
These still reduce rolling resistance by 15-20 per cent compared with
conventional tyres. But the concentration of silica is not sufficient to
require any significant revision to production equipment.
'Grey-green' tyres are, therefore, likely to be the first high-volume
applications of the technology with the leading tyre makers likely to devote
growing capacity to them over the next few years.
Following the industry's rule-of-thumb formula that each 6 per cent
reduction in rolling resistance yields 1 per cent improvement in fuel
consumption, there is the potential for an individual car to travel 3-4 per
cent further for every gallon of fuel consumed and a potential gross fuel
saving within Europe of at least 500m gallons a year.
There remains, however, a good deal of caution in the industry about how
widely such tyres might be accepted in the replacement market, which is
nearly twice as big as that for original equipment and which offers bigger
profit margins than the wafer-thin ones between vehicle makers and their
tyre suppliers. They are likely to cost 10-15 per cent more than
conventional tyres, at least until substantial economies of scale can be
achieved.
Even though this is certain to be recouped over the life of the tyre,
nevertheless this is accepted as a deterrent for many motorists who regard
tyres as mainly a distress purchase.
Even so, the next 12 months are likely to see capacity coming on stream for
'green' and grey-green' tyres at all the leading tyre makers. In Europe,
most of the output will be for the small and medium cars sector, with Fiat,
Peugeot and Rover Group expected to be early users.
Although such tyres have a long way still to go in development terms before
their full capabilities are realised, in five years' time it is likely that
'grey-green' tyres at least will be approaching the status of standard
fitment.
However, it does not necessarily mean the demise of the carbon black supply
industry. Already carbon black suppliers have begun a fight-back, seeking
formulations to lower their own product's rolling resistance.
Tyre makers are content that the silica and carbon black factions should
fight it out, seeing only further technology benefits accrue.
The 'green' tyre is being developed against the background of continuing
fragmentation of car and truck markets. Like the vehicle makers, says
Goodyear's European president, Bill Sharp, any tyre maker wishing to remain
a long term, powerful presence must also have the resources to make a wider
variety of products, to make them viably in ever smaller batches and to
replace them more frequently.
To this variety imposed by the vehicle makers, however, is that created by
the tyre makers themselves in search of that extra technical edge over
rivals that might lead to extra market share or might merit a price premium.
One such development is the premium rain tyre also designed to provide high
performance on dry roads - Goodyear, with its Aquatred, and Germany's
Continental with its Aqua Contact design. The tyres have in common a deep
central groove so that in cross-section it appears to be two narrow tyres
side by side. Continental maintains that the design improves the ability to
disperse water - and thus prevent dangerous aquaplaning - by about 20 per
cent compared with conventional tyres.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Survey of World Tyre Industry (4): A spectacular leap
forward - John Griffiths discusses a revolution in manufacturing technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A revolution in tyre manufacturing technology, the seeds of which were sown
in the mid-1980s, is gaining momentum.
Purely in terms of technical capability, the industry's leading companies
are approaching the point where they could automate their tyre-making
processes to something approaching 'lights out' levels, at least for
mainstream products such as popular replacement market car tyre sizes
produced in long runs with relatively little variation in specification.
This represents a spectacular leap forward for an industry where, for most
of its history, successful automation has proved elusive.
Right up to the mid-1980s the laminating and completion of each carcass was
carried out manually even though parts of the processes involved were
progressively automated, such as the feeding from reels of the various
laminates which provide both strength and the bed for the tread,
That the new technologies and processes which have been appearing since the
late 1980s - and which appear to have been taken a quantum step further at a
flagship plant at Michelin's Clermont-Ferrand headquarters  - will not
immediately sweep all before them appears to be largely due to commercial
rather than technological factors.
The massive wave of investment in new facilities and capacity made by the
industry during the eight-year motor industry boom until 1990, and which
totalled several billion dollars, will take a long time to be amortised. So
investment in the 'revolutionary' processes can only be progressive.
Michelin executives, who in the past couple of years have cast off part at
least of the shroud of secrecy which has covered the activities of the
world's biggest tyre maker, maintain that a quantum leap really is at hand.
The Clermont-Ferrand plant, which went on stream in January, occupies only
about one-tenth the space of a conventional tyre-making facility. Precise
details are far from clear, including its capacity, but there has been an
industry rush for the patents Michelin has taken out on the processes.
One key ingredient is dispensing with the previous necessity - and all the
plant and equipment - to make a number of individual components of the tyre
in semi-finished form away from the actual assembly site. It is this which
accounts primarily for the substantial space-saving, and which may have
almost as profound consequences in terms of process energy-saving.
The actual tyre-building uses a rotating drum system on which the carcass is
laid from plies fed automatically from stock drums, which can be tracked
above the rotating embryo carcass to ensure the right ply is laid in the
correct position.
Called the C3M system, for reasons also not entirely clear, one of its most
valued attributes is its flexibility. With the tyre market fragmenting into
ever greater varieties of tyres, in proliferating sizes, and with product
life cycles coming down from a decade to closer to five years as competition
intensifies, such flexibility is likely to prove decisive in terms of
competitive advantage in the medium term. According to one executive, 'it
just about eliminates work in progress and can switch from one tyre to
another in a heart beat'.
The ramifications are not lost on Michelin's work force, which has fallen
from a world total of 140,000 at the start of the 1990s to 125,000 now, with
more job losses to come.
The new facility employs just 50 people. Although its output is unknown, the
effectiveness of the technology is such that Michelin is looking very hard
indeed at the implications for employees. 'There is a social concern to this
which must be addressed,' observes one executive. 'Some have described
Michelin as the biggest mama's and papa's shop in the world and we have to
take account of employees' interests in phasing this in.'
The apparent production breakthrough, however, has not thrown the fear into
the rest of the industry that an outside observer might expect.
Michelin's principal rivals maintain they, too, will be able to introduce
appropriate new technology as and when they deem it commercially viable.
'All the majors have been very focused on this area,' says Mr Bill Sharp,
president and general manager of Goodyear's European operations. 'It is more
a question of how quickly it is phased in in view of the very significant
capital expenditure involved.'
Pirelli's deputy-chairman, Mr Carlo Banchieri, takes a similar view. 'As for
revolution - it's difficult to give a precise answer. Capacity investments
in the 1980s' boom were huge. Today, when the industry is operating at
around 70 per cent of capacity, it is difficult to justify totally new plant
which would also require further large amounts of research and development.
If I were a shareholder I would not be very happy unless the returns were
very good. In three, four, five years' time more flexible systems will exist
and we are working on them; but they will have to be in tandem with existing
automation.'
The Michelin innovation might be regarded as the fourth generation of the
automation systems which have been introduced to the industry since the late
1980s.
Pirelli itself was widely regarded as a front-runner with what can now be
regarded as third generation technology introduced at its Bollate plant near
Milan in 1989.
Now closely replicated at its Breuberg facility in Germany, the system
incorporates a 100-metre long assembly line traversed by the building drum,
with the tyres' individual components applied automatically. At the end of
the line the collapsible drum returns to start another cycle by means of an
underground conveyor. It is a system, maintains Mr Banchieri which, 'with
minor improvements and adaptations we can be very competitive'.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Survey of World Tyre Industry (2): Giving new life to rubber
dumps - John Griffiths discusses ways of reducing the growing mountain of
scrap tyres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The global pile of several billion worn-out tyres is growing day by day and
is fast becoming an environmental problem of significant dimensions.
If these tyres lie around long enough, they can leech a variety of
contaminants into the soil and eventually into water supplies. Occasionally,
tyre dumps catch fire. And when they do, they can be almost impossible to
put out. One in Wales is still burning after eight years.
Dumped tyres also represent a profligate waste of natural resources, for two
main reasons. One is that, provided it has not been damaged in use, the
complicated, stress-bearing carcass which forms the heart of a tyre usually
remains sound even if the tread has worn away. The other is that the
oil-based nature of the various tread compounds and fabrics represents a
potentially valuable energy source, or raw material for other uses.
An increasing amount of attention is thus being focused on ways to minimise
this waste. One obvious route is to make tyres last longer, resulting in
fewer tyres being produced. Thirty years ago the tyre industry virtuously
shot itself in the foot by introducing radial tyres which overnight doubled
the average tyre's life to around 40,000 miles. Today, leading participants
in the industry are using an 80,000-mile guarantee as a marketing tool.
But vehicle population continues to rise, so recycling in one form or
another is an increasingly unavoidable necessity.
At present, around 15 per cent of car tyres are retreaded, and returned for
sale in the cheapest sectors of the replacement market, although this figure
can vary widely from country to country. This figure is much lower than that
for truck tyres, more than half of which are retreaded.
In Brussels, the European Commission is seeking to increase the proportion
of car tyres retreaded to around 30 per cent. Achieving this, according to
industry estimates, would reduce by around 60m gallons the quantity of crude
oil used in production each year.
At that level of retreading, it is likely that the leading tyre makers would
become more interested in establishing more substantive 'in-house'
retreading operations. At present the big tyre makers undertake these
activities on a relatively small scale. Retreading has traditionally
provided business opportunities for small, independent companies.
The perception in the minds of many consumers that retreaded tyres might be
of suspect quality and performance has become outdated since strict quality
standards were imposed. Indeed, the UK's Durham-based Colway Tyres, which
retreads around 1m of the 4m discarded tyres it collects each year, is
actively using high performance as a promotional weapon. It has moved into
the highest speed-rated H and V tyre sectors, carved a unique niche as a
rally tyre supplier and recently has been approved as a supplier for junior
single-seat racing cars.
According to Mr Bob Bonomy, Colway's managing director, each retreaded tyre
represents a production saving of up to four gallons of crude oil compared
with a new tyre.
Colway's own output indicates the dimensions of the recycling problem. It
rejects three casings for every one remoulded, which means that 'finding new
ways of recycling scrap tyres not suitable for remoulding has become part of
our corporate strategy'.
One answer is the collaborative venture Colway has developed with Duralay, a
subsidiary of motor components and engineering group BBA. A tyre-shredding
and storage facility next to the remoulding plant turns the rubber into
'crumb' which Duralay makes into carpet underlay. However, since there is no
prospect of carpeting much of the earth's land mass, Mr Bonomy stresses that
underlay can only be a small part of the solution.
Another potential solution is to use the 'crumb' in large-scale enterprises
such as road construction. Inclusion of about 15 per cent 'crumb' in asphalt
would increase the life of a road surface by 15 to 22 years. The snag is
that the cost of the asphalt rises by 50 per cent to 100 per cent. However,
the picture might improve if Europe were to follow the example in some
states of the US which have legislated 'crumb' must be used to improve
drainage and skid resistance.
None of these solutions, however, has as much potential as the idea of
providing a power source from incineration of tyres.
Such a prospect is not as noxious as it sounds in terms of air quality, and
late last year a landmark was reached when Elm Energy, a US joint venture,
was granted permission to open Europe's first tyre-incineration power
station in the UK.
The Wolverhampton facility burns at a temperature of 950 degrees C tyres
which, on average, contain the energy equivalent of 12 cu m of natural gas.
The closed incineration system, already in use in North America, means that
virtually no gaseous pollutants escape.
Elm Energy - formed by Nipsco, an Indiana utility group, and the Performance
Service Corporation of Connecticut - claims it can consume around 5m of the
UK's 25m tyres scrapped annually.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Survey of World Tyre Industry (1): Deflated, not punctured -
Out of the black, into the red. That is the picture painted by the financial
results of some of the world's leading tyre makers. But amid this gloom,
John Griffiths finds some comfort, as the industry prepares for a revolution
in manufacturing techniques

<TEXT>
Tyres, often described dismissively as small, round and black, are made by
an industry which is big - nearly Dollars 55bn turnover last year - global
and at present streaked with red.
Some 15 months ago the world's six biggest tyre makers, who between them
control nearly 80 per cent of all sales, thought they were about to be
compensated for recession-induced job cuts and other painful restructuring.
They expected recovery to take firm root, and to reap profits from their
leaner operations as vehicle sales expanded and consumer confidence rose in
the important replacement tyre sector.
Instead, sales in North America, the world's biggest tyre market, have
remained flat. In western Europe, the second biggest market, new car sales
last year suffered their steepest decline since the second world war,
plunging by more than 14 per cent. The truck market fared even worse, down
28 per cent.
Latin America proved a bright spot as a result of expansion in Brazil, and
parts of the Asia-Pacific region continued their strong growth (from a small
base). But with Japan and its motor industry also in the doldrums, overall
conditions last year should have provided little to cheer about for the tyre
makers.
When the full roll call of financial results becomes available over the next
few weeks, they will show that for most of the big manufacturers profits
either fell sharply again or there was a descent back into red ink.
The notable exception was Goodyear Tire and Rubber, demoted from first to
third in the world league table of producers, but still the clear market
leader in North America.
Goodyear dipped into losses for the first time in many years at the start of
the 1990s. But the ensuing restructuring throughout its operations left it
leaner and fitter to take advantage of the considerable upturn in original
equipment and replacement market business which did take place in North
America at least in 1992.
Meanwhile, incoming chairman Stanley Gault was quick to dismantle some of
the ossified Goodyear retailing and distribution structures in North
America. The dedicated Goodyear brand outlets which had long formed the
backbone of Goodyear's replacement market sales in North America were opened
to competition from Goodyear's second-tier brands like Kelly-Springfield,
and a determined pitch made to supply the 'own brand' market of big
independent retailing chains such as Sears Roebuck. Partly as a result of
this, Mr Gault was able to report last month increased market share inside
North America and worldwide tyre sales for the company up 4.2 per cent over
the whole year.
Goodyear's results continued to be helped by disposals of non-core
businesses and the activities of non-tyre subsidiaries. Nevertheless, income
before extraordinary items and accounting changes was up 33.1 per cent to
Dollars 488.7m, the second highest in the company's history. More
importantly, operating margins continued to improve, particularly in the
final quarter.
That, at least, bodes well for the industry as the other big players seek to
repair ravaged profit and loss accounts. Groupe Michelin of France, now the
clear world market leader following its acquisition of Uniroyal Goodrich of
the US several years ago, is expected to show very substantial losses for
1993 after reporting a net interim loss of just over Dollars 600m.
However, such a gloomy figure reflects not terminal decline but the very
radical restructuring Michelin has undergone - at high short-term cost - in
order to knock itself into more efficient shape for when recovery does set
in.
Indeed, analysts believe that so much cost has already been taken out of the
business that Michelin will move quickly back into substantial profit this
year even in the absence of significant market growth.
In just over two years some 15,000 jobs have been lost world-wide. The
company is in the middle of a FFr3.5bn (Dollars 580m) cost-cutting programme
on top of a similar, FFr3bn exercise during 1991 and 1992. Not surprisingly,
the treatment of these exercises as extraordinary provisions has made profit
and loss accounts look grim, with some Dollars 460m included in 1993's first
half results.
Nevertheless, 'we are confident that we can reorganise the business so that
when real recovery occurs in Europe or the US we will be in a position to
take good advantage of it', said one senior Michelin executive. 'By the end
of 1994 we don't exactly expect the situation to be wonderful but the
assimilation and restructuring of Uniroyal Goodrich should have been
completed and we can go for growth.'
Bridgestone of Japan, whose purchase of Firestone of the US in the late
1980s swept it into second place in the world rankings ahead of Goodyear,
has also had a great deal of difficulty absorbing its large acquisition, and
its problems have been increased substantially by the steep downturn in
vehicle and tyre markets in Japan, and the inexorable rise in the value of
the yen.
As a consequence, profits tumbled by more than 50 per cent in the first half
of last year and the full-year figures are expected to show little
improvement.
A similar story of declining profitability can be found at Continental, hit,
like Pirelli, particularly hard by the collapse of vehicle sales in its
European heartland.
Unlike Pirelli, however, Conti is at least clinging to profitability,
whereas the Amsterdam-based Pirelli Tyre Holding is still seeking to stem
the losses arising from its own heavy restructuring, which has included the
closure of plants in Italy and Greece and redistribution of its tyre-making
activities. These include the end of car tyre manufacturing at
Burton-on-Trent in the UK, which is becoming one of three European centres
for truck tyre manufacturing.
Both Continental and Pirelli still bear faint signs of the bruising received
during Pirelli's 1992 abortive takeover attempt of the German tyre maker.
The failure of the takeover bid means, in the view of some analysts, that
the concentration process which has gone on among the industry's principal
companies for much of the past decade - and which has now led to its
domination by just a handful of global corporations - is over, barring some
unforeseen new crisis.
Competitive pressures have no prospect of receding, however. The big western
and Japanese producers are facing rivalry at the cheaper end of the market
from developing Asian producers outside Japan such as Hankook and Kumho of
South Korea, as well as East European companies looking outwards once more
after the collapse of Communism. Among the latter the respected European
Rubber Journal ranks Slovenia's Sava Kranj 32nd in its 'top 50' list of the
world's principal tyre makers, with the Czech Republic's Barum Holding not
far behind in 35th.
Most of their challenge is directed at the replacement market, which
accounts for 70 per cent of total world sales and which provides most of the
industry's profitability.
Equally, as the economies and vehicle populations of these regions rise,
they also offer the prospect of growth for competitive western producers
successful in establishing a manufacturing presence, or creating joint
ventures and technology transfers. Nearer to Europe, Turkey is also poised
for substantial growth and hardly a leading tyre maker is not expanding
capacity there.
Not least there is China, with its more than 1bn people and vehicle markets
which have barely been tapped. It is primarily a truck market, with
production consisting mainly of old-technology truck cross-ply tyres. But
Pirelli recently signed a letter of intent for a joint venture to produce
car tyres near Beijing, and other rivals are establishing or seeking to
establish an early foothold in such a potentially giant market. Indicative
of the potential, sales of vehicle and agricultural tyres totalled 42m last
year, out of world total tyre sales of 848m. The story is similar in eastern
Europe, which absorbed only 37m tyres last year.
With the industry overall operating at less than 80 per cent of total
capacity, it is clearly in no position to impose significant price increases
in either the original equipment or replacement sectors.
But there are a number of positive factors. North America now looks poised
for steady if unspectacular growth. And when recovery in Continental Europe
and Japan does set in, the sharply lowered cost bases of the leading players
should indeed allow them to benefit swiftly in terms of profitability.
That process should be helped further by revolutionary new, flexible
automation being introduced to manufacturing processes which will increase
productivity and, in the long term, should further drive down costs.
Efficiency improvements in the retailing and distribution chains of the
leaders are also helping volume sales and margins, while the aggressive use
of second and third tier brands owned by the principal tyre makers, such as
Pirelli's Ceat and Courier, Michelin's Kleber and Continental's Semperit, is
helping them more adequately to cover all sectors of the market.
The introduction of some premium sector tyres, with either very high
performance or fuel economy-boosting 'green' tyres is also having a positive
effect on the margins of their manufacturers.
Meanwhile, at least some - but by no means all - of the price increases
sought for the replacement market show signs of sticking.
And some of the leading players even see signs of hope for their original
equipment business. Margins are traditionally wafer thin in this sector.
Vehicle makers are in a position to drive a hard bargain because it is
worthwhile for a tyre maker to accept lower margins on original equipment,
as once its brand is on a new car it is likely to be fitted subsequently
throughout the life of the vehicle.
However, partnerships are gradually supplanting the old adversarial
relationship between vehicle makers and all their suppliers. 'In the last
few months the car makers appear to be beginning to understand our problems
and that we must have profits, too, if we are to develop together as
technical partners', according to one senior European tyre executive.

FT  04 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke fails to please
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A slashed dividend, hefty provisions, a rising tax charge and big
write-downs from Ladbroke came at the bottom end of pessimistic market
expectations and the shares fell 10 to 199p, with turnover hitting a very
heavy 27m.
The dividend cut, a surprisingly large 46 per cent, was the first in the
company's history, as the new management moved to spruce up the group's
image among the investment community. Most agreed they achieved this, and
analysts welcomed the company's new visibility, with financial and strategic
details forthcoming as never before.
However, some of the old trading worries remained. Texas, the company's home
improvement division, produced a fall in profits and prompted a large
provision. Some analysts expressed concern that the troubled sector would
continue to drag on the group's finances.
There were fresh worries over the impact of the National Lottery on
Ladbroke's betting business. Write-downs hit the property and hotel arms,
with questions also being asked about the future of the UK hotel division.
Ms Julie Farrar at Credit Lyonnais Laing said: 'What the new management has
revealed is that the recovery is going to be longer than expected. The stock
is fully valued at these levels.' Others disagreed, pointing out that the
stock has been one of the FT-SE's best performers in 1994, and that with all
the bad news now out of the way the shares are well placed for the longer
term.
Results in line with expectations saw Zeneca trade sideways before
succumbing to the market trend and the shares slipped 3 to 763p. Profits
rose 42 per cent to Pounds 627m, which was underpinned by good volume
growth.
Mr Peter Laing at Salomon Brothers said that, in spite of relatively slow
earnings growth, the group should benefit from new drugs due to come into
the market over the next three years. 'It is not a stock to sell at this
price,' he added.
The paper and packaging area of the market provided two outstanding
performers in Bunzl and David S. Smith, both of which responded to strong
buy recommendations published by stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Laing and
Gerrard Vivian Grey.
Credit Lyonnais pinpointed both stocks as its best buys in the sector,
saying that the recovery in the paper cycle could continue for five years.
CLL focused on a favourable outlook for costs and said the earnings recovery
potential of companies directly exposed to fluctuations in pulp and paper
prices is far greater than for raw material converters.
News of the US acquisitions also helped Bunzl shares, which settled 4 ahead
at 171p after turnover of 2.8m. David S. Smith closed 7 better at 499p.
Financial sectors of the market continued to reflect concerns that some of
the big international trading houses have suffered substantial losses via
the bond and equity markets in recent weeks.
The UK merchant banks remained under heavy pressure throughout the trading
session, with SG Warburg, widely regarded as the UK's premier securities
house, again roughly handled by marketmakers and finally a further 27 lower
at 827p, after 823p. Over the last two trading sessions Warburg shares have
fallen 61p, or 6.9 per cent.
Schroders non-voting shares gave up 23 more to 1090p, still unsettled by
fears that the merchant bank may drop out of the FT-SE 100 Index foll-owing
next week's meeting of the FT-SE 100 steering comm-ittee.
Among other merchant banks, Close Brothers, badly affected by the recent
steep slide in markets, fell 17 more to 438p. Kleinwort Benson, regarded as
one of the most successful trading houses during the upsurge in markets late
last year, retreated 12 to 538p and Hambros lost 8 to 370p. Smith New Court,
the big marketmaking firm, dipped 8 more to 394p.
The big UK clearing banks endured another tough trading session, but closed
above the day's lowest levels. TSB was the sector's best performer, ending 3
1/2 higher at 243p. Abbey National finished unchanged at 490p, sustained by
the news that UK house prices rose by 2.2 per cent during February, the
biggest monthly gain since 1988, according to the Halifax Building Society.
Barclays dropped 11 to 518p, Lloyds 7 to 576p and National Westminster 6 to
483p.
Shares in Serco, which reported bumper profits earlier this week, put on
another 20 at 1470p as the market continued to appreciate the figures.
Smiths Industries advanced 8 to 489p after SG Warburg recommended the stock,
while engineering group Siebe bounced 12 to 607p ahead of today's
presentation to both analysts and institutions at SG Warburg. Further
reflection on GKN's figures reported on Wednesday saw the shares jump 11 to
547p.
The Pounds 25m disposal of assets and businesses in BBA's industrial
materials activities helped the shares close 2 ahead at 216p. One market
watcher said: 'The group is highly geared and any reduction of gearing is to
be welcomed.'
Shares in photocopier leasing group Southern Business retreated 3 to 95p
after Danka Business denied recent market speculation that it was in talks
to acquire Southern. The latter's shares bounced 7 to 369p on the statement.
A trade press report that J. Sainsbury was restructuring its middle
management concurred with analysts' growing belief that the leading
supermarket groups are knuckling down to cutting costs in the face of
continuing margin pressure. The shares moved forward 5 to 367p. Tesco was
steady at 226p and Kwik Save added 12 at 604p.
In a firm drinks sector, domestic brewers were led by Wolverhampton &amp;
Dudley, which forged ahead 23 to 517p, inspired by a director's share
purchase the day before. There was further takeover talk surrounding
Merrydown, the cider group, the shares appreciating 5 to 155p.
British Petroleum managed a net gain of 3 1/2 at 356p after volume of 9.2m
shares. The exploration and production stocks were good performers all day,
with Enterprise Oil finishing 6 better at 437p and Lasmo 2 1/2 higher at
129p.
Shares in British Airways moved 3 ahead to 440p after cargo traffic figures
for the month of February showed a 10.5 per cent year-on-year increase.
After a strong advance in recent sessions, BAA succumbed to profit-taking
and the shares lost 13 to 1002p in active trade of 2m.
Epwin Group, which produces PVC windows and doors, was one of the strongest
performers among the second liners after announcing a 51 per cent rise in
preliminary profits and a good increase in the dividend. At the close the
shares were 17 higher at 317p.
The story that house prices had risen sharply during February prompted early
strength in housebuilders, but this quickly petered out as the market came
under pressure.

Stock index futures rallied strongly in late trading, pulling the underlying
cash market higher after a volatile session in which dealers continued to
watch developments in the bond market, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March futures contract on the FT-SE 100 opened weakly at 3,250, selling
from one of the large US houses being held largely responsible. At the day's
low point, the contract was trading at 3,201, and at a large discount to
cash.
However, short-covering led by independent traders brought a recovery, as
did the firmness in European markets and encouraging US economic data. March
closed at 3,233, an 8-point discount to cash, after volume of 17,233
contracts.
Turnover in the Liffe traded options fell back to 41,832 lots from
Wednesday's total of 67,008.
The FT-SE Mid 250 March futures contract on the Liffe closed at 3,907 after
trade of 36 lots. Open interest was 447. On the OMLX, the same contract also
finished at 3,912, with 4 lots traded. Open interest on this contract was
around 2,867. On the OMLX, volume in the traded options was seven contracts.
In early editions of Thursday's FT, the volume in the Mid 250 on the Liffe
was incorrectly stated. It should have read 36 contracts.

FT  04 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Closing rally leaves share prices
little changed - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market remained very nervous yesterday but regained confidence
towards the close when UK government bonds recovered early losses. The
Bundesbank's decision to leave key lending rates unchanged failed to upset
investors and the mid-afternoon low point in the UK stock market reflected
weakness in both US Treasuries and on Wall Street.
The final reading on the FT-SE 100 Index of 3,246.5 showed a loss of only
1.6, compared with a fall of just over 17 points recorded earlier. The rally
in London reflected a somewhat belated response to firmness in other
European markets.
Markets remained confident that short-term interest rates will be 'nudged
lower' across Europe. Optimism was unaffected by the absence of a move by
the Bundesbank yesterday, since any dramatic move in Germany had seemed
unlikely in the wake of the jump in money supply disclosed on Wednesday. Nor
was the stock market affected by the comment from the chief secretary to the
UK Treasury that 'the government is content with current economic
conditions'.
But institutions were cautious ahead of the US payroll statistics, which are
due today and could provide the trigger for the further tightening by the
Federal Reserve of which markets are still in fear. Reports that the US had
decided to reinstate the Super 301 trade order for sanctions against Japan
came too late for the London market.
Seaq turnover dipped to 675.8m shares from Wednesday's 762.9m. But the total
of retail, or customer, business in equities for the previous session rose
to Pounds 1.84bn, an indication that fund managers may be coming round to
the view, expressed by James Capel, London's leading agency broker, that the
equity market is 'a buy' at current levels. Other brokerage houses have
expressed similar advice; NatWest Securities seeing a 'buying opportunity'
and BZW 'exaggerated fears'.
Modest support across the broader range of the market took the FT-SE Mid 250
Index ahead by 5.2 to 3,907.0. There was demand for consumer stocks,
including brewery and media issues. But further substantial losses were
recorded in the financial sector. Merchant banks and those lending banks
with securities dealing subsidiaries continued to suffer as investors
weighed the possible losses in markets over the past fortnight.
By the close of business, around 40 per cent of the shares in the Footsie
100 list were showing gains, albeit mostly minor ones, and the market looked
more confident than for some time.
Traders commented that the institutions had been selectively buying stocks
in which the falls of the past two weeks appeared to have been overdone.
The market continued to track both stock index futures and bond prices
closely and showed little inclination to develop any trend independent of
these two mentors.
The opening of the market this morning is expected to depend largely on the
overnight performance of Wall Street, which was 12 Dow points down when
London closed last night.
Some strategists pointed out that European bond markets, which have made the
running for equities for the past fortnight, may be disengaging themselves
from trends in the US Treasury securities - but agreed that this theory will
be tested today when the US payroll statistics arrive.

FT  04 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico loses initial rise as
profit-taking sets in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico
Mexican stocks failed to hold on to an early rise that lifted the IPC index
near to 2,600 and finished marginally down on balance on profit-taking.
The IPC index of 36 leading shares was finally 0.75 of a point off at
2,561.93, after having waffled between 2,555.04 and 2,592.13 during the day
 -on Wednesday the index ended 48.53, or nearly 2 per cent, up at 2,562.68,
but after a low for the session of 2,470.56.
Equities initially followed on from Wednesday's gains, which had been helped
by news of a tentative agreement between rebels and government mediators in
the state of Chiapas to end a two-month rebellion.
Some brokers also noted a good early performance by Telmex and the return of
foreign investors. But Telmex later fell: the ADRs were down Dollars  5/8 at
Dollars 66 5/8 shortly before the close in New York, while the 'L' shares
trading locally lost a net 0.56 per cent and the 'A' series was unchanged on
the day.
Traders attributed the early advance in Telmex to news that Smith Barney
Shearson, the US brokerage house, had raised its 1994 and 1995 earnings
estimates.
Smith Barney said that it had lifted its 1994 ADR earnings estimate to
Dollars 6.75 from Dollars 6.50 and increased its 1995 forecast to Dollars
7.80 from Dollars 7.50.
Brazil
Sao Paulo opened in a confident mood after the government clarified its
position on foreign investments by saying that it did not intend imposing
new limits. But shares eased from the day's highs to close up 2.4 per cent
in lacklustre trade after investors took to the sidelines, awaiting clear
indications on how Brazil's economy will perform in the near term.
The Bovespa index of the 54 most active shares ended at 10,458, up 243
points from the previous close.
Mr Gustavo Franco, director of international operations at the central bank,
said on Wednesday that the government would not restrict foreign investment
in the country's stock exchanges.
State-run telecom firm Telebras rose 3.1 per cent.

FT  04 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subdued as bond yields
turn higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices were mixed in listless trading yesterday as the stock market
settled down after Wednesday's wild gyrations, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a slight 7.32 easier at
3,824.42. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.80 at 463.01,
while the American SE composite slipped 0.67 to 465.65 but the Nasdaq
composite gained 1.11 at 784.58. NYSE volume was moderate by recent
standards at 292m shares.
Wednesday's late rally, concentrated mostly in cyclicals, failed to feed
through into early gains yesterday. Instead, investors sold off the big Dow
Industrial stocks that had done well in the previous session.
The selling was mostly prompted by another rise in bond yields. By late
afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond was off three-quarters of a point, and
the yield had crept up to 6.832 per cent.
The decline in bonds, and some of the selling of stocks, reflected
nervousness ahead of today's jobs data. The February employment report is
being keenly awaited because some economists believe another indication of
strength in the labour market could be the trigger for a further interest
rate increase from the Federal Reserve.
These concerns were heightened yesterday when the weekly jobless claims
figures showed an unexpectedly big fall in the number of people filing for
state unemployment insurance. The day's other data, a 2.1 per cent rise in
January factory orders, also pointed to a robust economy.
Retailers bucked the trend, advancing as a group in the wake of surprisingly
strong monthly sales figures. Federated Department Stores put on Dollars
1/2 at Dollars 24 1/2 , the Gap Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 46 1/8 , JC Penney
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 55 3/4 and the Limited Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 19
7/8 .
Some of the cyclicals which did well on Wednesday weakened, with Alcoa
relinquishing Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 74 7/8 and Union Carbide Dollars  1/2
to Dollars 24. Car makers were in mixed form, with General Motors holding
steady at Dollars 60 1/2 , Chrysler firming Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 58 and
Ford shedding Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 63 5/8 .
Computer shares, which were hard hit on Wednesday, were also mixed. Compaq
recovered from recent selling to jump Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 98 and Texas
Instruments moved up Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 83 3/8 , but Hewlett-Packard
failed to hold on to an early gain and lost a net Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 89
1/4 .
Canada
Toronto ended mildly firmer after a technical bounce, but traders said the
market remains edgy after recent rate-related volatility. The TSE 300
composite index improved 8.0 to 4,370.2 and rises outnumbered declines by
401 to 333 after volume of 49.5m shares.
Nine of the 14 stock groups gained ground but with none showing a major
swing. Consumer products, media, mining and energy rose. Golds, industrial
products and financial services were little changed.
Malette tumbled CDollars 1 to CDollars 10 1/4 after announcing that it has
agreed to sell 2.5m shares at CDollars 10.25 each to a group of
underwriters.

FT  04 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei 225 average eases
further amid low activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Uncertainty over the course of the bond and foreign exchange markets
undermined investor confidence and equity prices lost ground on small-lot
arbitrage selling amid low activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average ended 138.91 off at 19,605.86 after a day's high of
19,771.68 and low of 19,531.65. After rising in early trading, the index met
arbitrage linked selling and later fluctuated within a narrow range for the
rest of the day.
Continued tension in the US-Japan trade arena also discouraged investors:
the US has threatened to revive the Super 301 trade act of 1988 against
Japan due to its alleged closed cellular telephone market.
The absence of dealers and foreign investors - the main driving force behind
the recent rise in share prices - depressed volume, and some 280m shares
changed hands against Wednesday's 401m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 13.61 to 1,602.33, while
the Nikkei 300 average declined 2.75 to 295.32. Losers outnumbered gainers
by 783 to 248, with 151 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index firmed 3.47 to 1,324.68.
Steel shares were weaker on reports that NKK would forgo dividend payments
for the current year to March and the next business year. NKK dipped Y9 to
Y250, Kawasaki Steel Y7 to Y353 and Nippon Steel Y8 to Y338.
Investors shunned broker issues due to the recent plunge on the domestic
bond market. Nomura Securities fell Y60 to Y2,270 and Daiwa Securities Y40
to Y1,680.
Shares of bakers and flour millers rose on hopes that consumers would turn
to bread because of the decline in domestic rice supplies and the increase
in imported rice. Yamazaki Baking gained Y10 at Y2,070 and Nisshin Flour
Milling Y20 at Y1,200.
Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical jumped Y63 to Y979 on reports of a new medicine
based on biotechnology. Hopes of increased business in the US cable
television market lifted Tomen, the trading house which has links to Nynex
Corp, of the US, Y11 to Y416.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 235.96 to 21,808.53 in volume of 120.7m
shares.
Roundup
With the exception of Taiwan the region's markets were weaker yesterday.
HONG KONG saw foreign institutional selling which left the Hang Seng index
down 75.40 at 9,802.03, having recovered from a sharp fall in the late
afternoon when profit-taking sent banks tumbling.
Wednesday's budget, which included a corporate tax cut, was viewed as
positive and helped to support the market.
HSBC Holdings came under heavy selling pressure, although bargain hunting
provided support when the issue fell below HKDollars 100. It ended HKDollars
1 cheaper at HKDollars 101.
KUALA LUMPUR reversed an early upward trend to close broadly lower amid
foreign selling, and as nervous investors liquidated their positions on
worries about the direction of overseas markets.
The composite index ended 15.67, or 1.4 per cent, down at 1,070.58, after
rising to 1,096.44.
SEOUL was lower in moderate trading as blue chips continued to consolidate
in response to the central bank's anti-inflationary tight monetary policy.
The composite index receded 4.50 to 902.16.
SINGAPORE fell 1.8 per cent amid worries about the prospects for higher
long-term US interest rates. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 41.94
to 2,242.55.
TAIWAN firmed slightly, with many investors remaining on the sidelines. The
weighted index ended 28.37 ahead at 5,457.74. Turnover came to TDollars
38.7bn, the lowest so far this year.
MANILA continued to consolidate, weakened by a further decline in Philippine
Long Distance Telephone in New York overnight. PLDT lost 30 pesos at 1,890
pesos after a fall of Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 67 1/4 in New York.
The composite index finished 1.7 down at 2,698.05.
AUSTRALIA drifted lower owing to pressure from the futures market. The All
Ordinaries index slipped 2.6 to 2,151.4 in turnover of ADollars 420m.
Amcor rose 8 cents to ADollars 9.88 in spite of announcing a 21 per cent
fall in net profits for the half-year to December because of expansion
costs.
In resource stocks, CRA jumped 28 cents to ADollars 17.40, picking up some
of Wednesday's 42-cent drop after reporting that it would have difficulty
repeating its strong 1993 profits performance this year.
BOMBAY closed sharply lower in spite of a late rally triggered by
short-covering. The BSE 30-share index was finally 79.13 off at 3,987.07,
after an intraday low of 3,943.62.
Brokers commented that there was still some confusion about the implications
of Monday's national budget which was causing concern among investors.
KARACHI fell back on profit-taking, the KSE-100 index declining 6.51 to
2,528.16. Falls led rises by 176 to 141.
COLOMBO's all-share index retreated 7.46 to 1,370.13 on profit-taking after
Tuesday's high. The market is viewed as overdue for a correction after its
39.7 per cent surge since the start of the year.

FT  04 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg ahead on steady foreign
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa had a better day yesterday in an unusually volatile week and
the overall index finished 50 higher at 4,931, writes Matthew Curtin in
Johannesburg.
The bullion price's descent below Dollars 380 an ounce took the gold shares
index 19 lower to 1,904. Industrial shares, however, remained buoyant, led
by strong overseas demand for Iscor, the steelmaker which produced
unexpectedly good half-year results last week. The stock lost 2 cents on the
day at R2.86 but the industrial index climbed 46 to 5,679.
The contradictory set of circumstances facing investors was dominated in
mid-week by initial confidence and then disillusionment with the degree of
progress in talks between the African National Congress and the Zulu Inkatha
Freedom Party. The weak gold bullion price and falling global markets also
contributed to instability, but deal-ers reported steady, if more subdued,
demand from over-seas investors for blue chip issues.
Mr Mike Brown at the stockbrokers, Frankel, Pollak, Vinderine, said that
local institutions were proving strangely hesistant, still weighing up the
shift in market sentiment at the end of 1993, brought on by the wave of
foreign buying which changed notions of value on the JSE.
Overseas investors could be forgiven for a wait-and-see approach as
elections loomed, but local fund managers might be missing out on an
opportunity to pick up good value scrip before another bout of foreign
investment.

FT  04 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weakness in financials mars
bourse recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's recovery from earlier falls was marred by weakness in some
financials, following rumoured repercussions among American banks to the
recent slide in bonds, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT chose to follow the US markets in the morning, after overnight
gains on Wall Street, and to ignore them in the afternoon when the Dow and
the US long bond both fell. The DAX index closed the session 17.57 higher at
2,037.90, and hit an Ibis-indicated 2,044.45 at the end of the day.
Turnover rose from DM8.2bn to DM9.5bn. Banks were relatively weak. Mr Nigel
Longley of Commerzbank said that this reflected stories of serious trading
losses in derivatives by US banks, rather than the Bundesbank's decision to
hold key interest rates.
There were pockets of strength among carmakers and chemicals on cyclical
recovery prospects, BMW rising DM15 to DM840, and then to DM844 after hours,
chemicals also responding to the prospect of their dividend announcements
next week.
Steels, after hours, seemed unmoved by the IG Metall decision to take 10,000
workers out on strike in Lower Saxony next Monday; there were hopes that a
compromise with engineering industry employers could still be reached.
Thyssen celebrated the Tranrapid go-ahead with a DM5.50 rise to DM257.50 on
the session; and Preussag ended the afternoon at DM470, after a morning rise
of DM5.70 to DM466.70.
PARIS saw a calmer day, after the excitement of Wednesday, with the CAC-40
index drifting 9.75 higher to 2,154.41, turnover retreating to a more
average FFr4bn after FFr8bn the day before.
Moulinex, the household electricals company, was the most active issue
following a broker's upgrade. It was suspended briefly limit-up in early
trading, before ending the session up FFr13.10 or nearly 10 per cent at
FFr149. The shares have gained 44 per cent over the year so far.
Peugeot was also strong on the day, up FFr23 to FFr866: the car manufacturer
said that it expected a return to profitability in 1994. Michelin gained
FFr5.20 to FFr250.00.
The financial sector weakened: SocGen lost FFr14 or 2 per cent to FFr682,
BNP FFr4.70 to FFr258.50 and UAP FFr6.40 or 3.4 per cent to FFr180.30.
AMSTERDAM returned to fundamentals as both Philips, the electronics group,
and DSM, in chemicals, pleased the market with good 1993 results and
dividend payments at the top end of expectations.
The AEX index gained 5.14 or 1.3 per cent to 412.41.
The 50 cents payout from Philips was its first since 1989, giving the shares
an early boost, while analysts were also encouraged by the Fl 2bn net 1993
profit which followed a loss of Fl 900m in 1992. The shares added Fl 4.00 to
Fl 46.00, bringing gains to the year so far to 11 per cent.
Polygram rose Fl 2.90 to FL 79.80.
The only disappointing division was at Grundig of Germany, in which it holds
a 31 per cent stake. Mr Jan Timmer, the chairman of Philips, said that job
cuts here would be necessary.
DSM paid Fl 1.50, forecast a profit in the first quarter of 1994 and
reported a 1993 loss of some Fl 60m before extraordinary items. The shares
rose Fl 4.10 to Fl 111.70.
MILAN saw a technical bounce after Wednesday's losses and the Comit index
picked up 10.33 or 1.6 per cent to 649.68.
BCI rose L93 to L6,110 amid reports that the privatisation, which closed
three days early, was nine times oversubscribed.
The enthusiasm spilled over to the rest of the sector with Banca di Roma L65
or 3.4 per cent higher at L1,957 and Credito Italiano L62 or 2.4 per cent
ahead at L2,670.
IMI, the medium term credit group, rose L143 to L12,812 on higher parent
company operating profits.
Some of the recently underperforming insurers had a better day. Alleanza
added L286 or 1.9 per cent to L15,594 and RAS L357 or 1.4 per cent to
L25,152.
Olivetti gained L50 or 2.2 per cent to L2,340, supported by speculation that
it could win a second mobile telephone system operating licence.
ZURICH rebounded 1.3 per cent after five straight days of losses and the SMI
index added 34.9 to 2,803.4.
The banking sector remained at the centre of attention. UBS bearers,
encountering further foreign selling, fell SFr14 to SFr1,248. CS Holding
added SFr20 to SFr636 as the market awaited today's results from Credit
Suisse, and SBC added SFr1 to SFr445: both continue to benefit from
recommendations of a switch out of UBS.
SMH put on SFr17 to SFr920: the watchmaker and Mercedes are to present a
working prototype of the Swatchmobile small car in Stuttgart today.
MADRID's banks were mixed in spite of a surprise half-point cut in the Bank
of Spain's benchmark interest rate to 8 per cent. However, the broad market
rose, the general index closing 4.65 up at 329.81.
Telefonica recovered Pta70 to Pta1,905 as analysts decided that the company
had been punished too heavily for the price of its Peruvian acquisitions.
HELSINKI picked up 2 per cent after declines earlier in the week, the Hex
index rising 36.1 to 1,876.3. Foreign demand helped Nokia FM43 higher to
FM375 in continued response to Tuesday's results.
Merrill Lynch joined the growing band of enthusiasts for the market,
forecasting that it could be among the best performers over the next 12
months. The US house said that a stronger than expected global economic
recovery would be positive, given that the market was the most cyclical in
Europe; the impact of currency depreciation on earnings growth had been
underestimated; valuations were among the most attractive in Europe; and
growth in the domestic economy could easily be three times consensus over
the next two years.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Markets Report: D-Mark moves lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges took a breather yesterday as a measure of calm returned to
international equity and bond markets following panic selling earlier in the
week, writes Philip Gawith.
Most observers, however, felt that what they were observing was a truce
rather than any sort of a lasting peace. There remains a broad consensus
that markets are not currently focusing on fundamentals.
Attention today will be anxiously concentrated on the release of key US
employment data. It was publication last month of a similar set of data that
prompted market jitters.
Any signs of inflationary pressures will renew speculation of a further
tightening of US monetary policy and lend support to the dollar.
Yesterday the Bundesbank council declined to shift any of its interest rates
at its meeting. Earlier in the week it had lowered its repo rate by three
basis points to 5.97 per cent. The Bank of Spain, however, cut its key money
rate by 50 basis points to 8 per cent.
The dollar declined sharply yesterday afternoon when a White House source
said President Clinton would reinstate the Super 301 executive order
permitting him to impose trade sanctions on Japan. It fell from a high of
Y104.17 to Y103.50 before bouncing back to close in London at Y104.065.
This selling pressure also spread to the D-Mark/dollar rate, with the dollar
falling from DM1.7135 to DM1.7050 before ending at DM1.7088. In New York the
dollar finished at DM1.7110 and Y103.90.
Analysts said the impact of this move would depend on whether Super 301 was
reimposed immediately, or left as a sword hanging over Japan's head. Mr
Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, commented: 'Whichever
way you look at it, the US is being very aggressive in terms of the
bilateral trade situation. That has only one implication - that the yen will
go stronger.'
Mr Lawrence Summers, undersecretary for International Affairs of the US
Treasury, said yesterday that it was wrong to say the trade war was
escalating. He also said it was premature to discuss the timing of any trade
action under Super 301.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said the Clinton
administration appeared to believe it crucial to be seen to be dealing
effectively with Japan. If not, this potentially could spill over into
similar troubles with other Far Eastern countries, especially China.
The D-Mark yesterday finished weaker across the board in Europe after news
that the engineering union IG Metall had voted in favour of strike action.
It finished in London at L984 from L990.2 against the Italian lira and at
FFr3.4 from FFr3.408 compared to the French franc.
With the shock of the 20.6 per cent annualised growth in M3 in January still
fresh in mind, and the IG Metall decision widely anticipated, it was hardly
surprising that the Bundesbank council decided to leave its Lombard and
discount rates unchanged. It also made no comment on the terms of its next
securities repurchase (repo) tender.
According to PaineWebber International, the Bundesbank has never changed its
key lending rates at two success-ive meetings. The M3 number and the likely
strike action also provided an inauspicious backdrop for a policy easing.
Yesterday the Bundesbank sought to limit the fallout from M3's rise. Mr
Otmar Issing, chief economist, told the Wall Street Journal that the M3
figure was 'no reason to panic'. He said the three basis-point cut in the
repo rate was a signal of where the Bundesbank was going.
Also following the cautious route was the Bank of France, which left its
intervention rate unchanged at 6.10 per cent at a securities repo, held to
allocate funds for injection into the money market today.
More adventurous was the Bank of Spain, whose rate cut was variously
described as 'brave', 'sensible' and 'very much a surprise'. Mr Keith
Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ, said the bank had two main reasons for
acting: to stimulate the economy, which is in recession, and calm the bond
markets, which were volatile earlier in the week.
Mr Edmonds said the Spanish authorities had room to reduce interest rates
which, at 8 per cent, were still 2 percentage points above German rates. He
added that this differential was probably sufficient to sustain the value of
the currency. The peseta had been fairly weak recently at the Pta82 level
against the D-Mark, the lowest since mid-January. But it rose after the rate
cut to close in London at Pta81.88, from Pta82.25 on Wednesday.
Sterling yesterday had a quiet day with attention focused on the D-Mark. It
was barely changed against the dollar at Dollars 1.495 and higher against
the D-Mark, finishing at DM2.5546 from DM2.5475.
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 270m of
unspecified late assistance, bringing total help for the day to Pounds 529m.
This compared with its latest forecast of an Pounds 800m liquidity shortage,
revised from an earlier Pounds 750m.

Report

<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange COPPER market put in a strong performance
yesterday, capitalising on signs of downside support at Dollars 1,870 a
tonne for three months delivery. The price broke above Dollars 1,890 at one
stage before hitting late selling. It ended the after hours 'kerb' trading
session at Dollars 1,889, up Dollars 14 on the day.
ALUMINIUM largely followed copper, and after rallying strongly from lower
morning levels lost some ground late on to end below the highs at Dollars
1,283 a tonne, still up Dollars 8, in the three months delivery position.
The LEAD market crumbled under late liquidation after the three months
position broke the important Dollars 460-a-tonne level, confirming a 'head
and shoulders' chart formation. Stop-loss selling pushed the market lower
and final business was at Dollars 456 down Dollars 10.
ZINC was also hit by negative chart factors, as repeated attempts on Dollars
948 a tonne eventually proved successful, and prices broke lower under
pressure from stop-loss and investment fund selling.
At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures were given a late boost by
news Brazil had met export retention requirements at last.
The near May position closed at Dollars 1,232 a tonne, below a Dollars 1,238
high but Dollars 21 up on the day.
In the COCOA market meanwhile, traders were becoming increasingly nervous,
in the continued absence of supportive news, that the Pounds 900-a-tonne
support level for the May position might shortly be broken, with next
support seen at around Pounds 870. The price closed at Pounds 905, down
Pounds 6 on the day, after touching Pounds 901 at one point.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil market looks to Gulf
meeting for Opec clues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Petroleum ministers from the six Gulf Co-operation Council members,
including Saudi Arabia, meet in Jeddah tomorrow amid contuining speculation
over whether a plan to cut oil output will emerge.
The Jeddah talks are likely to be the first in a string of contacts between
members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the run-up
to its next meeting in Geneva on March 25. The persistence of weak oil
prices since Opec's last meeting in November is putting pressure on the
organisation to agree to additional production cuts.
Reuters news agency yesterday reported that the Opec secretariat was
circulating a proposal among member states for a cut of 1m barrels a day in
the second quarter of this year, although an official of the organisation
later denied the report.
Few analysts expect a formal proposal to emerge from the GCC session, as it
excludes crucial Opec members such as Iran. But the meeting may indicate
whether there has been any change in the attitude of Opec's most influential
member, Saudi Arabia, which accounts for 30 per cent of the organisation's
output.
The previous GCC meeting last December proposed that any Opec cuts be
reinforced by reductions from independent producers. Mr Abdullah bin Hamad
Al-Attiyah, Qatar's energy minister and the current Opec president, recently
said that some of the smaller non-Opec producers had put forward proposed
cuts totalling 300,000-400,000 barrels a day.
The Jeddah meeting may review ways on how such cuts could be implemented.
But oil markets are likely to remain sceptical of such proposals as long as
the bigger independent producers decline to go along with Opec.
'They would need some participation from the UK, Norway and Mexico' for the
proposed non-Opec cuts to make a big impact in the markets, according to Mr
Mehdi Varzi, director of energy research at London broker Kleinwort Benson.
Mr Varzi believes Opec's strategy of relying on quotas to influence oil
prices is flawed as long as Saudi Arabia insists on maintaining its 8m b/d
quota out of Opec's total production ceiling of 24.52m b/d.
But Saudi officials have consistently rejected arguments that it could
absorb greater cuts than other Opec members, and Mr Varzi concedes that
there is 'no sign of any change in the Saudi mood'.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: East Europeans warned against
farm protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday warned east European countries not to
repeat the mistakes of the common agricultural policy.
Moves towards protectionism in these countries risked creating international
trade tensions 'instead of paving the way for a smooth entry of eastern
products into international trade,' according to Mr Rene Steichen, the
European Union's agriculture commissioner. He said there was a growing gap
between the long-term policy objectives of central and eastern European
countries and their short-term action on agriculture, which had become
'increasingly interventionist in orientation'.
Mr Steichen cited Poland, where import levies were expected to be
implemented shortly to protect certain domestic agricultural sectors from
competition.
Speaking in Budapest at an Agra Europe conference entitled Towards 2000:
Agriculture, Agribusiness and the Food Industry in Central and Eastern
Europe, Mr Steichen admitted the reformed CAP still relied partly on
intervention mechanisms to stabilise markets. But he said unchecked growth
in eastern European support for farmers could lead to old CAP-style prices
'far higher than market realities'.
But a senior Hungarian official told the conference it was a 'day-dream' to
think subsidies in eastern Europe could increase to the level of the EU. Dr
Laszlo Medgyasszay, secretary of state in the agriculture ministry, said the
high level of EU export subsidies compared with those in eastern Europe was
a particularly sore point.
'Without being able to cross draconian financial bridges, our commodities
cannot reach the favoured markets,' he said. 'Often we lose. . . due to the
lack of financial support.'
Mr Steichen claimed it was wrong for some east European countries to blame
EU protectionism for a decline in their exports to the EU in 1992, saying
this reflected internal difficulties in restructuring their farm sectors.
These arose, he said, from the slow pace of land privatisation, the
break-down in distribution systems, the collapse of traditional markets in
the former Soviet Union and the shortage of finance for farm modernisation.
However, the commissioner proposed improvements in co-operation between east
and west to avoid the kind of trade friction that arose last year over EU
minimum import prices for soft fruit imports and measures against livestock
imports from countries hit by outbreaks of disease.
He said the EU should set up an 'early warning mechanism' to lessen the risk
of east European exports suddenly being interrupted. It should encourage the
creation of exporter groups in eastern Europe that could co-ordinate a rapid
response to changes in trade. Eastern and western veterinary standards
should also be harmonised, he said.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Restructuring of farms in
eastern Europe hindered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bureaucratic problems are hindering the restructuring of nearly 70 per cent
of farms in eastern Europe, according to a survey to be presented today,
writes Alison Maitland.
The survey of 2,000 farms in 10 countries in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union found that 35 per cent also faced financial difficulties in
adapting from communist methods, while 34 per cent cited social
restrictions, notably having to axe large numbers of farm workers.
The Farm-Trak poll by the Produce Studies Group, a European food industry
consultancy, will be publicised at the Agra Europe conference in Budapest.
Mr Tony Houghton, who will present the findings, said bureaucratic problems,
particularly over land ownership, were preventing long-term investment by
farmers.
More than 60 per cent of farmers also said that a shortage of suitable
machinery was impeding their progress towards greater efficiency, while over
50 per cent said that they were hampered by poor quality animal feed, a lack
of machinery spares and a shortage of skilled workers.

Production of cobalt by major western world producers fell to 13,843 tonnes
in 1993 from 17,891 tonnes in 1992 according to Cobalt Development Institute
statistics being circulated among London by trade houses, reports Reuter.
The reduction was caused mainly by a sharp reduction in output at Zaire's
Gecamines and came as no surprise to traders given the political turmoil and
economic neglect in that country over recent years.
Output also dropped in neighbouring Zambia, the CDI statistics show, which
traders expected after hearing reports of lower ore grades being encountered
in the latter part of 1993.
Canada's Sherritt Gordon increased output by 78 per cent to 1,218 tonnes but
most other producers showed little change.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil gets to grips with
coffee scheme - The transfer of export retention to the private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Brazilian government says it has reached agreement with coffee producers
and exporters to fulfil its obligations under the international coffee
retention scheme but that it still intends to press on with its
privatisation of the retention programme.
Under the new system, which came into effect this month, exporters will have
to bear the costs of buying and storing coffee that is retained.
The deal reached yesterday will allow the government to retain about 800,000
bags (60kg each), enough to fulfil its retention commitment for exports in
the October-January period, says Mr Frederico Robalinho, trade policy
secretary in the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism. He says the accord
will not affect the decision to privatise the retention scheme.
This decision came after repeated failures by the government to acquire
enough coffee to comply with the agreement made last September, by the
newly-formed Association of Coffee Producing Countries, to hold back 20 per
cent of exports in an attempt to reduce world coffee stocks and push up
prices.
ACPC governments agreed to hold back an extra 20 per cent above their
exports until the average world price, as calculated by an ACPC formula,
reached 75 cents per pound, at which point retention would falls to 10 per
cent. When the 80-cent mark is reached the retention scheme will be
suspended.
The strategy has so far succeeded in pushing up prices to about 71-72 cents
a pound.
Brazil is the world's largest coffee exporter, closely followed by Colombia.
Last year, according to the Brazilian coffee exporters' association, Febec,
Brazil shipped just over 15m bags of green coffee, earning Dollars 988m.
The government has had serious problems acquiring coffee to retain but
yesterday Mr Robalinho said that a Dollars 38m credit line from the
government's coffee fund, Funcafe, would result in the retention of 600,000
bags from producers and exporters and that a further 200,000 bags would be
acquired from producers who were using coffee as collateral for their debts
to the government - controlled Banco do Brasil.
'The coffee that is being used as collateral will be freed and used for
retention purposes', he said.
Mr Robalinho added that the government might provide more funds to finance
the retention of a further 300,000 bags, which would cover exports to the
end of February.
Under the new scheme, exporters will not be allowed to ship coffee without
proof that they have stored 20 per cent of the shipment volume.
Coffee traders say February's exports were higher than usual because
exporters increased sales to beat the introduction of the new system. March
sales are likely to be around 800,000 bags, including soluble coffee, nearly
half the average volume.
The fall in Brazil's exports is expected to contribute to the rise in world
prices and some traders predict that the 75 cents level will be reached in
April or May, which would ease the situation for exporters.
Despite the extra costs for exporters, Febec is supporting the
privatisation. Mr Waldyr Ariano, its vice president, says this is because in
the long run it will mean lower stocks in the consuming nations and higher
prices for the local industry.
According to Mr Ariano the details of retention are not as important as the
signals being sent by Brazil, both to other coffee producing nations and to
importers.
'Our producing partners are following closely what it happening in Brazil
and they realise that the government is behaving cleanly and correctly'.
He adds that the key is maintaining trust among the producing countries in
order for the retention scheme to work.
Others are less optimistic. Mr Christian Wolthers, a trader, notes that the
Brazilian coffee industry has been in a state of semi-chaos since former
president Fernando Collor closed the Brazilian Coffee Institute in 1990.
He argues that with the higher prices privatisation of retention will bring
Brazilian coffee prices will become uncompetitive and, 'either the
international market absorbs the change and we will win or we will have to
stay out of the market'.

</HEADLINE>

Wool prices have risen at auctions in Australia and New Zealand this week,
taking the market close to, if not aligned with, seasonal peaks. The
Australian Wool International indicator at 535 cents compares with 546
touched early in February, and New Zealand prices have risen particularly
strongly with much better clearances than for some time. The market upturn
has developed despite an Australian clip forecast which raises expected
production this season, thus increasing offerings in the next four months,
and also indicates a smaller decline than expected in production next
season. there are still difficulties in selling semi-processed and
manufactured wool textiles at prices reflecting recent costs, but the
balance does this week seem to favour continuing market recovery rather than
any new setback.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Technical recovery in futures calms
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bond markets calmed yesterday, with sentiment buoyed by
a technical recovery in the futures pits.
'The markets got oversold and the technical indicators are screaming buy
me]' said Mr Julian Callow, international economist at Kleinwort Benson,
adding: 'This has a distinct flavour of a dead-cat-bounce.'
However, while cash dealings were thin, traders reported some buying,
especially by domestic investors. 'I saw a few timid buyers today - the
first time in a long time,' said one trader.
Following Wednesday's late bounce, prices continued to firm in the morning,
underpinned by hopes that the Bundesbank's central bank council might
announce a monetary easing. When the Bundesbank left interest rates
unchanged, prices dipped briefly but soon recovered, helped by news that the
German engineering employers' association had proposed new top-level talks
with union leaders to try to resolve the pay dispute. A short-squeeze in the
futures pits pushed many contracts sharply higher in late trading.
The high-yielding bond markets were yesterday's best performers, having been
the worst casualties of the recent sell-off.
'The very strong bounce reflects the fact that they had sold off too fast
and too far,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg.
The Bank of Spain's surprise  1/2 -point cut in the key money rate to 8 per
cent gave Spanish bonds a massive boost, causing the March bond future to
rally by more than three points at one point. It closed at 101.38. up 2.30
points on the day.
The Bank of Spain's decision to reject all bids for its auction of three,
five and 10-year debt also helped sentiment by removing the spectre of fresh
supply at a time of scarce retail demand.
Italian bonds also recovered smartly, boosted by the Spanish rally and by
news that Italy's National Auditors Court had approved government plans to
speed the repayment of withholding tax to foreign investors in the Italian
bond market.
The court decision was the final stage before a decree speeding the
repayment could be put into effect. The decree sets out a new system for
refunding the 12.5 per cent tax to residents of countries that have signed
double taxation treaties with Italy.
The BTP future on Liffe rose by 2.04 point to 111.40.
German bonds opened on a firm tone, slipped back on the Bundesbank's
announcement of unchanged rates but rose again on news of top-level pay
talks in the engineering sector. Unsubstantiated rumours surrounding
emergency central bank action to calm the markets fuelled another late spurt
as traders covered their short positions in the futures pits.
The March bund future hit a high of 96.30 during the late squeeze, but
slipped back in after-hours APT trading to around 95.98, up 0.54 point on
the day.
Due to continued high volatility, the German futures and options exchange
DTB raised margins on its bund and Bobl futures.
Effective today, the margin for the Bund future is DM4,000 (160 ticks), up
from DM3,000 (120 ticks). The margin for the Bobl future was raised to
DM2,000 (80 ticks) from DM1,750 (70 ticks).
French bonds also ended higher, helped by the smooth auction of 10 and
30-year bonds.
'The auction went much better than expected,' said one trader, who reported
massive single bids for the paper from French investment funds.
The March notional bond future rose 0.48 point to 124.86.
UK gilts posted modest losses amid nervousness ahead of today's US non-farm
payrolls data.
'The UK is the second-furthest along in the global economic cycle, and we're
especially vulnerable to bad US news,' said a trader.
The March long gilt future slipped by  9/16 point to 111 3/8 .
After a quiet opening, longer-dated US Treasury prices fell sharply
yesterday amid fears of an impending trade war between the US and Japan.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  27/32 at 92
17/32 , yielding 6.837 per cent. The two-year note was also weaker, down
5/32 at 99 5/8 , to yield 4.808 per cent.
After the wild gyrations of Wednesday, when the bond rebounded from an early
one-point loss to end with a modest gain, trading was relatively quiet at
the opening. Prices were mostly stable, although the long bond eased later
in the morning session as market participants lightened their positions
ahead of the monthly employment data.
The jobs data could prove decisive in determining the immediate outlook for
Treasuries, because analysts believe that if the figures show continued
strength in the labour market, the Fed will probably decide to raise
interest rates again in a second pre-emptive move against inflation. This
could further undermine bond market sentiment, although traders say that in
the wake of the recent falls, a second rate hike has already been priced in.
By mid-afternoon the long end of the market was decisively lower as traders
reacted to the news that President Clinton had reinstated the 'Super 301'
provision to trade laws that allows the government to impose trade sanctions
on any country which employs unfair trade restrictions on US goods and
services. The bond market fears a trade war because it could lead to a sharp
rise in the price of imported Japanese goods, thus fuelling inflation.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Credit Lyonnais voices
concern over derivatives image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the controversy surrounding funds investing in derivative instruments,
futures fund managers Credit Lyonnais Rouse (CLR) are voicing concern over
the industry's image.
'If we want to develop this business and get people to take the industry
seriously, we need the last two months like a hole in the head,' said Mr
David Moore, head of CLR's funds division.
Many funds investing aggressively in derivatives incurred heavy losses in
the currency and bond markets during the last two months, prompting a wave
of concern about the potentially destabilising effects of such investment
vehicles.
CLR recommends that the industry move away from basic managed futures
towards the construction of funds using derivatives (including futures,
options and swaps) that identify a particular risk or return profile and
identify their performance objectives.
Moreover, 'fees and expenses must be kept under control', they state.
Performance fees are acceptable if the performance element of the fee is
only charged after a minimum level of return has been achieved, they argue.
Indeed, 'negotiations with new CTAs (commodities trading advisers) for our
established funds have shown an acceptance of the critical idea of only
charging performance fees above a minimum level of return,' said Mr Moore.
'We are in the process of signing two CTAs on this basis.'
The industry average is currently a 2 per cent, management fee and an
additional performance fee ranging between 15 and 25 per cent.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Volatility worries keep down new
issuance in Eurobonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New issuance in the Eurobond market remained thin yesterday despite the
slight improvement in sentiment in leading government bond markets.
Syndicate managers said borrowers and investors were reluctant to leave the
sidelines until they were sure that the recent price volatility had come to
an end. The widening in yield spreads of around five basis points on recent
Eurobond offerings from supranational issuers was a further deterrent, they
said.
The turbulence of the past weeks prompted Industrial Development Bank of
India to postpone its debut Eurobond offering, a Dollars 200m issue of
five-year bonds, until market conditions improved, lead manager Citibank
International said.
Among yesterday's meagre selection, GECC raised Fl 250m through an offering
of three-year Eurobonds. The proceeds of the deal were thought to have been
swapped into fixed-rate dollars.
Some syndicate managers were surprised at the three-year maturity because
they believed that GECC was seeking to reduce its dependence on commercial
paper and extend its maturity profile to between four and six years.
Lead manager ABN-Amro said the deal, which was priced to yield 15 basis
points over the interpolated curve, was targeted mainly at retail investors
in the Benelux region and in Switzerland. It noted that there was a shortage
of guilder-denominated paper with this maturity.
ABN-Amro added that a 'comfortable' amount of bonds had been placed and that
hardly any had been sold back to the lead manager.
Elsewhere, Credito Fondiario e Industriale, an Italian mortgage institution,
raised L120bn through an offering of 10-year floating-rate notes. Joint lead
manager Chase said the deal had gone well considering the underlying
volatility in the markets.
As with other recent offerings of lira-denominated FRNs, there was a strong
bias towards Italian investors. In the afternoon, the notes were quoted bid
only at the issue price of par.
The Bank of China's proposed Dollars 500m yankee bond offering is being held
up until the US Treasury bond market stabilises, according to a source close
to the Bank of China debt offering, Reuter reports from New York.
The deal was expected to be priced yesterday, but the Treasury market fell
this week on fears the Federal Reserve may again tighten credit. The bank
source said the deal was likely to be priced today or early next week.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder dips 12% at
interim stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Goodman Fielder, Australia's largest food group which has been the subject
of recent management turmoil, lacklustre earnings, and shareholder
disgruntlement, reported a 12.1 per cent fall in interim profits, to
ADollars 57.6m (USDollars 41.2m) after tax but before abnormals.
The figure, which compared with ADollars 65.5m a year earlier, was achieved
on sales 7.3 per cent lower at ADollars 1.94bn. Earnings per share, also
after tax but ahead of minorities, slipped by 16.7 per cent to 5 cents.
Profits after tax and abnormals stood at ADollars 61.6m, compared with
ADollars 131.8m in the previous year, when there was a large abnormal
surplus.
The company pointed out yesterday that comparisons were distorted by
disposals and purchases. It said the operating earnings, before interest,
from ongoing operations rose by 16.8 per cent in the first half, although
total operating profit after interest charges of ADollars 42.6m, against
ADollars 47.4m, was flat at ADollars 91.6m.
Performance varied across the group. The Australian milling operations made
a reduced contribution, affected by higher wheat prices, and the Australian
poultry business also had a difficult half-year. Ingredients saw earnings
before interest and tax fall by 21.1 per cent.
However, margins in the European food group improved from 3.5 per cent to
4.7 per cent, and its contribution to operating earnings increased from
ADollars 22.9m to ADollars 27.8m, due partly to the full inclusion of
Wessanen (compared with two months last time).
Yesterday, Mr Barry Weir, chief executive, said that the group was looking
at 'modest earnings growth' in the second half, and that its current focus
was on the underperforming parts of the group.

<TEXT>
Amcor, the fast-expanding Australian paper and packaging group which is
currently pushing into Europe and North America, yesterday reported profits
before tax and abnormals of ADollars 251.5m (USDollars 179.8m) for the six
months to end-December, a 10.6 per cent increase over the same period of
1992-93.
Earnings per share increased by around 12 per cent, to 27.4 cents, on a
fully-diluted basis and also before tax. Sales rose by a tenth, to ADollars
2.73bn. The company incurred only a small ADollars 106,000 abnormal charge
in the most recent half-year, but had the benefit of a ADollars 67.2m
surplus last time. As a result, net profit after abnormals fell from
ADollars 294.7m to ADollars 251.4m.
Amcor said that it saw better operating conditions in Australia, North
America and the UK, with growth continuing in New Zealand and Asia. But
packaging activities in France and Germany continued to face a tough
economic climate, and Europe was the one region to show a fall in pre-tax
profits year-on-year.
On the packaging side, profits before interest and tax were up by 7.5 per
cent to ADollars 171.2m, with sales increasing by 15.4 per cent, to ADollars
1.57bn. On the paper side, which was recently augmented by the purchase of
North Broken Hill Peko's Associated Pulp and Paper Mills, profits dipped
slightly, from ADollars 106.1m to ADollars 104m.
Paper merchanting earnings rose, but the main Amcor Paper Group saw profits
dip by almost 6 per cent, under fierce competition.
Reduced interest charges, down from ADollars 43.6m to ADollars 29m, also
helped the increase in pre-tax profits.
Amcor said that it expects total outlays on acquisitions and capital
expenditure to exceed ADollars 1.1bn in the current financial year. North
Broken Hill Peko announced yesterday that it is spending ADollars 31m to
build a satellite woodchip mill at Hampshire, Tasmania.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Keppel, one of Singapore's biggest conglomerates, has reported pre-tax
profits for the year ended December 31 of SDollars 338.5m (USDollars 214m),
a 21 per cent rise on the previous year. The increase was achieved despite a
2 per cent drop in turnover to SDollars 1.53bn.
Keppel, majority-controlled by the Singapore government and one of the
island republic's leading ship repair and shipbuilding companies, said
growth and profitability had improved significantly in the second half.
While pre-tax profits in Keppel's shipbuilding and repair sector were down
slightly in 1993, the group's figures were boosted by big gains at Keppel
Bank, the recently partially privatised banking and financial services arm
of the group. The unit's pre-tax profits rose to SDollars 122m in 1993 from
SDollars 57.5m.
The group said it expected higher operating profits in the coming year due
to the improvement in the US economy and continued high regional economic
growth.
A final dividend of 12 cents per share was recommended.
Sembawang, another of Singapore's state-controlled conglomerates based on
ship repair, has announced pre-tax profits for 1993 of SDollars 124.1m, a 6
per cent decline on 1992. Revenues also fell 6 per cent to SDollars 666m.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Earnings at Mayne Nickless surge
30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased earnings from its transportation and healthcare businesses more
than offset a decline in the security division for Melbourne-based Mayne
Nickless, and left the company posting a 30.1 per cent increase in net
operating profits before abnormals, in the six months to January 2.
Mayne said that it made ADollars 61.7m (USDollars 44.1m) in the period,
compared with ADollars 47.4m a year earlier. Sales rose by 4.1 per cent, to
ADollars 1.44bn, from ADollars 1.38bn previously, and earnings per share
before abnormals were up by 25.6 per cent, at 20.6 cents.
The most recent half-year, however, saw an ADollars 27.2m abnormal charge,
relating to a retrenchment programme at its Spanish Transportes Helguera
business (ADollars 9.5m), and a decision to pull out of the Italian express
freight market. The Bergaglio Trasporti operation was closed this month, and
cost associated with this accounts for the remaining ADollars 17.7m of the
charge.
The result of the abnormal charge was to reduce Mayne's bottom-line profit
to ADollars 34.5m, from ADollars 47.4m previously.
Within the three operating divisions, transportation - which includes the
Parceline business in the UK - saw a sharp 70.4 per cent improvement in
operating earnings, to ADollars 41.7m. This result was helped by the
acquisition of France Distribution System in early-1993.
Mayne said that the Australian and North American businesses put in better
results, and that the express freight operations in the UK 'performed
satisfactorily'.
The healthcare business pushed operating profits 15.2 per cent higher to
ADollars 24.3m.

profits climb 12%

Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, the hotels and property company controlled by
the Kadoorie family, yesterday reported a 12 per cent rise in earnings to
HKDollars 417m (USDollars 54m) for the year to December 31 against HKDollars
372m in 1992. Profits were boosted by rocketing rental income from the
Repulse Bay and other developments and sharply reduced interest rate costs.
The company booked a further HKDollars 118m through the sale of 14.3m shares
in Harbour Centre Development, which owns and operates hotels in Hong Kong
and Texas. Since the year end, Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels has sold a
further 18m shares on the open market, in line with plans to concentrate on
core activities.
The group decided to dispose of its 10.7 per cent stake in Harbour Centre -
held since June 1968 - after a privatisation bid by Wharf Holdings, the
majority shareholder, failed last year. This year the disposal is expected
to reap around HKDollars 170m for Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels.
Earnings per share rose to 39 HK cents compared with 36 cents in 1992,
slightly above the market consensus, although analysts reckoned a more
generous dividend might have been forthcoming, especially in light of the
Dollars 118m extraordinary gain. The final dividend was 14 cents, giving a
total for the year of 20 cents against 18 cents in 1992.
Operating profit on the hotels side last year, down 8 per cent at HKDollars
245m, was hit by extension work to The Peninsula in Hong Kong, scheduled for
completion in June. However, increased rental incomes helped propel
operating profits on residential and commercial activities 16 per cent ahead
to HKDollars 248m.
The outlook for the group, which owns the colony's most prestigious hotel -
The Peninsula in Kowloon - and the long-running Peak Tram, is deemed to be
good on both the hotel and property fronts. The hotel sector generally is
expected to enjoy better times due to a reduction in room supply (several
hotels have been sold recently, and most of these are likely to re-emerge as
commercial blocks) and a rise in room tariffs.

<TEXT>
Anglovaal, the South African mining house, is raising its interim dividend
by 6 per cent to 35 cents after benefiting from improved contributions from
its diamond, gold mining and industrial interests in the half-year to
December 31.
Earnings climbed to 270 cents from 252 cents, but 1992 figures have been
restated to reflect last year's change in the company tax rate to 40 per
cent from 48 per cent. Sales rose to R4.82bn (Dollars 1.4bn) from R4.3bn,
with operating income at R406.2m compared with R344.8m. Lower investment
receipts curbed the rise in pre-tax profit to 16 per cent to R429.7m.
Solid performances from Anglovaal Industries' cement, engineering and
textiles businesses ensured the mining house's industrial interests remained
the mainstay of group profitability.
After-tax profit climbed to R283.9m from R242.9m with a drop in the group's
effective tax rate. A sharp fall in equity accounted earnings left net
income only 7 per cent higher at R162.9m against R152m.

<TEXT>
Orkla, the Norwegian group with interests ranging from branded consumer
goods to chemical processing, announced yesterday that pre-tax profits in
1993 advanced more than four-fold, helped by solid gains from shares and a
stronger performance by industrial activities.
The board proposed to increase the dividend to NKr4.10 a share from NKr3.75.
Group pre-tax profit rose sharply to NKr1.32bn (Dollars 178m) from NKr315m,
as sales increased to NKr17.85bn from NKr16.81bn. Operating profit advanced
by 7 per cent to NKr1.27bn.
Net financial items charged against accounts fell to NKr523m from NKr606m as
share of profit from associated companies nearly doubled NKr219m from
NKr112m.
Industrial activities lifted operating profit to NKr1.24bn from NKr1.17bn.
Branded consumer goods' activities increased market shares for most
important products but operating margins fell slightly.
Chemicals saw increased demand for important products and improved operating
margins as a result of a shift in product mix, efficiency, reduced raw
materials costs and favourable exchange rates.
Investment activities increased operating profit to NKr29m from NKr20, and
recorded a booked pre-tax profit of NKr273m, significantly better than in
1992, when stocks on the Oslo bourse fell heavily.
Realised gains on shares in 1993 reached NKr350m against losses of NKr381m
in 1992, while unrealised gains shot up by nearly NKr2.5bn from NKr5m.

Microsoft and Tele-Communications (TCI) have agreed to test interactive
cable television technology jointly in Seattle, Washington. The tests could
establish software standards for TCI's networks which reach more than 10m
cable television customers throughout the US.
The agreement is the first move into interactive television by Microsoft,
the world's largest computer software company, and the first deployment of
'information superhighway' technology by TCI, the largest US cable
television company.
The companies said that the I-TV trials will occur in two phases. Starting
in the fourth quarter of 1994, the companies will test the technology by
delivering services to 'a few hundred' TCI and Microsoft employees in and
around Seattle, close to Microsoft's headquarters. Next year, the trial will
be expanded to include 'tens of thousands' of TCI cable television customers
in the Seattle area.
'We are taking a deliberate, considered approach by making a long-term
investment in the development of system software that can actually be
deployed to deliver interactive television and broadband networks,' said Mr
Bill Gates, chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft.
'These tests represent our first step in the process of developing and
deploying actual equipment and software in our networks to build the
information superhighway,' said Mr John Malone, TCI's president and chief
executive.
'We will be working together with Microsoft to refine the technology and to
learn what our customers want from interactive television - what types of
services they prefer, how they use them, and what features they find
helpful.'
Last month TCI called off its planned merger with Bell Atlantic, a regional
telephone company, and said it would suspend Dollars 500m, or half its
planned spending this year, on upgrading cable television networks. The
announcement of the I-TV trial demonstrates, however, that TCI is moving
ahead with plans for deployment of advanced technology.

Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), one of Belgium's three largest banks,
yesterday announced a 130 per cent rise in net profits over the last year to
BFr6.7bn (Dollars 190m).
Mr Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer, BBL's chief executive, said the profits
growth showed that the bank was shrugging off the poor performance of the
previous two years.
'The bank has retrieved its position of strength . . . we are back on the
attack,' said Mr Cardon de Lichtbuer, who was appointed to his position at
the end of 1992, after a year in which the bank had been badly hit by
provisions against bad loans and the breakdown of merger talks with the
Dutch group ING.
In spite of previous setbacks, Mr Cardon de Lichtbuer said customer
confidence in the bank remained high, with 12.6 per cent growth in customer
deposits during 1993.
Although this growth had been partly offset by a 7 per cent drop in private
sector loans, the total assets of the bank had risen by 4.8 per cent to
BFr2,290bn.
At the same time, the bank's consolidated cash flow had risen by 28 per cent
to some BFr29.9bn.
Mr Cardon de Lichtbuer said that this, coupled with a significant
improvement in the bank's foreign units, had been the main reason for the
rising profits.
The board is to recommend a dividend of BFr145 per share, compared with
BFr98.8 the previous year.
Gevaert, the Antwerp-based investment group, yesterday announced a 46.8 per
cent growth in profit during 1993. Total consolidated profit was BFr2.9bn,
up from BFr1.9bn the previous year.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Amic steps up dividend after
strong advance

Anglo American Industrial Corporation (Amic) is increasing its dividend for
the first time since 1989 following a sharp increase in profits.
The industrial arm of Anglo American of South Africa, reported an
unexpectedly robust performance in the year to December 31 amid growing
signs of recovery in its domestic and overseas markets.
The company, whose interests range from chemicals to mining equipment,
stainless steel and consumer goods, recorded a 37 per cent jump in pre-tax
profit to R647m (Dollars 187m) from R470m, on turnover a third higher at
R8.79bn against R6.78bn.
The dividend is increased by 7 per cent to 375 cents a share, from 350
centsin 1992. Shareholders have been offered a scrip alternative.
A large part of the improved sales reflected an increased shareholding in
construction subsidiary LTA. A similar boost is expected in 1994 from an
enlarged stake in chemicals supplier AECI.
The group's three major unlisted subsidiaries - Scaw Metals, the pulp and
paper producer Mondi, and mining equipment supplier Boart - all reported a
strong turnround in their main markets in the second half of 1993, with
further signs of good domestic and export orders so far thisyear.
Net income before abnormal items was up by more than a fifth at R526m,
against R354m. Deferred tax credits boosted the bottom line by another R90m.
Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said the South African economy was heading for
growth of at least 4 per cent in 1994.
Amic has completed an internal reorganisation to improve financial
efficiency and borrowing capacity by maximising the tax base of its
wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Mr Boyd said Amic was embarking on a drive to attract international
partners, mainly for new business ventures.
In the past year, AECI established a joint venture in explosives with ICI of
the UK and entered a partnership with Daewoo, the Korean conglomerate, which
is investigating the construction of a R600m colour television tube plant in
South Africa.
