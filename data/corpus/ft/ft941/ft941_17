Alcan Aluminium plans to sell its North American building products division.
The division, which employs 1,800 people at 18 plants and 47 sales offices,
recorded sales of USDollars 425m in 1993 and could, according to analysts,
fetch around Dollars 300m.
Margins at the division, which makes and distributes a range of aluminium,
vinyl and steel building products, were under severe pressure during the US
recession.
In addition, aluminium's share of the big building products market has been
declining for several years. CS First Boston is to explore options for the
division.
Alcan is concentrating on upgrading the performance of its worldwide raw
materials and smelting businesses, and optimising its North American and
Euriopean rolling capacity.
'We will continue to invest only in those companies that are a strategic fit
and create long-term value,' it said. 'The capital tied up in the building
products business could be better deployed elsewhere.'

Canadian mining group Rio Algom's metals distribution business improved in
the fourth quarter, but mining operations posted lower revenues, writes
Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Net profit was CDollars 11.2m (USDollars 8.3m), or 25 cents a share, against
CDollars 10.1m, or 20 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 243m,
against CDollars 241m.
The figure for all of 1993 was CDollars 33.9m, or 73 cents, against CDollars
39.4m, or 88 cents, on revenues of CDollars 955m, compared with CDollars
905m.
Mining operations are moving away from uranium to base metals.
Production has started at the Cerro Colorado project in Chile, which will
produce 90m pounds of high-quality cathode yearly.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Dell posts 'disappointing year'
with 43% decline

<TEXT>
Dell Computer, the US personal computer maker, yesterday unveiled a 43 per
cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings. But the company, which recovered from
losses in the first half of the year, surpassed Wall Street expectations.
Mr Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive, said nonetheless fiscal 1994
had been 'a very disappointing year' for the company.
Dell's results calmed Wall Street fears of slowing growth in the PC market.
On Wednesday, shares of PC companies dropped sharply when AST Research,
another PC maker, confirmed slower than anticipated sales growth in
February.
Dell reported earnings of Dollars 17.7m, or 39 cents a share, on revenues of
Dollars 742.9m for the fourth quarter. This compares with profits of Dollars
31.3m, or 77 cents, on sales of Dollars 620.3m in the same period last year.
For the year, the group posted a net loss of Dollars 35.8m, or Dollars 1.06,
compared with net income of Dollars 101.6m, or Dollars 2.59, in fiscal 1993.
Sales rose 43 per cent to Dollars 2.87bn in fiscal 1994 from Dollars 2.01bn
in fiscal 1993.
The 1994 loss resulted from a Dollars 71m second-quarter charge when Dell
was forced to withdraw its notebook computer products due to design flaws.
Mr Dell said the company's rapid growth over the past two years had secured
its position as 'one of the top five PC companies in the world', but also
brought 'some serious issues in our systems and processes'.
The company has made substantial progress in addressing these problems, he
said.
Gross profit margins in the fourth quarter were 18.6 per cent of sales,
against 20.5 per cent in the same period last year and 17.9 per cent in the
third quarter of the current fiscal year.
Dell yesterday closed at Dollars 27, up from Wednesday's close of Dollars 24
7/8 . Compaq Computer gained Dollars 3 5/8 to trade at Dollars 98. AST
Research edged up Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 23 3/4 .

<TEXT>
Wilhelm Wilhelmsen, the Norwegian shipowner, suffered a pre-tax loss of
NKr47m (Dollars 6.35m) for 1993, compared with a profit of NKr166m in 1992.
The loss was primarily due to weak markets in several shipping segments,
foreign currency losses on debt and an increase in pension obligations.
Nevertheless, the shipowner plans to lift its dividend to NKr1.50 from
NKr1.30.
Group turnover in 1993 rose to NKr3.58bn from NKr3.34bn while operating
profit, before financial and other items, advanced to NKr285m from NKr221m.
Financial items increased sharply to NKr194m from NKr55m. Wilhelmsen also
provided NKr138m to cover pension obligations.
Wilhelmsen said it had disposed of a 47.5 per cent shareholding in a
drilling rig which will bring a gain of NKr175m to the 1994 accounts.
Scancem, a 50-50 joint venture between Norway's Aker group and Sweden's
Euroc, is to buy a 49 per cent stake in Cimangola, an Angolan cement plant.
The deal, valued at NKr135m, of which Scancem will pay 50 per cent, also
involves an unnamed international cement producer.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Metall Mining suffers sharp fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metall Mining, the Toronto-based international mining arm of Germany's
Metallgesellschaft, suffered a sharp drop in fourth-quarter earnings as a
result of weak copper and zinc prices.
Net income fell to CDollars 4.3m (USDollars 3.2m) or six cents a share, from
CDollars 9.8m, or 18 cents, a year earlier. Figures for the latest period
include a CDollars 19m gain from the sale of an investment, compared with a
similar gain of CDollars 6.5m last year.
Revenues climbed to CDollars 140.3m from CDollars 104.4m, reflecting
Metall's recent purchase of its parent company's copper smelting and
refining interests.
Metallgesellschaft has indicated that it planned to sell its 50.1 per cent
stake in Metall as part of its financial restructuring. However, the
disposal is complicated by arrangements between Metallgesellschaft and its
partners in various joint ventures in which the parent's stake has been
bundled into Metall. Some partners also hold a right of first refusal on
Metall's stake in their ventures.
Metall said that prices received by Copper Range, an integrated producer in
Michigan, fell to an average of 90 US cents per pound last year from
USDollars 1.03 in 1992. This was partly offset by a drop in cash costs for
cathode produced from Copper Range ore to 79 cents from 82 cents.
Feasibility studies are continuing at the Izok Lake property in Canada's
Northwest Territories, the largest undeveloped copper and zinc deposit in
North America. But Metall cautioned that transportation of concentrates from
the remote site 'remains a major issue'.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Slow Canadian recovery reflected
in CIBC results
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce lifted first-quarter income by 27 per
cent, due largely to strong contributions from investment banking, mutual
funds and credit cards.
But like most of Canada's other big five banks which have reported over the
past 10 days, CIBC's results reflect the relatively slow recovery in
Canadian business activity, compared with the US. Growth in credit demand
remains slow and there has been only a relatively modest drop in loan-loss
provisions.
The Canadian banks have been buoyed, however, by their strongly-performing
securities-dealing subsidiaries and their ballooning mutual funds business.
CIBC's earnings rose to CDollars 214m (USDollars 159.7m), or 86 cents a
share, in the three months to January 31, from CDollars 169m, or 74 cents, a
year earlier.
Return on equity improved to 11.6 per cent from 10.6 per cent. Return on
assets rose to 0.59 per cent from 0.54 per cent. CIBC, which is Canada's
second-biggest financial institution, had total assets of CDollars 144.4bn
on January 31, 6 per cent higher than a year ago.
Loan-loss provisions charged against income were unchanged at CDollars 220m,
although estimated loan losses of CDollars 880m for the year as a whole are
lower than the CDollars 920m posted in fiscal 1993. Non-performing loans
fell for the fourth consecutive quarter to CDollars 2.2bn, or 2.1 per cent
of total loans, from CDollars 3.1bn, or 3 per cent of total loans, last
year.
The loan-loss record of most Canadian banks has recently been distorted by
transfers of surpluses on the market value of their Third World debt
portfolios.
One analyst predicted yesterday that the banks would continue to use
surpluses on their LDC debt and other securities holdings to smooth overall
earnings trends over the next year or so.

<TEXT>
Details of the first public flotation by a Swedish television company were
announced yesterday when TV4, the country's only commercial terrestrial
channel, published the prospectus for a SKr400m issue of a 20 per cent share
of the company.
The 4m shares are priced at SKr100 each and TV4 hopes to attract 35,000 new
investors. Applications will be taken between March 8 and March 18 and the
company will be listed in Stockholm.
TV4's biggest shareholder is the Swedish company Kinnevik, which also
controls TV3, a commercial cable channel. Investor, the main investment
vehicle of the Wallenberg family, also holds 25 per cent.
TV4 predicted a SKr175m (Dollars 21.8m) profit in 1994, following a profit
of SKr72m last year, but warned revenues could be hit if state-owned Swedish
TV, which runs two terrestrial stations, is allowed to run advertising.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cadillac Fairview, one of Canada's biggest commercial property groups, will
halt mortgage payments on at least six troubled properties to conserve cash
and speed a financial restructuring.
Fairview owns 74 large properties in Canada and the US, mainly shopping
centres, and including Toronto's downtown Eaton Centre and Vancouver's
Pacific Centre. The last two are generating enough cash to cover debt
payments.
Fairview was sold by the Montreal Bronfman family in 1987 to Chicago's JMB
Realty and 41 institutions. Since 1990 it has been hit by steeply falling
property values, lower rents and rising vacancies.
It owes CDollars 2.2bn (USDollars 1.64bn) on individual properties and has
CDollars 11bn of corporate debt.
A week ago Fairview said it was negotiating a restructuring with
shareholders and lenders and was considering asset sales and a public share
issue.
Mr Graeme Eadie, president, said as an interim measure Fairview would
segregate cash flow and liabilities for each of its 62 Canadian properties.
Hitherto revenues were pooled and cash flow from one property could support
others.
Interest and principal to mortgage holders and joint owners would be limited
to actual cash flow generated by an individual property, while trade
creditors would continue to be paid fully, Mr Eadie explained.
It means that Fairview could risk foreclosure attempts, analysts said.
Fairview is in talks with its lenders to obtain new financing to complete
the restructuring. The Toronto Dominion Bank is agent for the lenders.

Nike, the US running shoe company, has concluded a five-year licensing
agreement with Argentina's Alpargatas to distribute its products in
Argentina and Brazil.
Nike also formed a joint venture with Alpargatas, a leading clothing and
sportswear company, to market and distribute Nike products in Argentina and
Uruguay.
Alpargatas maintained it was appointed to take over the Nike franchise from
a Brazilian company because of its success in building up the business in
Argentina.
Mr Juan Avellaneda, the Alpargatas executive in charge of the Nike
operation, said his company had raised annual sales at a rate of 30 per cent
a year since 1990 to Dollars 70m last year.
Mr Avellaneda expects sales in Brazil to increase faster than in Argentina,
which he forecasts to grow at 15-20 per cent a year. Alpargatas will pay
Nike a 6 per cent royalty on sales.
The deal with Nike is the latest in an increasing number involving local and
multinational companies aiming to integrate operations in the region.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's private-sector banks yesterday issued a strong protest to the
government over the extent of state aid for Nordbanken, one of the
hardest-hit victims of the recent Nordic banking crisis. The bank has shot
back to profits since the state took over most of its bad loans.
In a letter to the Bank Support Authority, the Riksbank and the financial
inspection authorities, the Swedish Bankers' Association said the terms of
the bail-out for state-owned Nordbanken had given the bank an unreasonable
competitive advantage over rivals which had not had loan-loss or balance
sheet problems laundered by the state.
The association, led by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska
Handelsbanken, the leading commercial banks which did not receive direct
state aid, said the state should ultimately claw back the SKr90bn (Dollars
11.25bn) it has pledged to ailing banks.
Nordbanken has been the biggest beneficiary of the state rescue operation.
Bad loans worth SKr67bn were taken off its books and put into a state-run
company called Securum, which itself was capitalised through a SKr35bn state
injection. Nordbanken then received more than SKr16bn in capital from the
government to keep it solvent.
It has meanwhile become Sweden's biggest bank by market share after taking
over Gota Bank, another state-owned crisis victim. Gota has swallowed some
SKr30bn in aid and been relieved of bad loans worth SKr43bn.
The operation has left Nordbanken the most profitable Swedish bank. It is
expected to report a profit after loan losses in 1993 of around SKr3bn.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: DSM slashes dividend after loss
</HEADLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, tumbled into loss last year after suffering
a narrowing of profit margins in virtually all its product ranges. The
company is to cut its dividend from Fl 4.00 to Fl 1.50.
Results for 1993 fell into a net loss of Fl 118m (Dollars 62m) from a net
profit of Fl 224m in 1992, on turnover down nearly 10 per cent at Fl 8bn.
Average selling prices for DSM's products were 7 per cent lower in 1993 than
in 1992.
The company blamed the downturn on economic difficulties in Europe,
industry-wide overcapacity, and cheap imports from regions such as eastern
Europe. The strength of the guilder since the turmoil on European currency
markets in September 1992 also worked against DSM.
Mr Simon de Bree, chairman, described the results as 'downright poor'.
However, he said: 'It seems that we are past the lowest point now.' The
company expected to post an operating and a net profit for the first
quarter, he said, although he refrained from making any prediction for 1994
as a whole.
DSM's shares rose 3.8 per cent, to Fl 111.70, helped by the company's
decision not to omit the dividend altogether, as some analysts had expected.
The company said it had decided to pay a dividend because of its success in
reducing net debt, and its continued strong financial ratios.
These were possible partly because of income generated by divestments.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Chrysler investment plans grow
to Dollars 1.8bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Chrysler, the US motor manufacturer enjoying strong market share gains,
yesterday announced plans to spend Dollars 1.8bn - up from a previously
announced Dollars 1bn - to expand the production capacity of its
best-selling vehicles over the next two years.
The company said the Dollars 1.8bn would increase capacity by some 500,000
units a year, to around 3.5m vehicles by 1996, and could add around 6,000
new jobs at its plants in the US and Canada.
Last September the company approved a Dollars 1bn programme to remove
production bottlenecks and the additional Dollars 800m it is now committing
is in response to continued strong demand for its products, particularly its
new Dodge Ram pick-up trucks and its Jeep Grand Cherokee sports utility
vehicles.
The move, which comes against a background of global vehicle overcapacity,
underlines Chrysler's strong financial and market-share recovery from the
1991 US recession, when it appeared close to a financial crisis.
The recovery has been due to a succession of innovatively-styled new
vehicles, strong cost controls, and an improvement in the US vehicle market.
The US industry announced yesterday that cars sold at an annual rate of 7.3m
units in February, the same as January and up from 6m units a year ago.
Truck sales were 6m units, up from 4.7m the previous February.
Chrysler's action yesterday includes keeping open its St Louis North
assembly plant, which is making its popular mini-vans. It had previously
intended to close the plant in January 1995, switching production of a new
generation mini-van to a second plant in St Louis.
However, the North plant will now be reopened in the third quarter of next
year to build up to 130,000 Ram trucks a year. The move will add around
1,500 employees in a programme costing Dollars 300m.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Deficit deepens at Van Roll

Von Roll, the Swiss steel and engineering group, revealed that losses
ballooned last year to SFr441m (Dollars 306.25m), following losses of SFr55m
in 1992 and SFr30m in 1991. Sales eased 6 per cent to SFr1.9bn.
In a show of rare candour for an industrialist, Mr Heinz Frech, the retiring
managing director, admitted that 'we have made some very grave errors'.
The trading loss of SFr106m, compared with a budgeted SFr10m profit, was a
'fiasco', Mr Frech said, while restructuring charges of SFr333m were causing
a liquidity haemorrhage.
The group is closing a steelworks and a forge in Switzerland, at a cost of
SFr98m. It has disposed of a venture into producing monorail trains,
described by Mr Frech as a debacle, at a cost of SFr50m.
'We clearly underestimated the international complexity of the monorail
business, and poorly evaluated the market potential and likely order flow,'
he said.
Rationalisation at the Isola wire and cable subsidiary, acquired in 1989 to
offset the steel and building cycles, absorbed a further SFr96m.
And there were more charges on a toxic waste disposal plant in the US. The
plant, which started up two years late because of blocking manoeuvres by
environmentalists had, Mr Frech said, been hit by a run of bad luck. Some of
the plant's sensitive equipment froze during a cold snap.
Shareholders' funds, following a SFr300m boost from a revaluation of fixed
assets and liquidation of hidden reserves, were SFr351m at the end of 1993,
14.5 per cent of total assets. Mr Max Amstutz, incoming managing director,
said the group aimed to break even this year.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Germans hear the Philips riot
act - Grundig and PKI are dragging their feet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost-cutting programme at Philips, the Dutch electronics company, has
finally swung away from its home town of Eindhoven to focus on a new target,
the southern German town of Nuremberg.
After making severe cuts in jobs, mostly at Eindhoven, during nearly four
years of drastic restructuring, Philips has clearly lost patience with the
slow pace of change in Nuremberg, where its two main German companies are
located.
Mr Jan Timmer, Philips' president, seized the opportunity at yesterday's
annual press conference to deliver a broadside against the sluggishness of
reforms at Grundig, the German consumer electronics group, and Philips
Kommunikations Industrie (PKI), a supplier to the telecommunications
industry.
He issued what he described as an 'urgent appeal' for 'the greatest possible
realism'. German unions have been resisting Philips' efforts to prune its
German operations. At Grundig alone, management wants to cut 4,000 out of
15,000 jobs.
Mr Timmer said: 'We believe that the survival of a whole company is more
important than short-term job losses.' He insisted that Philips intended to
maintain Grundig's name and identity, but said this could not be done
without a drastic reduction in costs.
His frustration stems from the fact that the continued heavy losses in
Germany were the only significant flaw in yesterday's much-improved 1993
results. The company's good news - including the return to a net profit of
Fl 856m (Dollars 441m) on normal business operations from a net loss of Fl
900m the previous year - was capped by the announcement of a 1993 dividend
of Fl 0.50, the first since the Fl 2.00 paid out of 1989 profits.
The problem in Germany is most glaring at Grundig, which is expected to
report net losses of DM350m (Dollars 205.9m) for its year ending March, 16
per cent worse than the previous year. The downturn comes when the Philips
group, excluding Grundig, managed to reduce operating losses in consumer
electronics to just Fl 73m from Fl 553m a year earlier.
This is all the more irritating to Philips because it is bound by a
long-standing agreement to pay DM50m a year in dividends to the Grundig
family foundation, regardless of the German company's performance. Although
Philips owns only 31.6 per cent of Grundig, it fully consolidates the
company in its accounts, and has complete management control.
PKI, by contrast, is blamed by Philips for the sharp decline in results in
the group's professional products business, where operating profit slumped
to Fl 177m from Fl 663m in 1992, reflecting reduced investment by the German
telecommunications authorities.
Mr Timmer contrasted the slow pace of change in Germany with the sacrifices
made by the more than 60,000 people who have lost their jobs within the
Philips group since 1990. 'Equally, it is not acceptable to Philips
shareholders, who also end up paying for Grundig's losses, that the process
of change at this company continues to take a long time,' he said.
Germany's position behind the rest of the Philips world is partly blamed on
the short-lived euphoria that accompanied German unification, which
coincided with company's concerted shake-up of its internal culture in 1990.
Events of that time tempted local workers to think they would be immune from
changes sweeping the company worldwide.
Despite the German problems, Philips had reached an important milestone in
its 'Centurion' programme of restructuring, Mr Timmer said. The process,
however, would continue. 'It will not end . . . the company must be in a
permanent state of change,' he said.
In the three years since the end of 1990, Philips has raised profits,
excluding restructuring charges, to 5 per cent of sales, from 4.2 per cent
previously. Its return on net operating capital has improved to 13.2 per
cent from 8.5 per cent at the start of the operation. And, at the same time,
group debt has fallen to Fl 8.6bn from Fl 14.8bn.
Besides continuing to cut costs, Philips still needs to come up with ideas
to generate new businesses and income, Mr Timmer said.
Unfortunately, its restructuring of the early 1990s has coincided with deep
malaise on most of its important markets and in many of its business
sectors, including its biggest single business, consumer electronics.
Although the company has made progress on slimming down and becoming more
competitive, it continues to wait for an economic revival, particularly in
Europe, that will allow it to reap the full benefits of its efforts.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bertelsmann and Canal Plus agree
to join forces

<TEXT>
Bertelsmann, the German multimedia group, and Canal Plus, France's leading
pay-TV broadcaster, have agreed to form a joint venture to exploit the
expected proliferation of new television services around the world.
The move is intended to enable both companies to compete more effectively
with the rash of Anglo-Saxon multimedia ventures already established.
Bertelsmann is the largest multimedia group in the world after Time Warner,
and Canal Plus the largest and most profitable pay-TV broadcaster in France.
The deal will extend the co-operation between the two companies, already
partners in the first German pay-TV channel, Premiere, into future
cross-border exercises.
'It will ensure the development opportunities for both our enterprises in an
important future area for the electronic media, including forms of pay-TV,
pay-per-view, video-on-demand, and other special services,' they said.
Bertelsmann pointed out that private television channels - like the
company's highly-successful RTL channel in Germany - were reaching the
limits of financing available from broadcast advertising. New channels would
require new forms of financing.
The advent of digital television would enable the distribution of a new
variety of different channels and services, which would have to be financed
by viewers as they watched or used them.
It said the latest venture was the 'logical international extension' of last
week's agreement between Bertelsmann, Deutsche Telekom and KirchGroup, to
establish a service company to manage and distribute the future pay-TV and
other services on the existing German cable network.
The announcement of the deal comes at a turbulent time for the French group,
which last month became embroiled in a row over the sudden resignation of Mr
Andre Rousselet, its founder and chairman.

<TEXT>
Heineken, the Dutch brewing group, has agreed to pay Fl 77m for 24.9 per
cent of Zywiec, one of Poland's best-known breweries with an 8 per cent
share of the local market.
Heineken said it was not planning to increase further its holding in Zywiec,
which last year reported net profits of 155.7bn zlotys (Dollars 7m).
Yesterday, the stock exchange suspended trading in Zywiec shares to give
investors time to digest the news about the capital injection. The company
is presently capitalised at 5,800bn zlotys.
The Dutch brewer's planned partnership with Zywiec comes soon after Brau Und
Brunnen, the big German brewer, announced it controlled 25 per cent of
Okocim, another listed Polish brewery.
Heineken is taking its stake through an issue of new shares. Zywiec, advised
by Schroders, is to propose the share issue to a March 28 meeting of
shareholders, which include Invesco's CEAM investment fund.

Color Line, the Norwegian ferry group, reports a decline in 1993 pre-tax
profits, to NKr64m (Dollars 8.6m) from NKr81m in 1992, writes Karen Fossli
in Oslo. The setback stemmed from a weak performance in the first four
months, plus a write-off of NKr58m on a ferry which is to be sold.
Revenue rose to NKr1.81bn from NKr1.68bn. Operating income improved to
NKr429m from NKr426m. Color Line had a difficult start in 1993, with gross
operating profit for the first four months dipping by NKr36m, the company
said.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bensons Crisps declines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bensons Crisps, the Preston-based food manufacturer, suffered from the
growing price war in the grocery trade and reported pre-tax profits 66 per
cent lower at Pounds 302,000 for the year to November 30, against Pounds
500,000.
The company said there had been constant pressure on selling prices and
product mix throughout the period. It added that the climate was not
expected to change during the present year.
Turnover rose from Pounds 33.2m to Pounds 34.5m with growth in sales to
supermarkets and discounters making up for the decline to independents. Its
share of the crisps market grew by 3 per cent while snacks showed a 24 per
cent advance.
A tax credit of Pounds 279,000 (Pounds 99,000 charge) helped earnings per
share improve to 4.1p (5p). A maintained final dividend of 2.15p is
recommended for an unchanged total of 2.85p.

<TEXT>
Yorkshire Building Society, the UK's 12th largest, announced pre-tax profits
of Pounds 66.8m for 1993, an increase of 20 per cent, writes Alison Smith.
Net mortgage lending was down slightly at Pounds 850m (Pounds 873m),
reflecting competition societies have been facing from banks in this area.
Net retail receipts rose steeply, from Pounds 121m to Pounds 223m.
Total assets rose to Pounds 5.3bn (Pounds 4.8bn).
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts and liabilities fell 20 per cent to
Pounds 18.4m (Pounds 22.9m). This is not as sharp a fall as that recorded by
some other leading societies, but Yorkshire said this was partly
attributable to the way in which house prices had moved in the north of
England, as against the UK as a whole.
The cost/income ratio fell from 39.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent.
Mr Derek Roberts, chief executive, said that 1994 was 'unlikely to herald a
significant recovery in the core savings and mortgage markets' but the
consistency of Yorkshire's performance had enabled it to reduce operating
margins.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Gambling with a cool hand - ICI's foray
into the Japanese chemical market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive of Imperial Chemical Industries,
opens a new plant this morning in Mihara, near Hiroshima, he will be
gambling that his company can take on the Japanese on their own turf.
The gamble is all the more audacious because ICI is commissioning a plant in
Japan at a time when almost all indigenous chemicals manufacturers have
stopped adding domestic capacity.
Japan's chemical industry has been ravaged by a particularly long domestic
recession, high domestic operating costs and an ever-appreciating yen.
In addition, its main customers - the automotive, electronics and textiles
industries - are migrating to other Asian locations.
Most Japanese chemical companies have responded to the crisis by investing
outside their traditional domestic manufacturing bases and building plants
in south-east Asia.
The question remains why a British company believes it can succeed where
indigenous manufacturers are finding it hard to make money?
Mr Hampel is gambling that ICI can triumph with a product called HFC 134a.
This is designed as a substitute for ozone-depleting CFCs, production of
which is scheduled to be halted at the end of 1995.
HFC 134a, which is marketed under the brand name Klea, is used mainly for
refrigeration and air conditioning. The Pounds 50m factory, a 50-50
joint-venture with Teijin of Japan, will have initial annual capacity of
6,000 tonnes.
ICI is nothing less than ambitious. It intends to grab 20 per cent of the
Japanese HFC 134a market and a higher proportion elsewhere in the
Asia-Pacific region.
The company hopes to repeat the success already achieved in the US, where
market share is as high as 40 per cent - the highest ever achieved by an ICI
product, according to Mr Hampel.
That ICI is investing in Asia is not surprising.
Says Mr Hampel: 'Asia will get a higher proportion of our investment over
the next few years because of its superb growth potential.'
Last year 25 per cent of turnover was in the Asia-Pacific region - including
Australia. That compares with 22 per cent in the UK, a similar proportion on
the Continent, and 30 per cent in the US.
ICI's commitment to the Asia-Pacific area is demonstrated by its capital
investment there over the last three years.
At a time when capital spending has been severely rationed, the bulk has
been invested in the region.
Sir Denys Henderson, ICI chairman, has opened numerous Asian facilities.
These include a titanium dioxide plant in Malaysia, and pure terephthalic
acid and methyl methacrylate complexes in Taiwan. In three weeks' time, he
is to open a paints facility in China.
Mr Hampel is adamant that the decision to invest in Japan was the right one.
'The Mihara HFC plant puts our CFC-replacement business on a global footing.
It's the third piece in the global jigsaw.' The group is the only CFC
substitute manufacturer in Europe, the US and Japan, he adds.
Although the Japanese economy is in recession, the market remains extremely
important, says Mr Geoff Tudhope, managing director of ICI Fluorocarbons.
The initial targets will be the automotive and domestic refrigeration
industries.
'Once you have the blessing of the Japanese parent company, you can sell the
product to their subsidiaries anywhere in the world,' says Mr Tudhope.
The product has already been qualified by significant Japanese automotive
and electronics groups, although ICI declines to identify them.
ICI believes its technology will give it a sustainable competitive
advantage. The company has considerable expertise in the sophisticated
lubricants required for each different HFC application. It has set up a
technical centre at Tsukuba science city which can provide a complete
service for Japanese clients rather than just a product.
Other advantages accrue from having a technological base. 'It's tough to
manufacture in Japan. But our proprietary catalyst technology will enable us
to continue to run a low-cost plant, even though it's producing in Japan,'
says Mr Tudhope.
ICI is the only manufacturer of CFC alternatives to also make its own
catalysts. It believes its catalyst technology is far beyond that of its
competitors and will allow it to increase both product quality and plant
yield.
It expects that the catalysts should eventually allow global HFC 134a
capacity to be increased from 20,000 tonnes a year to 50,000 tonnes without
significant capital investment.
'The technology involved means this will not be a multi-producer commodity
chemical,' insists Mr Hampel.
Competitors include Du Pont and Allied Signal in the US, Elf Atochem in
France and Hoechst in Germany. In Japan, manufacturers include Asahi Glass,
Daikin, Showa Denku and a joint-venture between Du Pont and Mitsui. World
capacity is probably about 50,000 tonnes a year, according to ICI.
The world's CFC replacement market has not grown as quickly as expected,
admits Mr Tudhope. The recession meant many companies had delayed their
conversion. However, ICI's sales are running at a monthly rate equal to the
annual rate just a year ago, he says. The market is expected to tighten
considerably in 1995 and 1996.
Mr Hampel says the fluorocarbons business has been privileged to receive so
much investment. Like other ICI operations, it has been set aggressive
targets for return on capital.
Once Mr Hampel has cut the ribbon today, the factory must prove it can
achieve its goals, in spite of the handicap of manufacturing in one of the
world's most difficult markets.
Although the risks involved in Mr Hampel's gamble are high, ICI believes the
dice are loaded in its favour.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sales collapse leaves Linx Printing with
Pounds 391,000 loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A poor first quarter, during which sales in the US collapsed and European
sales slowed dramatically, cost Linx Printing Technologies any chance of
profitability at the halfway stage.
The Cambridgeshire-based manufacturer of continuous ink-jet printers,
returned a loss before tax of Pounds 391,000, compared with profits of
Pounds 763,000, on sales down 26 per cent to Pounds 4.27m (Pounds 5.75m).
Losses per share were 1.78p, compared with earnings of 3.7p. An interim
dividend of 0.25p is declared.
Mr Michael Keeling, managing director, said that sales in Europe had slowed
in the first quarter as distributors ran down stocks of printers when
recession started to bite.
The second quarter had shown an improvement and the company had traded
profitably but it was not enough to offset losses in the first three months.
Sales in the US slipped to Pounds 167,000 in the half year, compared with
Pounds 612,000 last time. Mr Keeling said that action had been taken to
redress the position although he was unwilling to spell out measures in
detail.
Linx, which came to the market in 1992, has been hit by a combination of
recession in its principal markets, increased competition from Videojet and
Domino and changes in the pattern of demand for continuous ink-jet printing.
It was also affected by the delayed launch of the 6000R printer; both the
printer and an environmentally-friendly ink were launched late last year,
and, Mr Keeling said, have been well received.
He added that trading improvements, noted in the second quarter, had
continued and he believed the company would make a profit in the full year.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Flotation price of 140p puts Pounds 193m
tag on MIN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Independent Newspapers, the regional newspaper group which publishes
the Birmingham Post, set its flotation price at 140p yesterday, giving a
market value slightly below expectations of Pounds 193m.
About 57 per cent of the company, or 77.9m shares, is being sold, of which
50.7m are being placed with institutions. A further 27.3m shares are being
offered to the public.
The net proceeds of Pounds 96m will be used to reduce borrowings of Pounds
139m, leaving gearing at 40 per cent. MIN incurred substantial debt to fund
the Pounds 125m management buy-out from Mr Ralph Ingersoll, the US
publisher, in 1991.
The group is coming to the market on a historic p/e multiple of 19.5, based
on pro forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.6m. This is a substantial discount
to the sector average of 29.9 times and the similar multiples of more
comparable regional newspaper groups such as Trinity International and
Johnston Press. It is also lower than the expected multiple of 21.
The yield is 2.5 per cent on an indicated dividend of 2.8p.
Mr Christopher Oakley, chief executive, said he was confident MIN would show
good growth as a quoted company on the back of margin improvements and an
upturn in advertising revenues. 'Our improvement will not just be related to
the economy,' he said.
MIN had made several acquisitions last year with lower than desired margins
which had yet to contribute a full year's profit. The group was also
developing links with cable companies to recycle information gathered
through the newspapers for a local television audience.
MIN's leaflet operation - which provides direct marketing services to
advertisers - was growing rapidly, said Mr Oakley.
COMMENT
MIN has been attractively priced, particularly in light of its exposure to
classified and recruitment advertising. It would also appear to be well
managed, having improved margins from 9 to more than 20 per cent during a
savage recession. Longer-term, however, there may be questions about the
regional newspaper market in general. This has seen a steady decline in its
share of advertising in recent years, in favour of other mediums such as
radio and cable. MIN's potential further out may depend in part on changes
to policy on media ownership - for example, allowing regional newspapers to
own local radio stations. Until then, there appears to be considerable
upside on the prospective p/e of 17.5 and pro forma forecasts of Pounds 17m
pre-tax.

In spite of a 30 per cent fall in sales to Germany and Japan, Renishaw, the
specialist measuring equipment group, reported only a slight decline in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.07m to Pounds 2.81m for the six months to

The shares were marked down 20p to 275p.
After an exceptional charge of Pounds 183,000 for restructuring costs,
profits were ahead 11 per cent from Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 2.24m. Net
interest receivable fell from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 573,000, reflecting
lower interest rates.
Total sales edged ahead from Pounds 22m to Pounds 23.3m; but ignoring
currency distortions, sales were flat.
Mr Alan Roberts, finance director, said the sales declines in Germany and
Japan had been offset by an increase of 15 per cent in sales to the US, the
single biggest market accounting for up to 40 per cent of group sales. Sales
in the UK were ahead 20 per cent, and sales in east Asia were improving.
Sales of the group's new scanning devices and Raman imaging microscopes were
doing well.
Mr David McMurtry, chairman, said the group was continuing to keep the
pressure on costs while increasing investment in new products and
longer-term marketing.
The group has invested almost Pounds 1.5m in a new manufacturing facility,
which should be fully on stream at the end of the month. It will both
increase capacity and improve efficiency.
New sales offices are being opened in Singapore and Beijing.
Mr McMurtry said the start of this year had seen increased sales and orders,
which would 'contribute significantly' to the second half.
Earnings per share fell from 4.4p to 4p. The interim dividend is maintained
at 2.5p.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: PizzaExpress surges to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asset disposals and Britain's growing appetite for fast food fuelled a surge
in profits at PizzaExpress, the restaurant group which came to the market
last year.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to December 31 were Pounds 3.1m on
turnover of Pounds 13.6m. The comparable profits of Pounds 55,000 on
turnover of Pounds 3.8m related solely to trading by Star Computer, the
group's reverse takeover vehicle.
Mr Glen Tomlinson, finance director, said profits at PizzaExpress had been
boosted by Pounds 1.14m from the disposal of the computer business last
autumn. After accounting for an interim operating loss of Pounds 285,000,
funds received were Pounds 858,000.
Mr Tomlinson added that profits of Pounds 2.1m on continuing catering
operations represented a significant improvement, although no comparable
interim figures were available.
Turnover in the 32 wholly-owned restaurants increased 17 per cent. Sales by
the 39 franchised outlets increased 11 per cent, while turnover by the
wholesale division rose 7 per cent.
As part of a strategy to increase the number of wholly owned restaurants,
the company said it planned to open four new outlets by June this year at a
total cost of up to Pounds 1m.
Earnings per share came out at 2.9p (0.8p) and it is to pay a second interim
dividend of 0.5p. An initial interim of 0.5p was announced last September in
lieu of a final payment.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wyevale grows 26% to Pounds 4.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wyevale Garden Centres, the UK's largest garden centre group, yesterday
announced a 26 per cent increase, from Pounds 3.54m to Pounds 4.45m, in
pre-tax profits for the 1993 year, aided by lower interest payments and a
gradual increase in consumer spending.
Sales expanded by 6 per cent to Pounds 36.6m (Pounds 34.6m), boosted by a
2.5 per cent increase in customers numbers.
The results were in line with forecasts, but the share price fell 4p to
180p.
Following a successful Pounds 10.9m rights issue in November, gearing has
been reduced from 36 per cent to 4 per cent; the company is now looking to
enlarge its sales network.
Mr Brian Evans, chief executive, said: 'We want to expand the number of
outlets and improve on current sites.' The company has invested Pounds 1.2m
in acquiring the 10 acre Challis Garden Centre in York, and is looking for
other similar opportunities, in addition to expanding and refurbishing
existing centres.
Interest payments fell from Pounds 1.42m to Pounds 961,000 as a result of
declining interest rates and improving cash balances. Following the rights
issue, Wyevale had money market deposits of Pounds 5.5m at the year end and
Mr Evans said acquisitions would be funded from internal resources.
Earnings per share were 9.7p (7.8p). A proposed final dividend of 1.65p
brings the total to 4.4p, a 10 per cent rise.
Wyevale also announced that Mr John Rudgard, group managing director of HP
Bulmer, will join its board as a non-executive director.

Sir Keith Stuart, chairman of Associated British Ports, at the company's
most important property investment project, Capital Waterside at Cardiff,
part of the redevelopment of Cardiff Bay.
The chairman said the scheme was making excellent progress. In the autumn of
1993, the Welsh Health Common Services Authority took occupation of
Crickhowell House, their new 150,000 sq ft offices, and work was also well
under way on 119,000 sq ft offices for NCM Credit Insurance on an adjacent
site. Sir Keith said all sectors of ABP's business had done well: 'The
prospects are now set fair for us to perform well on a sustained basis in
the years ahead.'

The company said the result was satisfactory in difficult trading.
Turnover increased from IPounds 16.6m to IPounds 17.4m.
Interest received fell to IPounds 242,000 (IPounds 592,000) resulting from

Helped by improved exports, Record Holdings achieved a jump in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 2.41m in 1993.
The Sheffield-based toolmaker attributed the rise to an improvement in

reorganisation costs.
Turnover rose from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 29.4m. There was a 6 per cent fall
in the home market but exports advanced 15 per cent to Pounds 14.4m (Pounds

Earnings were 4.5p (1.7p). The dividend is held at 3.6p including a 2.45p

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Rhino advances to Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rhino Group, the fast-growing USM-quoted specialist video and computer games
retailer, yesterday reported a sharp increase in full year profits boosted
by acquisitions and strong organic growth.
Pre-tax profits for the group, which acquired 30 Virgin Games Stores for
Pounds 12.5m from Richard Branson's Virgin Group and WH Smith in November
and now has 77 stores in the UK and Ireland, jumped to Pounds 2.03m in 1993
from just Pounds 154,000 last time, on sales of Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 4.81m).
Basic earnings per share increased to 2.49p (0.39p), equivalent to 2.33p on
a fully diluted basis, and an initial 0.5p final dividend is proposed.
The Virgin Games Stores deal, funded through a 5-for-9 rights issue priced
at 44p, has enabled the group to accelerate its own development plans which
set a target of 130 stores in three years.
Commenting on the outlook Mr Bev Ripley, chairman, said; 'Our plan is well
under way to open a further 40 Future Zone stores in 1994. The board is
confident we will have another excellent trading year'.
Last year the group pursued an aggressive opening programme increasing the
number of Future Zone stores from 5 at the start of 1993 to 47 stores by
Christmas.
Despite gloomy comments from some high street traders about video game sales
in the run-up to Christmas, Mr Ripley said Future Zone's like-for-like sales
were up about 20 per cent. He said there has been a substantial shift in
market share away from non-specialist retailers to Future Zone and other
specialists, 'who have increasing competitive advantages as the product
range becomes more complex'.
After climbing to a peak of 67p in December, Rhino's shares had slipped back
to trade under 40p in recent weeks. Yesterday they closed up 5p at 43p.

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Colm Barrington, president and managing director of GE Capital Aviation
Services, has announced his resignation from the company to form his own
Dublin-based aircraft management company.
Mr Barrington said that he plans to merge his new company 'with a major
international investment company' which will provide the finance for a new
fleet of aircraft, which will then be leased.
He said that he had been considering his move for some time, and had an
agreement with Gecas that he would review his position after four months. Mr
Herb Depp was recently appointed worldwide chief executive of Gecas.
Gecas was set up in November last year as a wholly owned subsidiary of GE
Capital Services, following the restructuring of GPA, the Shannon-based
aircraft leasing company.
GPA had run into serious financial difficulties following its aborted 1992
flotation. Under the restructuring deal, Gecas acquired 44 aircraft from GPA
for Dollars 1.35bn (Pounds 920m), while the remaining 420 aircraft in the
GPA fleet - still owned by GPA - came under Gecas management.
GPA yesterday announced a third-quarter loss of Dollars 18.2m, making total
losses of Dollars 48.6m for the nine months to December 31. The company
reported outstanding debts of Dollars 5.8bn and a net worth of Dollars 195m.
Mr Barrington joined GPA in 1981 and had been a key figure in arranging the
finance for the fleet during its rapid expansion. He also developed GPA's
aircraft securitisation programmes which contributed Dollars 1.5bn in
revenues to GPA. In 1992 he was also appointed GPA's chief operations
officer.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wills Group, a maker of high-specification engineering products, is buying
Algo, a distributor of high pressure valves, for an initial Pounds 5m.
The consideration will be satisfied by the issue of 18.2m new shares, of
which 2.18m will be retained by Algo's vendors.
Deferred consideration of up to Pounds 1.2m is profit-related.
Wills also plans to raise about Pounds 2.05m before expenses, through an
institutional placing of 7.47m new shares at 27 1/2 p apiece through Greig
Middleton.
It is also placing, at the same price, 16m of the shares issued in
connection with the Algo acquisition.
At the same time Wills announced the acquisition of a 73 per cent stake in
Comint, a Spanish representative for overseas makers of engineering
products, for up to Pta210m (Pounds 1m).
These purchases follow the recent acquisitions of SI Industries, a maker of
beer cooling equipment, acquired from the administrative receivers for
Pounds 650,000 cash, and Cellar Services Technology, a designer and seller
of dispense equipment, acquired for Pounds 60,000 cash.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Life Sciences disappoints with 12% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life Sciences International, the laboratory equipment company headed by LWT
chairman Sir Christopher Bland, disappointed the City yesterday with a 12
per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 23m for 1993. Analysts had
been expecting nearer Pounds 26m and the shares fell 15p to 140p.
Excluding acquisitions, profits were down 11 per cent, the first fall since
the current management team was brought in by Robert Fleming, the merchant
bank, almost seven years ago.
Sir Christopher, who described the setback as 'more of a belch than a
hiccup' said the company now had 'a lot to prove'.
'1993 was the year in which the continuing worldwide recession had a
significant impact on the laboratory equipment markets, which up to that
point had appeared relatively recession-resistant.'
He said the US market grew broadly in line with inflation but that France,
Germany, Italy and Canada were all 'very disappointing'. The UK was the only
'robust' market. Earnings per share rose by just 3 per cent to 9.4p (9.1p)
but the dividend is up 10 per cent to 3.9p (3.55p) via a proposed final of
2.5p (2.35p).
Sales from continuing operations rose 16 per cent to Pounds 129m but
excluding the translation effect of the stronger dollar growth slowed to
just 3 per cent. Trading profits from continuing operations fell from Pounds
19.6m to Pounds 17.5m, after a 25 per cent drop in the second half.
Profits were hit by Pounds 1.6m of provisions covering settlement of a
longstanding lawsuit and write-downs on the value of demonstration equipment
in the US. Sir Christopher said that management had taken steps to improve
financial controls, particularly in the US.
Acquisitions during the year contributed trading profits of Pounds 6.16m on
sales of Pounds 25.5m. Most of this related to Labsystems, the Finnish
pipette maker acquired for Pounds 33.5m in June.
Sir Christopher said that despite the setback the acquisition of Labsystems
had made management 'more confident about our position in the market than at
any time in the past'. Labsystems brought the group a strong presence in
continental Europe, the former eastern bloc and Japan.
COMMENT
Shareholders in Life Sciences, Sir Christopher Bland's other company, have
done rather less well than investors in LWT. While LWT shares have provided
a compound annual rate of return of more than 60 per cent over the past four
years Life Sciences' have offered little more than 10 per cent. Over the
past two years the shares have lagged the market by about 40 per cent and
yesterday's figures justified investors' caution. The top management was
clearly surprised by the impact of recession on the Continent and must also
take some of the blame for lax financial controls in the US, though
Labsystems looks an increasingly good acquisition. The current year has
started well and assuming profits of about Pounds 28m the rating drops to
just 13. But, as Sir Christopher admits, the company now has a lot to prove.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Triplex buys John Williams
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Triplex Lloyd, the West Midlands-based industrial engineering group, is
expanding its automotive castings activities through the purchase of John
Williams Foundry from the receiver for Pounds 2.6m cash, equal to net asset
value.
Cardiff-based Williams is a specialist alloy iron foundry and a leading
manufacturer of turbocharger housings.
Mr Colin Cooke, Triplex chairman, said: 'Our automotive division is now
well-equipped to take full benefit from the growth in the turbocharger
market both in the UK and overseas.'
The increase in working capital is anticipated to be some Pounds 1m over the
next three months as the administration is unwound. Triplex plans to invest
Pounds 500,000 to 'ensure the foundry is adequately equipped.'

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BBA sells plastics offshoots for Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBA, the engineering and motor components group, yesterday embarked on the
first stage of a wide-ranging disposal programme with the sale of three
engineering businesses to United Industries, the precision tools and springs
manufacturer.
The move follows the group's decision to focus on four core businesses and
sell up to 12 subsidiaries with a combined turnover of Pounds 200m.
United, in which BBA holds a 21.23 per cent stake, has agreed to pay Pounds
25m cash for Holden Hydroman, Perplas and Railko - all manufacturers of
plastic and polyurethane components.
The Leicester-based group said the acquisitions, funded by a Pounds 26m
placing and open offer, would transform it from a small specialist company
with a market capitalisation of Pounds 6m into an operation worth more than
Pounds 40m.
Mr Tom Brown, United's chief executive, confirmed that BBA would be taking
part in the 1-for-5 offer - involving a total of 186m new ordinary shares at
15p each - to maintain its existing stake.
'This is a mutually beneficial deal to both companies. It allows us to grow
and BBA to refocus,' said Mr Brown.
BBA, which is expected to report annual profits before tax and exceptional
items of about Pounds 54m (Pounds 47.4m) next Monday, also welcomed the
transaction.
Mr Roberto Quarta, chief executive, said the group intended to concentrate
of improving profitability of its automotive, industrial and aviation
operations.
The former BBA companies, which made a combined operating profit of Pounds
2.86m (Pounds 828,000) in 1993, are expected to bolster profits at United,
which admitted that it had been struggling to overcome the effects of
recession.
United incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.5m on sales of Pounds 19.2m in
the nine months to December 31 last year, against a deficit of Pounds 3.63m
on sales of Pounds 29.6m in the 12 months to April 3.
United warned that it would not be paying a final dividend for the second
successive year.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Titaghur losses up to Pounds 2.14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The accumulated deficit at Titaghur, owner of six jute mills in Calcutta,
rose to more than Pounds 63m following an interim loss of Pounds 2.14m on
turnover of Pounds 15m for the six months to September 30. The comparable
figures were losses of Pounds 426,000 on turnover of Pounds 12.1m.
Mr Reg Brealey, chairman, referred in his statement to the same adverse
trading conditions that hit the full-year results, announced in January. He
blamed 'a shortage of raw materials and a massive increase in their cost
over the harvest purchase price'.
He does not envisage any significant improvement in the second half.
However, he sees the benefits of recent negotiations with trade unions and
Indian authorities coming through in the year to end-March 1995.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Galliford slips to Pounds 267,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Galliford, the Midlands-based contractor and
housebuilder, slipped further from Pounds 327,000 to Pounds 267,000 during
the six months to end-December.
The decline was in spite of a 42 per cent profits rise to Pounds 1.3m from
private housebuilding and a return to the black by the merchanting division.
The company said that contracting operations continued to face strong
competition for work and had incurred a loss during the first half.
Mr Richard Miles, chairman, said: 'The board expects the second half to
continue to be difficult.'
Turnover of continuing operations fell from Pounds 109.3m to Pounds 102.5m.
Earnings per share dipped from 0.27p to 0.2p leaving the interim dividend,
unchanged at 0.5p, uncovered, requiring a Pounds 265,000 transfer from
reserves.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Irish union opposed to C&amp;W telecom bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The bid by Cable and Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, to form an
alliance with Telecom Eireann, the Irish state operator, faces stiff
opposition from Ireland's communications workers' union.
But pressure on Telecom Eireann to conclude a deal with C&amp;W appears set to
increase as its domestic monopoly comes under further assault from new
operators targeting the lucrative Dublin business market.
Mr David Begg, general secretary of the CWU, said yesterday that his union
would fight the creation of any joint venture between TE and C&amp;W. 'All the
information we have about C&amp;W is very negative: they are very anti-union;
their commercial focus is to develop the Asia-Pacific market, and this does
not suggest a level of commitment to Telecom Eireann,' he said.
C&amp;W's bid, believed to be worth up to IPounds 500m (Pounds 480m), is for a
joint venture with TE, the core of which would be TE's existing
international traffic.
The government insisted yesterday it would not be party to the privatisation
of TE. A spokesman for Mr Dick Spring, the deputy prime minister and Labour
party leader, said 'The government . . . is considering strategic alliances
but no decision will be made until there is full consultation with the
unions'.
Mr Begg said that the CWU was 'not opposed in principle' to strategic
alliances being formed with other telecommunications companies, but was
'deeply concerned' if this involved the 'siphoning off' of the most
profitable parts of TE's business.
However, TE already faces acute pressure on its international business from
companies - including Cable and Wireless - offering large Dublin businesses
leased lines for international traffic priced below TE's international
tariffs.
The latest entrant to the market is E-Sat, a private Irish company, which
last month launched an international leased-line business in alliance with
Sprint, the US long-distance carrier.
E-Sat, which already has 10 customers, is pitching at companies spending
more than Pounds 3,000 a month on international telecoms. It claims its
charges are between 10 and 30 per cent cheaper than those charged by TE.
The EU's telecommunications services directive obliges state companies to
make leased lines available to companies wishing to re-sell them, providing
they are not used to carry traffic originating on the public network.
Mr Douglas Goldschmidt, E-Sat's chief executive, said: 'TE already faces
stiff competition in its home market: it cannot shield behind its monopoly
for much longer.'
In a bid to stem the loss of international traffic, TE sharply reduced its
international tariffs last September, increasing local charges.
But it is still struggling with a high cost base. According to a recent
survey by Lehman Brothers, TE has lower labour productivity than any other
national telecoms company in the EU, with more than twice as many employees
per line as the Netherlands and France.

A strong second half helped Inishtech, the Dublin-based maker of disposable
hygiene and protective packaging and self adhesive labels, lift pre-tax
profits 11 per cent to IPounds 8.1m (Pounds 7.8m) in 1993. Profits in 1992
were IPounds 7.28m.
Sales improved from IPounds 52.7m to IPounds 60.3m. After tax of IPounds
1.59m (IPounds 1.2m) and a IPounds 661,000 (IPounds 713,000) charge for
goodwill amortisation, earnings per share amounted to 35.6p (32.8p).
Adjusted earnings were 39.6p (37.1p).
At the interim stage the directors indicated they would recommend a final
dividend of 4.75p. However, in light of the improved trading conditions they
are now recommending a final of 5.5p, making a total of 8p (6.05p).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flemings is launching the first UK-listed investment trust concentrating on
India. It will be a single country fund, rather than covering the
sub-continent.
The launch announcement has been delayed several weeks through problems with
India's imposition of both short-term and long-term capital gains tax on
foreign investors, except through Mauritius. The problems have been
resolved.
The trust hopes to raise Pounds 100m or more, to be raised through a
placing, starting within a few weeks, and a public offer, possibly in May.
The fund will be managed from Hong Kong by Jonathan Boyer, who already
manages the Hong Kong-registered Jardine Fleming India unit trust. Research
will come from Jardine Fleming's Bombay office.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Mercury trust is largest ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury's European Privatisation investment trust was less than Pounds 4m
oversubscribed, but has still become the largest investment trust ever
launched.
The trust's maximum size was set at Pounds 575m after Pounds 325m had been
raised in a placing.
The similar Kleinwort European privatisation trust was oversubscribed by
Pounds 380m when it closed a month ago, after setting its limit at Pounds
500m.
However, it had a part-paid structure, with the balance due in August. The
Mercury trust is fully paid. Both will invest in existing and forthcoming
privatisations.
More than 43,000 individual applications, totalling Pounds 158.5m, were made
in the public offer for the Mercury trust, with an additional Pounds 95.4m
from an intermediaries offer. Only the largest applications in the public
offer will be scaled back; those for less than Pounds 15,000 will be met in
full.
About Pounds 57m of the applications were for shares to be held in Mercury's
own personal equity plan.
Mr Lough Callahan, Mercury Asset Management's director of investment trusts
said: 'It is astonishing to raise a sum of this magnitude when world equity
markets have been under considerable downward pressure.
'We believe this volatility has deterred more speculative investors who
might have considered stagging the offer.'
Dealings in packages of five shares with one warrant attached are due to
start on March 11. Separate trading in the shares and warrants will follow
on April 25.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Micro Focus 4% down and shares fall further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Micro Focus, the Berkshire-based software house which has seen its share
price plummet from Pounds 30 to less than Pounds 10 in 12 months, reported a
4.4 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for the year to January 31 despite
higher sales.
The shares fell a further 30p to 970p.
About 20 per cent of the company's stock is held as ADRs and it reports in
both sterling and dollars. Pre-tax profits came to Pounds 21.8m (Pounds
22.8m), or Dollars 32.5m (Dollars 38.5m). Sales were Pounds 83.8m (Pounds
68.9m), a 21.6 per cent rise in sterling but only 5.8 per cent in dollars.
Earnings, fully diluted, were 101.2p (106.5p).
In keeping with US practice for high technology companies, Micro Focus does
not pay a dividend, preferring to reinvest in the company. It spends about
19 per cent of revenues on research and development.
Micro Focus develops and markets software tools which make it easier for
programmers to write software. It has a special expertise in Cobol, the
commonest computer language for business applications.
Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman, said costs had been on budget while sales had
lagged, resulting in an earnings shortfall. 'This was caused by less than
planned sales of our products for development of MVS applications on IBM
mainframes.'
These products represented about 50 per cent of the company's business. The
problem was that customers were confused over the future of mainframe
computers. Mr O'Grady said that sales of the company's pc networking tools
were growing at more than 340 per cent a year.
COMMENT
The share price has been traditionally heavily influenced by US shareholders
who are both more knowledgeable and more volatile than UK investors, but
there is no disguising the City's irritation with Micro Focus. Despite its
proven ability to develop excellent software tools while keeping tight
control of overheads, the company somehow fails to inspire confidence.
Management is being strengthened, however, by the return of Mr Brian
Reynolds, a founder, as joint chief executive with Mr O'Grady. The real
question is: how much life remains in the mainframe applications market?
Data processing is subject to fads and fashion but both mainframes and Cobol
are probably safe for the foreseeable future. While customers make up their
minds, however, Micro Focus may have problems returning to growth. Earnings
are likely to be flat next year. The p/e is an undemanding 9.3, however, and
there should be value in the interest shown in the company's pc networking
tools.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: QMH shareholder loses attempt to delay EGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court yesterday turned down an attempt by a Queens Moat Houses
shareholder to obtain an injunction delaying next Tuesday's extraordinary
meeting.
The meeting was called to confirm the hotel group's Pounds 2bn borrowing
limit and was needed to rectify mistakes at previous annual meetings when
one class of shareholder was not allowed to vote on some resolutions.
Mr Dennis Woodhams, one of the leaders of the QMH shareholders' action
group, had applied for the injunction. It would have delayed the EGM until
the planned meeting when the group's refinancing proposals are put to
shareholders. No date has yet been set for this meeting.
The court turned down the application and ordered Mr Woodhams to pay QMH's
costs.
One of the resolutions put down for next week's meeting releases the present
directors from any liability in respect of the failure to give votes to the
class of shareholders. The mistakes date back to 1989; the current directors
were all appointed in the last year.
Mr John Bairstow, former chairman, yesterday said the question of releasing
directors from liability should be discussed separately at the meeting.
He also questioned why the release only covered present directors, which
would exclude himself. QMH said it did not need to apply to former directors
as the accounts were adopted in September when the new board was in place.
In another move, Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank which was originally one of
QMH's lenders, countered reports of a row between it and other creditors
following the sale of its Pounds 25m exposure to QMH. Credit Suisse is
believed to have sold the debt at 17 per cent of face value.
It said it had kept other banks and the authorities informed of its decision
to sell last December.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Baltic returns to the black with Pounds
4.38m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baltic, the specialist finance company, yesterday announced its return to
the black in 1993, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.38m, compared with
losses of Pounds 6.55m last time.
At the year end, the company had net cash and investments of Pounds 26m and
a net asset value per share of 132p.
The turn-around was primarily the result of asset disposals, declining
interest rates, and a fall in provisions. Profits included a Pounds 1.54m
charge against bad and doubtful debts, compared with Pounds 11.1m in 1992.
The lending portfolio was further reduced with advances, instalment loans
and finance leases amounting to only Pounds 37.4m at the year end, compared
with Pounds 90m a year earlier, and Pounds 200m at the end of 1991.
With its lending activity declining, interest payments and similar charges
fell from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 534,000.
The company substantially cut back on leasing business during the year,
through the sale of two asset leasing subsidiaries for a total of Pounds
22.2m.
It subsequently invested Pounds 7.5m in a tender offer for 15 per cent of
its ordinary shares and 14.5 per cent of its convertible preference shares,
capitalising on their discount to net asset value.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 8p, against losses of 16.9p.
A recommended final dividend of 1p makes a total of 1.5p, a 50 per cent
increase.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Names change problems remain - Ladbroke's
1993 performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The traditionally secretive Ladbroke Group held its first ever press
conference yesterday. The projector that was used to show slides of the
company's 1993 performance was clearly so unaccustomed to the task that it
froze.
A promise of greater openness from the new management, headed by Mr John
Jackson, chairman, and Mr Peter George, chief executive, had helped push the
shares of the hotel, betting and DIY group up 29 per cent since the new
year.
Yesterday, the glow that has surrounded Ladbroke since the departure at the
beginning of the year of Mr Cyril Stein, its founder, began to fade.
The announcement of full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 62.1m after
exceptional items, compared with a restated Pounds 5.2m in 1992, led to a
further initial rise in the shares. But they then fell to close down 10p at
199p as the realisation set in that while the names at the top might be
different, several of Ladbroke's problems remain.
Recovery in the Hilton International hotel subsidiary was proving slow and
the Texas Homecare retail chain is beset with problems. Rumours that
Ladbroke had found a buyer for Texas proved unfounded. Mr Jackson said
Ladbroke remained committed to Texas for the long term. The impact of the
National Lottery on Ladbroke's Vernons football pools business is still
uncertain.
Mr Jackson and Mr George are thoroughly familiar with the group's
difficulties and opportunities. Mr Jackson has been a non-executive director
since 1980 and Mr George has been with the group for 30 years.
What has changed is that both now have the opportunity to run the group in a
way that Mr Stein, suspicious of scrutiny from outsiders, would never
permit. Mr Jackson yesterday said the board would answer any questions put
to them. He was true to his word.
Mr George's public confidence has grown since his appointment was announced
last September. Then, Mr George, whose lanky frame gives him the appearance
of a gawky schoolboy, seemed overawed at the responsibility he had
inherited. Yesterday, he gave every indication of having mastered his brief.
He now has to restore the group's businesses to health. The only sector to
show a substantial improvement was betting and gaming, where operating
profits before exceptionals rose from Pounds 68m to Pounds 86.1m.
The UK betting shops benefited from summer evening opening. The group has
also begun testing terminals which allow bets to be placed without having to
go up to the counter, as well as a computer system which allows customers to
see simulated races.
Prospects for the pools business are clouded by the National Lottery.
Ladbroke is an investor in Games for Good Causes, one of the bidders to be
lottery operator. Mr George has placed a bet at William Hill, one of his
rivals, that his consortium will win. He thinks the odds of 16-1 understate
Ladbroke's chances, but accepts that its consortium is not the favourite.
Mr George argues the lottery will not have an immediate effect on the habits
of traditional pools customers. Standing orders accounted for 39 per cent of
stakes last year. Mr George believes these customers are more likely to
remain loyal.
'The pools are such a habit. People have been doing it for so long and 95
per cent do the same numbers every week. There's a tremendous fear that the
day you stop is the day your numbers come up.'
He sees younger people who have not begun filling in pools coupons as a more
serious problem. They might prefer to buy lottery tickets instead.
Hilton International's operating profits slipped from Pounds 119.5m to
Pounds 117.7m. Hotels in London, Hong Kong, Shanghai, the Americas and the
Caribbean performed well. Continental Europe, however, is struggling through
recession, hotels in Japan were hit by the fall in corporate spending,
Australia shows few signs of improvement and business in Egypt has been
damaged by fundamentalist terrorism.
Nevertheless, Mr George argues that Hilton is the sort of brand that will
benefit from worldwide recovery. It is in the four to five star category,
cheaper than the luxury hotel market, and suitable for cost-cutting business
travellers.
Texas profits were Pounds 7.8m, compared with Pounds 43.6m. Mr John Coleman,
appointed Texas chief executive last September, has to deal with the
previous management's practice of assuming they would receive rebates from
suppliers for buying quantities of goods they were unable to sell.
The lines stocked by Texas are being cut by a quarter and the number of
suppliers is being reduced. But competition is fierce and Mr George admits
that service standards require substantial improvement.
Despite the group's protestations that it has a long-term commitment to
Texas, it is difficult to believe that Ladbroke would not have sold if
anyone had been prepared to pay for it.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Epwin rises 51% and 'committed to
expansion'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With good progress in all but the public sector contracting side of its
business, Epwin Group, the maker of PVC-u windows and doors, lifted pre-tax
profits by 51 per cent in 1993 to Pounds 4.68m. The shares responded with a
17p rise to 317p.
Furthermore, Mr Jim Rawson, chairman and managing director, said that the
group was committed to expansion by acquisition. It could, and would, grow
organically within its core windows and doors product area, but he said that
was not 'exciting' enough for the management below board level, and the
shareholders.
He said the board was looking for product areas like garage doors, porches
and shower screens - 'products not outside the markets we understand'. Mr
John Townsend, finance director, said the group was in a strong financial
position, having done well through the recession, and would have no
difficulty raising funds. He added the group would be happy to be 50 per
cent geared.
Turnover advanced 18 per cent to Pounds 50.9m (Pounds 43m). 'By selling
aggressively, we have gained market share,' Mr Townsend said.
The two-year Pounds 10m capital expenditure was now complete, though a
further Pounds 4m will be invested this year.
Earnings emerged at 15.17p (11.84p) per share and a proposed final dividend
of 5.2p makes a total 7.5p (6.8p), up 10 per cent.

FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Heron Intl seeks more time to pay interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heron International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group which completed a
Pounds 1.4bn refinancing last September, is asking lenders for more time to
pay interest due on March 31. It blamed 'difficult market conditions in
Europe' for its inability to pay on time.
It added that declines in European property values meant it could no longer
predict that its senior bonds would be repaid in full, and it was proposing
that a proportion of the bonds should be swapped into a lower ranking
convertible bond. Further it said that its Spanish banking facilities would
need to be renegotiated.
Heron is due to pay Pounds 16.4m of interest on its senior bonds, which were
issued as part of the refinancing, and a further Pounds 16.5m of a new money
facility, on March 31. It is seeking to delay payments until June 30. It
said it was negotiating property sales which should enable it to pay by
then.
Part of the problem lies in Heron's complex structure. While much of the
group's debt is owed by the head office company, many of its assets are held
by subsidiaries. Proceeds from asset sales by these subsidiaries, notably
Heron Corporation, cannot be passed up to the head office company until all
their debts are repaid.
Heron International has raised Pounds 200m through asset sales and has a
further Pounds 75m due to complete by the end of March. However, most of
this is from disposals from Heron Corporation. Heron International had been
making interest payments early as asset sales came through.
At the time of the restructuring some lenders believed it to be flawed. They
thought there was 'a fairly high probability of default' because it would
have taken a rise in property values even to service the senior debt.
Bondholders are to meet on March 31 to consider the interest delays. An
explanatory memorandum will be issued to bondholders before then.

FT  04 MAR 94 / First dividend cut at Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new management of the Ladbroke hotels, betting and do-it-yourself group
yesterday cut the dividend for the first time since it became a public
company in 1967.
Mr John Jackson, who has taken over from Mr Cyril Stein as chairman, said it
was no longer in the group's interest to continue paying dividends uncovered
by earnings.
The cut was part of full-year figures, which showed a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 62.1m, compared with Pounds 5.2m in 1992, after much lower
exceptional charges. Before exceptionals, the profit figure fell to Pounds
117.5m from Pounds 148.6m.
The final dividend was cut from 6.23p to 1.08p, bringing the total payout to
6p - 46 per cent down on 1992. It was covered by earnings per share before
exceptionals of 7.13p. However, earnings after exceptionals were 2.32p,
compared with a loss of 3.11p. Turnover for the year rose to Pounds 4.3bn,
from Pounds 4.2bn.
The Pounds 55.4m exceptional charges resulted from stock write-downs and
management reorganisation at Texas Homecare, and property revaluations.
The group reported that trading at its Hilton International hotels
subsidiary remained difficult, and that substantial pruning of product lines
was necessary at Texas. Mr Jackson said the group continued to talk to
potential buyers of its property division, which had flat profits, before
exceptionals, of Pounds 41.4m.
Year-end net debt fell from Pounds 1.34bn to Pounds 1.27bn. A Pounds 394.1m
reduction in the value of hotel and investment properties resulted in a rise
in gearing to 58 per cent from 53 per cent.
Ladbroke said, however, that in the first half of 1994, it would receive
Pounds 83m from property sales to Burford Holdings. A further Dollars 125m
(Pounds 85.6m) would be received in January 1995 from the surrender of
Hilton's management contract in Hong Kong. Taking these into account,
pro-forma gearing was 49 per cent.
Mr George said he was examining possible changes in the running of the
group's divisions and their relationship with Ladbroke head office.
Mr Tommaso Zanzotto, formerly of American Express, joined the group this
week as head of Hilton International. Mr Mike Smith, a main board member of
Bowater, will head the gaming and betting division from May. Mr John
Coleman, previously with Burton, has been running Texas since September.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Winning streak comes to an abrupt finish: Tracy Corrigan,
John Gapper and Sara Webb explain the risks taken by banks and securities
houses in proprietary trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN, JOHN GAPPER and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While hedge funds have been the scapegoats for recent heavy falls in the
world's bond markets, they are not the only market participants to have laid
and lost big directional bets.
Many banks and securities houses had backed their views on the bond markets
with their own capital. This practice, known as proprietary trading, has
become much more common in the past few years.
Proprietary trading helped boost the 1993 profits of many banks and
securities houses, particularly on Wall Street, to record levels. Unless
recent losses on European bond markets are recouped, the story could be
rather different this year.
'Last year the market was a one-way bet. Banks decided that since they were
so good at it, they should put up some more capital this year,' said one
trader.
The vogue for proprietary trading took off because banks saw the effect on
profits of successful dealing at Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs. With
bank boards focusing on efficient use of capital, proprietary trading became
increasingly attractive - especially as it required only a handful of
dealers and few support staff.
Nomura International in London, for instance, has started to use its Dollars
1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) capital for proprietary trading in the same way as the
US banks do. 'Using our strong capital is something that we forgot about for
a long time,' said Mr Koichi Kane, chairman of Nomura International. 'Now we
are putting a lot of emphasis on enhancing our returns on capital. Fixed
income trading has been one area that we have been adding to our
capability.'
One propietary trader said that while his bank aims for a return on capital
of about 20 per cent for its ordinary trading activities, it can achieve a
50-100 per cent return on capital used for proprietary trading.
For successful traders, the business has proved rewarding. Last year Salomon
made Dollars 416m in proprietary trading, compared with Dollars 1.15bn in
client business. That was in a relatively poor year, because of a big hit in
the US operation. The previous year, which an official described as more
representative, the profit was Dollars 1.4bn.
One large player, Tokai Bank's London-based operation, has capital of around
Pounds 250m mostly used for proprietary trading. 'Our return on capital last
year was over 100 per cent and that's because we have a diversified
portfolio of trades such as yield curve trades, basis trades and so on,'
according to Mr John Clark, at Tokai Capital Markets.
However, proprietary trading does have drawbacks: stock market analysts do
not like the earnings volatility. Salomon decided to publish its propietary
trading results separately because it felt its share price was suffering as
a result of uncertainty about that business. Firms such as Salomon and
Goldman Sachs emphasise that client business is still their core activity.
'Proprietory trading can play a role in profitability, but it is icing on
the cake,' says Mr Fredric Garonzik, managing director for fixed income at
Goldman Sachs in London.
However, it is acknowledged in the markets that a proprietary trading team
can benefit considerably from access to information about what big clients
are doing. The extent to which the proprietary trading and ordinary trading
businesses are kept apart varies from bank to bank. One proprietary trader
at a UK bank said: 'We do not hear about the customer business.'
But other houses point out that in a rumour-driven business, it is quite
likely that the proprietary trading desk would know and be able to act upon
client flows. 'What the bank wants is a combination of the economic view,
the smart trader and the comfort of a flow of information from customers,'
said one trader.
Despite widespread rumours on losses incurred, it is difficult to gauge the
overall amount of banks' exposure through proprietary trading. First, no one
knows exactly how much money is involved. The very largest players are
believed to have as much as Dollars 2bn deployed.
In any case, proprietary trading covers two different approaches. One type
of trading, known as arbitrage trading, involves taking advantage of
anomalies between different markets, and is generally viewed as less risky.
But most proprietary traders also use capital to take straightforward punts
on the direction of the market.
What is clear from the surge in activity in recent weeks is that the
consensus in the market was that European bond markets would rally further,
based on economic fundamentals. The market was positioned accordingly - but
the market was wrong. Some banks also had US yield curve plays, expecting
the curve to flatten in the wake of last month's interest rate hike: it
steepened instead. Many traders were also involved in convergence plays -
based on the expectation that high-yielding European markets would
outperform the core markets such as Germany: wrong again.
These losses have to be seen in context. Two months into the year, it is too
early to predict half-year trading losses. 'I think the losses that have
been sustained in February in 'bond land' have been nasty. But they are not
so bad against the gains made in 1993 or over the last five years,' said one
trader.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Drugs and seeds help Zeneca grow 42%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A solid performance from drugs, seeds and speciality chemicals helped
bioscience group Zeneca post a 42 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for 1993,
at Pounds 627m before exceptional items.
The company's first set of figures since the demerger last summer from ICI
was boosted by currency gains as well as volume growth. Pre-tax profit after
exceptionals was Pounds 642m, in the middle of analysts' expectations.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, described the year as 'successful . . .
despite less than ideal trading conditions'.
Trading profit rose to Pounds 713m, a 21 per cent increase. Some 14
percentage points of this increase came from volume growth, 1 percentage
point from increased prices and the balance from currency fluctuations.
Strong cash flow of Pounds 833m, a Pounds 151m increase over 1992, helped
cut year-end net debt sharply from Pounds 391m to Pounds 188m. Gearing fell
from 11.7 to 25.7 per cent.
Earnings per share after exceptional items were 51.7p (10.8p) and the
dividend was confirmed at 27.5p.
The company issued a trading statement on January 21, so there were few
surprises yesterday and Zeneca shares fell 3p to 763p.
Underlying sales growth in the biggest division, pharmaceuticals, was 5 per
cent, rising to Pounds 1.87bn. The top-selling drug, heart treatment
Tenormin, saw sales in constant currency terms fall 22 per cent to Pounds
464m in the face of generic competition.
Mr John Mayo, finance director, said that the rate of Tenormin's decline was
slower than with comparable drugs that had lost patent protection.
However, growth from other products more than made up for the decline in
Tenormin revenues. Sales of the company's second biggest product, Zestril,
another heart treatment, rose to Pounds 416m from Pounds 294m.
By region, The US continued to be easily Zeneca's biggest drugs market with
sales of Pounds 782m (Pounds 661m), but sales in Japan grew more than twice
as fast, from Pounds 190m in 1992 to Pounds 261m last year. France moved
into third place ahead of the UK.
In agrochemicals, trading profit rose just 1 per cent to Pounds 86m on sales
of Pounds 1.47bn. The specialities division saw doubled trading profits of
Pounds 50m on sales of Pounds 1.03bn.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Shipping to Europe boosts UK ports' business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Associated British Ports, the UK's largest ports group, says it is
attracting an increasing amount of trans-shipment business, with cargo being
landed at Southampton and then shipped on to Europe.
Rotterdam has traditionally dominated the European trans-shipment business,
but ABP said UK ports had become much more competitive since the abolition
of the National Dock Labour Scheme in 1989.
Sir Keith Stuart, ABP's chairman, said industrial relations in the UK docks
had gone from being the worst in Europe to the best, and ports could take
cargo at any time of the day and night, seven days a week - unlike many
continental competitors.
Of the 350,000 containers landed at Southampton last year, 50,000 were
trans-shipped to Europe - up from negligible levels only two years ago.
Other UK ports such as Felixstowe have seen a smaller growth in
trans-shipments, but Southampton is particularly well placed on the
so-called 'Atlantic Rim', which includes ports in Ireland, France, Portugal
and Spain.
ABP yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 62.1m in the year to
December 31. The previous year it made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 36.6m,
mainly because of a write-down of Pounds 83.6m on its property portfolio.
The group plans a 1-for-1 scrip issue, its third since flotation in 1983.
ABP shares closed down 1p at 570p.
One indication of ABP's continuing pressure on labour costs was a redundancy
charge of Pounds 8.1m, compared with Pounds 4m the previous year. The 200
jobs shed last year reduced the number of the group's dockers to 1,700 -
compared with 3,000 before the abolition of the dock labour scheme. Sir
Keith estimated redundancy costs would be about Pounds 2m in the current
year.
The higher redundancy charges mainly accounted for the fall in operating
profits from ports and transport operations from Pounds 60.7m to Pounds
55.9m, although the group said the reduced costs would benefit profit
margins from the current year onwards.
Sir Keith said the ports business was improving in the second half and this
had been 'more than sustained' in the first two months of this year.
Port-related property income was flat at Pounds 20.7m but property
investment increased profits to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.1m). Gearing fell
from 60 per cent to 53 per cent.
Earnings per share were 25.5p compared with losses of 14.3p. A final
dividend of 5.8p (5.25p) gives a total for the year of 9.3p (8.5p), an 8 per
cent rise.

<TEXT>
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, swung firmly into the black last year,
allowing the company to pay its first dividend since an extensive
restructuring was set in motion in 1990.
Net profits excluding extraordinary items totalled Fl 856m (Pounds 297.20m),
reversing the previous year's net loss of Fl 900m. Extraordinary gains of Fl
1.11bn, including a big profit on the sale of shares in a Japanese joint
venture, boosted total net profit to Fl 1.97bn.
The sharp turnaround was due mainly to cost-cutting and to a strong
reduction in financing charges, rather than to any vigorous improvement in
market conditions. Philips said sales grew in North America and Asia but
fell in Europe. Overall, turnover rose by 1 per cent to Fl 58.8bn.
The figures were at the top end of analysts' expectations, and Philips'
shares closed yesterday nearly 9 per cent higher at Fl 50.
Commenting on the dividend of Fl 0.50, Mr Jan Timmer, president, said: 'We
hope the worst of the problems are behind us, that we have cautiously
started on the road to recovery, and that we will again be able to pay a
dividend for 1994.'
Philips is cautious about how much improvement it will achieve this year.
Pressure on margins is expected to continue.
Mr Timmer said that most divisions either matched or improved on their
results in spite of the difficult economic conditions in Europe. The biggest
exception was the communications systems division, which produced a loss
because of reduced demand in Germany, its main market. This caused overall
operating profit in the professional products sector to decline sharply to
Fl 177m from Fl 663m.
Philips' single biggest business, consumer electronics, saw the first signs
of recovery, with operating losses narrowing to just Fl 73m from Fl 553m.
The sector would have returned to the black last year if it had not been for
continued heavy losses at the German affiliate Grundig.
Philips also announced that Mr Floris Maljers, who will retire in May as
chairman of Unilever NV, would succeed Mr Wisse Dekker as chairman of its
Philips' supervisory board.

FT  04 MAR 94 / S African leaders appear ready to seek international
mediation

<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi appeared ready last night
to seek international mediation to help break the political deadlock which
threatens South Africa's all-race general election next month.
The African National Congress announced it had accepted the proposal to call
in mediators, made by Chief Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party.
Any appeal for United Nations assistance is expected to get a positive
response from UN secretary general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, who disclosed
yesterday that he had written to the two leaders expressing 'delight' at the
outcome of their meeting this week that paved the way to last night's
development.
President FW de Klerk, however, warned last night that he had 'serious
reservations about international intervention at this stage'. The leader of
the ruling National party told a meeting in Durban: 'We cannot afford
further delays. The sudden lackadaisical approach, not realising the
importance of the moment, does not impress me at all.'
It was not clear whether he would actually block a move which, if
successful, could ease the growing tensions in the country and ease the path
to a successful poll.
Chief Buthelezi is seeking what amounts to autonomy, if not full
independence, for Natal, his party's stronghold. The ANC and the National
party are prepared to concede Natal and other provincial assemblies limited
powers.
Mr de Klerk said in parliament on Wednesday he had not been consulted about
an agreement on mediation between Mr Mandela's ANC and Chief Buthelezi.
Details of the mediation proposal have not been agreed. The ANC has proposed
a joint working group to 'address the specifics and agree upon mutually
acceptable terms of reference'.
The ANC statement said it would contact Inkatha to discuss possible further
meetings between Mr Mandela and Chief Buthelezi.
Leaders of the right-wing Freedom Alliance, a coalition of black and white
parties including Inkatha, yesterday held out the prospect that they may
today register for April's elections, reversing at least temporarily their
decision to boycott the poll.
Alliance leaders refused to be drawn publicly on whether or not they would
register before today's midnight deadline. But they said privately that they
would do so if Inkatha goes ahead with registration as promised earlier this
week by Chief Buthelezi, and if the ANC accepts international mediation. The
election is due to be held at the end of April.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of Germany's engineering workers and employers are expected to meet
in Hanover today in an attempt to avert the first strike in west Germany's
engineering industry for a decade.
The move came last night after almost 40,000 engineering workers in the
German state of Lower Saxony voted in favour to strike on Monday.
The engineering employers' federation, Gesamtmetall, proposed a meeting with
IG Metall, the engineering workers' union. Leaders of the union indicated
unofficially they were prepared to restart talks. The national executive of
the union will decide today in Frankfurt whether to accept the invitation or
insist on a formal offer from the employers before returning to talks.
The vote in Lower Saxony, where more than 92 per cent of the 41,000 eligible
union members voted to strike, gives the embattled IG Metall leadership
ammunition in its efforts to wring an improved package on job security and
wages out of the employers.
It was clear in Hanover, the state capital of Lower Saxony, that the union
saw itself being dragged reluctantly into a full-scale conflict.
However, before the unofficial decision to re-open negotiations, Mr Jurgen
Peters, the chief union organiser in the state, said that if the employers
were proposing talks, without any proper offer, 'it will not be worth our
time . . . . The employers must give clear signals that these will be
negotiations, not just talks.'
Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of Gesamtmetall, proposed the direct
talks with Mr Klaus Zwickel, the IG Metall leader, without any indication
that new ideas were on offer.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Electricity watchdog sees scope for more competition by 1996
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tens of thousands more electricity users may be able to shop around for
supplies in 1996 under potential changes which the industry regulator has
asked the sector to consider.
The earlier-than-expected introduction of competition in the power market
for small and medium businesses would almost certainly lead to lower prices.
Larger power customers have seen prices fall considerably after moves to
allow them to choose from a variety of suppliers.
In a private letter to regional electricity companies, Prof Stephen
Littlechild, director general of electricity supply, says 'there would seem
to be scope' for extending competition to some consumers in two years.
Competition for all users is already planned for 1988.
His consultations, prompted by liberalisation of the gas market, will cause
concern at some electricity companies. They have bought power supplies from
generators until 1998 in the belief that their markets were secure. There
are also doubts on whether metering technology can meet a 1996 target.
Under existing market liberalisation arrangements, only about 5,000
customers requiring peak demand of more than 1 megawatt, can choose their
supplier. From next month, that will extend to another 45,000 whose peak
demand exceeds 100kW. All other consumers are scheduled to remain in the
'franchise', or non-competitive, market until 1998.
In a two-page letter to the 14 regional electricity distributors in England,
Wales and Scotland, Prof Littlechild accepts that full competition is not
possible by 1996 but suggests the study of an 'interim franchise reduction'.
Prof Littlechild's office said yesterday that he had no conclusions on
whether the introduction of competition should be speeded up, but he wanted
to explore the possibilities.
Prof Littlechild referred to the government's decision to introduce
competition to 5 per cent of the domestic gas market in each of 1996 and
1997 before British Gas's monopoly on domestic sales is abolished fully in
1998.
He noted that even after the electricity franchise threshold falls next
month, it will be 10 times as high as the energy demand level at which gas
users can shop around.
Separately, a report today in Power UK, a Financial Times newsletter, says
lower metering costs than expected will make the evolution of a competitive
market after 1998 much more likely. That, it says, will challenge the
security of the companies' investment in generation tied to long-term
contracts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sight of even the most sleepy regional electricity companies lining up
to take pot-shots at the deregulating gas market has finally provoked a
response. Currently British Gas faces loss of market share by a thousand
cuts while the Recs can sit secure in their monopoly franchise markets until
1998. On top of that, the franchise market in electricity covers users ten
times larger than that for gas. It is hard to argue that the Recs should be
able to use their databases to pick off British Gas's customers while
remaining in a cosy monopoly market - particularly when that is supplied by
long term coal contracts and gas stations in which the Recs have an equity
interest.
So the chances are that even if the Recs object, the electricity market will
be liberalised early. Losing some of the marketing supply business should
not have much direct impact on profits. Most of the Recs' money is made in
the natural monopoly business of distributing the electricity through their
wires.
It may however, have knock-on effects. The distribution review currently
under way will see excess profits made in that part of the business cut
back. That, combined with a squeeze on marketing, will force the Recs to
make cost savings which they have so far avoided. If it also depresses
market sentiment and share prices, predators may emerge. The Recs have the
kind of cast iron balance sheets, cash generation and stable UK earnings
which any company with an advance corporation tax problem must dream of.

FT  04 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: ABP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by Associated British Ports' 38 per cent operating margins, running
ports is nice work if you can get it. ABP is in the particularly happy
position of owning several well-positioned ports accounting for 25 per cent
of the UK's seaborne trade. The company has done a good job in establishing
and exploiting such an asset base. The worry is when such businesses indulge
in fruitless diversification. Sadly, ABP has done that, too.
The company's move into commercial property close to the top of the cycle
ravaged its balance sheet during the downturn. The renewed upswing in
property should save further blushes - although it grates that ABP claims to
have realised a Pounds 6m 'profit' on an Torquay shopping centre having
written it down so heavily against the revaluation reserve. Its decision to
fix so much of its debt long term at around 11 per cent has become a further
embarrassment given the subsequent trend in interest rates. That is
especially so when the company generates cash in such profusion.
The market appears to have forgiven all past misdemeanours in pushing the
shares so far. That may prove justified given the scale of current
development activity around its ports and the marked upswing in trade. The
longer term growth prospects, though, do not appear so promising considering
ABP's high market share. That may not matter if the management starts
channelling more cash back to shareholders. But a yield of 2 per cent
suggests it has a long way to go.

FT  04 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Zeneca is progressing through its first year of independence with remarkably
little fuss. Its shares have performed more or less in line with the equity
market since demerger from ICI and have modestly outpaced its peers. On the
evidence of yesterday's full year figures, Zeneca's handful of newer drugs
is growing fast enough to offset the decline in Tenormin, the heart
treatment which lost patent protection two years ago. While sales in
pharmaceuticals slowed markedly in the second half as US wholesalers held
back, volume growth for the full year is solid enough.
Still, the 21 per cent increase in trading profit was achieved only with the
help of favourable exchange rate movements. Without that the rate of
progress looks far more sedate. Since currencies could easily work against
Zeneca from here on, the challenge must be to raise margins in agrochemicals
and specialty chemicals until the pharmaceuticals research pipeline delivers
on its promise. With over Pounds 2bn turnover outside the drugs industry,
there is plenty to work on.
But while the full benefits of cost-cutting have still to be felt, much
turns on the speed of economic recovery in Europe and the US and on how long
it will be before reform of the Common Agricultural Policy stops depressing
demand for agrochemicals. Since Zeneca has neither the vast cash resources
of Glaxo nor the generous dividend cover of Wellcome, it has less scope for
keeping shareholders sweet with the payout should earnings disappoint.

FT  04 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Betting on a new future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost 10 years after it struck the Soviet Union glasnost has finally
arrived at Ladbroke. The new openness may not persuade everyone; a wealth of
information can be used to distract as well as inform. The 'new' management
has also been around for a while - the chairman and chief executive have
spent a combined total of 27 years on the board so far. Shadows of the
optimistic accounting practices which used to worry investors can still be
dimly seen. Last year Texas Homecare was claiming rebates which had not yet
been paid by suppliers. It had also sold and leased back properties in 1992
which will increase occupancy costs this year. Ladbroke's switching of
Pounds 200m of foreign currency loans back into sterling after black
Wednesday may have prevented further strain on the balance sheet but
crystallised losses.
Still, it would be churlish to cavil at a genuine attempt to make a fresh
start. The sea change in management's attitude to investors' concerns
deserves credit. The board has been strengthened and the dividend rebased at
a more down to earth level. Realistic management has been installed at Texas
and improvements should be possible even if pressure from B&amp;Q does not
abate. Property disposals are now possible into the rising market.
Now that difficulties are being tackled goodwill may well support the shares
even if the market yield and premium rating do not. But there remains much
work to be done restructuring Texas and developing the Hilton brand name
with the group's limited capital resources. Perestroika has still to follow
glasnost.

Almost 40,000 engineering workers in the German state of Lower Saxony have
voted in favour of a strike, union leaders announced yesterday, clearing the
way for the first major conflict in the industry for a decade.
The engineering employers' federation, Gesamtmetall, called for an urgent
meeting with IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, in a bid to prevent
strikes from starting on Monday.
The national executive of the union will decide today in Frankfurt whether
to accept the invitation or insist on a formal offer from the employers
before returning to the negotiating table.
The overwhelming vote in Lower Saxony, where more than 92 per cent of the
41,000 eligible union members voted for strike action, gives the embattled
IG Metall leadership useful ammunition in its efforts to wring an improved
package on job security and wages out of the employers.
It was clear yesterday in Hanover, the state capital of Lower Saxony, that
the union sees itself being dragged reluctantly into a full-scale conflict.
Mr Jurgen Peters, the chief union organiser in the state, said only some
10,000 of the union's members would be called out on Monday, and the
companies chosen would if possible not include suppliers to the
recession-struck motor industry. The union wishes to minimise the knock-on
effects of the stoppage.
He said that if the employers were simply proposing new talks, without any
proper offer, 'it will not be worth our time . . . . The employers must give
clear signals that these will be negotiations, not just talks.'
Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of Gesamtmetall, proposed the direct
talks with Mr Klaus Zwickel, the IG Metall leader, without any indication
that new ideas were on offer.
He said both sides agreed that securing existing jobs was the highest
priority for the industry, which has seen 30,000 redundancies a month during
the past year. But he warned that it would not be good enough if peace was
bought at the price of higher wage costs, which would simply lead to further
job losses.
Mr Dieter Hundt, one of the employers' chief negotiators, said the plan was
simply to take up the negotiations where they broke off three weeks ago.
However, a Gesamtmetall official said there were plenty of ideas on areas of
possible compromise.
If the attempt to get both sides back together fails, IG Metall has already
set out a strategy of gradual escalation of the strike.
The last full-scale engineering workers' strike, in 1984, lasted a month,
and knocked 0.5 per cent off the annual growth rate of the German economy.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Excess gives way to restraint: David Marsh assesses the
quiet revolution at the EBRD as its new president seeks to build confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Just before Christmas, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, president of the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, received a top-level visitor. Lord
Lawson, former UK chancellor of the exchequer, now chairman of the Central
Europe Trust consulting firm, dropped into the bank's London headquarters to
offer some hints on channelling resources to eastern Europe.
'It's not that usual in my experience for an international civil servant to
seek out the view of the private sector,' says Mr Tom Lampl, one of the
firm's managing directors, who accompanied Lord Lawson on his visit.
'Normally they have their heads in the clouds playing politics. But he (de
Larosiere) has his ear to the ground. He really wants to find things out.'
Mr de Larosiere's keenness to listen illustrates just one way the
public-sector bank has changed since his predecessor, Mr Jacques Attali,
resigned last year at the height of a crisis caused by mismanagement and
budgetary extravagance.
A former governor of the Bank of France and managing director of the
International Monetary Fund, Mr de Larosiere has been carrying out a quiet
revolution since he took over at the end of September.
He quickly concluded that the bank, established in 1991 with Ecu10bn capital
to provide loans and equity to the former communist bloc, had become too
cumbersome and disorganised to carry out its mandate.
Mr de Larosiere has been squaring up to two principal tasks. First, he has
had to win the support of the bank's 56 mainly government shareholders for
measures to cut costs and increase efficiency. An important stage in the
process was reached yesterday at the EBRD budget committee, which discussed
Mr de Larosiere's proposal to maintain the bank's personnel and
administrative spending for 1994 unchanged from 1993 at Pounds 116m. The
EBRD board is expected to approve the budget plan in three weeks.
Underlining the bank's problems in controlling expenses, the budget last
year rose by roughly 50 per cent compared with the start-up phase in 1992.
Second, he has been trying to improve long-term confidence that the bank can
fulfil its aim of developing the nascent private sector in eastern Europe
and the ex-Soviet Union.
Doubts whether the EBRD can meet this objective reflect the general
deterioration of the political and economic environment in the east during
the past two years, as well as the damage to its reputation caused by the
Attali affair.
The EBRD's management crisis has focused attention on a fundamental
contradiction in the bank's operations. It was established to provide
additional resources to the former Soviet bloc. But it has to meet standards
of extreme prudence in its investment policies - one of the reasons why it
has been frequently criticised for cumbersome administrative procedures.
The EBRD lends under fully commercial terms - charging higher interest
rates, for instance, than the European Investment Bank, the EU's long-term
lending institution, which competes with the EBRD in some areas of eastern
Europe.
By the end of 1993, the EBRD had committed a cumulative Ecu2.8bn (Pounds
2.1bn) and disbursed Ecu556m in 2 1/2 years of operations - much less than
originally planned. About 57 per cent of the bank's loans and equity
investments have been channelled to the private sector and 43 per cent to
the public sector, compared with the 60/40 split called for in its statutes.
By contrast, the EIB, which is a shareholder in the EBRD, has so far
committed Ecu1.7bn to eastern Europe, of which about half has been
disbursed. In view of the EIB's limited engagement in eastern Europe
compared with its overall lending, the EIB has, according to some critics of
the EBRD, been much more effective in channelling resources to the former
communist countries.
Under the leadership of Mr Attali, who as special adviser to French
President Francois Mitterrand was the main inspiration behind the EBRD's
foundation, the bank suffered from an acute imbalance between aspiration and
reality.
Mr Attali's relationship with the bank's 23-member, London-based board was
frequently adversarial. One EBRD insider says bluntly that Mr Attali was not
trusted by big shareholder governments.
A former EBRD director contrasts Mr de Larosiere's sober and professional
style with the 'oppressive and domineering' manner with which Mr Attali used
to handle board meetings. He says of the former president: 'He felt it was
his bank. He felt it was his property - his child, he called it. I don't
think he ever came to terms with the fact that it was owned by governments
and the directors were representatives of its owners.'
To put the bank's operations on to a more realistic footing, Mr de Larosiere
has set a target for new commitments of Ecu1.8bn this year, the same as last
year's actual total and much lower than the Ecu2bn to Ecu2.6bn originally
budgeted by Mr Attali for 1993.
The bank has embarked on several new programmes, including ambitious plans
to provide venture capital and loans for small businesses in Russia.
However, since the EBRD's lending in coming years will remain below earlier
expectations, it will continue to run the risk of looking top-heavy.
The bank now employs about 700 staff, since Mr Attali's original plans for
800 employees by the end of last year were never realised. One of Mr de
Larosiere's first actions was to freeze creation of new posts. About 35
employees have left the bank since he arrived, and a large number of
employees has been redeployed. The number of operational banking
professionals has been increased by 25 per cent to 250 people.
Mr Mario Sarcinelli - currently third in command at the bank under Mr de
Larosiere and Mr Ron Freeman, the senior vice-president - will leave next
month after his appointment as the next head of the Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro, the Italian public sector bank.
However, so far Mr de Larosiere has brought in only two new people at a
senior level. They are his principal aide, Mr Philippe Richard, who came
with him from the Bank of France, and Mr Claude Peyrot, a temporary
management consultant - known by some at the EBRD as 'the secret weapon' -
who has also previously worked at the French central bank.
To gear the EBRD's activities more closely to the varying needs of the 25
diverse countries in which it operates, the president decided in November to
merge the merchant and development banking departments, which previously
handled private and public-sector business separately.
Mr de Larosiere is convinced that the bank previously failed to put
sufficient emphasis on identifying profitable private-sector deals in its
countries of operation. He was surprised to find that only 20 EBRD staff
spoke Russian.
One director reports 'strained nerves' as a result of Mr de Larosiere's
insistence two months ago that five staff members move to Russia on
secondment with local banks, as part of his efforts to decentralise
operations. Mr de Larosiere wants to increase by 20 the bank's staff (both
expatriates and local employees) in its 11 offices outside London - a 50 per
cent increase from the present tally of 40.
He also wants to improve the bank's effectiveness by increasing the number
of investment instruments at its disposal. Proposals under review include
the ideas of taking more stakes in local banks and investment funds in its
countries of operation, and providing guarantees to back private-sector
loans for certain projects.
One problem, however, is that the EBRD's deals have become both smaller and
more time-consuming as it tries to shift towards private-sector business.
Although the bank aims to multiply the effects of its investment through
co-financing with other banks, it normally has to shoulder by itself the
time and expense of credit analysis. 'These are mainly borrowers without
credit history,' says one EBRD executive. 'In practically every case we are
starting from scratch.'
Roughly 20 per cent of the time of its 250 mainstream bankers is spent
monitoring credit risks. Already there are signs of an increased need for
write-offs on some investments, such as the alleged over-valuation of the
EBRD's 20 per cent stake in the Czech national airline.
Even though the bank's problems are by no means over, its main shareholders
voice relief at the switch of presidency. Mr Lee Jackson, the deputy US
director at the bank, says: 'He (Mr de Larosiere) has brought a greater
degree of focus. My government and I are very supportive of what he is
doing.'
Mr Gunter Winkelmann, Germany's director at the EBRD, says: 'There has been
a dramatic improvement.' Mr Attali stated in a recent book* that he was
toppled by a revolt against his own proposals last summer to restructure the
bank and make it more efficient. Mr Winkelmann, however, refutes this claim.
'That is not true . . . In the end, he (Mr Attali) was not accepted by the
board, not accepted by the staff. It is this that brought him down.'
Mr Tomas Parizek, director for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and
Croatia, says Mr de Larosiere's decentralisation plans are 'in the right
direction'. He emphasises that the bank should not simply put more bankers
in the field, but should also find ways of increasing its effectiveness by
injecting equity into banks and investment funds in its countries of
operation.
On the ground in eastern Europe, the staff in the EBRD's present network of
offices win few plaudits. One international investment banker in Budapest
says he has met the EBRD's local staff only at parties and receptions.
'These people are the worst kind of diplomats you can imagine,' he says.
'The best that they can do is set appointments.'
Senior bankers in Poland say they deal with the EBRD's London headquarters
rather than its Warsaw office when they want to do business. The World
Bank's local office has much more of an operational function. In Prague -
where the EBRD is generally held to have played only a minor role in
economic restructuring - there is support for a stronger EBRD presence.
'Decentralisation is a good thing, and the bank should be more willing to
listen,' says a senior fund manager in the Czech Republic.
For all the criticism to which it is accustomed, there are signs that the
EBRD can find a useful role in areas where commercial banks are reluctant to
lend. In association with a Russian state-owned oil enterprise, US oil
company Conoco last year borrowed Dollars 90m from the EBRD for a Dollars
350m oil project. Mr Mike Espinosa, Conoco's assistant treasurer, says he is
'absolutely ecstatic' over the EBRD's track record, and contrasts its
willingness to lend money to Russia with the excessive prudence shown by
commercial banks.
Similarly, Mr Wayne Murdy, chief financial officer at Newmont Mining, the
US-based gold company, says he is 'very complimentary' about the EBRD's work
on a Dollars 105m loan for a joint-venture gold mine in Uzbekistan. 'We
couldn't have got a commercial bank to take on a commitment in Uzbekistan
without them.'
Despite accolades like this, many would agree with the assessment of Mr
Wolfgang Roth, the EIB's director responsible for eastern Europe, that the
EBRD is 'not basically necessary'. An alternative three years ago, Mr Roth
says, would have been to establish a joint subsidiary of the EIB and the
World Bank. 'But now we have it, we must make the best of it.'
After Mr de Larosiere's initial moves to curb the bank's structural defects,
the EBRD has regained the support of its shareholder governments. His
hardest task, however, still lies ahead: to show during the next few years
that the EBRD can make a real contribution to the development of functioning
capitalist economies in the former communist bloc. In the meantime, the EBRD
will remain highly vulnerable to political and economic setbacks in the
countries it was set up to serve.

A bit odd that Midland Independent Newspapers, which is being floated on the
stock market, has the same chairman as the Tory party. Sir Norman Fowler can
point to the fact that he accepted the chairmanship of the regional
newspaper chain a good six months before he was tapped to be party chairman.
Although it sounds like he will be stepping down as party chairman before
long, he has not given up hope of further high office.
The group stoutly defends its editorial independence but perhaps it should
remove the independent from its title until Sir Norman quits the political
scene once and for all.

Lawrence Kudlow, Bear Stearns' chief economist, who has resigned after eight
years with the company, says he wants to spend more time with his politics.
He's got the experience - General Motors thinks he has broad public appeal,
having long used him as a TV salesman for Cadillac cars.
He's also got the connections, as former deputy budget director in the
Reagan administration and more recently the economic brains behind Christine
Whitman's successful campaign for the governorship of New Jersey.
He turned down Whitman's offer of New Jersey state treasurer, probably
seeking a bigger pool to swim in. Word is he will run for the Republicans
against Daniel Moynihan, the celebrated Democrat senator from New York.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The death at 81 of one of Britain's more interesting novelists, James Lloyd
Carr, probably means that another piece of the jigsaw concerning the late
unlamented Robert Maxwell will never quite be slotted into place.
Carr once told a colleague the tale of how, in the late 1980s, a Rolls-Royce
drew up out of the blue outside Carr's modest house in the sleepy Northants
town of Kettering. Out stepped Cap'n Bob himself.
Carr wouldn't disclose the details of the conversation, in order, he said,
to avoid further embarrassing Maxwell's family. He restricted himself to
depicting Maxwell's massive ego.
But Maxwell's visit almost certainly was to try to buy Carr's tiny
publishing company, Quince Tree Press, which never achieved an annual
turnover exceeding five figures; Carr specialised in miniature chapbooks,
maps and some of Carr's own novels. Maxwell was turned down; making Carr not
just a lovely novelist, but also a very canny publisher.

Lady Thatcher was in fighting form yesterday as she lashed Europe's
protectionist policies at the 'World Trade after Gatt' conference chaired by
her old chum, Lord Parkinson. Europe, she said, should follow the example of
the Asian tigers whose economies had thrived on international competition.
Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and South Korea all got a plug as
economies challenging the industrial supremacy of Europe and the US. But no
mention of the fast-growing Malaysian economy.
An odd omission, as was the sudden cancellation of Lady T's planned question

Those looking for portents of the death of British trade unionism as we knew
it have pointed to the TUC's overtures to political parties other than
Labour. Inviting the Treasury's financial secretary, Stephen Dorrell, to
give a speech at TUC HQ in London yesterday was but one instance.
But the final nail in the coffin must surely be that the TUC has succumbed
to the wiles of public relations. The TUC has always done these things
in-house before, but now seven PR firms are pitching for the account, which
should be awarded by the end of March.
Presumably the first press release will arrive with black borders.

Forget collapsing marriages, burgled rooms, paparazzi embarrassments - the
House of Windsor has suffered all those indignities and more recently. No,
what really threatens to take it from the realms of fairytale into the
backyard is - my dear] - trade.
Take Prince Michael of Kent, the Queen's cousin. He's just made an entrance
on CNN's flagship talk show, Larry King Live. He
was there touting a mail-order catalogue called The House of Windsor
Collection. It was a hilarious performance, with King asking things like:
'What is the royalty doing regarding product . . . ?'
Quick as a flash Prince Mike was hauling out ties, a candelabra, a wine
glass and a dinner plate, just like some encyclopaedia sales rep. The
confusing thing was that as he did his best to promote his wares on the
basis of their exclusivity - 80 per cent of the stuff coming from companies
holding the royal warrant - King six times gave a free-phone number viewers
could call to get their free copy of the catalogue. King said it made him
sound as if he was on a home-shopping network.
But in the end Prince Mike showed his true colours, suggesting that if the
fairytale is over, then at least fantasyland lingers.
When asked about what was happening to any profits he said: 'We haven't got
that far, really, at looking at profits.'

FT  04 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Open universities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's higher education system lurches from feast to famine. After
several years in which student numbers have soared, expansion was yesterday
brought to a sudden halt. Such wild swings in policy do not simply conspire
against good university management. They are also symptoms of an
over-centralised higher education system. The number of students who go into
higher education, the fees charged and, in large measure, the budgets of
individual universities are all set by a centralised quango.
The result is not merely that many school-leavers will be unable to find
university places this autumn. The squeeze in government spending per
student - it has fallen by a third in real terms over the past two decades -
is endangering quality. Meanwhile, centralised capping of student numbers
blunts the incentive for universities to compete to attract students.
It is widely accepted that the proportion of school-leavers who go into
higher education should rise. The figure is already nearly one in three and
the government would like to see it go higher. The snag is that the
public-sector deficit will not permit the state to pay for such expansion.
So far, ministers' attempts to square the circle have been timid. The main
initiative has been to increase the proportion of student maintenance
financed through loans rather than state grants.
But a more radical policy is needed if higher education is to expand again
in 1997, as ministers intend, without an unacceptable decline in quality. To
achieve this, most students should be required to pay for the bulk of their
tuition. This is quite reasonable, since they benefit from university
education in the form of higher lifetime earnings.
The key is to allow students to borrow against their human capital to
finance their education, while repaying the loans over a long period of time
as their income increases. The best way of structuring such a loan scheme is
still a matter of debate. But a recent study by the London School of
Economics makes a powerful case for repaying loans through the national
insurance contribution system. This would be administratively simple and
ensure that loan repayments were linked to ability to pay.
A new financing mechanism would not merely be a way of bringing extra funds
into higher education. It could pave the way for freeing universities from
the shackles of central government. If students ultimately paid for their
own education, there would be little need for a quango to fix student
numbers or set fees. These could be set in the market, as individual
students sought out the best courses for their needs.
One consequence is that universities would have to compete on price and
quality to flourish. Such a competitive spur would help put Britain's
generally admired higher education in better shape for the next century.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Singh's gamble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manmohan Singh's fourth budget, announced this week, has to be judged
against the background of nearly three years of remarkable progress in
opening up an Indian economy distorted by decades of protection and
over-zealous bureaucracy. Indian companies are working with a new spirit of
enterprise, far less fettered by government, and have substantially boosted
exports. The liberalisation which made this possible has been advanced
somewhat by Mr Singh's budget. But investors who have been pouring money
into India may be disappointed that the finance minister has not taken
advantage of the government's now strong political position to push the
reform process ahead more aggressively.
Mr Singh was facing twin problems: the fiscal deficit has been running far
higher than he expected, partly because economic growth has been slower. He
opted to boost the latter and take a risk that the former will not balloon
further. Unsurprisingly, the Indian business community is delighted with
cuts in interest rates and corporate taxes. There is no trace of austerity
measures to bring the budget deficit back on track - the target has been set
at an undesirably high level of 6 per cent of gross domestic product. This
is an acknowledged gamble. The government still lacks broad enough popular
support for reform because it has not triggered Chinese-style growth. If the
economy could be induced to boom without excessive inflation, it would
reduce the fiscal deficit and provide a broad mandate for further
liberalisation.
Admittedly, the budget deficit is not as alarming as it was in 1991 when it
was financed by foreign borrowing. Now it is financed internally and Mr
Singh has pledged to eliminate direct government borrowing from the banking
system within three years. At the same time, inflation is in single figures
and the reserves position is so comfortable that the International Monetary
Fund is to be repaid early.
There are also good reform measures. Convertibility of the rupee on current
account transactions is an important step forward. Import duties have been
reduced further, and simplified. There are moves towards indirect taxes
which would enable the government to reduce its dependence on customs duties
and reduce them again. But there were no surprises, and nothing suggesting a
desire to accelerate the pace of reform. For the time being, this may be it.
Significant reforms of taxation and labour law, as well as stepped-up
privatisation, may have to wait.
India's reforms have not, however, come so far that they will create their
own momentum. Mr Rao and Mr Singh need to ensure that they do not, by
reverting to the slow track, allow the progress they have made so far to be
sacrificed to the many still well-protected interests - in the public
sector, business and labour - who stand in the way of a true opening of the
economy.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Block votes and Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British support for EU enlargement often appears self-serving in the eyes of
Britain's present partners, who suspect that Britain's real objective is to
dilute the Union, making it more like a free trade area and less like a
federation. Yet Britain has good arguments on its side: the EU will be
strengthened by the entry of new Nordic and Alpine members, and it has
strong reasons of both morality and self-interest for not turning its back
on the newly free countries of central Europe.
It is perverse, therefore, of the British government to risk torpedoing the
agreement on admission of Efta countries by insisting that the 'blocking
minority' in the EU council under the qualified majority voting system
(QMV), should remain unchanged even in a larger Union. The larger the number
of member states, the more difficult it will be to achieve consensus, and
the greater the danger of paralysis. To insist that the same number of
states should be able to block a decision means that a larger number will
have to be lined up in favour before a decision can pass. By taking this
line, the UK courts the accusation that paralysis has been its true
objective in backing enlargement.
British ministers claim they need to keep the blocking minority at 23 votes,
which can be mustered by two large states and one small voting together, in
order to preserve the open and competitive character of the Union against
'the protectionist majority'. Only Germany and the Netherlands, it seems,
can be relied on to vote with Britain on many such issues. This seems just
the kind of negative and defeatist approach which has so often isolated the
UK from its European partners - including Germany and the Netherlands, both
of which, as it happens, support raising the threshold to 27 votes in order
to keep it constant as a proportion (30 per cent).
One reason why Britain has supported the entry of its former Efta partners
is that they generally share Britain's commitment to free trade.
Enlargement, therefore, so far from inciting Britain to cling to a veto,
should strengthen its confidence that it can win important arguments in the
council on their merits. Nor should this issue be confused with the question
of subsidiarity. There are strong grounds for wishing to limit the
competences of an enlarged Union, leaving more issues to be resolved at
national level or below; but where it does have competence, it must have the
capacity to decide and to act.
The UK should not feel comfortable to find itself allied on this issue with
Spain, which hopes to use the blocking minority to defend a pattern of EU
spending that is neither in British interests nor in those of the new
members. Spain has other demands that are more reasonable, such as an
increase in its own voting weight to equal that of the other big countries,
and a right for Spanish fishermen to fish in Norwegian waters when Norway
joins. It is on these points, rather than the blocking minority, that Mr
Felipe Gonzalez should be placated.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Rumbled in bumbledom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY

<TEXT>
This is getting serious. The British government is being shown to be a bad
liar. Worse, it begins to look as if Albion has forgotten the rules of
perfidy. These are: do not get found out, have a plausible explanation ready
just in case, and, finally, be honest and open whenever you possibly can.
The latter rule is placed third, but do not be misled. It is of the essence
of the matter. Poker players whose bluff is called cannot easily bluff
again.
Properly applied, the above three precepts might have kept Mr John Major and
his cabinet out of the mire into which they have fallen. It is important not
to be naive about this. All governments lie; many are treacherous; some
cheat. A few polities, of which the American is the most outstanding,
contain many checks and balances. These do not prevent corruption, but they
make its detection possible. In continental Europe, backroom deals are not
unheard of, but the most able administrators manipulate events with the
greatest aplomb. For some reason, France springs to mind.
The present British government would not recognise aplomb if it tripped over
it. If it has read Machiavelli, it has failed to understand him. Our
political masters lie like schoolboys. When caught, they point the finger of
blame at one another. They invent hugely improbable excuses. They squeal and
protest and whine that it was just this once. They shuffle words about,
hoping that dextrous use of the infinitely flexible English language will
deceive us. In short, they are incompetent with the truth.
The degree to which this matters varies. At the election of April 1992 the
Tories promised not to increase income tax or national insurance. They also
said that they would not extend the scope of value added tax. To top it all
they intimated that the economy would start to recover the day after they
were returned to power. In fact, taxes have been increased by the greatest
amount in peacetime history. The recession is over, but recovery did not
begin until a year after Mr Major's victory.
The government is paying dearly for its deceit. Usually supportive popular
newspapers, aware of the disillusionment of their readers, have turned
against the Conservatives in general and Mr Major in particular. The
tabloids will probably return to the fold, but the Tories' fate at the next
general election, due in 1996 or 1997, depends in large part upon the
elector-ate's memory.
Some concealments are justified. During much of last year the government led
us to believe that it was not in communication with the Irish Republican
Army. It chose its words carefully, referring to negotiation rather than
communication. Yet the implicit message was that there would be no contact
with terrorists. In November it emerged that the Northern Ireland secretary,
Sir Patrick Mayhew, had used an intermediary to establish whether there was
anything in the proposition that the IRA was ready to declare a ceasefire.
He was obliged to publish the relevant documents. There was a passing flurry
of critical comment. Titch. Most of us accept that in this instance the
government was right. If subterfuge is required to bring peace to Ulster,
let us have more of it. Just do it better.
Some breaches are winked at by Conservative backbenchers. Take the
celebrated promise to build a dam at Pergau in Malaysia to offset the cost,
to the Malaysians, of purchases of British arms. Sweeteners may be an
inevitable part of the armaments trade. Where they come from is
controversial. The permanent secretary of the overseas aid administration,
Sir Timothy Lankester, regarded the Pergau project as an abuse of the aid
budget. He demanded a written instruction before he would proceed. His
fellow officials have silently ap-plauded, hoping that they would have done
the same. One solution to the aid problem would be a separate
sales-promotion slush fund for armaments deals. Another would be to look for
different ways of making a living. That would be best. The weapons business
is ultimately unprofitable. The Labour party rightly proposes a change to
industries producing non-lethal goods.
To most people, these are fine arguments. What sticks in the throat is that
the government broke its own rules and then hid behind half-truths. One rule
is that aid and arms sales should not be linked. This week Mr Douglas Hurd
sat before a parliamentary committee to confess that, for three months in
1988, they were. It was a 'temporary and incorrect entanglement', he said.
When it ended, the then defence secretary wrote to the Malaysians to say
that an aid-arms link was not possible. The British high commissioner in
Kuala Lumpur wrote to the same minister on the same day offering the same
amount of aid. On Wednesday Mr Hurd argued that the two strategies -
promoting defence sales and using aid to get civil contracts - were
thenceforth separately followed. There was no link. He was as convincing as
a bigamist protesting that his two marriages are separately enjoyed.
Such malarkey can spoil a government's reputation. Lord Justice Scott's
inquiry into the sales of arms-manufacturing machinery to Iraq could blow
this government apart. We must await the report to see whether it does. The
evidence to date suggests that, however much they may deny it, some
ministers seem to have felt obliged to risk the unjust imprisonment of three
businessmen, merely to protect papers the government wanted to keep secret.
A few of these documents should be secret; most of them should not.
There is also the little accusation that the rules on arms sales to
President Saddam were breached, and Parliament misled about it, but the
politically explosive potential of that one is limited. What would anger
people in all parties would be a finding by Lord Justice Scott that
politicians were prepared to sacrifice individuals in the government's own
interests.
In sum, the underside of what was once universally regarded as a smooth,
silken administrative machine has been exposed. Departments that thought
they knew best now do not even know how best to measure what is and is not
proper, let alone what Parliament should and should not be permitted to
know. Whitehall and Westminster, which in good times work well together, are
without camouflage. What is revealed is the kingdom of bumbledom.

<TEXT>
Sir, The current difficulties over commercial relations with Malaysia are of
great concern to companies in the financial services sector.
Malaysian government policy has been the driving force behind the
transformation of Malaysian corporate structure. In assisting the
implementation of that policy over many years, we have learnt to value the
Malaysian viewpoint and to admire the political stability and economic
management of a country which has achieved steady growth averaging more than
8 per cent per annum for the last five years.
We are proud to have played a part in this success story.
We would encourage both governments to bear strongly in mind the mutual
benefits which have accrued through the investment banking industry as well
as through the success of Malaysian/UK industrial co-operation. We shall do
everything we can to repair the damage.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Commercial agents rules not so tough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms LINDA FAZZANI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ian Hamilton Fazey's article 'A rude awakening in Britain' (FT
Exporter, January 27) concerning the new Commercial Agents Regulations
contains certain statements which could be misinterpreted and deserve
clarification.
The regulations apply to agents dealing with goods on behalf of another,
whether on commission or for fixed payments. An agent may now claim
compensation when an indefinite term contract is terminated (including for
death or infirmity of the agent) even if the principal has a contractual
right to terminate. Hamilton Fazey states that an agent could now claim up
to a maximum of three months' average commission as compensation. The
regulations in fact set no overall maximum. It is likely, however, that the
courts will favour the indemnity formula in the regulations to calculate
compensation, namely no more than the equivalent of one year's commission
averaged out over the last five years of the contract.
Hamilton Fazey's compensation assumption seems based on the minimum notice
provisions of the regulations: in the case of an indefinite term contract,
the minimum notice period of one month for every year of the contract to a
maximum three months. If that notice is not served, an agent may claim
damages for breach of contract based on commissions that could have been
earned during that period as well as compensation or an indemnity.
Timing of commission payments is also affected. It has been common practice
to withhold commissions until the principal is paid by its customers. Now,
an agent becomes entitled to commission when the principal completes or
should have completed the transaction or, if earlier, when the customer has
completed the transaction. This provision can be excluded by agreement.
What cannot be excluded is the provision fixing the latest point when
commission is due: when the customer has 'executed his part of the
transaction or should have done so'.
Thus, a principal can only withhold commissions until payment is due from
the customer. This can cause a cash flow problem for the principal where
customers pay late, but the position is not as bad as Hamilton Fazey
indicates.
Discussion on interpretation of the regulations will no doubt continue until
cases come to court.

Sir, Is it not typical of the government's bad luck (or poor judgment) that
just as the controversial Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant is about to

reports how the Japanese government is about to suspend its plutonium
recycling programme and, with it, Thorp's major customer? The FT also
mentioned the French government's decision to cease the production of
electricity (and plutonium waste) at its Superphenix fast breeder reactor
('Utilities could sue over reactor', February 24). The two countries
normally described as having made a success of nuclear power are clearly

FT  04 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fraud detection possible for the
vigilant auditor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN WARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Thank you for Andrew Jack's excellent article (Recruitment: 'Duty to
report may not put the heat on fraudsters', February 24) in the aftermath of
the BCCI affair, about the duty of auditors to report fraud; and the
differing views of those who think auditors ought to be made responsible for
detecting fraud and those who believe this cannot be done, eg because of the
lack of access to the third-party bank accounts and records.
Fraud involves transferring cash and assets out of a business, by whatever
means. This process upsets the established patterns of behaviour, of assets
to liabilities, of costs to income, of working capital to turnover, of
margins to overheads ('break even') etc.
Detecting changes in these patterns does enable fraud (or error) to be
highlighted, sometimes quite quickly and nearly always to a high degree of
certainty, as a normal part of the audit.
Only audit firms and investigating accountants who are not using such
methods (and some are not) need fear the extra responsibilities which are
now being thrust on them by the inevitability of events.
Likewise for bankers, shareholders, investors, sup-pliers, depositors,
customers, staff, and all others who depend on their vital work.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Vital element in pensions regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GARETH MARR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your interesting history of the regulators' involvement in
controlling pensions transfers, one aspect was missed - the practitioner's
input.
One of the main reasons for any damage that will come to light over the next
few months will be the technical inadequacy of the individuals advising the
public on this most complex of subjects.
These inadequacies were present in the regulators. On my appointment to the
Fimbra council in December 1991, I persuaded colleagues of the need to
address the pension transfer issue. In early February 1992 I consulted with
OPAS, the Society of Pensions Consultants and NAPF, and produced a note on
best practice which Fimbra published. Lautro worked alongside us and
published its guidance at the same time. Evidence points to an improvement
in compliance from that date.
The technical competency of regulators is improving dramatically, but they
cannot be expected to have the same in-depth knowledge of every aspect of
financial services as practitioners.
The public could well be damaged again by those who seek to exclude
practitioners from participation in regulation at the highest levels and
those calling for the easy-ride option of statutory regulation. Hopefully,
PIA will ensure that experts, rather than politicians, from the financial
services industry have a direct influence on policy. This form of
self-regulation should ensure the consumer will not get fooled again.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Taming the wild beast: Brazil's latest effort at economic
stabilisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Mr Roberto Macedo, former economic policy secretary, Brazil's latest
financial stabilisation effort, under way since December, involves more than
bringing down inflation. 'We're running out of animals,' he says.
His concern is not ecological. With annual inflation of about 2,500 per
cent, the country's central bank needs a steady stream of new designs for
ever-larger denominations of notes and coins. The latest set of drawings is
nearly exhausted.
Brazil's rapidly devaluing currency is the most visible symbol of the
country's economic troubles. It is also the knotty problem which the second
of a three-stage stabilisation plan is now addressing. Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, finance minister, on Monday announced the creation of an accounting
unit called the Urv, which is expected to form the basis of a new and
theoretically inflation-free currency in a couple of months.
Brazilians remain sceptical that Mr Cardoso's plan will succeed. The country
has seen six previous stabilisation attempts fail in the past eight years.
But many businessmen agree he has achieved more than they hoped.
'Over the last few months Brazil has started to realise high inflation
cannot continue. If the overall stabilisation plan is adopted, it has an
enormous chance of success,' according to Mr Wilson Brumer, president of
Acesita, a large steel company based in southern Minas Gerais state.
Brazil's inflation has two main motors. Following decades of budget
profligacy, the government has been forced to issue securities of
ever-shorter maturity to fund its deficit. These are issued at higher and
higher interest rates, now equal to more than 40 per cent a month. The
process is equivalent to printing money, and is inflationary.
Second, and mainly in response to the first motor, Brazil created a
sophisticated financial system. This uses indices which measure past price
changes in order regularly to readjust current prices, rents and salaries.
Because the indices are based on past inflation, the process becomes
'inertial', or self-sustaining. Even if prices should be falling, they are
kept high by increases based on past inflation levels.
According to Mr Winston Fritsch, one of Mr Cardoso's economic team,
Brazilian inflation is now 'basically inertial and expectational'. The
government estimates that without these two tendencies, for example if price
rises were measured in US dollar terms, local inflation last year was below
5 per cent.
'So you need some kind of economic lobotomy to make people forget about past
inflation,' according to Mr Fritsch.
Such thinking formed the backbone to Mr Cardoso's plan. The first and most
important step was to balance this year's budget, which had been projected
to show a deficit of Dollars 22.2bn. This only represents about 5 per cent
of gross domestic product, less than the deficits of many industrialised
nations. But given the Brazilian government's poor international image, the
deficit could only have been financed by continuing the inflationary cycle
of short-term securities.
Following intense negotiations with Mr Cardoso, Congress last week finally
agreed a package of cuts and revenue transfers to wipe out the projected
shortfall.
According to Mr Fernando de Hollanda Barbosa, an economist at the Rio de
Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas foundation, Mr Cardoso did well to get his
budget through Congress, where the government relies on a weak coalition for
support. 'It's been a major victory for him. But the important phase lies
ahead. The first steps are just preconditions,' he said.
Mr Cardoso quickly moved to phase two and unveiled the Urv - the Unidade
Real de Valor, or real unit of value - which is partly designed to pave the
way for a new currency, and partly as the 'lobotomy'. The central bank sets
the daily value of the Urv in terms of the local currency, the cruzeiro
real. At present, one Urv is equal to one dollar. As the cruzeiro devalues
each day, the Urv is worth more cruzeiros but the same in dollars. Thus in
terms of the Urv, there is little inflation.
All salaries have been converted to Urvs, and the government hopes the
unit's apparent stability will tempt people to convert prices to Urvs
voluntarily. Once the unit is widely in use, it will become a full currency
called the Real and will be linked to Brazil's Dollars 32bn foreign exchange
reserves to give it credibility.
This ingenious plan is fraught with problems, as Mr Cardoso admitted. 'We
can get inflation down, that part is easy. What's difficult is to keep it
there. There are many difficulties. (The balanced budget) was approved in
Congress but it will be carried out by the executive arm, and it's made more
difficult by the fact we are in an election year.'
Mr Macedo agreed: discipline in the new currency is the most difficult
thing. 'But let's suppose they reach two-digit inflation, annually, in the
new currency, then that's a good thing. At least they will have gained
time.' Several previous stabilisation plans were designed to see a weak
government through to the end of its mandate.
Political observers say presidential and congressional elections in October
may put pressure on the government to increase spending and lead to
inflation in the new currency. Mr Cardoso has already agreed to demands from
other ministers for a 5 per cent bonus for public-sector workers. This is
likely to cost the government about Dollars 310m and already threatens the
balanced budget.
More worryingly, Brazil's erratic president, Mr Itamar Franco, is thought to
be unhappy with the minimum monthly wage of Dollars 65 and wants a
substantial increase by the end of the year. The labour ministry wants a
minimum wage of nearly Dollars 100. This wage is used as a base in the
social security system. Such an increase would lead to an immediate rise in
government expenditure of Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn and leave the budget in
tatters.
Mr Cardoso is dismissive of the wage rise idea. 'This is the real world,
that's why we want a real currency,' he said. But businesses are worried,
especially since unions in Sao Paulo are threatening to strike for higher
wages.
The elections are also a problem. Mr Cardoso is widely assumed to be a
strong candidate for president, but is short of time to bring down inflation
and still resign from the government by April 2, as Brazilian law dictates.
He may therefore have to stay in the government, as kingmaker, or hand over
to a chosen successor and bask in reflected glory if the plan succeeds.
There is also an outside chance the law will be changed to allow him and
other ministers to remain in office closer to the elections. Mr Cardoso, 62,
is evasive and has become an agile dodger of the issue of his candidature.
Asked about his greatest challenge, he replied: 'To defeat inflation will
only happen once in history. I hope I will live long enough to dispute an
election again.'

The Arts Council yesterday refused to help out the hard-pressed regional
orchestras, and returned the ball of inadequate funding of the arts firmly
into the government's court. Secretary-general Anthony Everitt said 'if we
had the resources we'd help, but we don't'.
Last November the government, through the Department of National Heritage,
took a hard line with the Council, and the arts, and reduced its grant by
Pounds 3.2m for 1994-95. The Council is getting its revenge by refusing to
put together rescue packages when arts organisations face financial crisis.
The latest potential victim is one of the best respected arts groups in the
country, Simon Rattle's City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. It has a
deficit of Pounds 250,000 and at one time Rattle threatened to quit as
conductor unless more money was forthcoming.
Birmingham City Council, a stalwart supporter of the arts, came up with
Pounds 125,000 for each of the next two years and Rattle agreed to stay for
an extra year, until 1997. But Birmingham expected a matching sum from the
Arts Council. In the old days this would have been forthcoming, but not now.
Richard York of the CBSO said yesterday 'the City has staved off the awful
day, but by the autumn we will be in severe difficulties.'
Everitt estimates that by March 1995 the five regional orchestras - the
CBSO, the Halle, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Bournemouth
Orchestras, and the Northern Sinfonia - will have between them an
accumulated deficit of at least Pounds 1.5m. An Arts Council working group
says, rather tortuously, 'we cannot absolutely guarantee that none of the
orchestras will consider liquidation within the coming year'.
Another victim yesterday was the RPO, which received a minimum Pounds
300,000 grant for its regional work based in Nottingham. The RPO has had its
subsidy for 1994-95 reduced by Pounds 100,000, or 25 per cent.
There is a feeling that the Arts Council would not be too unhappy if a major
client went belly up: it would prove its point that with box office revenue
down as well as sponsorship and local authority support, it was madness for
Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke to cut its grant.
Earlier this week the much respected boss of Welsh National Opera, Matthew
Epstein, quit, saying he could not carry on in a financial climate which
forced him to cut staff and productions rather than plan an ambitious
programme. All the major national arts companies are coping with either
accumulated or annual deficits, and usually both, and it will be a miracle
if there is not a high profile casualty among arts organisations during the
year.
The Arts Council does not anticipate a public change of heart by the
government and a sudden influx of new cash but it hopes the parlous state of
the arts will force the announcement in the autumn of a substantial rise in
subsidy for 1995-96.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Arts: The Tharp imagination - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are three major pieces new to London in the second programme by Twyla
Tharp's company at Riverside Studios. Each shows how a score sparks off the
Tharp imagination: ideas and allusions burst out of the music into the dance
 -clever, sometimes too clever by half, dazzlingly apt, always engaging our
attention.
The second book of Brahms' Paganini variations is, among other things, a
commando course for the pianist. For Tharp, and for Jamie Bishton her
prodigious soloist, it is a study in powerfully masculine stamina (Bishton
gets his green beret) and no less compelling acuteness to rhythm and dance
outline. There is an entourage of two couples in black who state certain
associated ideas; Bishton, in white, is like the music's spirit, flying,
cutting great shapes, in triumphant colloquy with Brahms. He, like the
piece, is wonderful.
As Time Goes By is 20 years old, and looks as fresh as if it were made this
week. It is, I suppose, both 'about' baroque dance and about the idea of
Haydn's Farewell symphony, whose last two movements it uses. And uses, in
the best sense, as a way into how we may think about the dance of Haydn's
time - courteous, quick, elegant - and about the music's mechanics.
A small dance ensemble is augmented, the choreography becomes more
complicated, then the numbers reduce until the gifted Daniel Chait is left
alone, dancing as the light and the music fade, seeming to contemplate the
choreography that has gone before, and an age that has gone forever. I think
it a delight, and can even forgive the men's costumes - natty beige winter
underwear.
The most recent work is Octet (1991), which is Tharp allusive and
analytical. The score is by Edgar Meyer; it sounds first like a jazz group
enjoying a nervous breakdown, then switches to a study for 'cello surrounded
by shimmering glissandi. The choreography, for eight dancers, proposes
classicism sharing (unsurprising, with Tharp) the jazz group's neuroses -
movement twitching, inverted, caught up in itself - then gaining in clarity
with the music's development. The eye is constantly engaged, excited. Tharp
gives a valid post-Balanchinian account of academic language, paying homage
to the Master; above all she takes a penetrating look at dance, showing us
what fascinates her - and hence fascinates us.
The programme ends with the Nine Sinatra Songs, that cunning exercise in
kitsch. The songs are stickily sentimental; Oscar de la Renta's dresses for
the girls are a catalogue of fashion horrors (the chaps are in dinner
jackets); seven couples plunge into cheap emotions like Olympic divers from
the top board, and perform marvels on the way down. It is, in essence, the
most fearful claptrap, but brilliantly made by Tharp and brilliantly danced
by her artists. No-one, though, should be required to listen to nine Sinatra
songs on the trot without danger money.
As an added note about Riverside: prospective visitors are advised that
seating is un-numbered and that, as at The Place, there can be an unholy,
and surely unnecessary, scrum to get into the auditorium. But Tharp vaut le
voyage.
The Tharp Company is at Riverside Studios until March 12.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Arts: Sympathetic 'Paddywack' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daniel Magee's Paddywack at the Cockpit is a play - and in parts a very good
one - about prejudice. It scores one definitive hit, yet also includes an
abysmal miss. The rest is in between. This mix, along with its topicality,
makes it a piece to be seen.
Paddywack is the most sympathetic work about Irish republicanism that I have
come across on stage. Damien, a young Northern Irishman looking for a job in
London, is suspected by his fellow lodgers of working for the IRA. Damien
does not deny the suspicion, nor does he overtly confirm it.
Instead he puts a thought of his own. 'Why is it,' he says after a spate of
London bombings, 'that the only question the British ever ask is how he (the
bomber) managed it, and not why he bothered to do it in the first place?'
Touche. No-one in the Kilburn lodging house even attempts an answer. Clearly
the IRA has still some residual sympathy in Northern Ireland which the
British fail to understand. This sympathy may fall short of approving the
violence, but it does not run to denouncing it: certainly not in front of
the British.
Yet Magee has a prejudice of his own. This is his manifest belief that, as a
result of the IRA bombings, the British have become more anti-Irish than
ever. I know of no evidence for this view. On the contrary, respect for the
Irish Republic has grown: British impatience is with the more intransigent
leaders of the Ulster Unionists; the IRA is a phenomenon to be contained
and, if necessary, lived with. The British tolerance of the disruptions
caused by the IRA is remarkable.
Magee plainly disagrees with that analysis. He thinks that the average Brit
regards 'Paddys' with contempt. 'Paddybashing' was a term coined by British
troops in Northern Ireland in the 1970s. It was meant to be a joke. Some of
the Irish took it literally, and that is perhaps the republicans' problem.
They take themselves over-seriously: more people, especially Irish people,
ought to poke fun at them.
Paddywack goes some of the way. Irish republicans, Magee suggests, can be
more racist than the British. Since there are very few blacks in Ireland,
the Irish do not have to live with the problems of a multi-ethnic society.
Magee also has a go at an English middle class woman who romanticises
violence and a middle class male intellectual whose liberal principles
collapse when he is sexually betrayed.
Since much of the drama depends on suspense - whether or not Damien is an
IRA activist - I shall not give away the plot. On the first night, the
direction by Michael Latimer looked a shade under-rehearsed. But it should
pick up speed and the subject is electric. James Nesbitt is a quizzical
Damien who maintains the suspense till the end. Holly Aird's Annette, the
girl who falls for him, is the essence of some female English liberals. And
the Soho Theatre Company is making the Cockpit one of the most exciting
small theatres in London.
Cockpit Theatre until March 26. (071) 402 5081

FT  04 MAR 94 / Arts: Zurbaran's Patriarchs - A family gathering at the
National Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Upholders of traditional family values find little comfort in the home life
of the Patriarch Jacob. The Book of Genesis describes how Jacob divided his
favours between two wives and two slave-girls. The result was an ill-starred
daughter called Dinah and 12 sons, founders of the Twelve Tribes of Israel.
Jacob and his Twelve Sons, which opens next Wednesday at the National
Gallery, London, brings together 13 monumental images of the Patriarchs by
Zurbaran, a master of Spain's Golden Age.
Probably painted in the 1640s, the Patriarchs are not Zurbaran at his best.
Just look at two marvellous paintings in the Spanish gallery next door, 'St
Francis in meditation' and 'St Margaret'. Yet even if much of the Patriarchs
was painted by assistants, they are strikingly decorative in their exotic
costumes, each with an amusingly different different personality.
The Patriarchs also share a fascinating history. Twelve belong to Auckland
Castle, residence of the Bishop of Durham and little known, partly because
they have never been lent before and partly because Auckland Castle is well
off the beaten track. I also hear that the dining room is too poorly lit to
see the Zurbarans properly.
Missing from the set is the 13th Patriarch, the youngest, 'Benjamin'. In its
place hangs a copy made by Arthur Pond, artist and dealer, in 1756 when the
set was split up at auction. Bishop Trevor of Durham must have been greatly
vexed to have missed securing the Benjamin. In his knickerbocker suit with
pink bows, he is one of the most charming figures in the series.
Benjamin went to Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire until six years ago,
when he was lent to the marvellous Zurbaran show in New York and Paris. Now
he has come to London, thus completing the family circle for the first time
since 1756.
It is odd that there should have been this cache of Zurbarans in England, so
long before his name became generally known. Not until the 1830s was
Zurbaran appreciated outside Spain when a huge haul of Spanish paintings,
looted from churches by Napoleon's generals, went on show in the Louvre.
Critics and poets raved about Zurbaran's tenebrous monks and friars,
brooding over skulls and rapt in ecstatic visions.
It was suggested that the Patriarchs were being shipped out to a client in
the Spanish Americas when they were intercepted by corsairs. It was a good
explanation. The theme of the Patriarchs was not common in art, but it did
enjoy a vogue in the Spanish colonies because of a remarkable theory that
American Indians were descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel.
The pirate theory is romantic, but wrong. Zurbaran probably thought he would
attract a colonial buyer, but the paintings seem to have been picked up in
Seville by William Chapman, a London wine shipper who, as a director of the
disastrous South Sea Company, forfeited three-quarters of his assets. The
Patriarchs were bought by a Portuguese Jew with a country house in Surrey.
On his death, the series - minus 'Benjamin' - was bought by the Bishop of
Durham. A strongly Jewish subject may have appealed to Bishop Trevor because
at the time bishops were in favour of allowing English Jews to become
naturalised. However, Trevor preached a sermon looking forward to the day
when 'this hitherto obstinate and impenitent People' would be converted to
Christianity. The strange, colourful figures of Jacob and his Twelve Sons
hanging in his dining room was a reminder to the bishop of the goal which he
might yet achieve. It is a wonderful chance that we can now see these
charming images of Jacob and his 12 strapping sons briefly reunited.
At the National Gallery until May 22 as part of the Spanish Arts Festival.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American television has, on the whole, managed the race conundrum better
than its British counterpart. In Britain broadcasters wring their hands and
say 'Blacks are disadvantaged so we will provide special slots where they
can do their own thing and showcase their own culture'. This unthinking form
of apartheid assumes that black people cannot co-operate let alone compete
with whites but must be treated like babies. Often the results have been
programmes watched by a minority of a minority.
Americans, with their tradition of the melting pot philosophy, tend to say
'Bill Cosby? Who cares what colour he is? Is he talented? Give him a
series', and the series tops the ratings. Today BBC2 begins an acclaimed
American mini-series, Laurel Avenue, stripped across three nights and played
out in real time. It is about a lower middle class family which, as the
executive producer points out, just happens to be black. The appeal is in
the impact and honesty of the drama (9.30).
Earlier Alexei Sayle winds up his BBC1 series about driving skills, Drive
(8.50).

FT  04 MAR 94 / Technology: Profs start IT group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British university academics in the information technology field are
planning a new organisation to act as a source of knowledge and experience
to help society deal with the problems of growing computerisation.
It intends to provide a public platform for IT professionals and to offer
advice to government on issues with an IT content. An example could be the
passage of laws which would require extensive IT support, such as tax
changes.
The 40 or so academics argue that existing bodies such as the British
Computer Society and the Science and Engineering Research Council are overly
preoccupied with computer science and technology and do not properly address
business or social issues.
Among the leaders of the new group, which has yet to be named, are Robert
Galliers of Warwick University and Frank Land of the London School of
Economics. The intention is that the organisation will eventually become the
UK member of a planned international network, the Association for
Information Systems.
The formation of the new body is a response to a perception that too much
attention is paid by Parliament and Whitehall to computer technology and not
enough to the uses of IT in business.
'Our concern is for the design and development of systems which support
business needs and in which there is considerable human input. Technology is
only one part of such a system,' says Land.
Galliers says the new group would have three principal functions: to weld
together members of a fragmented profession, to help inform policy at
national level and to advise on ways of avoiding computer failures. 'At
present, there is the frustration of seeing disasters waiting to happen. The
knowledge to solve these problems already exists,' he says.

The UK's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has developed a process for
measuring how much dust industrial materials produce during manufacturing
processes.
The method is intended to provide a single standardised way of measuring the
dustiness of a wide range of materials.
The process involves a rotating drum, which repeatedly lifts and drops the
material, producing an airborne dust cloud. This determines the size and
type of dust that can enter the nose and mouth.
A complete set of engineering drawings of the prototype for
the new tester is included with a report into the issue.

victims
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Researchers at the University of Southampton have devised a way of using
electrostatic polymer fibres to relieve the suffering to asthma victims
caused by dust mites, the minute creatures which inhabit beds and soft
furnishings.
The fibres, known as electrets, have a permanent electrical charge and so
trap the mites and their droppings by electrostatic attraction.
Because the fibres are both positively and negatively charged, the charges
balance out and so the resulting fibres do not produce the 'cling' or
electrical shock often associated with man-made fibres.
The university's patents are for woven and compact materials to be used in
mattress and duvet covers and for fibres to be interwoven in carpets.

Scientists at IBM in Zurich have developed an electronic 'nose on a chip'
which can accurately measure the minute quantities of heat produced by
chemical reactions.
The device, called a calorimeter, can measure temperature changes as small
as a hundred-thousandth of a degree. By measuring the heat produced the
instrument sniffs out what chemicals are involved in a reaction, making it
potentially useful in drug design and forensic science.
The instrument comprises a micromechanical silicon lever coated with
aluminium.
When heated the lever bends because the two materials expand at different
speeds. The degree of bending is measured by laser. IBM: Switzerland, 1 724

A non-stick coating that can be used on anything from saucepans to cars has
been developed in the US by the Dow Chemical Company.
The water-based chemical can be cured at a much lower temperature (100`C)
than existing coatings, and so has much wider applications.
The coating, which incorporates perfluoroakyl polymers, could even be used
on heat-sensitive materials such as plastics or wallpapers. It dissolves in
water like a soap and so can be painted on to the surface. Then it is baked
to produce the toughened coating.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Sangster, 57, the millionaire racehorse-owner, is limbering up to
join the race for control of United Racecourses, owners of Epsom, Sandown
Park and Kempton Park. He is set to join the tiny media company Sunset and
Vine, if it wins the race to buy the racecourses from the Horserace Betting
Lebvy board, the statutory body which has owned them for over 20 years.
Sunset, which has a market capitalisation of less than Pounds 10m, covers
horse-racing and other sports for Channel 4 and is regarded as the outsider
among the three contenders which put in their bids last Monday. The others
are Racecourse Holdings Trust, owned by the Jockey Club, and a consortium
headed by Stan Clarke, owner of Uttoxeter racecourse.
Sangster's decision to join the board of Sunset and Vine suggests that its
chances of wining control may not be as slender as is sometimes suggested.
Sangster is reputed to be worth Pounds 130m and Richard Thompson, one of the
people behind the Sunset bid, comes from another well known family of
wealthy racehorse-owners. His father, David Thompson, made Pounds 300m from

FT  04 MAR 94 / Technology: Stopping the flood - Nearly a third of the water
supply in England and Wales is lost through leakage. Jane Martinson reports
on new ways to plug the gaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thames Water, Britain's biggest water company, postponed building a Pounds
500m reservoir at the end of last year chiefly because of growing confidence
in its ability to plug leaks.
Technological advances in leakage control could mean that no new large-scale
reservoir will be needed for a decade or more. Charles Hurst, leakage
control manager at Thames Water, estimates that an integrated system of
leakage detection across Thames Water's distribution network will render a
reservoir the size of the proposed one at Abingdon in Oxfordshire - some 10
sq km - unnecessary until 2015. The current postponement is for five years.
Leakage is an important issue in the run-up to the water industry's first
review since privatisation. Oftwat, the industry regulator, will be
reassessing the basis for annual price rises for the next five to 10 years.
Figures from Ofwat reveal that an average 29 per cent of the water supply in
England and Wales is lost through leakage. Both it and the National Rivers
Authority have said they will not favour any plans for large-scale capital
investment projects until companies take action on leakage and consider
installing meters.
'It is a major development for a company to put off a big reservoir,' Hurst
says. 'There were pressures from Ofwat and the National Rivers Authority but
confidence had been built up through the company because of the results we
have achieved with leakage.'
Thames Water's advanced leakage detection equipment is able to record the
size and location of underground leaks much faster and more accurately than
older methods.
The company reports that its 'breakthrough' is saving up to 60m litres of
water a day. Water supply in the area dropped last year by 250m litres a
day, partly because of cost-cutting by industry.
Hurst estimates that without an adequate leakage detection programme a new
medium-sized reservoir would be needed every three years to meet growing
demand, estimated by Thames Water to be between 0.5 and 1 per cent per year.
Conventional techniques for finding underground leaks are time-consuming and
costly. For flow rates to be measured, the water supply to an entire
neighbourhood is usually cut off. Mains have to be recharged and although
such 'step tests' take place during the night when readings are more
accurate, customers are often left without water for hours. The old
equipment was slow to monitor changes and the measured flow rates had to be
taken away for analysis during the day.
Although 10 per cent of leaks are responsible for roughly 90 per cent of
water lost, it was not possible to measure the exact size of a problem,
which often led to mains repairs teams digging down to find only a tiny
leak.
Thames Water contacted Reten Acoustics of Gwent, which developed the Quick
Report Leak Spotter. This instrument translates water flow into electric
signals through a rotating turbine which gives off magnetic pulses. It then
measures the time interval between pulses. The pulse can be timed to one
thousandth of a second, much faster than previously, and give a much more
accurate gauge to the size of the problem. An instant computer read-out is
conveyed to engineers.
The valves in the pipes need to be shut off for only minutes to check flow
rates. A big leak can be detected immediately. Hurst says: 'The concept of
what we are doing is very simple but, until now, we lacked the technology.'
In conjunction with a leak noise correlator which pinpoints the leak's
location, the equipment identifies how fast the leak is flowing. Where
large-scale repairs are unnecessary, pressure control valves are used. These
work on the principle that excess pressure feeds leaks and is therefore
wasted. By reducing pressure, the water lost through leaks is reduced.
Thames Water will introduce variable-outlet pressure control valves in
London to remove unnecessary pressure at night.
The developments at Thames Water are not unique, but they highlight the
flurry of technological activity in the field of leakage control in recent
years.
Stan Bessey, chairman of the National Leakage Initiative set up by the Water
Services Association and the Water Companies Association two years ago,
says: 'Britain leads the field in leakage technology now. This is despite,
or perhaps because of, the high leakage levels.'
Britain's lead stems partly because of its ageing water system, helped by a
Pounds 28bn capital investment programme started in 1990. Thames Water
spends more than Pounds 20m a year in leakage detection. The money spent on
20 Quick Report Leak Spotters (about Pounds 1m) was recouped 'very quickly',
says Hurst.
But it remains to be seen how these improvements in leakage control will be
paid for after the review. There is some conflict over whether Ofwat will
allow Thames Water to increase prices to pay for better control or whether
the company will have to meet the cost through greater efficiency.
Thames Water says that the significant investment needed to set up an entire
leakage control system in the distribution network will form part of
discussions with Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, this spring.
Byatt, in an attempt to 'halt this endless escalation in prices' in the
industry, seems unlikely to agree that customers should pay more for greater
better leakage control. A spokesman for Ofwat said: 'In most cases companies
have got to improve efficiency within existing price limits.'
Thames Water, while keen to advertise it is winning the war against leakage
through its use of technology, may yet have a fight on its hands over who is
to pay.

<TEXT>
James Kinnear, a former chief executive of Texaco, and Eric Clark, an
executive director of BICC, are the latest examples of the growing trend of
companies on both sides of the Atlantic to pick more internationaly-minded
directors.
Kinnear, 65, who stepped down last year as Texaco's chief executive after
nearly 40 years with the US oil giant, has been appointed an advisory
director of Unilever with effect from March 1.
He joins a ten-strong advisory board which the Unilever board consults on
business, social and economic issues. He will also serve on at least one of
three committees: audit, remuneration and external affairs.
Clark, 59, managing director of BICC Cables, a subsidiary of one of the UK's
leading international engineering businesses, has been appointed a
non-executive director of Dana Corporation, which provides equipment for the
transportation industries and is based in Toledo, Ohio.
Clark (right), who has been on Dana's European advisory board since 1991, is
the first European to serve on Dana's main board.
Dana says that Clark's 'demonstrated commitment to achieving growth through
continuous improvement in technology, engineering and lean production
techniques is in perfect synch with Dana's own global growth initaitive'.
Before joining BICC in 1985, Clark spent 15 years with Plessey.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Property: Small is beautiful and profitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small is beautiful: this saying has been a useful rule of thumb for property
funds. Over the past 10 years, property funds have produced better returns
and proved less volatile than larger rival funds, writes Vanessa Houlder.
A report by Gerald Eve and Schroder Properties found that the
best-performing property funds managed property investments of less than
Pounds 50m in total, while returns from larger funds tended to diminish in
line with their size.
This is attributable, in part, to the small funds' greater agility. On
average, smaller portfolios were successful in shifting out of retail
property, which outperformed in the early 1980s, and into industrial
property, which outperformed in the late 1980s.
Smaller funds have tended to be no more volatile than larger funds probably
because they concentrate on smaller properties; this makes it easier for
small funds to diversify a portfolio. Funds with less than Pounds 15m of
property are, however, at a disadvantage because of the smaller numbers of
properties held.
But how much of the smaller funds' outperformance is simply a matter of
luck? Small funds' inability to buy large properties, such as shopping
centres, means they have avoided some of the worst performing sectors in
recent years. 'Smaller funds have benefited by default rather than through a
conscious decision to buy small investments such as shops and industrial
units,' says the report.
However, the tide may shift towards larger property owners. 'The market has
suited smaller investors over the past five years, but the next 10 years are
sure to be different and the bias may well suit the larger investors,' the
report adds.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Property: A capital start in London's long haul - After
three years in the doldrums, the UK capital's office sector is showing signs
of life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's office market is back in business. For the first time since 1988,
the volume of new office construction starts in central London is set to
increase this year, albeit from rock-bottom levels. Even speculative
development is once again viable, in certain locations.
'The opportunities, finance and willingness should be in place for a marked
increase in developer activity in central London in 1994-95,' according to
DTZ Debenham Thorpe, surveyors.
Is London, therefore, experiencing another of its traditional development
cycles? Or is a more fundamental change under way?
Research group Applied Property Research suggests the latter, in a report on
the London office market, published this week. 'Structural changes, which
are fundamental to the central London office market's long-term health, are
beginning to happen,' the report says.
Changing employment patterns, new transport links, more flexible leases and
the increasing obsolescence of old buildings are highlighting the
polarisation between properties that suit tenants' needs and those that fail
them, says APR.
'In the traditional property cycle, even poor quality products let in a good
market. This will no longer be the case,' says APR. Central to this argument
is the view that the letting prospects for some offices are so poor that
they are likely to be demolished or decommissioned when they fall vacant.
'For the first time in the postwar period, there is now evidence that the
market is exerting pressures which will lead to a decrease in the total
office stock,' says APR.
It argues that the area of land devoted to offices in London will decline
because new development will only take place in central locations. In these
areas, the expansion in property stock as a result of redevelopment is more
limited than in fringe locations, where development is often on virgin
office land. Moreover, existing office buildings are being sold for
conversion to residential use, in both prime and fringe locations.
The statistics on office vacancies underline the wide gap in the prospects
for buildings and locations.
The overall availability of offices in London fell from 17 per cent to 14
per cent in 1993, according to DTZ Debenham Thorpe. But in the core areas of
central London there was a 45 per cent fall in the volume of new space
available and a 12 per cent decline in the volume of second-hand units. In
the fringes, the volume of new space declined by a fifth while the volume of
second-hand space increased by 3 per cent.
In the West End, there is a relatively limited supply of large new
buildings, with only five new buildings of more than 50,000 square feet on
the market. Last year demand for buildings totalled 3.8m sq ft, the highest
annual total since 1989. There has been an upturn in speculative
development, with the Prudential and Great Portland Estates both starting
projects. In mid-town, an area including Holborn, Covent Garden and
Bloomsbury, prospects are mixed. Covent Garden market is proving relatively
robust but Holborn is suffering, partly because big tenants such as British
Telecom, British Gas and the Ministry of Defence are likely to vacate large
areas of space over the next five years.
According to DTZ, although the availability of buildings in mid-town dropped
by 30 per cent, to just 9 per cent of the total stock, this was due less to
the (small) rise in take-up than to the withdrawal from the market of
700,000 sq ft of old office space. In the City, underlying rents are
increasing markedly, says APR. In the first half of 1993, lettings were
occuring at 'net effective rents' - which allow for rent-free periods and
other inducements - of no more than Pounds 10 per sq ft in new buildings.
Net effective rents for the best new space in the City are now back in the
'low Pounds 20s' and likely to exceed Pounds 30 per sq ft within a year.
In Docklands, vacancy rates stand at 44 per cent, although total take-up of
781,000 sq ft in 1993 was the highest since 1987. APR argues that Docklands
is set to become a serious option for central London tenants.
Three factors stand in Docklands favour. First, the availability of
high-quality space. Second, competitive prices, of about Pounds 12-Pounds 15
a sq ft, with the first five years of a 15-year lease rent free (though not
in Canary Wharf). Third, Docklands will begin to acquire a critical mass in
the next couple of years, particularly when Credit Suisse First Boston,
Mirror Group and London Underground complete their relocation to the area.
The prospects for the City fringes, which are littered with vacant and
derelict office sites, are poor, according to APR. It believes the City
fringes faces a bleak outlook because of the abundance of empty buildings
and general urban dereliction. Many office occupiers, which in the past had
no choice but to locate in the City fringe, can now get decent second-hand
space in more central locations on the flexible terms they require.
Because the prospects for offices are so poor, the process of converting
offices into residential use is most active in the City fringes. By December
1993, 53 planning permissions and applications had been submitted to the
authorities for residential development on office land or conversion of
office buildings.
'The City fringe is in the firing line of structural change,' says APR.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Management: Employers cast as partners in crime - Who is to
blame for corporate misconduct
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When British Airways was caught last year waging 'dirty tricks' against
Virgin Atlantic, its local arch-rival, many outsiders assumed its campaign
had been authorised by top management. Others accepted BA's protestations
that the offending actions - some of which are now the subject of a lawsuit
in the US - were merely those of a small group of individuals who had
overstepped the bounds of proper behaviour in their eagerness to foster BA's
interests.
A third group of observers felt that, whether or not the employees had
really acted in isolation, the real rogue was BA's abrasive corporate
culture, fostered by the airline's then chairman, Lord King.
This view is given added credence by an article in the latest edition of the
Harvard Business Review* which argues that corporate misconduct is rarely
explained by the flaws of an individual employee. More typically, unethical
business practice reflects the values, attitudes, beliefs, language and
behavioural patterns that define an organisation's operating culture, says
the article's author, Lynn Sharp Paine, a Harvard ethics professor.
Paine's article is directed mainly at American companies, which are rushing
to install 'compliance-based ethics programmes' in order to fall in line
with new federal sentencing guidelines. But her conclusions apply to any
type and nationality of organisation.
The US guidelines, introduced in 1991, partly relate the size of fines for
unlawful conduct to the extent to which companies have tried to prevent that
misconduct. But Paine argues that providing employees with a rule book - as
BA did last year with its hurriedly-introduced code of ethics - is
inadequate on its own.
To foster a climate that encourages exemplary behaviour, she says,
organisations need to take a more comprehensive, 'integrity-based' approach
to ethics management. Such approaches vary in design and scope, but they all
foster guiding values, aspirations, and patterns of thought which support
ethically sound behaviour, plus a sense of shared accountability between
employees.
Sharp cites several American examples where the lack of such a 'governing
ethos', as she calls it, encouraged top, middle and junior managers to
behave unethically. The most recent was in 1992, when a car service offshoot
of Sears Roebuck was accused of misleading customers and selling them
unnecessary parts and services. Sears' chief executive acknowledged
management's responsibility for introducing pay and goal-setting systems
which 'created an environment in which mistakes did occur'.
In stark contrast, Paine says that decisions of thousands of employees at
all levels of Johnson &amp; Johnson were responsible for the US drugs company's
exemplary behaviour in the Tylenol crisis in 1982; they automatically
withdrew all painkillers of that brand from the market after batches were
found to have been poisoned. Without a shared set of values and guiding
principles ingrained throughout the organisation, Paine says it is doubtful
that J&amp;J's response would have been 'as rapid, cohesive and ethically
sound'.
Three years later, Martin Marietta, the US aerospace and defence contractor,
established a comprehensive ethics programme, at a time when its industry
was under attack for fraud and mismanagement and the company itself was
under investigation.
This programme comprises a code of conduct, an ethics training programme for
the whole workforce, and comprehensive procedures for reporting and
investigating ethical concerns within the company. An ethics network
investigates anonymous complaints, and a corporate ethics office manages the
programme under the supervision of a steering committee.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Management: Creative thought stifled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Innovative employees are being stifled by modern management practices
designed to maximise production and individual work output, according to a
report* published yesterday.
Fostering Innovation, published by the British Psychological Society, calls
on organisations to think about how best to encourage innovative staff who,
it suggests, are often overlooked and neglected by employers.
The authors, Michael West of Sheffield University, Clive Fletcher of
Goldsmith's College at the University of London, and John Toplis at the Post
Office training and development group, argue that performance appraisal
systems, goal setting and extra work demands can suffocate innovative
thinking.
They agree that performance monitoring improves effectiveness but say it can
create job insecurity and fear of failure, which both hinder innovative
thought. 'Where people at work feel that their jobs may be threatened if
they make mistakes they are likely to play safe and avoid the risk and
experimentation which is fundamental to innovation,' says the report.
Traditional career paths tend to stifle innovation, say the authors. They
suggest that employees likely to be favoured for promotion at the bottom of
an organisation are those who are accurate, pay attention to detail, rules
and procedures, accept authority, dress conventionally and conform
generally.
In contrast, it describes innovators as people who defy convention, question
authority and dislike routine work and paying attention to details. 'It
would be wrong to give the impression that innovation would be fostered
simply by the employment of radicals. However, organisations also have to
recognise that the complete exclusion of such people could lead to
stagnation,' says the report.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Management: Starck contrast - Alice Rawsthorn witnesses the
design revolution under way at Thomson Consumer Electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A look of disgust flashes across Alain Prestat's face as he grabs the
television remote control pad. 'Ugh]' he groans. 'This is the sort of thing
we used to make. Just look at it. It's so ugly. And user friendly? Huh] It's
so complicated that you'd need a PhD to use it properly.'
'Ugly' and 'complicated' products will, if Prestat has his way, soon be part
of the past at Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE), a division of Thomson,
the state-controlled French electronics group. Prestat has, in his two years
as TCE's chairman, launched a mission to haul the heavily loss-making
company back into the black and has hired Philippe Starck, the maverick
French designer, to orchestrate a new design programme.
When Prestat, 42, arrived at TCE in 1992 from his old post as an adviser to
the French prime minister, the company was in a dismal state. It was the
world's fourth-largest television manufacturer with interests across the
brown goods market and brands such as RCA, Telefunken, Saba, Ferguson and
Thomson. But it was losing market share and burdened by accumulated net
losses of FFr5.5bn (Pounds 630m) from the four preceding years.
Prestat spent his first two years at TCE slashing stocks and shedding staff.
The company last year came back into the black at the operating level.
'After two years on the defensive we've built a solid base for the
business,' he says. 'Now we're ready to deal with the long-term, strategic
issues that we didn't have time for before.'
One of the main issues is the design of TCE's products. Prestat realises
that TCE's long-term prospects hinge on its ability to steal a march over
rivals such as Philips and Sony in the intensely competitive consumer
electronics sector. He believes consumers are bored by the 'grey boxes' that
swamp the market and is convinced that imaginative design could give TCE a
real competitive advantage.
'For years manufacturers have assumed that price and technology were enough
to sell a product. But these days people don't see good technology as
anything special. They expect it. What they do want are appealing products
with their own identities,' he says.
Angela Dean, European electronics analyst at Morgan Stanley, suspects he is
right. 'This market is a nightmare for everyone,' she says. 'But it's
particularly tough for the Europeans because the south-east Asians are not
only more efficient at turning out televisions like cans of peas but at
making them look more attractive. There probably is a demand for
better-looking products. TCE can have a go - but it isn't going to be easy.'
In the past TCE's designs were undertaken by in-house designers based at
each of the company's factories where they worked to specifications provided
by the marketing and technical departments. Prestat wanted the designers to
be more pro-active and better integrated with the rest of the business.
'Design shouldn't be buried inside the company,' he says. 'It's got to be
central to everything we do.'
He was also anxious to ensure that TCE's designers took a fresh look at
their work rather than simply refining old designs, or those of their
rivals. A year ago he asked Philippe Starck to become TCE's artistic
director.
Starck, 45, made his name in the 1980s with witty work such as his
spider-shaped lemon squeezer for Alessi, the Italian kitchen and tableware
manufacturer, and the opulent Royalton Hotel in New York. His brief is to
overhaul TCE's visual identity - from all its products to corporate
stationery - thereby giving him the same degree of control as other
influential corporate design directors such as Dieter Rams at Braun, the
German electronics company. Whereas Braun employs Rams full-time, Starck
works for TCE as a consultant. 'My role is to be a kind of corporate
Candide,' he says. 'It's important for TCE that I continue to come in as an
outsider to look at what everyone's doing. Prestat understands that.'
His first big task, the redesign of TCE's European television sets, will act
as a blueprint for TCE's new approach to design and product development.
Starck has spent the past year working on the project in liaison with
Prestat, his marketing and technology specialists and the new 16-strong
European design team at TCE's Paris headquarters which includes some of the
old factory designers and the young planeurs, or 'gliders', that Starck has
hired on a freelance basis.
The new designs form part of the overall reorganisation of TCE's European
television business. When Prestat arrived the company had seven leading
brands in Europe each with their own ranges of products and market
positions. This meant that TCE missed opportunities to cut costs by pooling
resources and that, sometimes, its own subsidiaries were competing against
each other.
The brands have now been rationalised into three 'families'. To achieve
maximum economies of scale, each family has a unified range of products,
which are sold, for the most part, under different names in different
countries. Starck has identified a different personality for each brand to
reflect its market position.
He sees Thomson, the middle market brand, which carries the name Thomson in
France, Ferguson in the UK and Nordmende in Germany, as a ''techno-zen'
character - a buddhist monk who loves technology'. Saba, the cheaper range,
which is sold as Brandt in France, is 'younger and funkier', Telefunken is
the 'grand bourgeois who loves a grand gesture'.
The completed designs are being kept under wraps at TCE's Paris headquarters
until the first new products (a third of the entire range) are launched in
May with the rest coming out next year. The only clues as to what the new
products will look like lie in Starck's one-off TV sets for Saba and
Telefunken launched last autumn.
Both look dramatically different from anything else on the market. The
Telefunken set has an elegant 1940s feel with a sweeping glass screen and
mahogany case. The Saba mixes green plastic and recycled woodchips.
'There's no reason why televisions should have to come in boring cardboard
boxes,' says Starck. 'We want our products to be fun to buy - just like
opening a Christmas present.'

FT  04 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Formidable rivals on a shifting
battleground - Despite growth in the size Europe's capital markets and the
expertise of its investment banks, they are likely to continue to lag behind
their US counterparts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
In the battle for dominance of global financial services, both the opponents
and the battleground have changed since the turn of the decade.
For much of the 1980s, European banks saw their main competitors as the
Japanese, and the competitive arena as the mainstream business of lending
money. Now receding competition from Japan has been replaced by an intrusion
from the US, with banks competing to underwrite and trade securities rather
than extend loans from their own balance-sheets.
This time, it is the big US investment banks, enriched by a boom in US
equity and bond markets, which have flocked to Europe to exploit the gradual
liberalisation of financial markets. They are proving formidable competitors
as Europe struggles to develop a more powerful and integrated financial
services industry of its own.
The battle to lend money overseas left many casualties. Many banks with
international aspirations lost faith after becoming entangled in bad debts
and, in many cases, retired nursing wounds. According to the Bank for
International Settlements, international bank credit dropped from Dollars
465bn in 1990 to Dollars 80bn the next year.
Banks which extended their domestic retail networks abroad lost money as
they were too small to achieve economies of scale. Only a few European
banks, such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Lyonnais, have maintained a policy
of pursuing cross-border retail banking.
At the same time, large companies have moved away from raising capital
through bank borrowing. Especially in the US, companies have turned to bond
and equity markets to raise finance, placing investment banks that help
companies raise money from capital markets at the cutting edge.
US investment banks start from a strong base. The US has a bigger pool of
mobile capital because it is the world's largest economy and has
independently-managed pension funds. Such pension funds are not as strong in
Europe, outside the UK and the Netherlands.
This means European companies - and governments which are privatising
state-run enterprises - look to the US for capital, and often hire US
investment banks as intermediaries. 'There is no doubt the US banks have an
enormous edge there,' says Mr George Mallinkrodt, chairman of the UK
investment bank Schroders. 'They talk all the time to a group of investors
who are very powerful. There is no conduit like that in Europe, though it
will come in time.'
Mr Walter Gubert, head of the European management committee for JP Morgan,
the US bank, says US capital markets are likely to remain dominant. 'Even if
Europe develops stronger flows of capital, the US will, if anything, become
a more important source of funds, and European companies will have to take
account of that,' he says.
Their strong position has allowed the New York investment banks to invest in
technology and highly-trained professionals. This has helped to give them an
edge in developing capital markets, and in pricing and trading new financial
instruments.
In the past two years, huge amounts of capital have been flowing out of the
US, stimulated by low US interest rates and a search for higher-yield
investments. About 5 per cent of US pension fund money - some Dollars 250bn
 -has been switched overseas. A further Dollars 800bn would flow out if US
funds allocated the same proportion of portfolios to other countries as UK
funds.
European investment banks such as Paribas in France, Mediobanca in Italy and
Schroders and SG Warburg in the UK have strong domestic businesses. But they
have drawn many techniques from the US. These include securities
underwriting methods; the use of capital to trade on their own rather than
clients' behalf; and computer-based pricing models to cal-culate the value
of derivative products.
Mr Rudi Mueller, chairman of Union Bank of Switzerland in London, says that
the power of the US market helps its banks to export home-grown techniques
to Europe. 'They still have the largest pool of top professionals, and that
means that they can transfer their know-how faster,' he says.
The lack of a large pool of mobile capital is not the only challenge facing
Europe. Others include:
Financial centres: Because Europe has several centres offering securities
trading, demand for stocks is fragmented, and the methods of buying and
selling them vary. Although competition between centres such as London and
Frankfurt may reduce costs to investors, Mr Mueller argues that one market
would attract liquidity. 'If we could create a more meaningful European
bourse, the cake would grow for everyone,' he says.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman of Paribas, says that the fact that capital
markets are not linked makes it difficult for Europe to act as a single
force against Japan or the US. 'I think that is a crucial issue for Europe's
chance of competing against other regions,' he says. The US, of course, has
competing exchanges too, but the size of the US capital market means each
can attract enough liquidity to make an efficient market.
Conservative companies: European companies rely more on loan finance, and
lack expertise in capital markets. Mr Mueller says that European corporate
treasurers are catching up, but that 'in the past, the European finance
director tended to be more conservative about trying something new'.
One area in which European companies lag behind their US counterparts is in
gaining ratings from agencies such as Moody's to encourage investors to buy
their debt. Some Dollars 545bn was borrowed in the US commercial paper
market in 1992, against Dollars 79bn in the Euro-commercial paper market.
'The credit issue is a serious issue for the Euromarket,' says Mr Charles
McVeigh, co-head of European investment banking for Salomon Brothers. 'More
credit work should be done by financial intermediaries to allow investors to
have a broader appreciation of corporate credit risk. The unwillingness of
some European companies to obtain credit ratings adds to the problem.'
Asset fragmentation: Small assets such as home mortgages, which are often
packaged into securities and sold to investors in the US, cannot be bundled
together easily in Europe. Because of different jurisdictions and national
customs, it is almost impossible to mix assets from various countries.
Yet the multinational nature of European capital markets gives both them and
investment banks operating within them strengths as well as weaknesses. The
fact that they operate across borders within their home region helps to
develop techniques that are transferable across the world.
With London as the centre of the world's foreign exchange market, European
investors have proved more sophisticated in understanding currency risk than
US ones. The Eurobond market - through which Dollars 400bn was borrowed last
year - is the only large multi-currency bond market.
The development of a liquid global swaps market in the 1970s and 1980s,
allowing borrowers to exploit cheap financing costs in one currency and then
swap the proceeds into a second currency, encouraged opportunistic borrowers
from all over the world to tap the Eurobond market.
Europe's position between the Asian and US time zones has also proved an
advantage. Underwriters of Eurobond issues can start selling into the Far
East at 7am, and at 1pm address the US market. The advent of the global bond
 -traded and settled in any time zone - has further enhanced this role.
European investment banks have gained expertise by having to operate in such
complex markets. The heads of such banks also argue that they gain by being
consistent, rather than entering markets in profitable times and leaving
them when they slacken - a tendency of US banks in the past.
Mr Levy-Lang of Paribas says that the bank has an advantage in recruiting
staff in volatile markets such as those in the Asia Pacific because of its
consistency. 'We can attract some very good people out there who are afraid
of the stop-go approach of some of the American banks,' he says.
Europeans can also claim advantages from being less aggressive than US banks
in using their own capital for trading. Mr Mallinkrodt says this encourages
their clients to trust them. 'If you abdicate from putting your capital into
markets, the first opportunity goes to the funds that you manage,' he says.
Yet the uncomfortable fact is Europe still trails the US in terms of the
size of capital markets; the strength and expertise of investment banks; and
the amount of capital. In each, Europe's resources are growing, but not
necessarily fast enough to catch up with the US.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Day of reckoning looms on pensions -
Pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How the European Union's capital markets develop in the next few years will
depend in part on how governments tackle the dilemmas they face over
providing pensions for their ageing populations.
On one hand, shrinking workforces and growing numbers of retired people are
likely to impose intolerable strains on existing European state pension
schemes. On the other, large amounts of capital from people forced to
provide for their own retirement could be drawn into private savings and
investment. If governments seize the chance, this flow of funds could help
stimulate diversified and flexible capital markets across Europe.
At present, most west European states rely mainly on so-called pay-as-you-go
schemes for state retirement provision, in which younger working people
effectively finance their parents' pensions. But the greying of the EU's
population is putting such schemes under extreme pressure. Governments will
soon face a painful choice between cutting benefits and imposing swingeing
tax increases to finance the rising pension bill.
Already most EU countries have raised retirement ages for women and
lengthened the number of years of employment needed to qualify for the
maximum state pension. But these changes are only a start; to go further
means entering a political minefield.
A more palatable approach has been developed in North America, the UK and
the Netherlands. There, private pension schemes have developed large pools
of capital by extracting contributions from both workers and employers. The
resulting combined savings have not only eased pressure on state-funded
retirement provision but had a dramatic impact on domestic and foreign
capital markets.
In the UK, an estimated Pounds 350bn in pension scheme assets means pension
funds own at least 30 per cent of the UK stock market. Now, most other
European countries are studying whether to adopt funded private schemes.
According to Mr Karel Lanoo, researcher with the Brussels-based Centre for
European Policy Studies, the difficulty governments face is that fiscal
incentives are needed to encourage greater private pension provision.
'You are asking people to do this while they are still paying significant
taxes for those currently receiving pension benefits.' But offering tax
incentives means less cash for today's pensions bill.
Italy has forced through unpopular measures modestly limiting the
availability of state pensions. Tax incentives have been made available and
a nascent personal pensions sector now exists.
The French government, by contrast, plans to provide for funded private
pension schemes to complement the pay-as-you-go system. But it has postponed
this until the autumn, in part because of concern about the impact of such
schemes on public finances and personal consumption.
Switzerland, which has long operated a funded scheme for its state pensions,
introduced mandatory requirements for employers to contribute to funded
private pension schemes for their workers in 1985. Switzerland is one of
only four European countries where pension scheme assets exceed those of
insurance companies.
Even if EU member states develop pools of pension assets, they have yet to
resolve how these funds can be invested to maximum effect.
The Anglo-Saxon style of equity-based investment and geographically spread
pension portfolios is alien to most EU countries, which prescribe limits on
pension fund investments, by currency and class of asset - favouring
domestic fixed-interest securities.
In Germany, which has a relatively small independent pension sector, no more
than 5 per cent of assets may be invested in non-German assets and no more
than 30 per cent in equities. Denmark requires that 60 per cent of assets be
invested in domestic government and mortgage bonds.
Such restrictions usually spell lower returns. They have also constrained
the growth of institutional investment and international equity markets in
Europe.
The European Federation of Retired People, a grouping of occupational
pension providers, says the UK and the Netherlands, with almost no
restrictions on investment, accounted last year for about 93 per cent of all
EU pension fund investment outside its own currency area.
The issue of the restrictions has proved so thorny that a proposed EU
directive intended to liberalise pension fund investment has been
temporarily shelved. It would have barred countries from insisting on
minimum investments in asset classes, allowed pension schemes to invest up
to 40 per cent of assets in non-domestic currencies and allowed a pension
scheme to hire a non-domestic investment manager.
The problem, according to Mr Giovanni Tamburi, partner at consulting
actuaries R Watson in Geneva, is that governments have confused the question
of how best to finance retirement provision with other social goals, such as
bolstering domestic industry or reducing public borrowing.
There is no doubt that investment restrictions can seriously undermine
returns for private pension schemes.
Moreover, the US and UK experiences of pension schemes and voluminous
academic research establish an overwhelmingly strong case that
diversification of portfolios reduces risk.
The lesson of diversification has not been lost on US pension fund managers,
who until a decade ago largely shunned foreign investments. They now put an
average of 6 per cent of their Dollars 4,000bn in assets abroad, according
to InterSec Research, which specialises in tracking pension fund investment.
'There is a top tier of managers of larger funds who are putting as much as
15 percent of assets abroad,' according to Ms Alexe Nowakowski, associate
consultant at InterSec. InterSec estimates that, in the first half of 1993
alone, close to Dollars 30bn in net new cash was sent abroad by US pension
scheme managers in search of higher returns. Of that, only 15 per cent was
specifically destined for Europe.
Europe, by contrast, has hardly begun to resolve how to generate and channel
institutional capital of this kind, or, more generally, how to structure and
finance pension provision. As the new century approaches, the options for
pensions provision narrow and the day of reckoning looms closer.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Powerhouse holds its ground - Case
studty, Barclays / London is the world foreign exchange 'powerhouse' - and
the UK's competitive edge is growing sharper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH

In a large open space enclosed by cream-coloured walls and crammed with
computers, foreign exchange traders munch bananas, drink mineral water and
wait for something to happen. The dealing room of the Barclays banking group
next to the Tower of London forms a hub of the world-wide foreign exchange
market that transacts Dollars 1,000bn a day.
Like seismologists, dealers await the next earthquake. The better-paid may
anticipate or even provoke it. 'You go through periods of indescribable
boredom,' says Mr Christopher Taylor, head of sales at Barclays' global
foreign exchange operations. 'Then things take off, go crazy and become
totally calm again.'
The size and sophistication of the trading floor are reminders of the City
of London's international prowess. This is one economic sector where the UK,
unusually, is ahead of the field. London's share of volumes traded on
international currency markets, estimated at one-third of the total, is well
ahead of competing European centres, and is judged to be growing at the
expense of New York and Tokyo.
But the brain power and technology focused on managing financial market
risks highlight a basic uncertainty in European business. 'The foreign
exchanges give the opinion of the world on political events,' says Mr
Taylor, a 36-year-old specialist in options and derivatives. Since 1992,
European currency relationships have become much more volatile. Mr Taylor
does not think Europe's plans for monetary union will be realised.
'Countries' economies cannot be synchronised.'
Along with others like Citibank and Union Bank of Switzerland, Barclays is
among the half-dozen international banks that dominate the market in foreign
exchange. The big market-makers give their customers the chance both to
guard against and to profit from currency movements by providing buying and
selling prices 24 hours a day.
Because of the risk to banks' capital of exposure to large exchange rate
changes in a narrow-margin, high-volume business, market-making requires
in-depth management expertise. 'A lot of our brain power does not go into
trading. It goes into (monitoring) risk.'
The Barclays foreign exchange and money market trading room employs 250 to
300 dealers, trading 96 currencies. Mr Taylor says. 'There's a tendency for
money dealing to gravitate towards London, to pool liquidity in one centre.
The powerhouse is here.'
Although markets may go through periods of relative stability, Mr Taylor
says, 'market making is not as scientific as in the past, where prices moved
smoothly from one level to another. Trade and volume are increasing, but
liquidity is becoming less reliable. That's why we see markets moving more
suddenly. It's a nightmare for market makers.'
None the less, periods of nervousness, giving rise to large price movements
and sizeable dealing spreads, are the ones where market-makers earn the
biggest profits. The banks hope the next nightmare will not be too long
delayed.
This is the seventh part of a ten-part series. Next Monday: European markets

FT  04 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Lending climate tightens banking
disciplines - Small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest European economy was rebuilt from the devastation of the last
world war by partnership between banks and small and medium-sized
enterprises. Yet whether that outstandingly successful record can succeed is
now in doubt as Europe faces up to cyclical and structural challenges.
The German Mittelstand remains a thriving, stable layer of enterprises
largely funded by long-term and fixed-rate finance. Some is in loans
financed by development banks led by the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
(KfW), the public sector agency which in 1992 lent DM29bn to the sector
through banks.
This system is admired around the world for the stability it contributes to
small business development. But Mr Klaus Juncker, Deutsche Bank's chief
operating officer for corporate banking, says it faces a test from recession
and industrial restructuring forced by unification.
'Even if there is a turnround in the economy, we will still have structural
changes in many industries,' says Mr Juncker. He argues the system will
survive if banks stay close to their customers and use networks of
industrial relationships to analyse risk properly.
Yet the increased risk of financing small and medium-sized businesses in
recession has already damaged similar relationships elsewhere. Tensions
between banks financing small businesses and enterprises borrowing capital
have spread across Europe over the past six months. This matters especially
in Europe where small businesses tend to rely more than their US
counterparts on loan finance from banks.
The failure of thousands of small and medium-sized British enterprises which
used short-term debt and overdraft finance for working capital has caused a
shock. 'The relationship has been weakened on both sides,' says Mr Stuart
White, head of small business at Midland Bank in the UK. And in France, a
wave of small business failures led banks and business groups to call for
help last year. The government has been forced to take a series of measures
to help stimulate lending to small and medium-sized firms, including
injecting Ffr300m into a loan guarantee fund called Sofaris.
The strain on relations between banks and small and medium-sized enterprises
has big implications, both for financing growth and for the banks
themselves. Retail banks have become more dependent on small companies for
revenue as large companies switch borrowing to capital markets.
The main problem in lending to small business is that while the returns are
high, so are the risks. German banks which take on the credit risk even of
KfW loans do so only after very careful analysis. Mr Gunter Braunig, the
KfW's head of branch operations, argues the German system depends on
analysis of the company which is borrowing money and on an emphasis on
long-term finance. Some 31 per cent of finance for small companies in
Germany is in long-term loans, against 11 per cent in the UK. This stability
comes at a price. German banks gain a lot of useful knowledge from their
holdings of equity and loans in many industrial sectors.
The German savings banks, which provide most small business finance, can
sustain large branch networks and a strong local presence partly because
they face no pressures from shareholders to cut costs. Savings banks protest
they might lose touch with customers if privatised, as some German
politicians have urged.
Yet the pressure both for privatisation and the formation of
independently-managed pension funds in Europe could bring disciplines of
short-term profitability much more sharply to bear on banks. With fewer
staff, they might find it harder to assess well the risks of lending to
small firms.
The prospect that financing for small firms might then dry up seems remote.
In the UK, bank lending to small firms rose sixfold in real terms in the 15
years to 1992. Banks have little choice but to continue to do business with
small firms, given the paucity of other forms of corporate lending.
But that does not mean that they will have to lend money to all the firms
they did in the past. Nor does it mean they will lend on the same terms.
Without public subsidies - which French and British banks have been calling
for over the past year - banks may be far more selective about making
short-term loans at variable rates to companies they cannot fully
understand.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Lloyds gives way on cheque clearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds yesterday became the last of the big four clearing banks to say that
it would cut from three days to two the amount of time before it pays
interest on a cheque paid into a personal account.
The move follows a high-profile and effective campaign from the consumer
lobby and the Labour party against the longer clearing cycle previously used
by three of the four.
Midland and National Westminster announced changes in their practices last
month. Barclays was already operating a shorter clearing period, and has
recently capitalised on that fact while the other banks have been under
pressure.
Lloyds said yesterday that from June customers paying in a cheque on a
Monday would be entitled to interest on the Wednesday and have access to the
money from the Thursday instead of the Friday.
As a further change, a Lloyds customer paying cash into any of the bank's
branches will be entitled to interest on it on the same day. The changes are
estimated to cost Lloyds some Pounds 20m in lost income over a year.
The other three big clearers were reluctant at first to adopt Barclays'
practice.
They argued that the interest gained by placing the money on the
international markets for the extra day contributed to the Pounds 4.5bn
costs of running the clearing system. They also said customers would not
receive any significant benefit from crediting interest a day earlier.
But the publicity attracted by the clearing cycle turned the time-lag into a
customer issue, so the banks yielded.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, is now turning his
attention to the clearing cycle operated by building societies.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A total of 17 company directors were disqualified for up to 12 years during
the final quarter of 1993, Department of Trade and Industry figures showed
yesterday. Eight disqualifications arose from civil proceedings after
confidential company investigations, and nine resulted from criminal
proceedings following reports from Official Receivers.
The DTI's investigations division dealt with 260 requests for investigations
in the quarter, bringing the number for the year ending December 31 1993 to
1,086, an increase of 12 per cent on the previous year's 967. Of 260
requests, the division accepted 98 for confidential investigations.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Ro-ro unit at Humber port to be enlarged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Associated British Ports, Britain's largest ports operator, has signed a
long-term agreement with DFDS Group to extend facilities for roll-on
roll-off ferries at Immingham, Humberside.
ABP will spend about Pounds 13m to replace the single berth used by DFDS for
its service to Cuxhaven, Germany, with a new ro-ro terminal with up to four
berths.
The work, which is due to be completed by April 1995, will involve the
excavation of 20,000 sq m at the south-west arm of the port and an increase
in the terminal from 11 to 35 acres.
DFDS is to concentrate its Humber links with Sweden, Denmark and Germany at
the Immingham terminal early in 1995. Its Netherlands service may follow
later.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Labour retreats on election pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday issued its most unequivocal statement that it has
disavowed its 1992 election pledge to increase basic state pensions for all.
At a Fabian society conference Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security
secretary, said that raising basic pensions for all was impracticable. 'The
problems can't be solved by simply raising the basic state pension,' he
said. 'The Labour party believes pension provision should reflect increasing
national wealth and make a significant contribution to security in
retirement. But we have to recognise the limitations.'
Labour party officials have privately acknowledged that the pledge to raise
basic pensions for all had limited flexibility on other spending pledges and
committed the party to unpopular tax rises.
However, Mr Dewar also made clear that Labour was not interested in
means-testing the basic state pension, saying it must continue to be
universal. He also called for direct statutory regulation of personal
pensions.
Meanwhile Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons social
security committee, unveiled at the same conference a plan for a National
Savings Personal Pensions Plan.
Investments in the plan would be linked to one or more index-tracking fund
and cover a range of bonds and equities. Its management could be contracted
out to the private sector and would have very low charges.
When pensions become payable, there will be an 'open market option' to
enable pensioners to purchase annuities from the most competitive life
insurance companies.

FT  04 MAR 94 / London School of Economics and Political Science say student
loans should be privatised
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's student loans scheme should be privatised, with repayments
collected via National Insurance contributions, say a group of academics
from the London School of Economics and Political Science.
In a report they say that government spending per student has been reduced
by more than a third between 1974 and 1990, and 'the result has been an
erosion in quality'.
Student loans are organised by the Student Loans Company, an education
department quango, and repaid in fixed instalments.
The academics say asking for repayments via an extra percentage point of
income on National Insurance contributions would minimise the deterrent
effect.
Average repayment periods would be longer but low earners or part-time
workers would repay more than under the current scheme, which exempts all
those paid less than 85 per cent of average earnings from repayments.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Life insurers face jump in fines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scale of fines faced by life insurance firms that fail to meet standards
set by their regulator will rise sharply and is likely to start at more than
Pounds 200,000.
For the longer-term, however, Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for
the life insurance industry, is considering a regulatory system providing a
commercial incentive for firms to reach high levels of compliance.
'I believe that in the next year or so, regulators will need to start
introducing a system based on incentives as well as penalties,' Mr Kit
Jebens, Lautro chief executive, said yesterday.
Lautro's warning that fines for those with seriously inadequate compliance
procedures would increase substantially comes within a week of its imposing
a record fine of Pounds 180,000 on Legal &amp; General. L&amp;G also had to pay
Lautro's costs of Pounds 220,000.
Mr Jebens said that, given the extensive guidance issued, there could be
'little excuse for failures to come up to standard' in the second round of
inspection visits which has already begun.
Lautro remains conscious, however, that the fines it imposes will bear
directly or indirectly on a life office's policyholders, and so is keen not
to embark on a practice that leads inexorably to ever-rising penalties.
It believes that the adverse publicity suffered is a powerful weapon in
itself.
Mr Jebens said that one possible way of providing an incentive was a system
of grading life companies in accordance with their record on compliance and
customer care.
Those which achieved the highest grade would be given greater room for
manoeuvre than the other categories in the structures and procedures for
achieving satisfactory standards.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Pension schemes reduce investment in equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pension schemes cut investment in domestic equities in 1993, the first time
they had done so in 10 years.
The WM Company, which measures the performance of UK pension funds, found
that of the Pounds 3.4bn in net new cash available for investment last year,
there was a disinvestment in UK equities of Pounds 1.4bn, or 41 per cent of
available cash. The main beneficiaries of that disinvestment were UK
index-linked gilts, cash and cash-like instruments, and overseas equities.
The WM survey also found that the average UK pension fund manager
underperformed the FT-A All Share index slightly, partly reflecting an
underweighting in the shares of HongKong and Shanghai Bank.
While the FT-A had a total return of 28.4 per cent in 1993, the average WM
Company pension fund manager had a total UK equities return of 27.9 per
cent.
Across all asset classes, the average pension fund had a total return of
28.2 per cent.
Mr George Urquhart, client manager at WM, said the reasons for disinvestment
in UK equities may have been more a reflection of a desire by pension
schemes to match assets and liabilities rather than any fundamental judgment
about the value of UK stock markets.
Several schemes in the 'WM 50' index - 54 schemes with assets of Pounds 1bn
or more apiece - have undertaken studies of their assets and liabilities in
the past year to assess how well they are structured to meet pension
liabilities as they fall due.
Mature schemes with large numbers of current or deferred pensioners need to
be more heavily weighted in fixed-interest securities, and Mr Urquhart said
these schemes may have pared equity holdings as a result.
Many schemes in the WM 50 Index are those of large formerly nationalised
industries which are currently cutting staff.
The survey also found that, as a proportion of total holdings, UK pension
funds reduced their average weighting in UK equities in 1993 to 56 per cent
from 58 per cent in 1992. Overseas equities rose to a record 24 per cent of
total assets while UK property holdings edged down to 5 per cent from 6 per
cent.
In 1984, the average UK pension scheme held 10 per cent of assets in UK
property.
The best-performing asset class were equities invested in Far Eastern
equities excluding Japan. These had a total return of 95.3 per cent.

FT  04 MAR 94 / English universities avoid admissions cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Universities in England will admit more new students this year than they did
in 1993 in spite of government plans announced in the Budget to cut the
intake by 3.5 per cent.
The Treasury and the education department had overestimated the number of
students already in the system by 10,000 - equivalent to the student
population of a large university, said the Higher Education Funding Council
for England.
But university vice-chancellors predicted the total number of disappointed
place-seekers would increase, as early figures from the Universities and
Colleges and Admissions Service suggested a rise of about 10,000 applicants.
The funding council yesterday announced the grants it would pay to each
university and higher education institution in England for the next academic
year.
For the first time it has set targets for the maximum number of students in
each institution, to help the government's plan of halting university
expansion.
The council will apply a financial 'cap' so that universities will receive
no extra funding for any students they admit above their target figure.
This follows several years of expansion which last year saw 'old'
universities - excluding former polytechnics - increase their intake by 7
per cent.
The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals described the government's
policies as 'stop-go', and said quality was at risk.
Among individual institutions, Oxford and Cambridge both fared well from the
grant reallocation, with a rise in total grant of 5.8 per cent.
Professor Graeme Davies, chief executive of the funding council, said Oxford
and Cambridge had benefited from a reassessment of research funding.
They also avoided being penalised for over-expansion last year. Less
traditionally prestigious universities which also secured funding increases
of more than 5 per cent included Coventry, Plymouth, and Portsmouth, all
polytechnics until two years ago.
The London School of Economics and Political Science was one of nine
institutions limited to a below-inflation increase of only one 1 per cent.
Last year the LSE announced a plan to charge students an extra fee for
tuition, claiming this would be necessary to maintain academic standards.
This was eventually voted down by lecturers, but the move indicated that the
LSE was unhappy with its level of funding.
Some specialist institutions that do not have university status enjoyed
spectacular shifts in funding. Lackham College of Agriculture near
Chippenham in Wiltshire secured the greatest rise in grant - 55.4 per cent.
The University of East Anglia, despite an increase of 3.4 per cent in
funding, predicted it would have to cut intake by about 8 per cent compared
with last year because the funding council had not taken into account the
number of four-year courses it offered.
The university would be able to meet its cap on total admissions only by
cutting first-year admissions.
It said other universities could be affected by the same problem.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Manchester Olympic bid in surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manchester's failed bid for the 2000 Olympic games made a surplus of Pounds
1,626 on income of Pounds 5.59m, according to final accounts published
yesterday.
Sir Robert Scott, chairman of the bid committee, said the 'huge generosity'
of supporters, plus tight controls, had been responsible.
The bid cost more than Pounds 8m, but about Pounds 3m was given in kind by
corporate sponsors, including discounted hotel accommodation, air travel,
consultancy, office furniture, equipment and printing.
The private sector contributed Pounds 3.07m, with the government putting in
Pounds 2.2m. Sale of merchandise such as mugs and T-shirts raised Pounds
320,000.
Neither Manchester City Council nor the British Olympic Association, which
made the bid jointly, had to contribute money.
The biggest single costs were salaries at Pounds 640,330 and visits by 80 of
the 91 members of the International Olympic Committee at Pounds 564,990.
Trips by leaders of the bid cost Pounds 313,040, not including the final
lobbying of the IOC in Monte Carlo last September, which cost Pounds
250,330.
Public relations were costed at Pounds 295,830, but the bid attracted
between 75 and 100 articles a month in British media and widespread coverage
by international newspapers and broadcasters.
Development of sporting venues such as the new velodrome and arena, and
design of the planned Millennium Stadium, cost a total of Pounds 589,110
including Pounds 264,030 for 'master planning' and Pounds 177,510 for
consultation. The bid document cost Pounds 200,140 to prepare.
The accounts are for the bid itself and do not include Pounds 75m given by
the government towards land acquisition, clearance, environmental
improvements and the velodrome and arena.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, has estimated the total regional
economic benefit of the bid and the new facilities at about Pounds 200m and
480 jobs.
The biggest single sponsor of the bid was Manchester Airport with Pounds
400,000. Other big contributors have included National Westminster bank -
which gave Pounds 100,000 for Manchester's failed 1996 bid and Pounds
150,000 this time - and Boddington's, the local brewing subsidiary of
Whitbread, which also gave Pounds 150,000.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Oxbridge benefits from grant share-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oxford and Cambridge are among the greatest gainers from the reallocation of
government grants to universities for the academic year 1994-5.
Both received increases of 5.8 per cent compared with this year's total
funding. Only the London Business School and the Open University are ahead
of them.
Professor Graeme Davies, chief executive of the Higher Education Funding
Council for England, said both universities had benefited from a
reassessment of research funding.
They also avoided being penalised for over-expansion last year. Less
traditionally prestigious universities which also secured funding increases
of more than 5 per cent included Coventry, Plymouth, and Portsmouth, all of
which were polytechnics until two years ago.
The London School of Economics and Political Science, educator of numerous
world leaders, is one of nine universities limited to a below-inflation
increase of only 1 per cent. Bristol, another traditionally prestigious
university, is also among the nine.
Last year the LSE announced a plan to charge students an extra fee for
tuition, claiming this would be necessary to maintain academic standards.
This was eventually voted down by lecturers, but the move indicated that the
LSE was unhappy with its level of funding.
Some specialist institutions that do not have university status enjoyed
spectacular shifts in funding. Lackham College of Agriculture near
Chippenham secured the greatest rise in grant - 55.4 per cent.
The effect on intakes next year will vary widely between different
universities. Changes in overall funding will have less impact than the
target figure set by the funding council.
The University of East Anglia, despite an increase of 3.4 per cent in
funding, predicted it would have to cut intake by about 8 per cent compared
with last year.
It said the funding council had not taken into account the number of
four-year courses it offered, so it would be able to accommodate its cap on
total admissions only by cutting the number it introduced in the first year.
It said that other universities could be affected by the same problem.
Prof Davies predicted that the sharpest cuts, of around 10 per cent, would
be made by the former higher-education colleges, such as Derby and Luton,
which boosted their admissions while pre-paring bids for university status.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Feuds doused by Red Adair MP: Sir Terence Higgins must be
feeling hard-pressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Terence Higgins must be feeling a bit like a hard-pressed heathland
fire-fighter.
Whenever a flare-up has threatened in the Commons committee system as a
result of Labour's campaign of procedural non-co-operation with the
government, the veteran Tory MP has hosed it down in his capacity as
chairman of the liaison committee - the committee of heads of all the select
committees.
But with no sign so far of a change of heart by Labour, Sir Terence has yet
to be blessed with the break that would permit him to stand easy.
His skills may soon be called upon again to quell a row over a planned
foreign affairs committee trip to Brussels.
It is the consequences for the system that have provoked the most bad blood
in Labour's procedural battle.
Tory MPs have bridled at being deprived of expenses-paid trips to South
Africa and Belize.
Meanwhile serious students of constitutional matters, including Sir Terence,
cannot see why the main opposition party should wish to hamper the
functioning of parliament's most powerful tool for scrutinising the
executive.
They believe Labour is cutting off its nose to spite its face by refusing to
let its MPs 'pair' - agreeing with a Tory counterpart to miss non-crucial
votes - at least in the effects of this on the committees.
An indication that Labour sees some merit in this argument came when it
agreed to allow one of its MPs to visit Bosnia next week, as part of an
expedition by the defence committee. The shadow cabinet agreed on Wednesday
night that this was a special case.
But the party has made clear both that the ban on 'pairing' stays and that
the leadership is determined to pursue its non-co-operation policy.
Opposition business managers argue that there is nothing to stop MPs going
ahead with pre-arranged foreign visits without their Labour colleagues. Some
Labour whips have even been known, in unguarded moments, to question the
value of most overseas visits - a view with which many taxpayers might
sympathise.
Seven Labour leftwingers yesterday tabled a Commons motion expressing
'appreciation' for the saving of over Pounds 100,000 on fact-finding tours
by committees 'because of non-co-operation preventing such excursions'.
Sir Terence's flame-dousing skills worked again this week when Conservative
members of the trade and industry committee in effect withdrew their threat
to unseat Mr Richard Caborn, its Labour chairman.
This was after the committee agreed a report to parliament criticising
Labour for blocking the body's planned visit to South Africa.
'Due to the intervention of the opposition the committee was not able to
make the visit at the time intended,' the report said.
'Political disagreements elsewhere in the House related to the conduct of
legislation should not be allowed to impede scrutiny of the executive by
select committees.'
Labour could have retaliated to the threat against Mr Caborn by paralysing
the entire committee system.
The trade and industry committee is also calling for a full review by
backbench MPs of the committees. This would examine - among other subjects -
whether there should be an automatic right for committee recommendations to
be put to a Commons vote.
Some committee members are understood to believe this review should contain
an international dimension, comparing the British system with the
functioning of congressional bodies in the US.
If the review goes ahead, some good may come out of the wrangling.
In the meantime, Sir Terence will no doubt be turning his mind to stopping
sparks flying over the planned Brussels trip.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Scotland to upgrade Higher examination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotland is to upgrade its Higher examination for secondary school leavers,
James Buxton writes. The Higher is to be modified to include vocational
subjects, and longer teaching time will be allocated to the exams, which
pupils take one year after they sit the standard grade exam - equivalent to
the English GCSE.
There will also be a new advanced Higher involving a two-year course instead
of the one-year Higher course. Pupils aiming at advanced Highers will not
usually sit the normal Higher, making the advanced Higher somewhat similar
to English A-levels.
The changes, taking effect from 1997, were announced by Mr Ian Lang,
Scottish secretary, in response to the 1992 report by Professor John Howie
which said the Higher should be replaced for more academic pupils by a
'baccalaureate' which would provide greater depth and breadth.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Life houses face steep rise in Lautro fines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scale of fines faced by life insurance firms which fail to meet
standards set by their regulator will rise sharply and is likely to start at
more than Pounds 200,000.
For the longer-term, however, Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for
the life insurance industry, is considering a regulatory system providing a
commercial incentive for firms to reach high levels of compliance.
'I believe that in the next year or so, regulators will need to start
introducing a system based on incentives as well as penalties,' Mr Kit
Jebens, Lautro chief executive, said yesterday.
Lautro's warning that fines for those with seriously inadequate compliance
procedures would increase substantially comes within a week of its imposing
a record fine of Pounds 180,000 on Legal &amp; General, one of the largest UK
life and general insurance companies, for a widespread and systemic failure
in its compliance systems. L&amp;G also had to pay Lautro's costs of Pounds
220,000.
Mr Jebens said that, given the extensive guidance issued, there could be
'little excuse for failures to come up to standard' in the second round of
inspection visits which has already begun.
Lautro remains conscious, however, that the fines it imposes will bear
directly or indirectly on a life office's policyholders, and so is keen not
to embark on a practice that leads inexorably to ever-rising penalties.
It believes that the adverse publicity suffered by a fined firm is a
powerful weapon in itself.
Mr Jebens said that one possible way of providing an incentive was a system
of grading life companies in accordance with their record on compliance and
customer care.
Those which achieved the highest grade would be given greater room for
manoeuvre than the other categories in the structures and procedures for
achieving satisfactory standards. This would give them greater flexibility
in deciding how they meet the regulator's requirements.
A pilot study into devising effective and accurate ways of measuring a
firm's service to customers is under way at Lautro.
The results are to be passed to the Personal Investment Authority, the new
regulator for retail financial services, which is due to come into operation
in July.
Yesterday's tough stance was signalled in November 1993 when Mr Barry
Sherlock, Lautro chairman, said that the one-in-six failure rate in first
inspection visits was unacceptable, and that penalties would be heavier for
those failing in the second round.

FT  04 MAR 94 / BT looks abroad for video trials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications announced yesterday that its video-on-demand
trials will use technology developed by north American and French companies.
Two trials are planned for this year. The first, covering 70 BT employees in
Kesgrave near Ipswich, will be a technical trial. It will be followed later
this year by a commercial trial involving 2,500 residents in a place yet to
be decided.
The trials will pilot two technologies: the use of ADSL electronics to
upgrade copper wire to carry video pictures; and the more ambitious option
of extending fibre-optics into the home.
Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecoms manufacturer, has won the contract
for the ADSL equipment. Alcatel, the French supplier, will provide the fibre
technology.
Three US companies - Oracle, nCube and Apple Computer - will supply software
and hardware. Oracle will provide software and systems-integration services,
nCube will provide multimedia server hardware and Apple Computer will supply
'set top boxes' to decode the digital multimedia signals.
The technical trial will be limited to programming, using material supplied
by broadcasters including the BBC, Carlton Communications, London Weekend
Television and Granada. The commercial trial may extend to information
services.
On the basis of the experiments, BT will decide whether to proceed with a
heavy investment - about Pounds 15bn - to upgrade its network to provide
broadband services.
Until recently, BT insisted that the government's refusal to allow it to
provide entertainment services until at least 2001 made it uneconomic to
extend fibre down to the local network. But, with US phone companies
announcing ambitious network modernisation plans, senior BT executives are
anxious not to be left behind.
Participants in the initial trial will be able to call up more than 250
hours of programming through video remote-control devices. The material is
transmitted from a central database over the upgraded telephone network to
the television.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Major joins attack on executive pay increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, joined Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
in the Commons yesterday in condemning excessive pay awards to company
chairmen and senior executives.
There were fierce protests from the opposition benches when both insisted
that there was no case for government intervention - with the chancellor
ruling out an increase in the top rate of income tax.
Mr Major recalled that it was in 1991 when he first stated that 'excessive
pay awards' were not justified. He had not altered his view that pay was a
matter between employer and employee, and company and management, rather
than for the government.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said that there was anger throughout the
country over top people securing massive pay increases while others had to
bear massive tax increases.
Undeterred by Labour jeers, the prime minister said Britain was 'a free
capitalist country' in which wage rates were determined by companies. He
argued that Mr Smith's demand for government intervention undermined
Labour's claim to have modernised its ideas and to be more understanding
about the needs of free enterprise.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, accused the government of having one
tax law for company boardrooms and another for everybody else. He maintained
that if executive share options were fully taxed it would make Pounds 200m
available for public services. He pressed the chancellor to act over the
'unacceptable face of capitalism'.
Mr Brown condemned the tax-free handout secured by Mr John Cahill when he
stepped down from the chairmanship of British Aerospace, and the Pounds
370,000 rise awarded in one year to Lord Young, chairman of Cable and
Wireless.
Mr Clarke said he frequently urged restraint on those who led British
industry at a time when it was necessary to maintain competitiveness and low
inflation.
'Individuals get cited who are wholly untypical of British management, most
of whom have exercised such constraint,' said Mr Clarke.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Take-home pay gulf broadens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gulf between the take-home pay of chief executives and that of other
employees has broadened markedly in the past 15 years according to figures
released today by a leading employment researcher, Richard Donkin writes.
Comparisons published by Incomes Data Services in its latest management pay
review also demonstrate that recent government figures recognising that the
tax burden had shifted conspicuously from high to low earners did not show
the full extent of the earnings gap that had developed.
While the take-home pay of employees on average earnings has grown fourfold
since 1978-79, chief executives' pay after deductions has increased on
average more than sixfold, according to the report. The differences in the
rate at which earnings have multiplied become apparent when comparing gross
earnings of both income groups. In the period from 1978-79 to 1994-95, the
average gross earnings of a chief executive rose by nearly six times from
Pounds 18,333 to the Pounds 106,168 that would be earned in the coming
financial year. The gross pay of those on average earnings increased by just
over four times from Pounds 4,826 to a projected Pounds 19,463 in the same
period.
Changes in the tax regime only served to compound the effect on
differentials, says the report.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Three jailed after accepting bribes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three businessmen who admitted accepting bribes to influence the awarding of
contracts for big engineering projects were jailed for between six months
and two years at Southwark Crown Court yesterday.
Mr Donald Richards, the former head of Donnar Services, a marketing and
personnel company, was imprisoned for two years and fined Pounds 30,000. Mr
Robert Wilcox and Mr Colin Read, both former employees of NEI Thompson
Kennicott, the engineering company, were jailed for one year and six months
respectively.
All three had admitted various charges of conspiracy to corrupt.
Mr Read and Mr Wilcox had passed confidential information about bids for
contracts to Mr Richards. He then passed it on to rival bidders, who were
able to win subcontracts from NEI. The bulk of the contracts involved work
on the Sizewell B and Drax power stations.
Judge Valerie Pearlman said: 'Each of you knowingly and willingly behaved in
the way you did for money, motivated solely by greed. Corruption does a
grave injury to the commerce of this country and . . . those who indulge in
it must expect to receive immediate sentences of imprisonment.'

FT  04 MAR 94 / Aid policy decried as recipe for corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's aid-and-trade (ATP) policy, which supported the controversial
Malaysian Pergau dam project, was a breeding ground for financial
corruption, according to a memorandum circulated to the Commons foreign
affairs committee.
It was yesterday revealed that the memorandum was written by Professor John
Toye, an adviser to the Overseas Development Administration. He concluded
that ATP projects had been used to maximise profits for officials in local
agencies and British shareholders.
Baroness Chalker, minister for overseas development, told the committee that
she did not agree with the allegations and that she had had no forewarning
of the report when she met Professor Toye last week.
Earlier in her evidence to the committee she gave a strong defence of the
use of ATP.
Although some of the report's findings are based on studies in the early
80s, some members of the committee said the paper underlined their
opposition to government use of ATP because there has been little change to
the policy's structure.
The report says ATP projects were not 'primarily designed to promote the
welfare of those in the recipient country for whom the local agency is
responsible as clients or consumers, but to maximise the private interests
of local agency officers and the shareholders in the British firm'.
The report says: 'In one of these earlier cases, where corruption of this
kind occurred, the chief executive of the firm responsible (Willowbrook Ltd)
later made a large payment (Pounds 50,000) to a major British political
party.'
The report also points to the fact that ATP finance is concentrated on a
small number of companies. Between 1977 and 1985, 55 per cent of ATP
expenditure went to a group of five companies: Biwater, Balfour Beatty, GEC,
NEI and Davy McKee.
'This high concentration permitted the creation and financing of a political
lobby group, which actively sought the perpetuation and expansion of the ATP
scheme by means of press campaigns, the lobbying of ministers and officials
and the sponsoring of research aimed at demonstrating the benefits of ATP.'
The report adds: 'They are also regular and substantial contributors to the
funds of campaigning groups associated with a major British political
party.'
The Overseas Development Administration instigated a review of the lessons
to be learned from Pergau. Mr Hurd has said that the objective was to avoid
a repeat of the way in which key stages in the project approval process were
handled.
Mr Mike Gapes, a Labour member of the committee, said: 'It appears the ODA
had been given evidence of the serious problems with ATP in the early 80s
but regardless of this the government went ahead with the Pergau dam
project.'

FT  04 MAR 94 / Rise in Pergau dam costs queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baroness Chalker, minister for overseas development, yesterday told the
Commons foreign affairs committee that it was unusual for the cost of an aid
project to rise by as much as that of the Malaysian Pergau dam in such a
short time.
She confirmed that she had opposed government funding of the dam project on
economic grounds.
It was only 'marginally economic' at the 1988 original contract estimate of
Pounds 316m.
Sixteen days later the UK consortium, led by Trafalgar House and BICC,
increased their estimate to Pounds 397m, which by 1991 rose to Pounds 417m.
Lady Chalker said: 'It was extremely unfortunate that they (the consortium)
did not clarify the elements which were excluded from the first estimate.
What was going on it is difficult to say.'
Questioned over the alleged link between the aid and a Pounds 1bn arms deal,
Lady Chalker conceded that it might be more accurate to describe the two
policies 'as independent rather than no-linkage'.
Lady Chalker's evidence came as former minister Lord Younger said he alone
had taken the decision to offer aid as part of an arms sale in the protocol,
when he was defence secretary. However, speaking on ITN, he made it clear
that he did so on behalf of the government. 'I was secretary of state for
defence, not just an office boy,' he said.
It is understood that Lord Younger's intervention follows two telephone
conversations with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. When Mr Hurd
appeared before the foreign affairs committee on Wednesday he appeared to
blame Lord Younger for the 'incorrect entanglement' of aid and arms between
March and June 1988.
Yesterday Lady Chalker agreed with Mr Michael Jopling, a former minister,
that appraisal of the project was conducted in two days because Baroness
Thatcher wanted it completed quickly: 'A more substantial appraisal would
have been more desirable.'

FT  04 MAR 94 / Matrix case failings admitted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitehall's most senior lawyer yesterday admitted there were failings in the
way ministers and their advisers handled the prosecution of the Matrix
Churchill case.
Mr Gerald Hosker QC, the Treasury solicitor, said he had decided that the
law had not been adhered to 'strictly enough' in the use of public interest
immunity certificates after personally reappraising the way the prosecution
had been handled.
Speaking at the end of his two-day appearance before the Scott arms-for-Iraq
inquiry, Mr Hosker conceded that PII certificates had been used 'too widely'
in the Matrix Churchill case and backed any future recommendations from Lord
Justice Scott that might pave the way for a stricter, more limited use of
such certificates.
Mr Hosker's evidence represents a rare public admission of failure by a
witness to the inquiry. The lawyer's co-operation was acknowledged by Lord
Justice Scott last night when he paid tribute to the way the witness had
borne relentless cross-examination by the judge and his counsel Miss
Presiley Baxendale QC.
Earlier Lord Justice Scott, in a series of exchanges with Mr Hosker,
challenged the use of PII certificates to try to prevent disclosure of a
wealth of official papers, some of which were 'relatively mundane'.
The judge said the importance of disclosing the papers to the defence was
'so strong' as to make it 'unthinkable that anybody should use PII
(certificates) to cover documents of which no more could be said than that
they were confidential'.
Quoting from a series of previous legal rulings on PII certificates, the
judge repeatedly questioned the government's main legal argument that
ministers had a long-established duty to sign the certificates.
Mr Hosker suggested that ministers could refuse to include certain documents
in a PII certificate, but ultimately had to refer back to legal advisers
before taking a final decision.
The latest evidence to the Scott inquiry will put extra pressure on the
government over the arms-for-Iraq affair. However, in the Commons yesterday
Mr John Major, the prime minister, brushed off Labour attempts to exploit
divisions over the case between Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, and Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general.
Mr Edward O'Hara, Labour MP for Knowsley South, asked the prime minister at
question time whether he shared Mr Heseltine's 'low opinion of the legal
advice given by the attorney general'.
The low-key exchanges underlined the widespread view at Westminster that Sir
Nicholas has successfully resisted calls for his resignation in the wake of
Mr Heseltine's comments.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Brown attends cabinet discussion at Downing Street
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK entrepreneur David Brown (right), who has played a key role in the
development of export markets for Proton, Malaysia's national car, is seen
leaving Downing Street yesterday after cabinet discussions certain to have
centred on the breach in trade relations between the UK and Malaysia.
Mr Brown was not available for comment on the talks. However, he is known to
have maintained close and cordial contacts with key Malaysian government
figures since the late 1980s, when he founded Proton Cars (UK).
The UK has become an important market for Proton - with sales providing
Malaysia with annual earnings approaching Pounds 100m.
Businessmen such as Mr Brown, who has a permanent office in Kuala Lumpur,
could provide a sounding board and possible link between the two sides in
the dispute.
Mr Brown is currently preparing the ground for the launch of Proton exports
to continental Europe.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Malaysia upsets the Ipswich roadshow: The trade ban has
dashed the hopes of many exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spare a thought for the 26 members of the Ipswich and Suffolk Chamber of
Commerce who are visiting Malaysia. A week ago they packed their bags and
headed east, hopes high for handsome trade deals.
When they visited Malaysia last year they bagged more than MDollars 2m
(Pounds 500,000) worth of contracts with a promise of bigger things to come.
But the chamber reckoned without last week's Malaysian announcement banning
government contracts with British companies in retaliation for British media
allegations linking senior Malaysian officials, including Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, the prime minister, with under-the-counter payments by British
companies.
A British High Commission reception for the entrepreneurs of Ipswich and
Suffolk has been cancelled. Chamber members who spent several thousand
pounds on the trip are likely to find the business community in Malaysia
less than pleased to see them.
But while British business is busy calculating the many millions of pounds
worth of contracts likely to be lost through the Malaysian move, there is
growing concern on the other side of the fence as well.
A senior manager in one of Malaysia's biggest companies said: 'I don't think
the government really calculated the damage it was doing when it took its
action. Business goes two ways. I'm very worried about the consequences of
this.'
Malaysian business executives have raised concern that Britain might seek to
make the ban a European Union issue. By coincidence, Sir Leon Brittan, the
European Commissioner, was in Beijing this week warning the Chinese that any
attempt to punish British companies for the row over Hong Kong would be
viewed seriously by the EU as a whole.
There is also concern that the ban might be contrary to the spirit, if not
the letter, of Gatt. Mrs Rafidah Aziz, the Malaysian minister of industry
and trade, said the Malaysian move was limited to government contracts with
British companies and did not therefore contravene Gatt. However the
Malaysian government has wide-ranging influence over the private sector.
There is confusion among foreign companies that have joined consortia with
British and local companies to tender for government contracts. Many such
consortia are not simple to disband. This is the case with the Pounds 3.5bn
airport project outside Kuala Lumpur which was to have been undertaken by a
UK/Japanese consortium.
There are likely to be grumblings from local partners of British companies
who will now lose their share in millions of pounds worth of contracts.
Many of these companies are headed by influential Malay businessmen, some of
whom are prominent members of the United Malays National Organisation, the
dominant political party in the country.
Several Malaysian companies have been planning fundraising exercises in
Europe. The first stop for such roadshows is usually London. British fund
managers have given no indication that they are going to withdraw any of the
millions they have invested in the fast growing Malaysian market. But some
awkward questions might be addressed to visiting Malaysian business leaders.
There is also some confusion about what does and does not constitute a
British company. For example, Shell, the UK-Dutch group, operates refineries
and is involved, along with Petronas, the Malaysian state oil company, in
one of the world's biggest gasification projects.
Perhaps Shell will now be emphasising its 60 per cent Dutch ownership. Other
companies might find it more difficult to assert non-British credentials.
But the Ipswich and Suffolk Chamber of Commerce appears to be optimistic
about a change in policy: it told local reporters it planned to send another
mission to Malaysia next year.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Rise in Pergau costs queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baroness Chalker, minister for overseas development, yesterday said that she
had opposed government funding of the Malaysian Pergau dam project on
economic grounds.
She also told the Commons foreign affairs committee that it was unusual for
the cost of a project to rise by as much as the Pergau dam had in such a
short time.
Under persistent questioning over the alleged link between the aid for the
dam and a Pounds 1bn arms deal, she conceded that it might be more accurate
to describe the two policies 'as independent rather than no-linkage'.
Lady Chalker's evidence came as former minister Lord Younger said he alone
had taken the decision to offer aid as part of an arms sale in the protocol.
Speaking on ITN, however, he made clear that he did so on behalf of the
government. 'I was secretary of state for defence not just an office boy,'
he said.
It is understood that Lord Younger's intervention follows two telephone
conversations with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. When Mr Hurd
appeared before the foreign affairs committee on Wednesday he appeared to
blame Lord Younger for the 'incorrect entanglement' of aid and arms between
March and June 1988.
Lady Chalker told the committee: 'The minute George Younger got back to
London (after signing the protocol linking aid to arms) other members of the
government set about making sure that the protocol was withdrawn.'
However, she argued: 'At the same time it was in Britain's interests to
continue to offer defence equipment to Malaysia.' She added: 'I advised
Douglas Hurd that from my perspective we should not proceed with the
project. The foreign secretary took a different view.' She said Mr Hurd had
informed Lady Thatcher, the then prime minister, that she opposed the
project on economic grounds.
It was only 'marginally economic' at the 1988 original contract estimate of
Pounds 316m. Sixteen days later the UK consortium, led by Trafalgar House
and BICC, increased their estimate to Pounds 397m, which by 1991 rose to
Pounds 417m.
Lady Chalker said: 'It was extremely unfortunate that they (the consortium)
did not clarify the elements which were excluded from the first estimate.
What was going on it is difficult to say.'
She agreed with Mr Michael Jopling, a former minister, that appraisal of the
dam project was conducted in two days because Baroness Thatcher wanted it
completed quickly. 'A more substantial appraisal would have been more
desirable,' she said.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Heseltine sets out economic manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday called for
radical new thinking on the roles of the government and the private sector
in promoting growth.
Delivering the annual Stockton lecture on the theme of obstacles to future
prosperity, Mr Heseltine set out what amounted to a personal manifesto on
the future of Britain.
In a wide-ranging speech, he repeatedly stressed the limits on the powers of
government, the crucial role of the private sector, and the constraints on
the use of taxation or borrowing to promote investment.
He was also critical of bureaucratic over-regulation in the European Union,
which he claimed had led to an 'over-protected, over-centralised community
suffering from 'Eurosclerosis'.
The speech will inevitably be seen as an attempt by Mr Heseltine to keep
open the option of a further bid for the Conservative party leadership if Mr
John Major, the prime minister, is forced to step down before the next
election.
Mr Heseltine's endorsement of fiscal conservatism, his stress on the role of
the private sector, and criticisms of the EU will appeal to rightwingers who
have recently begun to offer him support.
Many on the right would prefer to see Mr Heseltine in Downing Street than Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who is regarded as too interventionist and
too sympathetic to the EU.
Mr Heseltine's friends have let it be known recently that he remains a
candidate for Number 10, in spite of his defeat in the 1990 leadership
election and the heart attack he suffered last year.
However, Mr Heseltine was careful to offer his support to Mr Major, who he
described as 'the first of the European leaders' to seek a solution to the
EUs structural problems.
His comments also amounted to a stinging rebuke to Baroness Thatcher, the
former prime minister, who is regarded by her supporters as an effective
critic of the EU.
Mr Heseltine said the world faced great opportunities as a result of the
collapse of communism, liberalisation of world trade, and the information
technology revolution.
But he said 'new techniques and thinking' were required to overcome
obstacles to growth.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Sweetener offered to rail losers: Bids for Channel link
invited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday offered unsuccessful bidders for the Pounds 2.7bn
Channel tunnel rail link a compensation package worth a third of the costs
of their bids up to a ceiling of Pounds 1.5m. Mr Roger Freeman, transport
minister, explained that compensation was being offered 'in the interests of
vigorous competition and because of the size and complexity of the project'.
But he also indicated that the project might not receive any government cash
on top of the selection of assets and rights listed yesterday. 'The
government's contribution to the project should be sufficient to attract the
private sector, so that the private sector can earn a sufficient return on
its contribution,' he said.
'It (the contribution) will be a substantial one . . . and, as part of the
necessary contribution will be determined by the competition, it may involve
distributing some cash.'
Mr Freeman was speaking at the launch of a competition to find a
private-sector consortium to build the 68-mile rail link between London's St
Pancras station and the Channel tunnel. It is expected to be the largest
joint public-private sector construction project this decade.
The public contribution to the scheme is expected, subject to bargaining
with bidders, to consist of:
The Pounds 800m assets owned by European Passenger Services, the company
which will run trains between London, Paris and Brussels. These comprise
Waterloo International station, the North Pole rail depot in north-west
London and the Eurostar rolling stock. The government will not transfer the
Pounds 1bn of debt incurred to acquire these assets.
The right to revenues from EPS's train services when these start this
summer.
The right to charge domestic train-operating companies a fee for running
trains over the rail link's tracks.
The intellectual property built up by Union Railway, the company which has
been developing the rail link for the past six years. No formal value has
been given to this.

</HEADLINE>

Mr Harry Goodman, former chairman and chief executive of Air Europe and
International Leisure Group, last night said he had issued a writ against
British Airways and a number of its directors, managers and agents.
Air Europe collapsed in March 1991 with debts of about Pounds 400m and the
loss of more than 3,000 jobs. It is thought that the writ could relate to
allegations last May that BA sought to investigate and then destabilise Air
Europe.

Support for the Conservatives has fallen from 26 per cent to 25 per cent
while Labour has risen from 45.5 per cent a month ago to 48.5 per cent, a
Gallup poll for today's Daily Telegraph shows. The Liberal Democrats have
fallen from 23 per cent to 21 per cent.
The poll also found that 66 per cent of voters do not believe the economy is
coming out of recession.
A total of 68 per cent of Tory voters say the recession is ending, while 25
per cent say it is not. Only 14 per cent of Labour voters believe the
recession is ending.

<TEXT>
A sharp rise in company formations last month has been reported by Jordans,
the Bristol-based information company, Philip Coggan writes.
It said 10,498 companies were formed in February, a 6.8 per cent increase on
the same month last year. January saw a 4.8 per cent increase. The
information is compiled using data supplied by Companies House and excludes
Northern Ireland.
Excluding March, which is a big month for company formations because it is
the end of the financial year, last month's figure was the largest since May
1991.
Last year 113,561 new companies were formed compared with 107,375 in 1992.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Tories cede Ulster committee control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is unlikely to have a majority on the new Commons Northern
Ireland select committee, which is expected to start work shortly after
Easter.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, announced yesterday that MPs will
vote on whether to set up the committee on Wednesday - the same day as the
annual debate on whether to renew the prevention of terrorism act. The
establishment of the committee has been widely interpreted as a bid to
placate the Ulster Unionists, the province's largest political party.
Under Tory proposals six of the committee's 13 members would be
Conservatives. There would be four unionists, two Labour MPs and one from
the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. If this is adopted,
the Conservatives would apparently be setting great store by the support of
Sir James Kilfedder, the Ulster Popular Unionist MP for North Down. There is
a Tory majority on all other Commons select committees.
Sir James was last night widely tipped as the likely chairman of the
committee. Two of the other unionist members are expected to be UUP MPs,
with one from the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party.
It is unclear whether the SDLP will agree to sit on the committee. Mr Seamus
Mallon, the party's deputy leader, told MPs it had been 'imposed against the
wishes of a very substantial number of people in this House' and the
proposed membership was 'unfair to one section of us represented in this
House'.
Labour is expected to vote against establishment of the committee. It is
also expected to oppose the renewal of the prevention of terrorism act while
calling for a bipartisan approach to anti-terrorism in the province.
Lord Fitt, the former SDLP leader, last night warned that the Anglo-Irish
peace initiative in Northern Ireland had failed, and called for a security
clampdown on both sides of the border. He also claimed during a debate on
Northern Ireland that Mr John Hume, the present SDLP leader, had helped Sinn
Fein, the political arm of the IRA, to gain undeserved credibility as a
party of peace.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Swans' French suitor discounts rival: CMN is finalising a
bid price and is close to a deal with receivers of the now leaner Tyneside
shipbuilder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French-based company preparing a bid for Swan Hunter yesterday said it
saw the apparent interest of Vosper Thornycroft in the Tyneside shipbuilder
as a 'spoiler'.
Mr Fred Henderson, leader of the Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie team
planning to submit a bid to Swan Hunter's receivers later this month, said
he believed Southampton-based Vosper was trying to make it more awkward for
CMN to bid for the Tyneside yard.
CMN's acquisition of Swans would, he suggested, dilute the advantage of a
'British political push' for Vosper, which exports 95 per cent of output and
is a rival of CMN in the international market for patrol boats and
corvettes.
Mr Henderson, chairman of UK-based CMN subsidiary CMN Support Services,
said: 'They have a political edge on specific occasions which they would
lose the exclusive use of. We have had situations politically where we've
lost out to VT although a navy had chosen our design in preference to VT's.
It was the British political push.'
Vosper might be concerned, he added, that CMN could make available to Swan
Hunter its technology in minehunters, another class of vessel where Vosper
is strong.
Earlier this week Vosper confirmed that it had entered 'exploratory and
tentative' talks with Swans' receivers, Price Waterhouse, but refused
further comment. It did not wish to speak further yesterday.
Swan Hunter went into receivership in May after failing to win a contract
for a helicopter carrier, against competition from a consortium of VSEL and
Kvaerner. Since then its bitter rivals have been watching its fate with grim
fascination. Given the shrinking UK warship market they are unlikely to be
enthusiastic at the tenacity of Swans' fight for life and its dogged search
for a buyer.
Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle East, said: 'The issue is the fight
within the industry for what remains of the domestic warship building
programme.' CMN is believed to have sought government assurances that if it
buys Swans it can compete on equal terms for UK naval orders.
Swans' receivers won the chance of selling the company as a going concern
when the Ministry of Defence agreed that it could finish three frigates
under construction when it went into receivership. They have also retained
crucial design skills, maintained the MoD's goodwill, clinched EU agreement
for intervention funding and slashed overcapacity. Work on the remaining two
frigates is even ahead of schedule. Mr Gordon Horsfield, joint receiver,
said: 'Swans is lean, fit and hungry.'
Since May the number of employees has been cut from 2,476 to 1,038, more
than halving to Pounds 6m the redundancy liability for any purchaser.
Vosper's involvement came as a surprise. GEC, which was negotiating to buy
Swans before the loss of the helicopter carrier, had been seen as the
potential dark horse bidder. GEC refuses to comment. It has had talks with
the receivers and remains in touch. 'GEC's still a stalking horse; I
wouldn't write it off,' said Mr Dick Gonzales, chairman of the Confederation
of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions at Swans.
Mr Henderson said he was not greatly concerned about Vosper's apparent
interest. CMN lawyers were now doing due diligence checks and CMN and Price
Waterhouse were 'flirting' over price but were within a reasonable distance.
He expects to make a firm bid this month and getting an 'almost
simultaneous' decision.
There remains another imponderable if CMN is a sole bidder and offers a low
price: the attitude of Lloyds Bank, which Swans owes about Pounds 12m.
Lloyds said yesterday that it shared the receivers' objective of selling
Swans as a going concern.
Mr Gonzales said Swans' sale prospects were finely balanced. 'I would say
it's 50/50.'

FT  04 MAR 94 / Minister warns unions of curb on pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A government minister told the Trades Union Conference yesterday that future
pay rises for the 5.8m public-sector workers would have to be funded from
efficiency savings and not increases in government funding.
Defending the government's three-year public-sector pay bill freeze Mr
Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, explained to delegates
at a TUC public services conference in London that there was 'no formal
limit on pay settlements' in the public sector. Mr Dorrell, the first Tory
minister in many years to address a TUC conference, received a cool
reception from delegates.
Mr Dorrell said there was a 'continuing role' for the existing five
pay-review bodies in the public services but he added that future pay awards
would have 'to take account of wider management considerations', such as the
spread of performance pay and local wage determination.
However the unions are likely to find it hard to convince workers to oppose
the government's public-sector wage policy. Nearly two in every five workers
are unaware that the government has any public-sector pay policy, a survey
commissioned by the TUC reported yesterday. Only 31 per cent knew there was
a 1.5 per cent pay limit last year and 20 per cent that the government had
introduced a pay-bill freeze.
A total of 85 per cent of the survey sample had not heard of any union
campaign against the government's public-pay policy.
The Post Office is continuing to face stiff resistance from the Treasury in
its efforts to win commercial freedom in its business activities. The
government is agreeing to lift existing financial restrictions that all its
investment programmes must be funded from its own profits.
But at yesterday's conference Mr Dorrell, in reply to Mr Alan Johnson,
leader of the UCW postal union, rejected a proposal on the use of public
money.
'I am not in favour of seeing the Post Office using taxpayer's money in the
form of public capital to compete openly with taxpayers in other
industries,' he said.
Mr Dorrell added: 'If we are being told that the Treasury should no longer
take an interest in the Post Office's use of public capital, then that is
not going to be the position.'
Mr Johnson said: 'This is very depressing.' If the Post Office could not
work with private companies it would mean European postal companies would
pick up business.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Balfour Beatty set for barrage contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A joint venture between Balfour Beatty, part of the BICC engineering group,
and Costain is favourite to win the main construction contract for the
Pounds 152m Cardiff barrage, one of Europe's biggest building projects.
The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation is due to meet today to discuss the
decision which is expected to be announced shortly.
The value of the contract to the joint venture - 60 per cent Balfour Beatty
and 40 per cent Costain - is thought to be than Pounds 100m.
The barrage is designed to rejuvenate the derelict docklands area of south
Cardiff and control the tidal waters of the Taff and Ely estuaries, creating
a 500-acre lake. Supporters claim it will attract investment of about Pounds
2.5bn and create over 20,000 jobs.
The project has been opposed on environmental grounds because it would flood
a 165-hectare freshwater wetland bird habitat.
The scheme has attracted bids from UK and continental European construction
companies. These include tenders from Balfour Beatty and Costain; Laing;
Tarmac; Bouygues of France; and joint ventures of Kier and Christiani;
Nielson and Hochtief of Germany; Trafalgar House and Ballast Nedam; and
Taylor Woodrow and Sir Robert McAlpine.
Preparatory work on the site has started and the main construction is
expected to begin shortly. The corporation hopes that the work will be
completed within four years. The awarding of the contract will have to be
approved by the Welsh Office.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Builder for Channel link sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government may be able to avoid making any direct cash contribution to
the Pounds 2.7bn Channel tunnel rail link, Mr Roger Freeman, transport
minister said yesterday.
He was speaking at the launch of a competition to find a private-sector
consortium to build the 68-mile rail link between London's St Pancras
station and the Channel tunnel. It is expected to be the largest joint
public-private sector construction project this decade.
The size of the public contribution will depend on negotiations with the
private consortia that bid to build the line, but it is expected to consist
of:
The Pounds 800m assets owned by European Passenger Services, the company
which will run trains between London, Paris and Brussels. These comprise
Waterloo International station, the North Pole rail depot in north-west
London and the Eurostar rolling stock. The government will not transfer the
Pounds 1bn of debt incurred to acquire these assets.
The right to revenues from EPS's train services when these start this
summer.
The right to charge domestic train-operating companies a fee for running
trains over the rail link's tracks.
The intellectual property built up by Union Railway, the company which has
been developing the rail link for the past six years. No formal value has
been given to this.
The winning consortium is expected to be the one which bids for the smallest
amount of government contribution to the link. The government expects there
to be three or four serious bidders.
Companies have until April 25 to express an interest in the project but the
formal tendering process will begin in June and bids must be made by
December.
The winning consortium will be required to build a line capable of carrying
at least six trains an hour each way at speeds of up to 140 mph.
The government expects to introduce a bill authorising the project by the
end of the year with the aim of passing the legislation in 1996. The rail
link could then open in 2002.
In a new move the government said it would also pay 33 per cent of bid costs
 -up to a maximum of Pounds 1.5m - for each failed bidder.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Trustee for mental patients criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government organisation responsible for administering assets of Pounds
780m for 30,000 people mentally incapable of looking after their own affairs
is criticised in a report published today by the National Audit Office.
The public expenditure watchdog says that the Public Trust Office, part of
the Lord Chancellor's Department, is failing to monitor the receivers
appointed to look after the finances of their patients.
Very few visits are made to check that receivers are meeting patients' needs
according to the report. The NAO says that this leaves the Public Trust
Office with insufficient information to ensure that patients enjoy the
quality of life they are entitled to.
The Public Trust Office is responsible to the Court of Protection. Most
patients have assets of less than Pounds 50,000, but some have more than
Pounds 1m.
Most have their finances managed by a receiver appointed by the court -
19,000 receivers are relatives or friends, with most of the rest solicitors,
bank managers or local authorities.
The NAO says that too little is done by the Public Trust Office to check the
suitability of receivers. Patients were sometimes dissatisfied with the
choice and many receivers were 'daunted by the complexity of the task facing
them'.
Monitoring of receivers needed greater attention, the NAO said. Financial
accounts were often received late and there was a backlog of accounts to be
reviewed.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Favourite tipped for barrage deal

A joint venture between Balfour Beatty, part of BICC engineering group, and
Costain is favourite to win the main construction contract for the Pounds
152m Cardiff barrage, one of Europe's biggest building projects.
The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation is due to meet today to discuss the
decision which is expected to be announced shortly.
The value of the contract to the joint venture - 60 per cent Balfour Beatty

2.5bn and create over 20,000 jobs.
The project has been opposed on environmental grounds because it would flood
a 165-hectare freshwater wetland bird habitat.
The scheme was approved by parliament in the autumn after five years'
scrutiny, after ministers cut short the last stage of debate on legislation
with a 'guillotine' timetable.
The project has attracted bids from UK and continental European construction
companies. These include tenders from Balfour Beatty and Costain; Laing;
Tarmac; Bouygues of France; and joint ventures of Kier and Christiani;
Nielson and Hochtief of Germany; Trafalgar House and Ballast Nedam; and
Taylor Woodrow and Sir Robert McAlpine.
Preparatory work on the site has started and the main construction is
expected to begin shortly. The corporation hopes that the work will be
completed within four years. The awarding of the contract will have to be
approved by the Welsh Office.
The corporation says the barrage should act as a catalyst for the
regeneration of 2,700 acres of derelict docklands.
It is expected to pave the way for other large construction projects in the
area. The corporation says the barrage could encourage up to Pounds 1.2bn of
private-sector investment, 4.7m sq ft of business space and 23,000 jobs.
Without the barrage, it says, these figures would be halved.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Employers differ over part-time worker ruling: The rights of
employees must be equal. Lisa Wood gauges the chances of a labour market
shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two main employers' bodies reacted very differently to the House of
Lords ruling that part-time workers must have the same rights as full-time
workers to redundancy benefits and against unfair dismissal.
The Institute of Directors, which has more than 35,000 members, said: 'The
Lords' decision will mean a lot of employers will think very hard about
taking on part-time workers for people for whom they have new liabilities.
What good are rights if you have not got a job?'
The Confederation of British Industry, which represents 250,000 companies,
was more muted. 'There is always a danger that extending redundancy
protections to part-time workers will reduce employers' willingness to
create new part-time jobs,' it said.
'But in this case we think that most employers will be relaxed about the
implications, although we shall need to study the judgment carefully before
advising them on what it means.'
Government amendments to employment protection laws to extend unfair
dismissal and redundancy rights to anyone with two years' service who works
eight hours or more could have big implications for the labour market.
The vast majority of new jobs are part-time, and most are taken by women.
The UK has 5m part-time workers, about a fifth of the workforce and more
than any other European Union country. The sectors where they are most
commonly found are retailing, education, hotels, and health.
Whether this growth will be interrupted by the Lords' judgment is likely to
depend on the reasons employers hire part-time workers. For some, it has
been a response to business needs, providing flexible workers at peak
business times. This was the reason recently given by Burton Group, one of
the UK's largest retailers, for switching significant numbers of its workers
to part-time.
For other employers, part-timers provide a cheap and convenient way of
taking on workers when they have not the business confidence to take on
full-time staff.
Employers say it is unlikely that those taking on employees because of the
structure of their business will alter their policies, in spite of potential
increased costs should they have to terminate employment.
The Local Government Management Board, which represents local authorities
employing more than 800,000 part-time workers said: 'We need part-timers.
You need catering staff at lunch-time in schools, not all day.'
Smaller companies that have recently altered their employment patterns for
strategic reasons agree. Stateside Foods, of Rossingdale Valley in
Lancashire, a manufacturer of chilled foods, cut its workforce in 1992 from
84 to 34 but has built it back to over 85, with the new recruits mostly
being women working part-time. This was to respond to daily fluctuations in
customers' demands.
Mr Leonard Haysom, operations director, said: 'When we took this strategic
decision it did not even enter our considerations that employing people
part-time would make it easier to dismiss them. Our whole objective was to
produce the goods that our customers wanted at the right time. As to
increased potential costs - we are not looking to get rid of people.'
Other companies may be more nervous. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director
general of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'One
reason many companies, particularly smaller ones, take on part-time workers
is because they cannot decide whether to employ somebody full-time. By
increasing the cost of doing this, this ruling will mitigate against that.'
However, the ruling may not make as much difference as at first appears. The
National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux this week published a report
which highlighted anecdotes of employers getting rid of workers just before
their two years' employment protection rights began.

The building workers' union Ucatt has won one of the first industrial
tribunal cases under laws giving workers redress for dismissal for raising
health-and-safety concerns.
Mr Matthew Harris, a timber-frame worker of Camberley in Surrey, was awarded
Pounds 8,760 compensation by a Southampton tribunal which ruled he had been
unfairly dismissed by Select Timber, a Basingstoke timber supplier.
Mr Harris had complained of nausea and mood swings while working with the
chemical, Lindane. He was dismissed after calling in a health-and-safety

FT  04 MAR 94 / Procedure for challenging government in court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Lords rulings over the procedure for challenging the government
in the UK courts could prove a greater blow to ministers than those on the
specific issue of part-time workers, some senior lawyers believe, writes
John Mason.
The rulings are likely to leave the government having to defend itself
against an increased number of legal actions brought by pressure groups and
others.
First, groups challenging issues of European law will now be able to bring
them through the judicial review procedure in the High Court. This would
prove both easier and quicker than having cases heard by the European Court
in Luxembourg.
Second, the legal position of pressure groups seeking to bring any kind of
actions before the UK courts has also been strengthened.
The result of both rulings could be the government having to defend its
policies more often and in the greater public spotlight offered by London
rather than Luxembourg.
The law lords overturned a Court of Appeal ruling that judicial review
proceedings in the High Court were not an appropriate forum for hearing
cases on European issues. In approving the use of High Court judicial
reviews, they have given pressure groups and others the opportunity to
bypass the long process of taking cases to the European Court.
Cases that are taken to the European Court may take four to six years to
resolve. If a judicial review application is expedited and approved, the
case can be before the High Court in a matter of days - as demonstrated by
the reviews over Maastricht and the challenge to the government's pit
closure programme.
The High Court could, however, still decide to refer the case to Europe
rather than proceed with a judicial review.
The law lords also strengthened the position of pressure groups by ruling
that the Equal Opportunities Commission had 'locus standi' in this case - in
effect it was suitably qualified to act on behalf of part-time workers. This
principle has often been disputed.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Railtrack to raise charges by 194%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack, the company set up to take over the infrastructure of the
national railway system from British Rail, will charge metropolitan
transport authorities an extra Pounds 144m in 1994-95 for the use of lines
and signalling equipment.
This is the first sign of increased costs for local rail travel as British
Rail privatisation takes effect, prompting warnings of cuts in services. In
the past, BR charges to passenger transport authorities did not reflect the
cost of infrastructure. Track charges are rising from Pounds 74.2m a year to
Pounds 218.2m - a rise of 194%.
Chairmen of the seven authorities - from Manchester, Merseyside, West
Midlands, Strathclyde, Tyne &amp; Wear, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire -
were told of the new charges by Railtrack at a meeting in London this week.
Mr Dick Worrall, chairman of the West Midlands PTA, said yesterday: 'The
real cost of rail privatisation is beginning to emerge and it is extremely
worrying. It would have a catastrophic effect on all passenger transport
authority services, particularly, rail, if we had to find this kind of extra
money.'
The passenger transport authorities have not been told how much it will cost
to run local trains. The train companies succeeding BR have not yet
calculated their charges.
Railtrack's calculation of its charges follows government demands that it
should make a 5.6 per cent return, rising to 8 per cent, on its assets. The
government has promised to meet the extra charges of the passenger transport
authorities for fiscal 1994-95, but there are no arrangements thereafter.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Clarke pledges domestic focus on interest rate moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, assured the Commons yesterday that he would
continue to have 'British conditions' in mind when determining interest rate
policy.
He was replying to Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyne and a
former Treasury minister, who urged him to send a clear message to 'voices
in the City' calling for an increase in interest rates.
Mr Clarke said he would continue to set interest rates according to British
conditions, taking account of medium-term prospects for factors such as
inflation, exchange rates and asset values.
He told the House that these had guided his decisions on monetary policy so
far, and they would continue to do so.
The chancellor's emphasis on British conditions was welcomed by Mr Geoffrey
Robinson, Labour MP for Coventry north-west, who, like Mr Sheldon, is an
advocate of further cuts in interest rates.
Mr Robinson underlined the need to consider the interrelationship between UK
interest rates and the value of sterling, and the implications for industry.
He hoped the government would combine downward pressure on inflation and
interest rates while maintaining a competitive exchange rate.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea yesterday announced a conditional suspension of its annual Team
Spirit military exercise with the US in response to North Korea's acceptance
of international nuclear inspections.
Team Spirit, which has taken place almost annually since 1976 in South
Korea, will not be held this year if the International Atomic Energy
Agency's inspections of the North's seven declared nuclear facilities prove
satisfactory.
In Washington, the administration said it would resume high-level talks with
North Korea following the arrival of experts in Pyongyang to begin nuclear
site inspections.
'The talks will aim at a thorough and broad resolution of the nuclear and
other issues that separate North Korea from the US and the rest of the
international community,' Mr Mike McCurry, State Department spokesman, said.
Team Spirit has been a bone of contention with North Korea, which has
criticised the exercise as a preparation for an attack by the US.
Last week in New York, North Korea agreed to allow the long-sought IAEA
inspections to go ahead and to resume the North-South dialogue. In Vienna,
IAEA officials said yesterday they had carried out inspections at nuclear
sites at Yongbyon, 90 miles north of Pyongyang.
The US has also asked Pyongyang to agree to an exchange of presidential
envoys with South Korea to discuss the nuclear problem and other
inter-Korean issues.
The two Koreas yesterday had a working-level meeting at the truce village of
Panmunjom to prepare for the proposed exchange this month. It was the first
inter-Korean contact since October.
The negotiations are expected to focus on possible US diplomatic recognition
and economic aid.
But North Korea tabled new conditions for the envoy exchange, raising doubts
whether the deal to resolve suspicions about Pyongyang's nuclear programme
will proceed smoothly.
The North demanded that the proposed deployment of US Patriot missiles in
South Korea be stopped and that South Korea's President Kim Young-sam
apologise for remarks last year criticising Kim Il-sung, the North Korean
leader.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Fund managers watch S African cliff-hanger with bated
breath: South Africa is on the threshold of an investment 'third wave'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A select group of visitors to South Africa with around half a billion
dollars to invest are following the country's nail-biting political
negotiations with particular interest.
They are 28 fund managers from some of the most prominent European and North
American investment institutions on a week long tour. They will be seeking
the answer to one question above all else: what are the prospects for a
stable, post-apartheid South Africa?
Signs are that the representatives from New York's Lazard Freres and Merrill
Lynch Asset Management, London's IDC International and Toronto's Goodman &amp;
Co, among others, have liked what they have heard from minister of finance
Derek Keys, the ANC's economics department, the Reserve Bank, and
businessmen such as Mr Meyer Kahn, chairman of South African Breweries
(SAB), and Mr Hans Smith, managing director of the steel-maker Iscor.
Mr Richard Jesse, at stockbrokers Martin &amp; Co, which arranged the visit,
says there is no doubt that even the most cautious foreign investors 'like
the concept' of investing in South Africa.
A successful outcome to the political negotiations currently under way would
remove much of the remaining unease about the country's investment risk. But
with elections so close, many will take the attitude that waiting a few
weeks more before committing funds 'can do no harm when you have been
waiting for 50 years'.
When they do take the plunge, South Africa is likely to see indirect foreign
investment which will dwarf the sums spent on shares since the lifting of
sanctions in September which saw records broken on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange.
'The JSE has seen hundreds of millions of rands of foreign money. Now it
will see hundreds of millions of dollars,' says Mr Jesse.
The change in sentiment is dramatic (only 10 companies accepted Martin &amp;
Co's last invitation for a fund managers' visit in October), and has been
fuelled by the feverish interest in emerging markets.
Mr Miles Moreland of the London-based Blakeney Management, which specialises
in discovering 'new' markets, says South Africa is on the threshold of a
third wave of offshore share buying.
The first wave saw hedge funds and the 'more nimble, unrestricted' investors
buy South African shares for much of 1993, and move quickly to take profits
this year.
Then came the specialist Africa funds such as Morgan Stanley's Dollars 60m
(Pounds 33.3m) Africa Investment Fund, and Alliance Capital Management's
Dollars 100m Southern African Fund, listed on Wall Street on Friday.
Mr Moreland says the more cautious global investors, the large mutual and
pension funds, are about to follow. This comes about as much the result of
growing confidence in a growing South African economy as the JSE's
forthcoming inclusion in the International Finance Corporation's emerging
market index and Morgan Stanley International's developing market index.
The JSE in one of the world's largest stock markets by capitalisation (about
Dollars 170bn) but is under-represented in emerging market portfolios.
When the JSE is added to indices by which the performance of share
portfolios are judged, emerging market fund managers will have to redirect
some of the Dollars 8bn assets they manage to South Africa to ensure they
have even exposure to a market which represents at least 10 per cent of the
value of all emerging markets.
Ms Maria Ramos, an ANC economist, says any increase in indirect investment
is welcome, as its improves market liquidity and economic confidence. That
will be vital if a new government is to raise new funds on international
capital markets. But she points out it does not create jobs.
Direct foreign investment will be critical if the estimated 6m unemployed
South Africans are to find work. Job creation has risen swiftly this year to
the top of the agenda at the National Economic Forum, which links
government, business and trade unions.
However, as high-profile as the announcement of the return of Industrial
Business Machines (IBM), Kodak and Reebok have been, the sums involved with
the companies' reinvestment are small.
The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (Opic), the US government agency
which helps US businesses invest abroad, completed a 10-day visit on Tuesday
by announcing a Dollars 75m equity investment fund aimed at black business,
and small business partners.
Mr Richard Morningstar, an Opic vice-president, says the trip was an
'unqualified success' but admits the agency can only make the smallest,
albeit important, contributions to the economy.
Even if the political transition proves surprisingly free of violence, and
fears of future macro-economic indiscipline are unwarranted, foreign
companies contemplating direct investment are entering a competitive
domestic market.
Mr Jesse says it is easy to say a foreign brewer or pharmaceutical company
should be able to rush into South Africa, but large indigenous groups are
unlikely to give ground easily to competitors.
Foreign investment will be good for stockbrokers' pockets but promises no
free ride for the economic planners.

Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema flew to Nigeria and Cameroon yesterday
to mediate in a growing border row between the two countries, and a French
frigate docked in Cameroon, Reuter reports from Yaounde. A French embassy
official in Yaounde said the surveillance frigate La Vendemiaire and its

Nigeria's military government had already protested on Wednesday after
France sent a squad of paratroopers and two attack helicopters to Cameroon.

The Vatican established diplomatic relations with Jordan yesterday in its

recognition of Israel, Reuter reports from Vatican City.
The new relations will also make it easier for Pope John Paul to visit holy
sites of the Old and New Testaments before the year 2000.
The move, less than three months after the Vatican announced it was stepping
up official ties with Palestinians, was also expected to give the Holy See a
greater chance of influencing the Middle East peace process.

Algerian economy minister Mourad Benachenhou is expected to visit Washington
next week to hammer out the details of an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund, according to officials in Paris, Reuter reports from Paris.
If agreed, the accord is expected to have two components - a regular
'standby' loan to support its balance of payments and a further sum under
the IMF's compensatory financing facility. Algeria said last week the IMF
might give it a Dollars 500m (Pounds 342.4m) standby loan and Dollars 300m
more to offset lower oil revenues, which make up over 90 per cent of hard
currency earnings.

   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Inflation in the Philippines rose towards the end of 1993, partly because of
the easing of state support for the central bank following a law that
created a more independent monetary institution, a central bank official
said, Reuter reports from Manila.
The government had eased its support for the bank's liquidity management
since passage of the Central Bank Act. This led to heavy withdrawals of
state deposits in the bank, contributing to an expansion in money supply
that fuelled inflation, the official said.
The annualised inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index, rose
to 8.4 per cent in December last year after hitting a low of 6.6 per cent in
June and averaging 7.6 in the same year. Inflation was 8.2 per cent in
January 1993.

China said it would establish two specialist courts in Shanghai to handle
intellectual property rights cases, according to Wen Wei Po, a pro-China
newspaper based in Hong Kong.
The courts would specialise in trademark and copyright violation cases.
Since 1983 an array of courts in Shanghai hashandled more than 1,200
intellectual property rights cases. The number has risen in recent years as
China moves to a market economy.
The number of bank credit cards issued by China's four main banks will reach
7m by the end of this year, up from 4m today, the Economic Information Daily
said, Reuter reports from Beijing. China's population last year grew at its
slowest rate in more than three decades. Although the total population grew
to nearly 1.2bn, the natural growth rate - the difference between the birth
and death rates - was 11.45 per thousand, down from 11.60 in 1992, the
Xinhua news agency said.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Vietnam's state companies discover the bottom line: A sector
that has been told to stand or fall on financial merit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For ten years, Mr Le Trong tried to persuade other state-owned companies in
Vietnam to pay him to advertise their products, but he got nowhere. The
companies said their raw materials were supplied by one government
department and the finished products were distributed by another. All they
had to do was to meet their production targets and everyone was happy.
Five years on, Mr Le Trong is much in demand. His swish central Hanoi office
is besieged by directors of the same state companies and he can barely hire
enough staff to deal with the extra work.
The reason is simple: in the intervening years the Vietnamese government has
introduced pro-market economic reforms and told state companies they have to
survive or fail on their financial merit.
State-owned companies that for years had proceeded in the innocent belief
that they were pleasing their customers have awakened to the awful truth
that nobody actually wants to buy what they make. Others with bloated
workforces have had to choose either to sack their excess staff or face
financial ruin.
Mr Le Trong's company, Vinexad, is owned by the Ministry of Commerce and he
now proudly boasts that it is the most successful state-owned advertising
agency in Vietnam.
One of his prospective clients is doing rather less well. For 40 years after
it was set up in 1947, Tran Hung Dao Engineering played an integral part in
Vietnam's struggle for independence and socialism. Now, the company is in
danger of being thrown on the scrap heap.
During the war for independence against the French and then the war against
the US, Tran Hung Dao made military hardware and other supplies for the war
effort. After the war ended in 1975, the company was converted to civilian
use.
Until 1990, Tran Hung Dao made 6,000 small engines a year for use in
tractors, water pumps and other agricultural equipment. All were taken away
from the factory for distribution, and the company assumed its products were
popular.
Last year, the company sold just 200 engines. Now more than half its 2,000
workers have been laid off. Tran Hung Dao is pinning its hopes on a joint
venture with a South Korean company.
'At present, we are facing a shortage of work for the workers,' says deputy
director Mr Vu Duy Lieu. 'We are suffering from many difficulties, such as a
shortage of capital, obsolete equipment and old buildings. We also have to
compete with large numbers of illegal imports from outside, which are better
quality and cheaper than what we can produce.'
The charge that illegal imports - mostly from China - are undermining state
industry in Vietnam is heard regularly from those in charge of running the
state system. However, foreign economists say the main problem these
companies face is internal inefficiency, not outside competition.
It is not all gloom, though. Thang Long Garment Company is one state
enterprise that has not only survived but has thrived under the new system
of financial independence.
Throughout its 36-year history, the company has adapted well to the economic
conditions of the time. In 1958, Thang Long was set up to export garments to
the former socialist bloc countries in eastern Europe. When that market
collapsed into political turmoil and the Comecon trading system was
abolished, Thang Long had to find new markets fast. At the same time, the
government in Hanoi withdrew much of its financial and planning support for
state industry.
Five years later, the company's output has risen 30-fold and it now exports
4m items a year to Japan, other Asian countries and western Europe. With the
lifting of the US economic embargo, it hopes soon to add North America to
this list.
The secret of the company's success? First, it invested in new equipment and
improved the quality of its products, rather than dropping its prices; and
second, 'We try to conform to the saying 'The customers are the gods' and we
are trying to meet as many of our customers' demands as possible,' says
assistant general director Nguyen Van Do.
This enthusiasm for customer service is an indication of just how far
successful state companies have moved away from the command economy of the
past.
So far, most of the survivors have been light industrial companies, relying
on cheap labour and high levels of output. Heavy industrial and engineering
companies, which require expensive capital input, are generally doing much
less well and will either face bankruptcy under new legislation or will
require high levels of state support to survive.
The continuing existence of a state sector may not be a bad thing, though,
according to some western economists in Vietnam. 'There will be certain
areas of the economy where public enterprises will certainly continue to
exist,' says Mr Roy Morey, head of the United Nations Development Programme
in Hanoi. 'Public utilities and those areas of the economy that are
considered to be of strategic importance to the country - I would expect
that these would continue to function.'

FT  04 MAR 94 / SDR48m IMF loan agreed for Senegal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund yesterday moved to help the countries of
French-speaking west and central Africa get over the pains of January's
devaluation of the CFA franc by agreeing to lend Senegal 47.6m special
drawing rights (about Pounds 46m).
The loan is the first agreed since the countries of the franc zone decided
on January 11 to cut the value of their currency, fixed at 50 CFA francs to
the French franc since 1948, by 50 per cent.
The IMF board is expected to discuss similar loans to other franc zone
countries, starting with Niger, Ivory Coast, Comoros and Cameroon, over the
next month.
The loan agreed yesterday will back up the policies Senegal's government has
adopted since the devaluation to boost its economy, including cuts in
customs tariffs, administered prices, and the pursuit of a moderate wage
policy.
Figures from the Senegal government and the IMF show the country's economy
shrank by 0.8 per cent last year, but is projected to grow by 2.7 per cent
in 1994 and 5.0 per cent in 1995. Inflation is projected to climb to 39 per
cent this year before dropping to 7.8 per cent in 1995.
In a statement issued yesterday the IMF called for external aid to Senegal,
including debt relief. France has already agreed to cancel its remaining
debt from low-income member countries and to halve outstanding debt from
middle-income countries.

Israel came under renewed international pressure yesterday to meet demands
for greater protection of Palestinians living under military occupation.
In an effort to calm Palestinian outrage after last Friday's massacre in
Hebron, Israel began freeing 400 more Arab prisoners yesterday, bringing
this week's total to nearly 1,000. But the Palestine Liberation Organisation
reiterated that the move was insufficient to allow a resumption of peace
talks.
Efforts to resume the peace process are focusing on the PLO's demands for
the deployment of an international presence in the occupied territories to
safeguard Palestinians, the disarming of the 120,000 Jewish settlers, and
the dismantling or 'realignment' of some political or ideological
settlements. Israel has rejected the PLO's demands.
However, Mr Karolos Papoulias, the Greek foreign minister, who is touring
the Middle East representing the European Union, lent his support to the
demands during a visit to Amman. Russia, a co-sponsor of the Middle East
peace process with the US, has also backed the PLO position.
Officials in Israel also said that the US, which generally supports the
Israeli government, would welcome more credible measures to assuage
Palestinian fears.
The US is awaiting the arrival of Mr Nabil Shaath, a senior PLO official,
who is due in Washington today to explain the organisation's stance and to
try to win backing for a strong UN Security Council resolution on the
massacre.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said in London yesterday
after meeting Mr Shaath that the UK would be willing to send international
observers to the occupied territories. 'I am thinking of individuals and
civilians rather than armed units,' he said. Britain was determined that the
massacre should not derail the peace process, he added.
Meanwhile, the Israeli government sought to strengthen its position in
parliament, where it has only a one-seat majority, by bringing Tsomet, a
far-right-wing party, into the Labour-led coalition, a move that ignited
fierce protest from Arab and left-wing government supporters.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, has had lengthy negotiations with
Tsomet, which has five members in the 120-strong Knesset (parliament).
Tsomet favours expanding Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and
is opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state.
Mr Rafael Eitan, the leader of Tsomet, who once compared Arabs to
cockroaches, said yesterday the basis for coalition negotiations with Labour
had been created by recent events and the uncertainty surrounding the
implementation of the PLO-Israel outline peace accord.
The Knesset's two Arab parties, with five parliamentary seats, said they
would withdraw their support from the government if Tsomet joined the
coalition. The left-wing Meretz party, Mr Rabin's most important coalition
partner, also said it was opposed to the move, warning that it would send a
negative message to Palestinians and jeopardise peace talks.
Mr Ahmed Tibi, adviser to Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, said the contacts
with Tsomet 'cast a deep shadow' over the peace process.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Hopes rise on HK airport finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a settlement to Britain and China's long-running dispute
about financing Hong Kong's multi-billion-dollar airport project brightened
significantly yesterday after what British officials described as 'useful
and constructive' talks.
British officials gave an upbeat assessment of the talks, the first since
August last year, describing the atmosphere as 'positive and friendly'. They
said China's attitude demonstrated it wanted to settle the issue of airport
finance.
China has attempted to use the airport as a lever to influence the British
government in its row with London over Hong Kong's political development.
With the recent failure of bilateral talks on the colony's forthcoming
election, Beijing may have decided that holding up progress on the airport
served no further useful purpose.
An early test of this will come next week. On Wednesday, the government
introduces into the local legislature the second of Governor Chris Patten's
bills for democratic reform. The following day, China's National People's
Congress, or rubber-stamp parliament, convenes in Beijing for its annual
meeting. A year ago, a similar conjunction of events produced a furious
response from China.
The airport and its connecting railway are estimated to cost the public
sector about HKDollars 84bn (Pounds 7.3bn). Earlier this year, the Hong Kong
government acquiesced in China's demand that the project be funded by
HKDollars 60.3bn of equity and HKDollars 23bn of debt.
Mr Alan Paul, the UK team leader, said the attitude of the Chinese side
showed China wanted to move to a full meeting of the airport committee. The
committee would meet in full session only if it were to agree a financial
plan.
The Chinese side had yesterday asked a number of technical questions
concerning the latest financial plan, he added. These would be responded to
within the week and the timing of another meeting discussed. It is vital
both sides agree financing before the summer. If not, delays in opening the
airport of up to a year or more may be unavoidable.

India's exports surged 21.41 per cent to Dollars 17.8bn (Pounds 9.8bn) in
the 10 months from April 1993 to January this year. Preliminary figures
yesterday showed that while exports are continuing to grow strongly, imports
in the period increased only 0.68 per cent to Dollars 18.38bn against last
year's Dollars 18.26bn. The trade deficit fell from Dollars 3.6bn in the 10
months to Dollars 581.68m.
Main commodities that have led to the growth in exports are gems and
jewellery (18 per cent); ready-made garments (12.3 per cent); engineering
goods (9 per cent); textiles (6.8 per cent), and leather goods (3.9 per
cent). Imports continued to be dominated by petroleum and crude oil.
The Asian Development Bank yesterday approved a Dollars 600,000 grant for
emergency rehabilitation management in Maharashtra, where 10,000 people were
killed in an earthquake last September.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Venezuelan judge orders 83 arrests

<TEXT>
A Venezuelan judge has issued 83 warrants against some of the country's most
prominent businessmen in connection with the collapse of Venezuela's second
largest bank, Banco Latino, in January.
Criminal Court Judge Diamora Ramirez de Simancas ordered the arrests of two
ex-presidents of Banco Latino, members of the board of directors and deputy
directors, bank officers, and Mr Roger Urbina, the superintendent of banks,
who was charged with concealment.
Also charged was Mr Ricardo Cisneros, one of the wealthiest men in Latin
America, whose family owns large industrial and commercial holdings in
Venezuela and the US. Mr Cisneros was formerly a member of Latino's board,
and the Cisneros group of companies reported that it owned 3.5 per cent of
the bank's stock.
Mr Cisneros and his brother, Gustavo, own the Organizacion Diego Cisneros in
Venezuela as well as the Spalding, Evenflo and Pueblo Xtra supermarkets in
the US. Mr Gustavo Cisneros has denied wrongdoing by him, his brother or his
family companies in the Latino affair.
The Cisneroses formerly owned Paternoster Square in London and the Galerias
Preciados chain in Spain.
Most of those involved are believed to have left the country, even though
the authorities had issued international travel bans against members of
Latino's board in January. The judge asked the government to initiate
extradition proceedings against any of those charged who are found overseas.
The warrants covered charges that included illegal appropriation, fraud, and
falsification of financial statements.
Arrest warrants were issued against two ex-presidents of Latino, Messrs
Gustavo Gomez Lopez and Giacomo Leon, and a list of others that reads like a
Who's Who of Venezuelan businessmen and investors.
It is not clear how far the current legal actions will proceed.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Good start to Streisand sale: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barbra Streisand, the entertainer, is simplifying her life by disposing of
the collection of 20th-century decorative arts that she has assembled over
the past 30 years. Christie's sold 178 lots yesterday in New York for
Dollars 5.77m (Pounds 3.88m), with just one item unsold.
The auction is completed today.
The top price was Dollars 1.98m (est Dollars 600,000-Dollars 800,000) paid
for a painting by Tamara de Lempicka, the leading female exponent of the art
deco style. 'Adam and Eve', featuring two nudes, was completed in 1932. The
model for the male figure was a policeman who Tamara called up from the
street near her Paris studio. The price was a record for the artist.
The most highly estimated lot was a Tiffany Cowbeb lamp, one of only a dozen
in this style made by the American art nouveau master. It was bought in 1979
and occupied the prime position in the actress's Beverly Hills Sun Room. It
sold for Dollars 717,500, below forecasts.
A rare Tiffany Peony lamp, around which Streisand had planned her living
room, made Dollars 332,000, within forecasts, while a Cartier clock of 1927
in the form of a Shinto gate doubled its estimate at Dollars 316,000.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Polls hand mid-term boost to Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Republican party may find it hard to make expected gains in this year's
mid-term elections, according to an opinion poll published yesterday by the
Washington Post and ABC News.
The survey also found President Bill Clinton's popularity rating holding up
at 58 per cent positive and 38 per cent negative. Other polls, however, have
shown slippage to the 50 per cent range.
The main message of the survey was the extent to which Democrats have
appropriated the issues of most concern to the American public. The party
holds a sizeable edge in public confidence in its ability to manage the
economy, the federal deficit, healthcare and crime.
Only in defence and foreign policy was a Republican advantage apparent. But
two thirds of those surveyed identified social issues as the most important,
against 18 per cent who cited the economy.
The mid-term election season opens this month with a batch of party
primaries, of which the most widely watched is probably in Illinois, where
Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the ways and means committee,
faces a tough battle in his Chicago district because of impropriety
allegations.
The general rule of thumb had been that the Republicans could gain as many
as 25 seats in the House - not enough to overturn the current 81-seat
Democratic majority but a real problem for the Clinton administration.
But a comprehensive poll of polls published last month by the New York Times
and CBS News, covering over 250,000 respondents, has given the Democrats
reason for encouragement.
It found that for the first time since 1976 the Democrats were making
significant gains over Republicans - 36 per cent identified themselves as
Democrats, 28 per cent as Republicans and 30 per cent as independents.
For the first time since 1984 more Americans in the 18-29 age bracket said
they were Democrats than Republicans, by a 31-29 per cent margin, with
independents at 33 per cent.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Business sceptical over policy switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During its first month in office, Venezuela's government, headed by
President Rafael Caldera, has announced a series of economic measures that
stand in contrast to the unpopular market reforms that were implemented over
the last five years.
The administration has depicted itself as seeking a middle ground between
free-market policies and heavy government intervention in the economy. While
the results are not yet apparent, businessmen are generally sceptical.
The government, which began a five-year term on February 2, is facing the
country's second year of recession. It is trying to cope with a drop in the
value of its oil exports which accounts for much of the Treasury's revenue,
46 per cent inflation last year, a fiscal deficit of 8-10 per cent of GDP,
heavy debt payments and a banking crisis brought on by the collapse of the
country's second-largest bank.
The imposition of 'temporary' price controls helped bring down the inflation
rate last month from 4.3 per cent in January to 1.9 per cent.
But the government's international reserves fell by Dollars 633m (Pounds
433.5m) last month to Dollars 11.2bn, after a Dollars 744m decline in
January. These large falls - reserves fell only Dollars 519m in the whole of
last year - resulted from lower oil receipts and dollar demand after the
failure of Banco Latino.
Businesses have been concerned these problems would prompt exchange controls
and a big devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, but the government has said
it is not planning action on either point.
Instead, the government has promised to cut the central government budget by
8 per cent, proposed a series of tax changes, set up an autonomous agency to
collect income taxes and reduce tax evasion, extended price controls on
medicines, and announced it will seek 'voluntary price restraint' on other
items.
It has also committed substantial resources in an effort to refloat Banco
Latino and keep other troubled banks in business. There are also business
worries that the huge volume of government financing required by these
troubled banks will prove inflationary.
Mr Caldera has suspended the constitutional right to engage in free business
practices, giving him extensive power to decree drastic economic measures.
The last suspension of economic rights lasted 30 years and was lifted only
in 1991. This time the government has said the current suspension may be
revoked soon, and that the special powers will be used prudently.
Mr Freddy Rojas, former president of Fedecamaras, Venezuela's largest
business association, called the presidential move 'an improvisation' and
warned that it would scare off private investment.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Quebec politics dampens business hopes: How separatism fears
are overshadowing economic gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and BOB GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quebec's business community is holding its breath, not sure whether to
celebrate the end of a long, deep recession or to worry about the political
future of Canada's French-speaking province.
A provincial election, to be held later this year, is shaping up into a
closely fought battle between the ruling Liberals, who have held office for
nine years, and the separatist Parti Quebecois.
If the PQ wins it has promised to hold an independence referendum within 12
months of taking office, giving Quebecois an opportunity to reverse their
decision to remain part of Canada which they made in a similar vote 14 years
ago.
The prospect of a PQ victory has become as much - if not more - of a talking
point in Montreal's clubby business community as the surging exports, a
turnaround in corporate profits and the improved housing market which all
signal the start of a long-awaited economic upturn.
'The economic climate is very good,' says Mr Jean Douville, president of
Schroders &amp; Associates Canada, an affiliate of Schroders, the UK merchant
bank. But Mr Douville, himself a Quebecois, adds that renewed political
nervousness 'is certainly worrisome'.
The PQ insists that business has nothing to fear in a sovereign Quebec. Its
leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau, is an astute economist who was once described
as the best finance minister that Canada never had. In particular, PQ
leaders have begun to lobby for an independent Quebec's accession to the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
Nevertheless, fears of a messy divorce and uncertainty about how well Quebec
would fare by going it alone are unsettling business confidence.
The PQ's last term in office in the late 1970s and early 1980s was marked by
a flight of capital and people to neighbouring Ontario to the west, and the
US to the south. The scare was exemplified by Sun Life of Canada, the
country's biggest insurance company, which moved its head office from
Montreal to Toronto.
The jitters have started to resurface. The gap between the yield on 30-year
bonds issued by Quebec and by the neighbouring province of Ontario has
widened from about 12 basis points last autumn to 33 basis points late last
month.
Mr Yves Auclair, a Quebec bond specialist at Burns Fry in Montreal, says
that 'the typical holder of Quebec bonds has gradually scaled back his
weighting over the past four months'. Among long-term bonds issued by
Canada's 10 provinces, only impoverished Newfoundland offers a higher yield
than Quebec to attract investors.
However, the spread between Quebec and Ontario bond yields narrowed to 21
basis points last week on the heels of opinion polls which show waning
support for the separatists. One poll put the Liberals ahead of the PQ for
the first time in more than a year. The federalist forces received another
boost this week when the Liberals unexpectedly won a by-election in a
French-speaking constituency east of Montreal. Anecdotal evidence suggests
that while many companies are continuing to invest in Quebec, political
uncertainty is also causing them to review their Quebec operations.
The separatist forces were bolstered by the strong showing of the PQ's
federal counterpart, the Bloc Quebecois, in the general election last
October. The BQ is now the official opposition in the House of Commons in
Ottawa. Its canny leader, Mr Lucien Bouchard, is likely to play a leading
role in the coming election campaign.
Mr Bouchard is in the US this week enjoying a level of status and publicity
not conferred on the separatists since they were voted out of office nine
years ago. His itinerary has included a meeting with Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary-general. The BQ has made use of its strength in
parliamentary debates and question periods to remind Quebecois that being
part of the Canadian federation brings more costs than benefits.
Prior to the by-election upset this week, Mr Parizeau was exuding
confidence. The PQ had won a string of by-elections, including one last week
in which it captured a Liberal - and supposedly federalist - stronghold.
The Liberals' new leader, Mr Daniel Johnson, took over from Mr Robert
Bourassa as premier in January amid low expectations. Mr Johnson has a
low-key style and made many political enemies during his years as a
tight-fisted cabinet minister in charge of the province's civil service.
Senior diplomats in Ottawa had concluded that the coming election was the
PQ's to lose. But recent opinion polls and the by-election result show that
the fight is far from over.
Mr Johnson is following a formula much like that which steered the federal
Liberals to victory in the general election. Instead of being drawn into a
constitutional debate, Mr Johnson is trying to spread a message that the
best way to generate jobs is through a strong economy unfettered by
political uncertainties.
Like many others in the business community, Mr Douville is crossing fingers
that the strategy will work. He notes that 'it's a lot easier for people to
accept the status quo when they've got some money in their pockets'.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Salinas gives ground to soothe rebels: Concessions may hit
public support for Zapatistas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The preliminary agreement reached on Wednesday between Mexico's Zapatista
rebels and the government demonstrates the remarkable ability of Mexico's
political system to resolve seemingly intractable conflicts quickly and
pragmatically.
The tentative accord comes little more than two months after the Zapatistas
declared war on the Mexican army in the southern state of Chiapas and
demanded the resignation of President Carlos Salinas and his cabinet. Mr
Salinas's government swiftly dismissed the rebels as 'transgressors of the
law,' backed by foreigners and radical priests.
But the prospect of a prolonged conflict in the run-up to this August's
presidential election and the vulnerability of the economy to civil unrest
persuaded the president to make sweeping concessions to the masked rebels.
These concessions should transform Chiapas, the state's relationship with
indigenous peoples, and have important effects on the rest of the country.
Under the 32-point draft agreement the government has promised to meet rebel
demands for a new and more democratic electoral law in Chiapas, to return
land taken from peasants there and divide large farms. It will also draw up
a new state penal code, and dramatically increase spending on schools,
hospitals, housing, and basic infrastructure.
The government will provide a local radio station for indigenous peoples,
and appoint an attorney general for defence of Indian rights. It will
propose a law for indigenous peoples allowing them to incorporate local
customs into their laws. It will also outlaw the expulsion of Protestant
Indians from Catholic communities.
The government proposals do not meet all the rebel demands, specifically
their call for legal action against three former governors of Chiapas and
the ousting of Mr Salinas from the presidency.
The government formally rejected the rebel insistence that peace talks
include national democratic reforms. However, the government has indirectly
met such demands by negotiating electoral reform with opposition parties in
Mexico City. Electoral laws are likely to be agreed shortly.
The provisional agreement still has to be approved by Zapatista supporters,
but government officials believe this is likely. Even if the rebels do not
support the agreement, the concessions should undercut much of their public
support, which has been their most effective weapon against the state.
If the agreement is ratified by the rebels, the accord would mark a personal
victory for Mr Salinas. Having come close to seeing his presidency unravel
in the days after the peasant uprising, he can now take credit for restoring
peace to the region, and for proposing social and economic reforms that much
of the country supports and that do not by themselves threaten his project
to modernise Mexico's economy.
However, resolution of the conflict will not come without a cost. Government
concessions to armed rebels may legitimise further violence as a solution to
social and economic problems, and make the task of ruling Mexico more
difficult in the future.
Mr Salinas has also had to agree to an electoral reform that he had
previously opposed. By reducing government control of electoral boards and
giving the opposition more equal access to the media, the reform will make
it more difficult for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party to win
elections through fraud. It also raises the possibility, for the first time
in modern Mexican history, of an opposition victory.
The agreement raises still further the profile of Mr Manuel Camacho, the
peace envoy to Chiapas. He was instrumental in persuading the president to
make concessions to the rebels, and in pushing through the national
electoral reform.
While most observers consider the prospect unlikely, Mr Camacho is now in a
stronger position to run as an independent candidate for the presidency,
challenging Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the candidate of the ruling party and
favourite to succeed Mr Salinas.
As indicated by the sharp rise in Mexico's stockmarket after the
announcement of a preliminary accord, peace should boost investor confidence
in Mexico's economy. In recent days the peso has come under fire, with
investors worried about low growth and the pressure that has been put on the
government to keep interest rates low.
Even with a peace agreement, the divisions within Chiapas have deepened
since the New Year uprising and are unlikely to disappear quickly. Many
ranchers and government officials in Chiapas view the Zapatistas as little
more than terrorists.
While a minority, they hold most of the region's economic power and are sure
to oppose elements of the peace plan that call for appropriation of large
farms and electoral reform.
For their part the Zapatistas and their sympathisers have been liberated by
the uprising, losing their fear of the landowners and PRI officials.
But if there is resistance or delay in compliance with the promised reforms,
they may take up arms again.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US factory goods orders rose 2.1 per cent in January - the sixth increase in
a row - as last year's momentum in the manufacturing sector carried into the
new year, the government said yesterday, AP reports from Washington.
The Commerce Department said the string of advances was the longest since
one that ran from September 1987 to June 1988. January's rise followed a 1.4
per cent gain in December.
Leading the surge were sales of transport equipment, particularly aircraft
and parts. The volatile transport component rose 14 per cent, or Dollars
5bn, to Dollars 40.7bn (Pounds 27.8bn).
The Commerce Department also reported unfilled orders increased for the
first time in nearly a year, an indication that more hiring of workers may
be on the way.
The department said factory orders totalled a seasonally adjusted Dollars
272bn, up from Dollars 266.4bn in December. Manufacturing orders excluding
transport increased just 0.3 per cent and excluding defence orders were up
1.6 per cent.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Clinton faces healthcare compromises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton is fighting to salvage what he can of his plan to
reform the US healthcare system, in the face of waning popular support and
continued deadlock in Congress.
Mr Clinton said yesterday that his proposals were misunderstood because of a
Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.5m) lobbying campaign against them by the health
insurance industry and other interest groups, but offered to concede on
virtually any point, so long as the end result guaranteed private health
insurance to everyone.
'I think what will happen is people of good faith who want a plan that gives
healthcare security to all Americans - that is, healthcare that you can
never lose - will get together and come up with a system that meets the
criteria I laid out,' Mr Clinton said on breakfast television.
But recent opinion polls show that the Clinton reform plan is losing ground.
A Washington Post-ABC poll taken last week showed 48 per cent of those
questioned disapproved of the plan, while 44 per cent approved of it - the
first time since it was unveiled last September that more have disapproved
than approved.
In Congress the plan is making little headway through the legislative
machinery. Jurisdiction over the bill has been divided up between a wide
array of House and Senate committees, but none has yet managed to agree on a
text.
One of the Clinton plan's key supporters, Congressman Henry Waxman of
California, this week gave up attempts to work out a compromise in the
health subcommittee he chairs. The committee includes Congressman Jim Cooper
of Tennessee, who is sponsoring one of the chief rivals to the
administration plan, a proposal he calls 'Clinton Lite'.
Another health subcommittee chaired by Congressman Pete Stark, another
California Democrat, has also postponed its efforts to agree on a bill. Mr
Stark has his own proposal, based on an expansion of the existing government
Medicare scheme.
The full committees over the heads of Mr Waxman and Mr Stark are chaired by
two of the president's staunchest and most powerful backers on the
healthcare issue: Congressmen John Dingell of Michigan and Dan Rostenkowski
of Illinois.
Both recognise that they will have to compromise on many aspects of the
Clinton plan if they are to win passage, and have decided not to start
dealing away concessions to win agreement at the subcommittee level only to
have to start again at the full committee level.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Talks resume on ending conflict in Guatemala
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Guatemalan government and left-wing guerrillas resumed peace talks
yesterday in a new bid to end their 33-year conflict.
The talks in Mexico between the government and the guerrillas of the
National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unit come amid a climate of instability
fuelled by recent coup rumours and apparent divisions in the army over the
possible outcome of the talks.
The negotiations, at which a United Nations moderator will be present, are
to address the delicate issue of a human rights agreement and the creation
of a commission to investigate past abuses.
The meeting will be the first since the signing of a framework agreement in
January, in which both sides stated their political will to reach a
settlement this year.
Guatemala's President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, a former human rights official
who became head of state last June, badly needs a public relations victory,
after his image has begun to wilt both locally and internationally.
But senior army officers, including the minister of defence, have made it
clear they take a dim view of a proposal to form a commission which would
investigate violations during the internal conflict, which has cost more
than 100,000 lives.
The substantial constituency in the army against the peace talks, and
particularly an investigative commission, has cast doubt on professed
optimism in government circles of an imminent breakthrough.
However, sources close to the government delegation believe the guerrillas
may allow discussions on the commission to be put to one side.
The guerrillas have maintained throughout the four-year long negotiations
that the creation of such a commission, and a commitment to international
verification of human rights observance, are requirements if it is to sign
an agreement on human rights.
The issue has highlighted divisions between the civilian government and the
military. Mr Hector Rosada, the head of the government's team in the talks,
which includes two generals and a colonel, has said that a commission is
necessary if peace is to bring minimal comfort to the hundreds of thousands
of relatives of victims during the conflict.

FT  04 MAR 94 / First miss for 84-year-old
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something extraordinary happened in the US Congress yesterday.
For the first time in 41 years there was a division in the House of
Representatives - on a mundane procedural issue - in which Mr William
Natcher, the 84-year-old Democrat from Kentucky, did not cast a vote.
That broke a string of 18,401 consecutive votes by Congressman Natcher. This
is, naturally, a record. Congressional historians do not know who held it
before, nor who holds the current longest streak. Mr Tom Foley, the Speaker,
yesterday advised his colleagues not to try to beat Mr Natcher because they
could never stand the strain.
So anxious were his colleagues to keep his streak going that they had held
no votes at all on Wednesday. On Tuesday Mr Natcher had been wheeled to
Capitol Hill from his hospital bed to cast a vote or two. Though frail and
ill, he has not hinted at retirement.

Belleli, the Italian engineering group, yesterday said it had, together with
Uhde of Germany, been awarded a Dollars 430m (Pounds 289m) contract by Qatar
Fertiliser Company to build a petrochemical plant, John Simkins reports from
Milan.
The plant at Umm Said will, on completion in 1996, be one of the biggest in
the world, with a daily capacity of 1,500 tonnes of ammonia and 2,000 tonnes
of urea.
Uhde, a subsidiary of Hoechst, is in charge of the process engineering.
Belleli, which has its Middle East headquarters at Al Jubail in Saudi
Arabia, will have a 55 per cent share of the project and provide power
generation and desalination units.

<TEXT>
Dr Manfred Schneider, chief executive of Bayer, the German chemicals and
pharmaceuticals group, has warned that European politicians did not
understand how cut-throat international competition in the chemicals
industry was becoming.
Asian-Pacific chemicals companies were already making their presence felt in
Europe, he said. But European competitiveness was being handicapped by high
labour and social security costs as well as state intervention in
environmental affairs. Slow approval for new products and processes was also
taking its toll.
The warning came as Dr Schneider announced his company intended to invest
more than DM1bn (Pounds 400m) in the Asia-Pacific region by the end of the
decade. The forecast underlines the increasing interest of European and
American chemicals and drugs companies in the region.
Dr Schneider, who was speaking at the Chemical Week Asia-Pacific Conference
in Singapore, said demand for chemicals was growing rapidly in the region.
He added the chemicals industry's leading customers - the textiles,
electronics, automotive and engineering sectors - were all enjoying high
growth. Imperial Chemical Industries, which today opens a CFC replacement
plant in Japan, estimates the Asia Pacific market will grow from Dollars
280bn (Pounds 188m) to Dollars 460bn by the year 2000.
Bayer, which had sales of about DM5.6bn in the Far East last year, welcomed
the increasing industrialisation of the area, Dr Schneider said. The group
aimed to increase sales in the region, but needed to expand its production
base.

Efforts to make the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade more responsive
to environmental concerns risk being held up by unwarranted fears over
'green protectionism', the World Wide Fund for Nature says in a report
released today, writes Frances Williams from Geneva.
The WWF says Gatt rules already provide safeguards against green
protectionism, which it defines as trade restrictions which in practice
bring no environmental benefit. However, it wants Gatt to take a more benign
view of so-called trade-related environmental measures which harness trade
restrictions to environmental goals.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, yesterday rounded on US trade policy towards Japan, lambasting
the managed trade approach as 'misguided and dangerous' and accusing
Washington of putting the multilateral trading system at risk.
'A new outbreak of bilateral trade tensions is putting the achievements of
the Uruguay Round to the test even before they are fully operational,' he
said in remarks for delivery yesterday lunchtime at the Swedish-American
Chamber of Commerce in New York. The Uruguay Round trade accords, to be
signed by ministers next month, are due to come into force in 1995.
Mr Sutherland said 'when any country privileges the bilateral approach over
the principles of the multilateral system it runs the risk of weakening that
system and the improvements in it just painstakingly negotiated'.
The US has been pushing Japan to agree bilateral accords which would open
its markets to more foreign-made goods, with the use of numerical indicators
to check on progress. Japan, fearing these indicators could become
obligatory targets, says it will not be a party to managed trade deals.
Backing Japan's case, Mr Sutherland said managed trade was damaging for the
countries concerned - because bureaucrats were more likely to make misguided
decisions than businesses - and for the multilateral system. Agreements
could only be enforced by the threat of trade sanctions, often illegal under
Gatt.
It was also very difficult to operate quantitative numerical targets for
market share of foreign producers in a way that gave equal opportunities to
all trading partners, as required under Gatt's most-favoured-nation
principle.
Mr Sutherland said completion of the Uruguay Round showed that countries
wanted to strengthen the multilateral system. 'The top priority on the world
economic agenda' was for countries quickly to ratify the Uruguay Round.

FT  04 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Airbus-Boeing jumbo studies to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The four leading European aircraft manufacturers yesterday agreed with
Boeing, the world's biggest aircraft maker, to continue until the middle of
next year joint studies on the development of a 600-800 seat superjumbo
airliner.
After what was described as a 'lively meeting', the four European companies
 -British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace and Casa of
Spain - said the European Airbus consortium would also participate in the
studies in an advisory role.
All four European manufacturers are shareholders in Airbus Industrie and
have been involved in joint studies with Boeing on a superjumbo for the past
14 months.
Although the European Airbus partners agreed to continue the joint studies,
they have also become concerned over Boeing's commitment to the joint
project.
Aerospatiale of France had shown growing reluctance to participate in the
joint studies in the wake of the controversy over Saudi Arabia's recent
decision to order Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) worth of new airliners from
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US following pressure from the White
House.

FT  04 MAR 94 / World Trade News: BT chairman assails curbs on ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications, yesterday said
talk in the European Union of restricting foreign ownership in the
telecommunications industry was a 'dangerous game' which could encourage
escalating protectionism in other parts of the world.
However, Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, speaking at the
same conference in London, said the EU was committed to an open trade
stance. He attacked what he called one-sided criticism of its anti-dumping
policy.
Critics overlooked the fact that many other countries also had anti-dumping
policies, which could be used against EU exports. Such policies were
essential to maintaining confidence in the world trading system by
correcting market distortions.
'Anti-dumping is not a carte blanche for protectionism,' he said. He had
instructed the European Commission officials responsible for the policy to
be 'scrupulously unpolitical' and to enforce it fairly.
Sir Iain said there were already signs of moves to strengthen foreign
ownership restrictions in the US, while the recently proposed alliance
between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom also appeared intended to reduce
competition.
Foreign ownership curbs were often defended on national security grounds, he
said. 'Yet the point about open markets is that diversity of supply should
mean that no interests - foreign or local - are in a position to dominate
anything.'
He said BT's recent alliance with MCI, the US carrier, differed from the
proposed Franco-German link-up because it was between two companies
operating in competitive markets and was designed to exploit emerging
opportunities for international value-added network services.
Sir Iain also called for the the inclusion of telecommunications services in
the Uruguay Round to be extended to cable television and broadcasting.
Separating regulation of these services would, he said, 'force multi-media
into a maze of conflicting regulations and operating constraints, with the
potential for inflicting real damage on this new and exciting field of
communications services'.

FT  04 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Hurdles to Mozambique aid - Poor
management dogs recovery effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peace has brought back prosperity to Mozambique's ports and railways, as
well as corruption, drug-trafficking and a thriving trade in looted
merchandise.
Western embassies are alarmed at the flow of illicit drugs through the
country's ports. Mr John Sunde, the South African ambassador, says his
customs officers have impounded up to one tonne of mandrax a week from
Maputo harbour. The hallucinogenic pills, manufactured in India, are widely
consumed in South Africa's black townships.
Diplomats also estimate that one-fifth of the total tonnage handled in
Maputo is stolen. Storage areas are not locked, and security guards look the
other way when women haul bags of maize and sugar over the harbour perimeter
fence.
Lax security and poor management are costing the state-owned Ports and
Railways Company of Mozambique (CFM) business it can barely afford to lose.
Coal mines in the Transvaal, which recently secured huge contracts to supply
Turkey, say they will not use the port at Maputo - their shortest outlet to
the sea - until security is improved.
'If South Africa doesn't use Maputo port, the World Bank will not fund an
Dollars 11m (Pounds 7.5m) project to upgrade the railway line,' Mr Sunde
says.
Having spent hundreds of millions of aid dollars to rebuild Mozambique's
war-damaged transport network, foreign donors have decided that the only way
to stop the rot at CFM is by privatising its management. In the diplomatic
language of the World Bank, the administration of CFM is in need of reform.
Already, the Caisse Francaise de Developpement, the French government's
overseas development agency, has threatened to halt the rehabilitation of
the Nacala railway, the northern-most of the three lines which traverse
Mozambique, unless CFM agrees to privatise the management of Nacala's
deep-water port and railway services.
The privatisation proposal provokes a vitriolic reaction from Mr Armando
Guebuza, the transport and communications minister.
'CFM is Mozambique's biggest company and foreign exchange earner. Why should
I hand over the country's wealth to foreigners without a full analysis of
the options?' he asks. 'There may be management problems, but we are not
obliged to accept every solution donors impose on us. Their objectives
should coincide with ours.'
The arguments are often clouded by emotion because Mozambicans fear they are
losing their sovereignty to the dictates of foreign donors. In a country
where aid receipts equal gross domestic product (a meagre Dollars 1bn),
there is an undercurrent of resentment at the lecturing that comes with
international assistance.
Charges of weak management wound Mr Guebuza's nationalist pride. To
surrender the railways to foreigners would bring back the not-so-distant
days of Portuguese rule, when blacks were restricted to menial jobs.
Seventeen years of civil war destroyed the few resources the Portuguese left
behind. Rehabilitation only began in earnest after the signing of a peace
accord in October 1992, and it has been financed entirely by external aid.
The port and railway terminal of Beira, which handles Zimbabwe's foreign
trade, has shiny new container and multi-purpose terminals, a fishing
terminal with cold storage facilities, a new oil terminal and a deeper port
thanks to some Dollars 435m of European Union and Nordic assistance.
Freight traffic along the Beira corridor has doubled since 1991 to 950,000
tonnes; the tonnage handled at the port has risen by 60 per cent to 2.7m
tonnes, as has container cargo.
Mr Fernando Ferreira Mendes, a former CFM employee who is now a consultant
with the World Bank, agrees that weak management is a problem, but mainly
because all decisions are centralised in Maputo.
'Everything has to be referred to CFM headquarters, from the purchase of
spares to the tariffs we may charge. We don't need to privatise management,'
he says, 'just decentralise it.'

FT  04 MAR 94 / Russia starts cutting off gas to Ukraine over Dollars 900m
unpaid bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Russia has started cutting gas supplies to Ukraine, threatening an energy
blockade to add to the woes of the country's crumbling economy.
The action came as tension grew in relations with other former Soviet
states.
Russia, energy supplier to much of the former Soviet Union, has been moving
towards world prices in its gas and oil supplies - putting pressure on the
economies of energy-dependent states like Ukraine, where reforms have hardly
begun and where inflation and financial crises are chronic.
About 95 per cent of Russian gas exports to western Europe pass through
Ukraine. Western customers maintain emergency reserves of gas in case of
disruptions, and some supplies could be shifted through the European gas
grid to compensate for shortfalls in individual countries. In addition
demand for gas is likely to fall as winter ends.
Any prolonged cut-off of Russian exports through Ukraine is likely to be
felt most in central Europe, which has few links to the western grid.
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia could be hardest hit, as they are
almost entirely dependent on Russian gas.
The Russian action, made as Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president,
flew to the US to meet President Bill Clinton, comes two weeks after
Turkmenistan, Ukraine's other major gas supplier, cut off supplies. Russia
has accused Ukraine of taking extra gas from the pipeline which carries 500m
cu metres a day both for Ukraine and to customers in Germany, France Italy
and central Europe in order to compensate for the Turkmen cuts.
Gasprom, the Russian monopoly gas company, says it is owed Rbs1,500bn
(Dollars 900m) by Ukraine - though Ukraine claims it owes only Rbs300bn. A
Ukrainian offer to pay Dollars 20m on account by tomorrow has been refused
by Gasprom, saying it is not enough.
Yesterday's gas reduction comes only two weeks after Russia and Ukraine had
apparently struck a 10-year deal to supply Ukraine with 50-70bn cubic metres
of gas a year. Some 90 per cent of Russia's gas exports to western Europe
cross the Ukraine but officials in Kiev deny this gas would be siphoned off
to replace Russian supplies to the Ukraine. However, officials in Kiev
remained sceptical even yesterday that Russia could effectively cut gas
supplies to Ukraine alone, precisely because it is so easy for Ukraine to
syphon.
Three other former Soviet republics - Belarus, Latvia and Moldova - also
face action from Gasprom. Belarus owes Rbs400bn (Dollars 240m) which it says
it cannot pay, and is already suffering cuts; Latvia owes Dollars 23m, and
talks begin in Riga today in an attempt to settle the issue; while Moldova,
which owes Rbs53bn (Dollars 390m), has just agreed to barter the debt
against consumer goods and foodstuffs.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Construction lifts German output: Economic watch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
West German industrial output in January was up 0.2 per cent on January
1993, but unchanged from December. Meanwhile, revised figures for December
showed a 1.4 per cent increase over the previous month, twice the increase
initially reported. The results were better than expected, and pointed to
stabilisation in the economy. Economists noted that manufacturing output
remained weak, falling 0.5 per cent in January. The main factor behind the
buoyancy of the January index was an unexpected 8.4 per cent surge in
construction output.
Italy recorded a surplus of L5,134bn (Pounds 2.04bn) in January on its
balance of payments current account, after a L2,310bn deficit in December.
The deficit in January 1993 was L765bn.
Turkey's trade deficit widened to Dollars 818m (Pounds 560m) in January from
Dollars 519m a year earlier. Exports totalled Dollars 1.32bn, up from
Dollars 1.27bn a year earlier. Imports reached Dollars 2.1bn in September
1993, up from Dollars 1.8bn a year earlier.
Belgian new car registrations in February were up 22.4 per cent on February
1993 and 11.5 per cent on January and February over the same period last
year.
Slovakia has introduced a 10 per cent tax on imports of many consumer goods,
in a move to improve its trade balance.
German car sales fell 20 per cent in 1993, to around DM190bn, while vehicle
output fell a quarter to about 4m units. The collapse in sales led to 70,000
job losses last year.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Balladur softens line on youth training but stands firm on
pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday agreed to improve
training for young apprentices, partly caving in to union pressure, but
stuck to the principle of his new law that young people on training
contracts can be paid less than the national minimum wage.
The government compromise was reached after all-day talks between Mr
Balladur, six ministers and the unions, in the course of which the
communist-leaning CGT federation stalked out and several thousand students
demonstrated. Even the other unions insisted after the meeting that they had
given no formal approval to Mr Balladur's changes, which the government is
to publish as a decree within a month.
At the meeting, Mr Balladur agreed to scrap the provision in last autumn's
labour law which would have allowed companies to pay young people, even with
university degrees, up to 20 per cent less than the so-called Smic minimum
wage, currently FFr5,886 (Dollars 985) a month. Qualified workers under the
age of 26 will, after all, get the Smic minimum.
Young workers without any qualifications can, by contrast, be paid as little
as 30 per cent of the Smic (in the case of 16-17 year olds), provided
companies spend the saving on training them. What Mr Balladur promised the
unions yesterday was to monitor the training to check that it was effective,
but he seemed to have left the unions unconvinced.
The government's rationale is that one in four people under 26 are out of a
job - a higher proportion of youth unemployment than in most European
countries - partly because in the past 20 years the Smic has, for social
welfare purposes, been raised by successive governments twice as fast as
average wages. This, it reasons, has priced less skilled and inevitably
younger workers out of the job market.
In last autumn's labour law the government thought it had quietly
circumvented the taboo against touching the Smic by associating pay cuts
with training.
But growing popular disenchantment with Mr Balladur over other issues such
as educational reform evidently emboldened the unions to make an issue of
the Smic changes when decrees implementing the 1993 law were published last
month.

A parliamentary report has criticised Mr Nicola Mancino, Italy's interior
minister, for failing to exercise proper control of the domestic
intelligence services, writes Robert Graham from Rome. The report, released
yesterday, followed the discovery of large scale misuse of the
organisations' funds and suspicions that secret servicemen had been involved
in planting of last summer's bombs in Florence, Milan and Rome. The report
says Mr Mancino lacked 'effective control' and his knowledge of the
activities of the domestic intelligence (Sisde) was 'episodic'. More often
than not, he was informed only after operations had been concluded. However,
the minister's supervisory role had been handicapped by the 1977 laws
setting up the Sisde, which gave its officials virtual autonomy.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Poll setback for Dutch coalition

<TEXT>
Local elections have dealt a blow to the Netherlands' two ruling parties
ahead of the May general election, writes Ronald van de Krol. Support for
the Christian Democrats (CDA) of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the prime minister, (left)
fell to 25 per cent of the vote on Wednesday, from 33.8 per cent in the last
local elections in 1990. Their coalition partner, Labour, led by Mr Wim Kok,
the finance minister, won 20.4 per cent of the vote, down from 26.2 per
cent. The main winners were the two largest opposition parties, the
right-wing Liberals and centrist D66, and a number of smaller parties,
including the far-right. If the local election results were translated into
parliamentary seats, CDA and Labour would lose their majority in the
150-member lower chamber, with their combined seats falling to 71 from 103
in the 1989 general election. However, local elections are not reliable as a
guide to national elections.

The Bank of Spain yesterday ignored the caution of other central banks and
cut its benchmark intervention rate from 8.5 per cent to 8 per cent, writes
Tom Burns from Madrid. The early morning cut surprised analysts, but
reaction was positive. Bond yields which had risen to above 9.6 per cent
fell to 8.8 per cent, the 3-month Mibor came down from 8.7 per cent to 8.3
per cent, Ibex-35, the index of the Madrid market's most traded equities,
rose 2.4 per cent and the peseta held steady. Meanwhile, figures released
yesterday revealed that GDP was down 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of
1993 against a year earlier, but up by 0.1 per cent on the third quarter of
1993.

<TEXT>
European broadcasters who have failed to meet quotas for European films and
programmes will escape legal action for the time being, the European
Commission said yesterday, writes Lionel Barber from Brussels. The
Commission decision follows surveys by the 12 member states, which show that
more television channels are devoting more than 50 per cent of air time to
European works. The surveys did not include all satellite and cable
programming. The 1989 'Television without Frontiers' directive requires 51
per cent of material shown on television to be of European origin, and 10
per cent to be set aside for independent European producers - much to the
fury of foreign producers, particularly in Hollywood. A Green Paper on the
audio-visual sector is to be published this month, but the surveys showed
there was anyway a growing preference for European programmes. In France,
which has led the campaign against alleged US cultural domination, showed
all five state-owned channels as meeting the quotas. In the UK, 19 out of 42
channels transmitted a majority content of European works.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, yesterday suggested
setting up multinational European rapid intervention forces, a project far
more ambitious than the Franco-German-Belgian Eurocorps now being created,
Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Leotard, in a speech to a symposium on
European defence, called for a summit of the nine-member Western European
Union (WEU), the designated security arm of the European Union. 'Such a
meeting could allow the Europeans, for example, to create European
intervention forces, commanded by a European general staff and which would
be both multinational and have integrated (air, land and sea) forces,' Mr
Leotard said. The Eurocorps, seen as the future land-based defence force of
the WEU, will become operational later this year, with one French and one
German division plus a Belgian brigade. But the Strasbourg-based Eurocorps
will have no air or naval forces of its own and Mr Leotard linked his new
plan to an existing one for the creation of an air and naval force made up
of French, Spanish and Italian units. Mr Leotard said he was not seeking to
rival Nato, of which France remains a member but whose integrated military
command it left in 1966 because of US dominance.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Fear in Athens for health of the nation: Illness has become
an obstacle to government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's socialist government has a problem usually associated with the old
communist regimes of eastern Europe: the weak health of several key players,
among them the prime minister, Mr Andreas Papandreou, has become an obstacle
to effective decision-making.
'Administrative delays are always a hurdle to getting anything done in
Greece. It's compounded now because the prime minister and the economy
minister can't stay at their desks as long as they should,' says a senior
government adviser.
Privatisation is a case in point, now that the rising budget deficit has
forced the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) into an
embarrassing reversal of its previous opposition to unbundling the state.
In addition to the plan for selling part of OTE, the state
telecommunications monopoly, there is talk of disposing of a 15 per cent
stake in the Public Power Corporation this year, through a convertible bond
issue with a five- to seven-year maturity.
Decisions are needed quickly if the flotation and the bond issue are to be
completed on schedule this year, given that both require extensive
preparation in terms of passing enabling legislation and removing other
procedural obstacles.
Offers from half a dozen international merchant banks to act as advisers or
underwriters to the OTE flotation are being evaluated at the Economy
Ministry. But officials there say the choice cannot be made without Mr
Giorgos Gennimatas, the economy minister, who has terminal cancer and has
been away from his desk for several weeks.
One banker said: 'There's a communication gap, no feedback. There was an
enthusiastic meeting with the minister some time back, then simply nothing
happened.'
Planning the sale requires tough decisions at an early stage on sorting out
OTE's large pension obligations and auditing its books according to
international standards
Mr Papandreou, 75, shows no sign of replacing Mr Gennimatas, one of his
closest political associates. One reason is that the economy minister,
Pasok's most popular member, is considered the best person to sell
privatisation to the trade unions, who successfully opposed the previous
conservative government's plans to transfer public utilities to the private
sector.
However, Mr Papandreou, who has a serious heart problem and is often not
seen in public for several days, has not appointed a deputy prime minister
either. He is expected to cling obstinately to power: the succession to his
leadership is not on the agenda for discussion at next month's Pasok
congress.
Meanwhile, the Culture Ministry has been thrown into disarray by the illness
of Ms Melina Mercouri, still in intensive care in a New York hospital after
surgery for a recurrence of cancer.
At the Bank of Greece, advisers keep a watchful eye on Mr Yannis Boutos, the
governor, who has a heart condition that would curtail his activities under
normal circumstances. Mr Boutos, a former economy minister appointed by Mr
Papandreou on his return to power, says he is determined to expedite reform
at the central bank.
However, the survival of the socialist government in the next few months
depends not on Mr Papandreou's health but on President Constantine
Karamanlis, the 86-year-old head of state, whose hold on power is just as
precarious.
Mr Karamanlis also has heart problems, but after consultations in London
last year decided against having by-pass surgery.
If he has to step down before his presidential term expires next spring,
parliament would probably be unable to muster the three-fifths majority
needed to elect a successor, and a general election would be held.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Bundesbank's faith in M3 creates schism: The smashing of the
central bank's 'plaster saint'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank, arguably the most respected institution in Germany, was
given a toasting by its warmest supporters yesterday; the local media's
financial commentators.
The target was the central bank's reliance for monetary guidance on its
prized but eccentric monthly M3 money supply figures.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung's crisp assessment - 'a compass that swings to every
rusty nail is not much use' - was widely shared, if not always so succinctly
put.
Like the best criticism, the judgements were sharp but well-intentioned.
Brickbats from left and right seemed intended to warn the central bank that
its credibility - its greatest asset, as it says itself - was being
tarnished by its over-reliance on wonky M3 data. Nor was its dignity helped
by the need to issue tortuous explanations of why the figures never quite
seemed to come under control.
Damage assessments in the wake of the whirlwind unleashed on financial
markets by Wednesday's figures, showing 20 per cent annualised monetary
growth in January, agreed that experience showed the early figures in any
year were not worth the beans they were counted on.
But enough was enough for the left-leaning Frankfurter Rundschau. 'After 20
years the Bundesbank can stick its money supply concept in the shredder,' it
suggested. Handelsblatt, the financial daily, agreed in its own quiet way.
'German money supply policy is threatened with a fate similar to that of
attempted monetary steering in the US and Britain,' it said.
Reminding readers that Germany and Switzerland were the only countries still
sticking to a policy based on money supply, it said such a concept could
work only if the relationship between money supply and inflation was clear
and stable.
'But a monetary policy loses its rudder when the relationship keeps
collapsing,' it added. In these circumstances, the desire of the Bundesbank
to have its faith in M3 taken seriously was not easily fulfilled.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung, sharpest of all, said financial markets looked up
to M3 'like a plaster saint' precisely because the bank continued to hold it
in such high esteem.
'The market hardly noticed the warning signs (about an inflated January
figure) put out by the Bundesbank itself: even experts cannot change their
views so swiftly.
'Now everyone has received the bill. But the gentlemen of the central bank
council are apparently still trying to stick their plaster saint together
again.'
The Suddeutsche's view reflected a consensus that the Bundesbank was
unlikely to be persuaded to change its ways, least of all under pin-pricks
from the press. Handelsblatt, too, expected it to hold on, hoping that M3
would regain some value as an indicator, at least until the time came for
European monetary union. There was some evidence that a pan-European money
supply aggregate was more stable than that of a single nation, it suggested,
offering a sop to the bank's ambitions to have its methods adopted by Emu.
'Until then, we will have ample opportunities to witness 'monetary
pragmatism' at work at the top of the Bundesbank: that is, the art of
presenting a policy in a different light whenever circumstances require it.'

FT  04 MAR 94 / Greece to go ahead with telecoms sale
</HEADLINE>

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's socialist government, finally dropping its opposition to
privatisation, plans to sell a minority stake in OTE, the state
telecommunications company, through a flotation on the Athens stock
exchange.
The government hopes to raise Dr250bn (Pounds 677m) from the sale of 25 per
cent of the company, placing at least half the offering with institutional
investors abroad.
In a reversal of the socialists' announced policy on privatisation, the
Economy Ministry intends to use at least Dr100bn of funds raised by the
flotation to help cover an expected shortfall in revenue collection this
year.
The prime minister, Mr Andreas Papandreou, has maintained until now that
income raised from listing state corporations on the bourse would be set
aside to modernise them, not transferred to the central budget.
However, with revenues in January and February lagging behind the 1994
budget projection, the Economy Ministry is anxious to find fresh sources of
revenue without having to impose new taxes.
The European Commission, in a recent report on the Greek economy, described
this year's budget as unrealistic, calling for immediate measures to avert a
revenue shortfall projected at about Dr300bn.
Economy Ministry officials said that despite opposition to the listing from
OTE's trade union, they were confident the flotation could be launched in
October.
The Economy Ministry has renewed contacts with international merchant banks
that worked with the previous conservative government last year on a plan to
dispose of 49 per cent of OTE through a strategic sale to an international
telecoms operator, to be followed by a flotation.
The plan, fiercely opposed both by trade unions and prominent conservative
officials, was abandoned when the socialists came to power last October.
However, no decision has so far been taken on re-appointing domestic and
international underwriters for the proposed issue.
Delays are likely as Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, the economy minister, who takes
responsibility for decision-making on privatisation, is seriously ill with
cancer.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Polish budget set to pass and release IMF loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's awkward coalition government of farmers and former communists is
set to win parliamentary approval tomorrow for a tight budget which
restricts the 1994 deficit to 4.2 per cent of GDP.
The budget, once approved, paves the way for a new IMF standby loan. The
IMF's agreement is needed to trigger off the second and final stage of
Poland's April 1991 debt reduction deal with the Paris Club of official
creditors.
The first stage, a 30 per cent reduction in the Dollars 33bn (Pounds 22.6bn)
official debt in 1991, is to be followed by the final 20 per cent reduction
at the end of this month. An outline agreement is also expected later this
month on the rescheduling and reduction of Poland's Dollars 13bn debt to the
London Club of commercial bank creditors.
The budget was tabled in parliament yesterday by the acting finance
minister, Mr Henryk Chmeliak, a replacement for Mr Marek Borowski. Mr
Borowski, from the former communist Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), last
month lost a power struggle with Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister,
from the peasant party (PSL).
The prime minister sacked Mr Borowski's deputy, Mr Stefan Kovalec, for
mismanaging the privatisation of Bank Slaski, one of nine state-owned banks
in the process of privatisation. The shares opened on the Warsaw stock
exchange last month at 12 times the initial offer price. But few of the
800,000 new shareholders, apart from bank employees, had been able to
register their shareholdings. Only registered shares could be sold at the
artificially high market level.
Mr Borowski protested that it was his prerogative to dismiss his deputy, not
the prime minister's, and demanded further concentration of economic
decision-making in his hands. The prime minister refused and accepted Mr
Borowski's resignation.
The ensuing political row between the coalition partners has been papered
over and a new finance minister will be nominated after the budget is
approved.
The budget assumes a 4.5 per cent growth in GDP this year. It forecasts a 36
per cent rise in revenue to Zl 613,000bn (Pounds 19bn) and a 38 per cent
increase in spending to Zl 696,000bn. Inflation, on an annualised basis, is
expected to fall to 27 per cent from 36 per cent in 1993. The 1994 deficit
of Zl 83,000bn (Dollars 3.8bn) is above last year's lower than expected Zl
53,000bn, 3.6 per cent of GDP, but was agreed only after strong lobbying
from PSL and SLD deputies to increase spending on pensions, social services
and agriculture.
The Solidarity trade union, which mounted a protest strike by over 20,000
workers last month, is due to hold a general strike against the government
on Monday. But the stoppage is not expected to have a significant impact,
either economically or politically, with unemployment at 15.7 per cent and
union strength concentrated in declining state industries and public
services.

pay

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Some 10,000 French students marched through Paris yesterday in protest
against a law allowing employers to pay young workers less than the minimum
wage as trade union leaders pressed the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur,
for concessions, Reuter reports from Paris.
The communist-led CGT union walked out of round-table talks with Mr Balladur
after three hours when the conservative prime minister refused to withdraw
the controversial law, but non-communist unions continued to negotiate in
the hope of winning key changes.
The CGT general secretary, Mr Louis Viannet, said: 'The prime minister made
a number of proposals which are no more than cosmetic changes. In these
conditions the CGT cannot condone the talks.'
Mr Viannet later joined the front rank of the protest march, along with
student union leaders, near Mr Balladur's Paris office.
The law, disapproved of by most French voters according to an opinion poll,
allows young people under 26 on 'training contracts' to be paid between 30
and 80 per cent of the minimum wage, known as the SMIC, even if they have
university diplomas.
The talks with unions and employers to discuss ways of combating record 12.2
per cent unemployment were arranged before controversy erupted last week
over what unions and left-wing political parties have dubbed the
'Youth-SMIC'.
'This protest is just a foretaste,' student leader Philippe Campinchi said.
'The aim is to organise a national demonstration in the coming days to
demand the scrapping of this law.'
Mr Marc Blondel, leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere union, who stayed in
the talks, said Mr Balladur had offered amendments to limit the application
of the contracts, make them experimental and ensure that young people were
given real training.
'There can be no question of the unions, and particularly Force Ouvriere,
accepting this notion of a Youth-SMIC,' he said.
Mr Viannet said the measure undermined the minimum wage - which currently
stands at FFr5,886 (Pounds 674) a month for a 39-hour week.
Mr Balladur has denied the measure discriminates against young workers or
subverts the minimum wage.
With his credibility at stake after several recent policy reverses, the
prime minister has vowed he will not back down.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Clinton revives US law to fight Japanese trade curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Clinton last night signed an executive order resurrecting the
Super 301 provision of US trade law, which allows him to impose sanctions on
countries with unacceptable trade barriers.
The new Super 301 is largely aimed at Japan and comes in the wake of last
month's summit at which the US failed to persuade Tokyo to adopt measurable
targets on market-opening progress.
'This action will help us reach our objective: open markets that will create
better jobs and increase wages at home and abroad,' Mr Clinton said.
The US president telephoned Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime
minister, to warn him of the announcement. Mr Clinton, who has sought to
bolster Mr Hosokawa's reform efforts while putting him under pressure on
trade, described the phone call as a 'friendly, forthright discussion'.
'We are not looking to start a war, but we are looking to establish some
fairness,' Mr Clinton's spokeswoman Ms Dee Dee Myers said yesterday.
Unilateral US efforts are strongly resented by some of its trading partners
and yesterday foreign reaction to the re-imposition of Super 301 was sharp.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt), criticised US policy towards Japan as 'misguided and
dangerous'.
Mr Hideaki Kumano, Japan's vice-minister of international trade and
industry, said: 'Such a unilateral approach to solving trade disputes will
result in a shrinkage of world trade.' Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade minister,
said it was 'disappointing' the US had decided on this action.
The new 301, renewed for two years, sets a schedule that could give Japan
several more months to institute regulatory reforms before sanctions are
threatened.
It requires the administration to list countries it considers practise
unfair trade, and establishes a formal negotiating process of up to 18
months.
The process begins on March 31 with release of the national trade estimates
report detailing foreign trade barriers. On September 30, the trade
representative will identify 'priority foreign practices' - the most serious
trade barriers. Three weeks later he can institute Section 301 complaints
against those practices.
Cases covered by multilateral rules will be settled under Gatt. The rest
will be subject to US law - consultation, negotiation and sanctions, if
necessary. The six month period March 31 is considered an 'early warning
system'.
Mr Hosokawa pledged that his government would concentrate on the trade
dispute and the ailing domestic economy. A wrangle within his seven-party
coalition bodes ill for any solution to the Japan-US dispute because it
marks a reduction in the influence of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's
backroom strategist, who was playing an increasingly important role in
seeking a compromise with Washington.

FT  04 MAR 94 / PM holds out hope of more troops for Bosnia: United Nations
calls for near doubling of ground forces to protect fragile ceasefires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain yesterday held out the possibility that it might send more troops to
Bosnia after the United Nations called on the international community to
almost double its forces in the former Yugoslav province.
But amid signs of a cabinet split and fears of a backlash on the
Conservative backbenches, it rejected a request from General Sir Michael
Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, for immediate reinforcement of Britain's
2,500 troops.
Responding to the latest UN plea for an extra 10,650 soldiers to join the
13,000 already in Bosnia, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said British
help would be proportionate to and contingent on increased participation in
the peace effort.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, warned
that without the extra troops fragile ceasefires could collapse. Gen Rose
said his troops were operating 'on a wing and a prayer'.
The US is also coming under pressure to send ground troops to Bosnia.
General Jean Cot, head of the UN's peacekeeping forces in the former
Yugoslavia, said it was a 'strange and not very courageous idea' that the US
would consider sending troops only after a peace settlement was secured.
After discussion at the weekly cabinet meeting, Mr Major told British MPs:
'If a request is made to the UK, we would of course consider providing more
forces proportionately as part of a wider international effort.'
His comment reflected a view among some leading ministers that if the
situation in Bosnia continues to improve Britain would find it hard to
resist pressure for additional forces. Ministers said the new position in
Sarajevo has opened up the prospect of a new phase in the civil war in which
the UN would be required to police a number of regional settlements.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, is also under pressure from the
army chiefs of staff to meet Gen Rose's request for more troops. It is
understood that in spite of recent cuts in army numbers, a battalion of
about 900 soldiers could be sent to Bosnia at short notice.
But the latest request also opened up the prospect of a cabinet struggle
with those ministers who remain opposed to further British commitments to
Bosnia.
Gen Rose has told Mr Rifkind that he needs more British troops with
experience of Northern Ireland. But some senior ministers - said to include
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade secretary
 -have opposed greater British involvement on the ground.
During yesterday's discussions Mr Rifkind held back from a formal suggestion
of British reinforcement. Mr Major fears that a swathe of rightwing Tory MPs
might rebel if Britain increases its commitment. Mr Nicholas Budgen, a Tory
back bench opponent of further involvement, claimed growing support for his
view that the government risked a 'British Vietnam' in Bosnia.
The UN plea for more troops came amid talks between Bosnian Croats and
Moslems and Croat officials. They are due to meet in Vienna today for talks
on a federation for one part of Bosnia that will have an arrangement with
Croatia.
In an attempt to persuade Bosnia's Serbs to support these negotiations, Mr
Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, met Russian foreign ministry
officials.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Lords back EU on workers' rights: UK in breach of European
law on part-time employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's drive to create a flexible labour market suffered a
substantial setback yesterday when the House of Lords ruled that UK laws on
part-time workers' rights over redundancy pay and unfair dismissal are in
breach of European law.
The law lords' ruling may add significant costs for employers as the
government will be forced to give part-timers rights equal with those in
full-time employment.
The reaction of employers organisations to the Lords judgment was mixed. The
Confederation of British Industry said it believed most employers would be
'relaxed about the implications', while the Institute of Directors condemned
the likely changes as 'contrary to the interests of employers and employees
alike'.
The Association of British Chambers of Commerce, many of whose members are
from small companies, said it was 'disappointed' this had occurred at a time
when the UK was trying to build a flexible labour market.
The government suffered an equally severe blow when the Law Lords ruled at
the same time that those bringing challenges over the government's
implementation of European Union law should be able to use the High Court's
judicial review procedure rather than go to the European Court.
It is expected that that might significantly increase the number of
politically controversial cases brought by pressure groups.
The Law Lords ruled, by a majority of four to one, against the provisions of
the Employment Protection Act 1978, which restricts the rights of those
working less than 16 hours a week.
Under the Act, part-time workers are covered by unfair dismissal and
redundancy pay provisions only after completing five years continuous
employment. Full-time employees qualify for such entitlements after two
years.
The Equal Opportunities Commission, which brought the action against the
government, had claimed this breached European law intended to outlaw
discrimination in the workplace.
The government had maintained that the provisions struck a fair balance
between employers and employees. It also argued that employees working fewer
than 16 hours a week benefited since the lack of entitlements encouraged
employers to take on more part-time staff.
However, Lord Keith of Kinkel said the government had failed to prove that
the use of the 16-hour threshold had resulted in an increase in part-time
employment. He also noted that the Republic of Ireland was the only other EU
country to have similar thresholds.
The Lords ruled that the Act's provisions over redundancy pay breached
article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, while those over unfair dismissal
breached the Equal Pay Directive.
The government must now introduce legislation to conform UK law with that of
the EU. The Department of Employment said that would happen as soon as
possible. However, it seems unlikely that it will be passed without
ministers having to endure strong protests from right-wing and anti-European
Tory MPs.
Part-time work is the growth area in the UK labour market, involving about a
fifth of the 25m workforce.
Its advantages for employers include increased flexibility and cost saving -
any employee who works less than 15 hours per week, or earns less than
Pounds 56, does not have to be covered for National Insurance.
The EOC estimates the move will affect about 500,000 part-time staff now
working between eight and 16 hours a week. They will not formally enjoy the
same rights as full-time staff until legislation reaches the statute book.
Until then they will be able cite the law lords' judgment in industrial
tribunals.

FT  04 MAR 94 / S Times sends trade ban letter to Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times, which carried an article said to
have provoked the Malaysian government into curbing trade with British
companies, has sent a message to Kuala Lumpur that could help thaw
relations.
Mr Neil has sent the Malaysian government a copy of a letter signed by him,
which appears in today's Times, stating that his newspaper has 'no vendetta
against Malaysia or its prime minister', Dr Mahathir Mohamad.
Meanwhile, Baroness Chalker, minister for overseas development, confirmed
that she had opposed government funding for the Pergau Dam project.
She denied, however, that Britain's aid-and-trade policy was a breeding
ground for financial corruption as alleged in a report by Professor John
Toye, an adviser to the Overseas Development Agency, which was circulated to
the Commons foreign affairs committee. Her evidence before the committee
came as Lord Younger, former defence secretary, said he alone had taken the
decision to link an offer of aid to arms sales.
Malaysia's deputy prime minister, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, was reported earlier
this week as saying that the trade ban would not be lifted until The Sunday
Times apologised for alleging that Dr Mahathir took a bribe.
Mr Neil states in his letter: 'I regret . . . if subsequent misreporting of
a Sunday Times story has led the Malaysian prime minister to believe he has
been accused by us of a charge we did not make.'
He adds: 'In the light of this clarification, I hope he will conclude that
there are no grounds for a ban on British companies doing business with his
government.'
A copy of the letter has been sent to the Malaysian High Commissioner in
London with a request that it be immediately dispatched to his government in
Kuala Lumpur.
Sources close to the Malaysian government described the letter as a 'step in
the right direction', which while not enough to end the trade ban might help
restore relations.
They suggested the letter may not be unconnected with Mr Rupert Murdoch's
media ambitions in Malaysia. Mr Murdoch's News International owns the Sunday
Times.

FT  04 MAR 94 / Clinton steps up trade pressure on Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton last night signed an executive order resurrecting the
Super 301 provision of US trade law, which allows him to impose trade
sanctions on Japan.
Mr Clinton telephoned Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japanese prime minister, to warn
him of the move, which will intensify pressure on Japan to open its markets
to imports.
The president, who has sought to bolster Mr Hosokawa's reform efforts while
putting him under pressure on trade, described the phone call as a
'friendly, forthright discussion'.
The renewal of Super 301, which has been under consideration since the
failed Clinton-Hosokawa summit last month, requires the administration to
list countries it considers to have unfair trade practices, and establishes
a formal negotiating process of 12 to 18 months that may end in sanctions.
The US administration had sought to establish 'quantitative and qualitative
indicators' to measure Japan's progress in opening its markets. Mr Hosokawa
refused to agree to those, fearing such indicators would become commitments,
which might result in trade sanctions if the targets were not met.
In a speech for delivery in New York ahead of the expected announcement
yesterday, Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, criticised US trade policy towards Japan as 'misguided
and dangerous', accusing Washington of putting the multilateral trading
system at risk.
Mr Sutherland said that when any country stresses the bilateral approach
rather than 'the principles of the multilateral system, it runs the risk of
weakening that system and the improvements in it that have been so
painstakingly negotiated'.
Japanese leaders warned of the dangers they saw in invoking the Super 301
provision. Mr Hideaki Kumano, vice-minister of international trade and
industry, said: 'Such a unilateral approach to solving trade disputes will
result in a shrinkage of world trade,' adding that 'from the viewpoint of
Gatt rules, a revival could be problematic'. Japan has said it might lodge a
complaint with Gatt.
Mr Hosokawa pledged that his government would now concentrate on the trade
dispute and the ailing domestic economy. A wrangle within his seven-party
coalition over ministerial positions has eroded Mr Hosokawa's authority.
Although disagreements were set aside this week when he agreed to postpone a
cabinet reshuffle, the aftermath of the row bodes ill for any solution to
the Japan-US dispute, because it marks a reduction in the influence of Mr
Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom strategist, who had sought the
shake-up.
Mr Ozawa was playing an increasingly important behind-the-scenes diplomatic
role in seeking a compromise with Washington.
Only last week he proposed Japan should adopt 'non-binding indicators' for
reducing its current-account surplus, as a concession to US demands for
numerically measured reductions.

FT  04 MAR 94 / People: Cruickshank answers another call
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The pull of the private sector has proved irresistible for one of the
directors general of the government's new regulatory authorities overseeing
former nationalised industries.
Don Cruickshank, 51, has been director general of Oftel, the body watching
the telecommunications industry, on a salary in the region of Pounds 90,000,
for just under a year. He has now joined the board of Christian Salvesen,
the specialist hire and food services group, as a non-executive director. It
is his only such post, and might be worth about an extra Pounds 12,000 a
year.
None of the other DG's currently holds a non-executive post in the private
sector, though when he was at Ofgas Sir James McKinnon did.
His successor there, Claire Spottiswoode, is contractually free to follow in
his footsteps should she choose - as are all the DGs - but Spottiswoode is
understood to regard her formally part-time job as rather enough to handle
for the time being.
At Offer - the one dealing with electricity regulation - Stephen Littlechild
regards his duties as fully occupying; he has taken a sabbatical from his
professorial duties at the Birmingham School of Business Studies. Ofwat -
the water authority - is headed by Ian Byatt. He too sees his duties as
full-time and has no non-executive posts.
Ofsted - the office for standards in education - is a different kettle of
fish, being the body monitoring the new school inspection system. Its DG,
Stuart Sutherland, is due to depart for the vice-chancellorship of Edinburgh
University at the end of the year.
Appointed the first chief executive of the National Health Service in
Scotland between 1989-93, the Aberdonian Cruickshank's background is
wide-ranging.
First with Alcan, then an MBA at Manchester Business School, then to
McKinsey and thence to the Times newspaper before joining Pearson
Longman as finance director, in 1980. He joined the Virgin group in 1984
to prepare its flotation.

About 490 striking stevedores returned to work in Sydney yesterday, ending a
three-week walkout that had tied up millions of dollars worth of cargo,
Reuter reports from Sydney.
The dispute was settled after intervention by a government arbitrator who
ordered the company at the centre of the dispute to re-hire 55 sacked
workers.
A spokeswoman for Australian Stevedores, which handles over half the
container and conventional cargo moving through Sydney, said the backlog
should be cleared by Monday. A Maritime Union of Australia official said the
union was happy with the outcome.

today amid mutual recriminations between the central bank and the private
sector.
The outcome is seen as an important test of the military government's
capacity to implement the 1994 budget, delivered in January, and criticised
by the country's creditors as impractical.
The government has pegged its official exchange rate at N22 to the dollar
and banned all foreign exchange dealing outside its control, but the naira
has fallen on the black market to N52.
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has accused commercial banks of abusing
the new arrangements, while bankers and other private sector leaders say
that the CBN's allocation system is time-wasting and open to corruption.
The new system is meant to channel all the nation's hard currency via the
banks to the sectors which would most benefit the economy: half the foreign
exchange going to buy goods for manufacturers, 10 per cent to agriculture,
30 per cent for finished goods, and the remaining 10 per cent at the
discretion of the banks for invisibles.
After a 10 week gap with no foreign exchange on offer, demand for the first
allocation in late February exceeded the supply of Dollars 200m by almost
six times and the CBN delayed allocation by a week while it investigated the
top 26 banks for irregularities.
On Monday the central bank's spokesman accused all 26 banks of submitting
inflated or false demands or lending too much to their customers to fund the
bids, then pardoned them with a warning of a one-year ban for the next
transgression. Leading banks which have a reputation for strict compliance
and who were cleared by the inspectors last week angrily reject the
spokesman's accusations.
'For a long time the CBN made the best of a bad job,' said one international
banker. 'Now it appears that they don't even want banks to lend money.'
Other bankers believe that they are being made scapegoats for a system which
is bound to fail. 'The categories for applications are a matter of
interpretation and even after following the CBN's advice they still faulted
us. They are basically involved in window-dressing to disguise the real
flaws with the system,' said a senior Nigerian banker.

<TEXT>
In Vienna, news that agreement on joining the European Union had been struck
brought a sense of relief. Austria's negotiators, especially Mr Alois Mock,
the foreign minister, were afforded hero status in media coverage.
Nevertheless, the outcome of a referendum to approve membership, scheduled
for June, is far from certain. Until then, opponents - nationalists,
traditionalists, special interest groups, and most of the Greens - will look
for ammunition in the small print. They may yet be joined by the right-wing
Freedom party led by Mr Jorg Haider, who said he would not advise a Yes or
No vote until he had studied the deal.
The most sensitive issues remain lorry transit and agriculture, and the
government may feel it has won a better deal on both than it might have
expected.

FT  03 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share losses cut back sharply as
bonds rally - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dramatic turnround in the government bond market helped UK equities rally
strongly yesterday from a severe setback in early trading. The final hour of
trading saw London outperform a general recovery by markets in France and
Germany as some confidence was regained in the prospects for interest rate
cuts in Europe. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 22.5 down at 3,248.1, having
fallen to 3,195.7 at the height of the trading drama.
Bargain hunting by the institutions and short-covering by marketmakers
helped the share price rally in London which was also encouraged by a
steadier trend on Wall Street in early dealings. Although somewhat more
confident on European interest rate prospects, traders remained nervous of a
further tightening of credit policy by the US Federal Reserve.
Equity prices were hit hard at the beginning of the session when European
bond markets collapsed on news that German M3 money supply had soared by
more than 20 per cent in January - far above the worst of market forecasts
and a serious blow to interest rate hopes.
The Footsie plunged, driven down by widening discounts on stock index
futures. By mid-morning, the Footsie was nearly 75 points down. The surge in
German money supply was seen as threatening chances of a further cut in
rates by the Bundesbank, and raised fears that inflation may be on the march
again in Europe.
The market rallied when the Footsie 3,200 mark was pierced, but recovery was
very slight as London saw that the Standard &amp; Poor's futures contract was
signalling a weak start on Wall Street.
New York duly came in lower and extended its fall to around 50 Dow points in
early trading. But London appeared to have already disengaged itself from
the Dow average to some extent even before the US bond and equity markets
rallied. By the London close, when the Dow's drop had been cut to 22 points
following publication of economic data, and London bonds had staged their
powerful recovery, UK stocks looked surprisingly confident.
Stock index futures extended the recovery in later, unofficial, trading,
holding out the prospect of a firm opening in equities today.
The rally was focused on the blue chip stocks, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index
was left to languish at a closing level of 3,901.8, a loss of 42.8 on the
day.
Once again, trading volume, as measured by the Seaq network, was modest, at
763m shares compared with 720.8m on Tuesday. Selling pressure has not been
heavy in equities during the latest market setback, although some securities
houses are believed to have suffered heavy losses in gilt-edged securities.
There have been signs this week that the institutions have picked up cheap
stock in the equity market. Retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds
1.73bn on Tuesday, well at the higher end of daily averages.
James Capel, London's largest agency broker, repeated its view that equities
should be bought, drawing parallels with market experience in the 1980s and
pointing out that shares did well then in spite of rises in bond rates
because earnings recovered.
At Kleinwort Benson, Mr Albert Edwards said that, while London had much to
fear in the short term from further tightening by the US Federal Reserve
Board, it was still likely that rates would be reduced in Europe in order to
stimulate economic recovery.

FT  03 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Leisures active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leisure stocks were among the market's best performers as dealers pointed to
the recovery potential of the sector amid speculation of further cuts in UK
interest rates.
Forte, the sector's favourite blue chip, was firm all day, helped by good UK
tourism figures for 1993 and higher predictions for 1994.
There was also renewed speculation over the hotel group's intentions with
regard to the Savoy Group, in which Forte holds a majority stake but only
minority control. Rumours that Forte is willing to listen to offers for its
69 per cent stake in Savoy were dismissed by leisure analysts yesterday, who
pointed out that Forte had spent much time and effort edging towards gaining
control of the luxury chain.
They also said that, with Savoy in closed season, a move by Forte, which has
board representation, could have regulatory implications. However, the talk
did lead some observers to conclude that the long-running battle over Savoy
might be drawing to a close. Forte gained 5 at 264p, while Savoy 'A' fell 13
to 1050p.
Multimedia considerations were again cited as the power behind Thorn EMI, 10
higher at 1092p, and Carlton Communications, 6 ahead at 933p. US support was
said to have helped Rank Organisation rise 10 1/2 to 1081 1/2 p.
Ladbroke shares held firm before fading in late trading to end 2 1/2 off at
209p. Although a dividend cut with today's results announcement is widely
discounted, the overall trading picture is expected to be brighter.
A rumour that the group would report the sale of its Texas home improvement
chain, with Tesco one suggested buyer, found few supporters among food and
leisure analysts. Tesco steadied at 226 1/2 p.
The profits recovery in engineering group Vickers had been discounted and
the shares closed 9 lighter at 183p.
The company reported profits of Pounds 32.3m, against a previous loss of
Pounds 36.6m. Several brokers increased their current-year profits
estimates, including Strauss Turnbull which upgraded its forecast by Pounds
10m to Pounds 42m. NatWest Securities called the shares 'a fully valued
recovery play'.
Figures from GKN were also in line with market expectations and the shares
recovered from early weakness to finish just a penny down at 536p.
GKN signalled continued weakness in its European markets and that sentiment
hit Laird Group. The stock fell 17 1/2 to 387 1/2 p.
Reports that Vosper Thornycroft was in talks about acquiring the Swan Hunter
shipyard left the shares 3 cheaper at 798p. The Tyneside shipyard has been
in receivership since last May and a French shipbuilder indicated last month
that it planned to make an offer for it.
International mining group RTZ surrendered 21 to 846p, with Smith New Court
said to have advised investors to sell the stock.
Shares in Clayton Son (Holdings), which reported a past year's loss of
Pounds 1.068m, surged 14 to 127p after it announced an agreed bid for the
company.
CRH, the Irish-based building materials group and the first of the big
companies to report, succumbed to the general market malaise, the shares
sliding 9 to 374p. However, analysts said the group's profits were at the
very top end of market expectations, as was the dividend.
UBS was taking a positive view on the stores sector, emphasising those
retailers with large market shares particularly in sectors where there is
overcapapcity in supply markets. Among these, Boots slipped 5 to 527p and
Storehouse 3 to 233p.
The drinks sector bounced back from Tuesday's weakness. Boddington produced
good results and the shares steadied at 275p. Bass rose 6 to 524p and Grand
Metropolitan 13 1/2 to 481 1/2 p. Whitbread, however, suffered from
continued concern over the threat of imports by telephone from France,
sliding 11 to 543p.
Business services group BET relinquished 5 to 134p after Charterhouse Tilney
downgraded current-year profits expectations. The broker reduced its
forecast by Pounds 6m to Pounds 91m. Volume was 5.5m at the close.
Nervous trading in Cookson ahead of tomorrow's figures left the shares 7
lighter at 253p.
British Petroleum was the market's most heavily traded stock, the shares
slipping to 347p at one point amid talk of renewed selling from the US,
before stabilising and closing a net 6 1/2 off at 352 1/2 p; 12m shares
changed hands during the day.

FT  03 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Pressure on bank sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial sectors again took the brunt of the downside pressure in the
market as marketmakers responded to yet more scare stories that the big
clearing banks, investment banks and other financial institutions have had
to absorb heavy losses on market trading operations during the latest sharp
setback in bond and equity markets. However, dealers pointed out that these
sectors would also respond sharply to any return of confidence in
international markets.
The most damaging of the scare stories concerned one of the US investment
banks and was largely discounted around the trading desks, but there
remained lingering worries that plunging gilts and bonds have wrought havoc
at some of the big international trading firms.
The clearing banks, exposed to bond markets via treasury operations, took a
substantial hit shortly after the opening when marketmakers chopped prices
to head off any attempted selling in the wake of the German money supply
figures. Similarly, merchant banks and financial services stocks were given
a mauling as dealers pre-empted selling.
The latest slide on the Hong Kong market exacerbated the weakness in the two
Far Eastern-influenced banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered, the latter
closing a further 29 off at 1130p, after touching 1115p, and the former 24
cheaper at 844p, after 828p.
National Westminster Bank, whose shares plunged after the disappointing
dividend news last week, was in the forefront of the market rally, ending a
net 4 ahead at 489p, closely followed by Abbey National, a penny up on the
day at 490p.
Among the UK merchant banks, SG Warburg, one of the UK's largest biggest
bond and equity market dealing firms, dropped to 849p before finishing 34
down on balance at 854p.
Schroders non-voting shares, also viewed as a possible candidate to drop out
of the FT-SE 100 when the FT-SE Steering Committee meets next Wednesday,
gave up 40 to 1113p. Close Brothers dropped 35 to 455p but Kleinwort Benson
held up well to end only 5 cheaper at 550p. Smith New Court, the independent
securities house and London's biggest marketmaking firm, lost 8 to 402p.
Discount houses showed Gerrard &amp; National and Cater Allen down 30 apiece at
410p and 570p respectively. Commercial Union was the best of the composite
insurers, closing 3 firmer at 609p.

A recovery in the bond markets helped stock index futures to reverse an
earlier slide after the March FT-SE 100 contract crashed through the 3,200
support level, writes Joel Kibazo.
After a volatile session, the March contract closed at 3,227, having touched
a low for the day of 3,163 at an 11-point discount to the underlying cash
market. Turnover was high, reaching 35,441 contracts.
Dealers attributed the recovery to short-covering from independent (local)
traders and further gains in after-hours trading indicated that a strong
rally was likely to occur today.
Early in the session, March tumbled in hectic trading after European bond
markets fell sharply on higher than anticipated German money supply figures.
The FT-SE Mid 250 futures contract on the Liffe ended at 3,900 on volume of
36 lots and the same contract dealt on the OMLX finished at 3,902.5 on 58
lots traded.
The traded options sector was also busy and turnover rose to 67,008
contracts. Most of the activity was in the FT-SE 100 option, which saw
40,277 lots dealt.
BT was the busiest stock option with a total of 3,455 contracts transacted,
followed by Land Securities with 1,743. Barclays and Abbey National were
also active.

FT  03 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow sharply reverses early
plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
After plummeting more than 50 points at the opening following heavy losses
in overseas stocks and US bonds, share prices rallied impressively yesterday
to end firmly in positive territory, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22.51 at 3,831.74,
which represented a 76-point swing from its low of the day of 3,755.76. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion to end a
net 0.37 ahead at 464.81. The American SE composite, however, remained weak,
finishing 3.64 down at 466.32, while the Nasdaq composite ended 5.17 lower
at 783.47.
NYSE volume was heavy at 361m shares, while declines still outnumbered rises
at the close by 1,424 to 772.
Heavy overnight selling on foreign equity and bond markets, and early
declines in US bond prices in New York, set the stage for a sharply downbeat
opening to equity trading.
Within minutes the Dow was showing a double-digit loss, and it was not long
before the average had posted a 50-point decline, which triggered the NYSE's
'circuit breakers', which limit program trading.
The circuit breakers, however, and a sharp rebound in US bond prices (the
30-year bond recovered from a one-point decline to end slightly higher),
stemmed the tide of selling. By midday, stocks were rallying, aided by the
news that the US government will not immediately take punitive action
against the Japanese for failing to open up their markets to US goods and
services.
With demand for cyclical issues (many of them components of the Dow) surging
during the afternoon, the market eventually moved back into the black. Yet,
in spite of the Dow's rebound, the wider market remained weak, and
investors' mood sombre.
Bond and stock prices in the US and Europe have been falling because of
fears that signs of resurgent inflation in the US will prompt the Federal
Reserve to put up interest rates again. Yesterday's report from the Commerce
Department that wages and salaries rose by 1 per cent in January - double
the growth in the previous month - only fuelled investors' fears about
inflation.
Among individual sectors, financial stocks again took a beating because of
concern about rising interest rates. Bankers Trust was hardest hit, falling
Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 78 3/8 after the New York bank was forced to issue
a statement denying rumours that it had incurred huge losses on its
derivatives trading. JP Morgan, down Dollars 1 at Dollars 66 1/2 , was
another to suffer from speculation about trading losses.
Elsewhere in the sector, Citicorp slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 39 1/2 and
Nationsbank Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47 7/8 .
Car manufacturers led the market's recovery, Ford Motor rising Dollars 1 7/8
to Dollars 64 1/8 , General Motors Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 60 1/2 and
Chrysler Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 57 3/8 .
Other cyclicals on the rise included Alcoa, up Dollars 2 at Dollars 76 1/2 ,
Caterpillar, Dollars 3 higher at Dollars 112, General Electric, Dollars 1
ahead at Dollars 105 7/8 , and Union Carbide, Dollars  1/2 firmer at Dollars
24 1/2 .
Canada
Toronto stocks shook off much of their earlier rate-driven weakness in
afternoon action, but failed to match New York's resurgence and ended still
easier on the day.
The TSE-300 composite index closed 28.2 down at 4,362.2 after tumbling
almost 57 points early in the session. Falls finally led rises by 513 to 249
after volume of 63.8m shares.
Eleven of the 14 stock groups declined, led by the golds sector, off 2.50
per cent. However, the Comex gold bullion price finished only USDollars 0.50
easier at USDollars 378.90 after trading as low as USDollars 374.00 per
ounce.

Investors were discouraged by Tuesday's fall on Wall Street and the rise in
long-term interest rates following a plunge on the government bond market,
and the Nikkei 225 average lost 2.3 per cent on arbitrage selling, declining
for the first time in five days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 average dropped 471.85 to 19,744.77 on index-linked selling and
profit-taking by securities dealers. It opened at the day's high of
20,159.02 and hit its low of 19,724.27 just before the close.
Expectations of a bottoming out of the economy prompted a sell-off in the
bond market. The yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark gained 19 basis
points at 3.94 per cent, after briefly moving above the 4 per cent level in
the morning session for the first time since August 30 last year.
Some Japanese traders said that after their recent rise, share prices
'needed a breather'. Meanwhile, foreign investor buying orders failed to
counter arbitrage selling and profit-taking by institutional and corporate
investors.
Volume totalled 400m shares, down from Tuesday's 518m. Declines led rises by
823 to 234, with 131 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks fell 29.54, or 1.8 per cent, to 1,615.94, while the Nikkei 300
receded 6.18 to 298.07. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 15.82 to
1,318.73.
Retailers lost ground on profit-taking by dealers, who had been actively
buying the sector recently on hopes of a recovery in consumption.
Mitsukoshi, the department store, shed Y30 to Y930 and Daiei, the country's
largest supermarket chain, slipped Y50 to Y1,850.
Arbitrage selling depressed bank stocks. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y40
to Y3,290 and Bank of Tokyo Y50 to Y1,580.
High-technology issues, which have climbed recently on the multimedia theme,
declined. Hitachi dipped Y13 to Y944 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
plunged Y32,000 to Y947,000.
Alps Electric rose Y50 to Y1,490 on reports of a smaller than expected loss.
Hopes of an economic recovery supported machine tool shares, usually
beneficiaries of an increase in capital spending by corporations. Tsugami
gained Y20 at Y495 and Ikegai Y23 at Y415.
In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 279.47 at 22,044.49 in volume of
108.4m shares. The index declined for the first time in nine trading days,
but profit-taking ahead of the year-end book closing boosted trading volume.
Roundup
Interest rate worries preoccupied many of the Pacific Rim's markets.
HONG KONG made little immediate response to what was widely seen as a
favourable budget: instead it fell 2.7 per cent amid fears that local
interest rates will rise soon. The Hang Seng index was down 270.93 at
9,877.43, after a day's low of 9,819.76.
Bank and property counters were big losers, extending their slide to a
second day.
Sino Land tumbled 50 cents to HKDollars 8.90 after it paid record prices at
Tuesday's government land auction. Cheung Kong receded 75 cents to HKDollars
43 and Henderson Land 50 cents to HKDollars 46.25.
SINGAPORE was unnerved by the outlook for US long-term interest rates and
the Straits Times Industrial index fell 29.19 to 2,284.49.
Weakness in Sembawang Shipyard, 60 cents lower at SDollars 12.10 ahead of
its corporate results released after the market had closed, also dragged the
index down.
AUSTRALIA took its lead from the bond market and the All Ordinaries index
finished 27.7 lower at 2,154.0.
NEW ZEALAND closed sharply weaker, the NZSE-40 index falling 42.5, or 1.9
per cent, to 2,227.66 in moderate turnover of NZDollars 41.0m.
TAIWAN gave up early gains to end moderately lower after dull, gloomy trade.
The weighted index lost 23.07 at 5,429.37, after an initial rise to 5,497.
Turnover was modest at TDollars 48.21bn, after TDollars 52.96bn.
China Development, the most active stock, finished TDollars 3.50 stronger at
TDollars 120 after proposing a big TDollars 3.15 stock dividend for 1993.
This sparked an early surge in the overall financial sector but it soon ran
out of steam.
MANILA eased but finished off the day's lows, amid a return of selective
bargain hunting. The composite index slipped 55.90 to 2,699.75.
SEOUL ended lower in weak trading as investors, including institutions,
stayed on the sidelines. The composite index shed 12.22 to 906.66.
BOMBAY declined in dull trade as most buyers preferred to await for clearer
trends to emerge from the national budget presented earlier in the week. The
BSE 30-share index closed 81.50 off at 4,066.20.
KARACHI finished at a record high, continuing Tuesday's rally which was led
by institutions and funds encouraged by cuts in key interest rates. The KSE
100-share index rose 29.43 to 2,534.67. Gains led falls by 167 to 130.

FT  03 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent begins to recover
from sharp declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise in German January M3 data took the markets by surprise, although a
figure of around 13 per cent had been estimated by some economists, writes
Our Markets Staff.
The opinion among strategists yesterday regarding the fallout in equity
prices was that traders had made an instinctive and uninformed reaction to
the M3 figures based on the view that they suggested, at first glance, that
inflation was on the rise again in Europe.
However, Mr Richard Taylor of NatWest Securities said that the fundamental
picture remained unaltered: inflation was not a worry in Europe and interest
rates would continue to decline.
This view was repeated by Mr Sushil Wadhwani of Goldman Sachs who said that
while short term volatility might well continue, on a 12 to 18-month view
equities would continue to perform well.
Mr Anthony Thomas at Kleinwort Benson responded to present turmoil by
reducing exposure to France and Belgium, two interest rate-sensitive
markets, and increasing weightings in the more defensive and dollar
sensitive Switzerland and the Netherlands.
'We would accept that the domestic fundamentals remain positive, but would
not be in a hurry to buy as the upheavals in the US have some way to go,' he
said.
Mr Thomas remained very positive on Italy, as a political reform play, and
on Sweden and Finland, for their cyclical companies which are on attractive
ratings with good earnings visibility.
FRANKFURT was buffeted from the start as the market reacted nervously to the
M3 data and to overhanging worries that metal workers would vote to take
strike action today. The Dax index finished the official session down 46.72
at 2,020.33, but off a low of 1,992.70, while the March Dax futures
plummeted 58.5 to 2,004.5.
With Wall Street's opening, post-bourse activity was also frenetic, with a
further decline to the 2,000 level seen before a push upwards occurred in
the last hour on some encouraging US data, leaving a 2,018.68 close.
Turnover was DM8.2bn.
There were suggestions late yesterday that the Bundesbank could well make a
cut in interest rates at its regular council meeting today.
Among the day's fallers, Hoechst lost DM10.70 to DM292.50, Daimler DM16.50
to DM778.50, Deutsche Bank DM20.50 to DM781.00 and Dresdner Bank DM15.70 to
DM401.00.
Thyssen managed to resist the steep declines felt elsewhere, losing DM1 to
DM252, helped by news that the government had given the go ahead for the
Transrapid high-speed rail link between Hamburg and Berlin.
ZURICH saw further foreign selling which left the SMI index 80.8 lower at
2,766.6, for a cumulative fall of 5.6 per cent this week and 15.3 per cent
since the market peaked on January 31.
Mr Hans Kaufmann at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich noted that foreigner sellers
were picking up currency gains along with accumulated profits on shares that
they sold. He added that domestic institutions were beginning to return as
selective buyers as prices dipped.
Banks remained under pressure with UBS bearers down SFr38 to SFr1,262,
taking the cumulative loss since last Friday's results to SFr12.6 per cent.
CS Holding dipped SFr19 to SFr616 as investors awaited tomorrow's figures
from Credit Suisse and Swiss Volksbank.
Investors marked Roche certificates SFr250 to SFr6,650, registering
disappointment that the shares had not managed to hold above the SFr7,000
level on Tuesday. Among speculative issues, Motor Colombus shed SFr145 or
9.9 per cent to SFr1,400.
PARIS recovered some of its early falls as domestic institutions were seen
re-entering the market. The CAC-40 index, having been off some 4 per cent
during the session, picked up to close the day down 38.46 at 2,144.66.
Turnover was FFr8bn.
Investors were watching UAP, soon to be privatised, the shares slipping
FFr5.80 to FFr186.70. The government said that privatisation would not be
affected by the recent volatility in the markets.
Among other newly privatised companies, Rhone-Poulenc lost FFr4.50 to
FFr133.20, after a low of FFr128.30, Elf Aquitaine FFr5.90 to FFr400.60 and
BNP 80 centimes to FFr263.20.
AMSTERDAM's losses accelerated during the day, the AEX index closing down
8.67 at 407.27.
Philips fell Fl 1.50 or more than 3 per cent to Fl 46.00 ahead of today's
results, while DSM dropped Fl 3.10 to FL 107.60, also with results pending
today. Akzo Nobel slipped Fl 7.00 to Fl 203.60.
BolsWessanen shed Fl 1.10 to Fl 42.20 after reporting a 26 per cent decline
in 1993 profits.
MILAN picked up from its lowest levels leaving the Comit index to finish
9.89 lower at 639.35.
BCI held its loss to just L9 at L6,017 in response to news last on Tuesday
that its sell-out privatisation had closed three days early. But Ambrovento
fell L206 or 4.2 per cent to L4,713 in a correction after recent strong
gains which followed its 1993 figures.
Domestic selling of some of the traditionally foreign favourites left
Olivetti L43 at L2,290 and Sip L90 down at L3,957. Fiat dipped L59 to
L4,633, helped by rumours that sales figures for its new Punto model were
positive.
MADRID picked up from intraday lows which left the general index down 7.52
at 325.16. Telefonica lost Pta55 or 2.9 per cent to Pta1,835 as investors
continued to look unvarourably on its Dollars 2bn foreign venture in Peru.

FT  03 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: India may get a lift from the budget
package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indian equities remained static yesterday, as they have since the release of
the budget earlier this week, while investors review the situation. However,
a bullish assessment of the package has already come from Mr Nigel Spence of
Lehman Brothers in London, writes John Pitt.
His reading of the proposals are that it is a boost for industry. A cut in
interest rates by 1 percentage point to 14 per cent will assist the many
highly indebted companies, while the reduction in corporation tax from 52
per cent to 46 per cent will be good for the blue chip companies and
multinationals, says Mr Spence. He does not see the increase in the budget
deficit being a problem, and is not worried about the potential risk of
rising inflation. He forecasts a move substantially higher in the short
term.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar was again under pressure in foreign exchange markets yesterday as
turmoil in financial markets dampened sentiment towards the US currency,
writes Philip Gawith.
The immediate cause of the dollar's woes was news that German M3 had grown
by 20.6 per cent in January, which quashed hopes of an early monetary
easing.
The D-Mark rose against the dollar and European currencies after this news,
but later fell back on profit-taking. It closed in London at DM1.7037 per
dollar, from DM1.7090 on Tuesday. The dollar was also weaker against the
yen, ending at Y103.670 from Y104.615. In New York it finished trading at
DM1.7050 and Y104.20.
The pattern of recent trading continued, with currency markets in a residual
role reflecting the panicky behaviour in equity and bond markets, rather
than moving in response to any fundamental factors.
Although the Bundesbank had been assiduous in its efforts to discount a poor
M3 number, the market was unprepared for the shock of 20.6 per cent - way
above the 4 to 6 per cent target range for 1994 M3 money supply growth. Mr
Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, commented: 'Even allowing for
distortions, there is no doubt that the money supply figure was a shocker.'
This was reflected in the three-month D-Mark interest rate futures on the
Liffe. The December contract dropped 14 points at one stage, although it
later recouped most of this fall.
London traders said US hedge funds continued to be responsible for most of
the selling pressure, which was emerging in the futures markets, rather than
pension funds and corporate customers.
Ms Alison Cottrell, senior international economist at Midland Global
Markets, downplayed the M3 figure, which she described as 'laughable'. She
said the Bundesbank would not have eased the repo rate on Tuesday if it had
been concerned by the figure.
The Midland analyst said the M3 number had merely hastened the market in the
direction it was anyway moving. In this regard the US purchasing managers
index on Tuesday had been more influential. 'It was just the market looking
for another cliff to jump off,' said Ms Cottrell.
She predicted that the Bundesbank council, which meets today, would be
unlikely to cut interest rates. The problem it faces is that a policy easing
that cheers financial markets would almost certainly come at the expense of
its own reputation and the health of the bund market.
The D-Mark was stronger against most European currencies. It finished at
L990.2 against the Italian lira, from L989.8. Compared with the French franc
it closed at FFr3.408 from FFr3.403.
Dollar/yen continued to be influenced more by the politics of the US-Japan
trade dispute than the chaos elsewhere in financial markets. The past few
days have seen US officials again taking a more combative line against
Japan.
The Bank of Japan was again reported buying dollars to arrest the progress
of the yen, assisted apparently by the insurance arm of the Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications.
Analysts said yesterday that the dollar was victim of a fundamental
reassessment under way of the outlook for interest rates. Mr Steve Hannah,
head of research at IBJ International, commented: 'The recent policy moves
of the Fed and Bundesbank have alerted us that we had pushed markets up to
far. The markets most at risk are those where people were most optimistic at
the beginning of the year.'
Sterling recovered from an early loss against the D-Mark and finished at
DM2.5475, up from DM2.5395 on Tuesday. Yesterday saw the monthly monetary
meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie
George, governor of the Bank of England. Last month the meeting heralded a
25 basis-point cut in UK interest rates the following week.
The Treasury in its monthly report prepared for the meeting described the
latest monthly indicators as 'mixed but consistent with a trend of
continuing recovery'. Analysts said the Treasury appeared to be talking up
the UK recovery as the report downplayed some recent figures that hinted at
economic weakness.
Although this stance would be inconsistent with an easing of policy, last
month's report was also bullish. Following the controversy which accompanied
the last cut, however, the Bank was expected to proceed cautiously. Room for
manoeuvre will also have been diminished by developments in Germany which
have lessened the prospect there of an early lowering of rates.
After forecasting a fairly large shortage of Pounds 1.95bn in UK money
markets yesterday, the Bank of England dealt with most of this in its early
round when it put Pounds 1.6bn liquidity into the market. Liquidity
conditions were therefore much easier than on Tuesday, when overnight rates
rose as high as 20 per cent. In further operations the Bank injected Pounds
309m into the market.

Members of the International Bauxite Association have agreed to continue the
producers' group, despite mounting financial problems because of the failure
of some to meet their obligations.
The association, which has its headquarters in Jamaica, has been forced to
scale down its operations and cut back its staff over the past two years
because of the withdrawal of Australia, the world's largest producer, and
the increasing delinquency by some members.
A recent meeting of officials from most of the nine member countries agreed
not to phase out the IBA, concluding that the aims of the organisation were
still relevant, said Mr Robert Pickersgill, Jamaica's mining minister. The
delinquent members have agreed to settle all arrears.
The IBA was established 20 years ago and has been acting as a data bank for
its members, allowing them to exchange information and ideas on the state of
the industry. Members once accounted for about 85 per cent of the western
world's bauxite production, while contributing 54 per cent of alumina
(aluminium oxide) production and 18 per cent of primary aluminium output.
The association lists its members as Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, India,
Indonesia, Jamaica, Sierra Leone, Surinam, and Yugoslavia. Mr Nenad Altman,
the secretary general, said recently that membership was open to the states
of former Yugoslavia.

FT  03 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee prices reverse early gains
 -Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE futures prices eased in late trading at the London Commodity Exchange
yesterday after putting in a strong performance in the morning.
As the market digested news that Brazilian producers had presented a plan to
retain 817,000 bags (60kg each) the May delivery price climbed to Dollars
1,232 a tonne. But the rally ran out of steam with traders generally
adopting a more cautious attitude on the Brazilian news, and a weaker New
York market setting the tone in the afternoon.
By the close the May price was at Dollars 1,210 a tonne, down Dollars 11 on
balance, and traders said there was room for further weakness.
The COCOA market had a featureless day, the main activity again being cross
trading between March and May futures positions. The May price ended Pounds
6 down at Pounds 911 a tonne, but most traders remained confident the
support at Pounds 900 would not be breached.
At the London Metal Exchange the COPPER market stood firm in the face of the
aluminium price tumble. An early test of support below Dollars 1,870 a tonne
for three months delivery quickly found underlying buying interest and the
price ended at at Dollars 1,875 a tonne, a gain of Dollars 3 on the day.
LEAD and ZINC prices continued to come under pressure with prices drifting
dangerously close to support levels of Dollars 460 and Dollars 950 a tonne
respectively. NICKEL slipped to a low of Dollars 5,650 on trade and general
liquidation before finding support.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US fishermen to protest against
French embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US-French row is simmering over US complaints that French health
inspectors are deliberately holding up imports of fresh and frozen US fish.
There have been reports this week that the French are close to at least
partially lifting a virtual embargo against US fish. But the US
administration, which filed an official protest last week, is expected to
reject any compromise.
US fishermen are expected to stage a protest today outside the French
embassy in Washington if no solution has been found.
Congressman Gerry Studds, chairman of the House Committee on Merchant Marine
and Fisheries, says American fisherman, trying to sell fish 'under-utilised'
in the US market - including dogfish, skate and mackerel - in France, last
month suddenly found their products refused entry and left to rot in airport
warehouses.
According to Mr Studds, the French government has never made any claim that
rejection of the fish was based on legitimate health concerns, but publicly
admitted during the February 23 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
council meeting that the actions were a 'highly temporary' solution to
address strikes and violent protests by French fisherman about cheap
imports.
'It is clear that your government's actions are an attempt to placate your
fishermen at the expense of American fishermen and exports,' he has told the
French.
He says the US is considering retaliation. The US annual exports about
Dollars 200m worth of fish and fish products to France, while the French
exports about Dollars 360m worth to the US.
Congressman Studds says the French have 'flagrantly' refused to honour
international agreements to conserve bluefin tuna. For this alone, their
seafood imports into the US can be embargoed.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana fungicide poisoning
Ecuadorean shrimps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Ecuadorean shrimp industry faces multi-million dollar losses for the
second year in a row as a water pollution problem continues to hit
production.
In 1993 the industry suffered a Dollars 70m loss as toxic waste polluted the
shrimp farms' water supply and cut production by about 16 per cent from the
previous year's level.
Recent studies have established that the toxic substances originate from
nearby banana plantations, where fungicides are used to control the black
sigatoka disease. Washed into rivers and the Gulf of Guayaquil by rain
water, the toxins enter the shrimp cultivating pools, deforming and
ultimately killing the larvae.
Shrimp farmers insist that the shrimps that are being exported pose no
health threat to consumers as the level of toxicity being encountered is too
minute to affect humans.
The so-called Taura syndrome, named after the area in Ecuador where it first
appeared, has been spreading steadily since it was first discovered in late
1992. It puts at loggerheads the country's two largest non-petroleum export
earners. While banana industry officials claim they have no alternative but
to use the commercially available pesticides, shrimp farmers argue that the
enormous quantity of toxins are endangering the entire eco-system, not only
the shrimp industry.
Says Mr Harold Muller of the National Aquaculture Association: 'Shrimp are a
type of bio-indicator. If they cannot survive in a given environment, you'd
know something is wrong with the ecological balance'.
Indeed, the outbreak of the Taura Syndrome puts an end to the image of
Ecuador being a haven for shrimp-growing because of its pristine waters.
Taiwanese shrimp farmers who flocked to Ecuador to escape polluted waters in
their country are now worrying whether the pollution will reach their shrimp
farms in the southern region of the country's Pacific coast.
According to Mr Muller, the principal toxins responsible for the deaths of
larvae are the fungicides propiconazole (Tilt) and tridemorph (Calixin).
He says the banana growers are combating a disease that won't go away, while
the effect of their fumigation is killing millions of dollars worth of
shrimp. Neither of the fungicides is able to eliminate the sigatoka disease.
They are only effective in preventing its spread.
Representatives of the Dollars 500m shrimp industry are calling for a
complete moratorium on the use of the fungicide and for a government
evaluation of the alternatives to its use. According to the president of the
National Acuaculture Association, Alex Aguayo, the government ought to study
the feasibility of introducing other types of banana trees that are more
resistant to the sigatoka disease, thereby reducing the need for fumigation.
In a seminar sponsored by one of the chemical companies producing the
controversial toxins, leading marine biologists from around the world
recommended to the Ecuadorean government a moratorium on the use of
fungicides in the Guayas river basin. The government has formed a
multi-sector commission to develop a strategy in response to the phenomena,
which is unique to Ecuador.
But shrimp farmers say action is needed now. They claim their survival is at
stake, not only because of the Taura syndrome, but because of the rising
production costs caused by movements of the national currency, the sucre. In
the last 16 months costs have risen by 70 per cent while the Sucre sales
price has remained stable.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium prices slide as
Ottawa talks disappoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium prices tumbled yesterday as sentiment was affected by two factors:
nervousness about the steep drop in bond and share prices and disappointment
among some traders over the outcome of international trade talks in Ottawa
about measures to bring supply and demand back into balance.
Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, the Noranda subsidiary, said that
it was unusual for disturbances in share and bond markets to spill over to
metals but yesterday it was obvious some investment trusts had decided to
take profits on metals while they could.
Meanwhile, the two-day Ottawa meeting merely approved proposals drafted last
month in Brussels and Ms Karen Norton, researcher at Billiton-Enthoven
Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, suggested the aluminium market
had also wanted to see more substantial ideas about how the Russian industry
would meet its proposed target of cutting production by 500,000 tonnes and
how these cuts would be monitored.
Aluminium for delivery in three months closed on the LME last night at
Dollars 1,272.75 a tonne, down Dollars 33.75. Both analysts suggested that
there was important technical support for the price at Dollars 1,260 a tonne
but if it breached that level the next support was at about Dollars 1,235.
Ms Norton said the price might stabilise, however, waiting for the
announcement of more production cuts. So far western producers have cut
about 850,000 tonnes of annual production but the has industry agreed that
global cuts of between 1.5m and 2m tonnes are needed to bring the market
back into balance.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold joins in general decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold, often seen as a haven in times of turmoil in financial markets, failed
to live up to this reputation yesterday. As stock and bond prices went into
free fall on world markets, gold also lost ground, closing in London at
Dollars 375.75 a troy ounce, down Dollars 5.55.
However, Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, pointed
out that governments were still determined to keep inflation under control
and would consider increasing interest rates to do so. 'Higher interest
rates are not good for a non-interest earning asset like gold,' he said.
'People are holding cash in the expectation that interest rates will rise.'
Mr Smith said that if gold could hold above the technical support level of
Dollars 376 an ounce for a few more days it could move up again. He warned,
however, that the investment funds that last year made profits by chasing up
the price of gold might start to push the price down if they thought the
time was ripe.
Market sentiment was also affected by increased hopes that there would be no
violent conflict during the elections in April in South Africa, the world's
biggest gold producer.
Dealers said trading was thin and demand weak. 'Gold was being tugged about
by other precious metals,' said one. Silver's price closed in London down by
12 US cents an ounce at Dollars 5.245 while platinum fell by Dollars 6.25 an
ounce to Dollars 386.50.
Platinum was also affected by Engelhard, the US precious metals group,
announcing that Ford Motor would soon begin limited use of its all-palladium
automotive catalyst. These catalysts are the biggest consumers of platinum.
The market has been aware of the all-palladium catalyst for some time and
this has helped the palladium price move up from Dollars 80 an ounce last
November to Dollars 135.

<TEXT>
Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest publicly quoted company, announced yesterday
that it was seeking government approval to develop a thin oil zone in the
south-west part of the Troll West gas province in the Norwegian North Sea.
It said the plan, which is in addition to the approved development of the
NKr7.4bn (Pounds 670m) Troll West oil province, comprises a NKr1.4bn
four-well subsea development scheme, which is to be tied back to the Troll B
platform.
The company aims to bring the 12-14m thick oil zone on stream in October
1996, nine months after start of production from Troll West.
Hydro said that to accommodate the additional oil production from the gas
province, export capacity on the Troll B platform would be increased to
30,000 standard cubic metres from 25,000.
Recoverable reserves of the potential new development are estimated at 6.8m
standard cu m of oil and 8.5bn cu m of gas.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: European prices rebound after opening
sharply lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds opened sharply lower following the overnight
sell-off in US Treasuries and plunged further on shocking German M3 money
supply numbers.
However, prices rebounded towards the close on heavy short-covering in the
futures pits and speculation that the Bundesbank, whose council meets today,
may lower interest rates.
While those hopes were partly dampened by comments from Mr Guntram Palm, a
member of the central bank council, who described the M3 figures as
'alarming' and said he saw no room now for a further reduction in official
rates, many traders said this did not exclude the possibility of fixed-rate
repos at a significantly lower rate next week.
Long-term investors remained sidelined, ceding the stage to short-term
traders. Dealers also reported more selling by highly leveraged players,
including US hedge funds.
'This price action is scaring the hell out of investors - volatilities have
risen so much no one wants to get involved,' said Mr Karl Haeling, head of
the futures and options group at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. 'The market is
moving on pure emotion, pure psychology. The sell-off won't end on anything
logical, but simply when the last seller sells.'
Many futures exchanges across Europe registered new record volumes
yesterday, and as a result of extreme volatility several of them called for
extra margins on certain futures contracts during the day.
While a double-digit German M3 number had been expected, the publication of
a 20.6 per cent annualised growth rate for January triggered another sharp
bout of selling on fears that the data would further delay the Bundesbank's
already slow pace of easing.
German bunds fell by more than two points after the release, dragging the
rest of Europe down with them. Prices were further pressured by the Mr
Palm's comments and disappointing results of the Treuhandanstalt's latest
10-year auction, which saw virtually no retail demand.
However, the late short-squeeze helped bund futures recoup most of their
losses. The March bund future stood at 95.51 in late London trading, down
0.62 point on the day but well above its 93.80 day low.
French bonds tumbled in line with bunds and were pounded by more foreign
selling. Prospects of FFr18bn to FFr20bn of today's new 10 and 25-year
supply also weighed on the market.
However, rumours that the Bank of France had bought OATs via inter-dealer
brokers helped calm the hectic market, and some observers were confident
today's OAT auction should go smoothly. 'There may be better demand than
expected,' said Mr Steve Major, European economist at Credit Lyonnais in
Paris.
The notional OAT contract on Matif fell by 1.36 points to 124.38 on the day,
but crept higher to 124.96 in late London trading on Globex.
UK gilts slid in line with other European markets, despite an early offer
from the Bank of England to buy cash bonds from market-makers. 'The Bank
came in early, offering to take paper off distressed market-markers' hands,'
said a senior gilt dealer.
While he felt the offer was not heavily taken up, another trader said the
Bank had been 'a very aggressive buyer'. The Bank declined to comment on
rumours of its market-smoothing intervention.
Gilts also staged a late recovery, with the June long gilt future closing
1/32 point higher on the day at 110 31/32 , off its 109 7/32 low.
Japanese bonds were whipped around by jitters surrounding the auction of
Y1,200bn of 10-year bonds. The market sold off ahead of the auction as
participants feared a lack of demand for the paper.
However, results showing better than expected support for the auction
prompted a small recovery, said Mr Adam Chester, international bond
strategist with Yamaichi International.
The JGB future rose by 0.70 points to 110.50 in London, from a Tokyo close
of 109.65.
After heavy overnight selling in Tokyo and London had prompted big early
declines in New York, longer-dated US Treasury prices rallied strongly
yesterday to stand little changed in late trading.
By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year bond was down only  1/16 at 93 3/16
, yielding 6.782 per cent. Earlier in the day, the bond had been almost a
full point lower. There was little movement in prices at the short end of
the maturity range throughout, with the two-year note up 1/32 at 99,
yielding 4.774 per cent.
Traders said the downward momentum from overseas markets, where investors
had sold US bonds heavily overnight, spilled over into New York trading at
the opening. The selling of the past few days had been inspired by fears
that the Fed, which raised interest rates a month ago, would tighten
monetary policy again to prevent the rapid expansion in the economy from
reigniting inflation.
Concern about inflation has been rising recently because several indicators
have suggested prices may be heading upward. Yesterday, the Commerce
Department reported a 1.0 per cent increase in wages and salaries during
January, which was double the growth rate of the previous month and a
worrying sign that wage inflation may be picking up alongside the
fast-growing economy.
The wages data, plus the overnight declines, pushed longer-dated prices
sharply lower from the start. But the selling in New York was not as
pronounced as in overseas markets, and with a lack of buyers, rather than an
abundance of sellers, being the main problem, prices quickly bottomed out.
By midday the 30-year bond had halved its losses and by late afternoon had
edged close to opening values.

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Biggest ever intra-day margin
call from LCH
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Clearing House, which clears London's four futures exchanges,
yesterday made a record intra-day margin call, reflecting sharp movements in
contract prices.
The LCH made margin calls totalling almost Pounds 500m on members holding
long positions in bund, Bobl, BTP long gilt and FT-SE 100 contracts, when
initial margin limits were breached. It also increased margin rates on bund,
BTP and FTSE futures and options, and some stock options, effective March 7.
Margins act as deposits on futures contracts and are returned when positions
are closed.

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Ontario Hydro prices CDollars 1bn
global floating-rate note issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The volatile conditions in many government bond markets yesterday kept
borrowers away from the international bond market, with only a handful of
new issues launched amid the general turmoil.
Ontario Hydro, the largest electricity utility in Canada, went ahead with
the pricing of its already-publicised issue - a CDollars 1bn global
floating-rate note with a five-year maturity.
The coupon will be set at the same rate as that available on three-month
Canadian dollar bankers acceptances (which are currently trading at around
4.15 per cent).
The notes were priced at 99.64 to give a yield of 8 basis points above the
rate on bankers acceptances.
The joint book runners have heralded the deal as the first substantial FRN
offering in Canadian dollars.
They said the pricing was based on 'general market perceptions,' as well as
by looking at the recent US dollar FRN issue which was launched by the
Province of Ontario at the end of January.
That deal, which had a 5 1/2 -year maturity, was launched with a yield of
three-month Libor plus 8 basis points and tightened to a yield of Libor plus
7 basis points.
Ontario Hydro has an Aa2/AA - credit rating and has an expected borrowing
requirement of between CDollars 2bn and CDollars 3.8bn per annum over the
next three years.
Syndicate officials said that demand came mainly from North America,
continental Europe, and to a lesser extent from the Middle East.
They said that investors in the issue were looking for exposure to the
Canadian dollar and were expecting to see Canadian interest rates to move in
tandem with those in the US.
Burns Philp, the Australian food group, yesterday tapped the equity-linked
sector with the launch of a Dollars 125m convertible bond issue.
The deal has a 10-year maturity with an indicated coupon of between 5 and
5.5 per cent. The bond proceeds will be used to help finance the recent
DM182m acquisition by the company of Karl Ostmann, the German herbs and
spices producer, and for general corporate purposes.
Standard &amp; Poor's has lowered the senior debt rating of Lasmo to triple-B
from A - , and Enterprise Oil to A - from A, writes Tracy Corrigan. Both
companies were placed on CreditWatch with negative implications in January.
The moves reflect the companies' exposure to weakening oil prices, the
rating agency said, as their cashflows are very sensitive to crude oil
prices.

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Japan takes step-by-step
approach to deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's ministry of finance yesterday outlined the schedule under which the
country's nine city, or commercial, banks' subsidiaries will enter the
securities industry.
The announcement is part of the MoF's blueprint for the 'gradual' lowering
of the barriers between the banking and securities industries and comes
almost a year after it opened the door to Japan's three long-term credit
banks, Norinchukin Bank, the central agricultural bank, and trust banks to
set up securities units.
The step-by-step approach has been taken in response to fierce opposition by
Japan's brokers, which are still recovering after the plunge in the Tokyo
stock market in 1990 and a spate of securities scandals. The ministry has
also limited operations by securities units to underwriting, dealing and
broking corporate and government bonds, and underwriting equity-linked
bonds.
The deregulation comes while banks are still suffering the effects of bad
loans made during the late 1980s. Of the 11 institutions permitted to enter
the securities industry last year, only Industrial Bank of Japan, Long-Term
Credit Bank, Norinchukin, and two trust banks have set up subsidiaries.
The MoF said the city banks would be allowed to establish securities units
in July, November and March 1995, in an 'orderly manner to avoid confusion'.
Asahi Bank is expected to set up new operations in July, followed by six
leading city banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Sakura
Bank, Sanwa Bank, and Sumitomo Bank, in November.

Research shares

<TEXT>
Shares in AST Research, the fifth largest US manufacturer of personal
computers, dropped sharply yesterday when the company confirmed Wall Street
concerns about slower than expected sales growth in the current quarter. AST
shares lost Dollars 5 1/4 to close at Dollars 23 1/2 yesterday, following a
9 per cent drop on Tuesday.
AST is one of the fastest growing companies in the PC industry. For the
fiscal year ended July 3 1993, it lost Dollars 1.72 a share, or Dollars
53.8m, on sales of Dollars 1.41bn. The loss reflected a Dollars 125m pre tax
restructuring charge related to the company's acquisition of Tandy's PC
manufacturing operations in July 1993.
For the first half of 1993-94 AST reported net income of Dollars 26.2m, or
79 cents per share, on revenues of Dollars 1.2bn. Two brokers lowered their
ratings on AST after it said February sales were strong but below
projections. Sales growth in US 'value added' reseller channels - third
parties that sell AST computers with added software or services - grew about
60 per cent over the same month last year rather than 70 per cent as
expected.

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Incentives help lift orders at
Peugeot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French government and industry measures to stimulate the depressed car
market have prompted a sharp increase in orders, according to Mr Jacques
Calvet, chairman of PSA Peugeot Citroen.
He said that last month's measures, which included a payment from the
government of FFr5,000 (Dollars 861) for car owners who trade in vehicles
more than 10 years old to buy a new one and which were matched by incentive
schemes by the car companies.
This resulted in almost 50,000 extra orders in the French market. Total
orders for the month were about 200,000.
'It seems there was a strong effect,' said Mr Calvet. But he warned that the
increase could be temporary as consumers may have hurried to take advantage
of the schemes.
The company has not revised its forecast made at the start of the year of a
7 per cent increase in total car sales in the French market to 1.85m, as it
had anticipated stimulatory measures.
Mr Calvet also repeated his claim that Renault, Peugeot-Citroen's
state-owned rival, should repay about FFr8bn to the government following the
failure of its merger with Volvo of Sweden.
He said that the creation of the industrial alliance between the two groups
and the decision to unwind their cross-shareholdings could have increased
Renault's capital, and this should be reimbursed.
Renault said that any increase in capital had come from Volvo, not the
French state.
Peugeot was continuing to cut costs and increase productivity, said Mr
Calvet. The company plans to cut about 7,000 jobs this year, from a total
workforce of 143,900. Productivity, which rose 12 per cent last year, is
targeted to increase by a similar amount in 1994.
Mr Calvet described BMW's acquisition of Rover of the UK as 'a courageous
and intelligent move, but with risks'.

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Futures volume rises sharply
in February
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volume on the world's leading financial futures exchanges jumped during
February, reflecting the rush by banks and hedge fund managers to stem
losses in a turbulent world interest rate and foreign currency environment.
Volume in exchange-traded interest rate derivatives soared, with action in
Paris's Notional bond future more than double February 1993, and up 61 per
cent on an active January, at 5.9m contracts.
Liffe saw volume in its bund futures contract rise 53 per cent over January
and 264 per cent over last February to 4.38m contracts, while action in
Chicago's US Treasury bond futures pit was up 30 per cent from last February
and up 15.7 per cent from January at 8.4m contracts.
Chicago's Eurodollar futures, used for short-term interest rate hedging
around the world, traded 9.3m contracts in February, up 43 per cent from
January, and nearly double last February.
Interest rate options trading activity at all exchanges also soared. Foreign
currency futures, available only in Chicago, had volume gains of 8 per cent
over January, at 2.8m contracts.
Even within the derivatives industry, where volumes double every five to
eight years, exchange turnover during January and February has been
remarkable. Traders say the sharp rise in exchange business correlates with
worldwide financial volatility and heavy trading in underlying cash markets.
There was little evidence that fund managers and banks were liquidating
derivatives positions as part of February's heavy turnover. The number of
open positions in Matif's Notional future were up 41.4 per cent over
January, positions in London's bund futures contract rose 60 per cent from
January to February, but there was little change in the number of open
positions Chicago's Eurodollar or US Treasury bond futures.

<TEXT>
Woodside Petroleum, the Australian offshore gas producer, returned to
profits in 1993 but warned that the slump in oil prices late last year would
have a significant effect in 1994, writes Nikki Tait.
The company announced this week that it is laying off around 430 employees
in an attempt to cut annual operating costs by around ADollars 70m
(USDollars 50m).
The energy group made a net profit of ADollars 102.9m last year, compared
with a loss of ADollars 22.6m in 1992. The improvement was partly due to a
ADollars 20.6m abnormal surplus in 1993, compared with a charge of ADollars
85.8m in 1992.
Operating profit before abnormal items and tax improved from ADollars 111.5m
to ADollars 134.8m.

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Boral announces rights issue
after 19% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boral, the Australian building materials group which last year paid ADollars
830m (USDollars 593m) to acquire the Sagasco energy business, yesterday
combined news of a 19.5 per cent increase in first-half profits, before tax
and abnormals, with the announcement of a one-for-10 rights issue to raise
ADollars 353.7m.
Both elements reflected a significant restructuring. The company saw a
fairly strong operating performance in the six months to end-December, with
sales revenues increasing by 10.9 per cent to ADollars 2.32bn, and operating
profits rising to ADollars 213.3m from ADollars 178.5m.
Sagasco was included for two months, adding ADollars 10.1m at the operating
level, while Azon - Boral's former manufacturing division which was floated
off in November - made a five-month contribution of ADollars 17.4m.
Geographically, the improvement came from the core Australian business, with
North American operating profits dipping to ADollars 1.64m from ADollars
8.09m, and Europe's to ADollars 6.06m from ADollars 8.44m.
However, Boral also took a ADollars 265.6m abnormal charge in the first half
to cover a range of write-offs, rationalisation and restructuring moves. The
largest goodwill write-off applied to the US operations, where Boral says it
is looking to become 'more focused'. Goodwill was written off in the
resource and clay roof tile operations in Southern California, and a large
portion of the resource and clay brick assets will be sold.
Smaller amounts of goodwill were written off in Australia, and there were
also some large rationalisation provisions there - including one to cover
the expected loss on the sale of Boral's collieries business, acquired in
1987 with Blue Circle Southern Cement. The group's total abnormal charge was
then offset by the ADollars 121.2m surplus on the Azon sale, leaving a net
charge against profits of ADollars 162.2m.
This meant that profit after tax and abnormals fell to ADollars 4.61m in the
first half, compared with ADollars 102.8m.
The rights issue, pitched at ADollars 3.60 a share, is designed to return
Boral's gearing to 'normal' levels. In the wake of the Sagasco deal, it rose
to 72.5 per cent at end-1993, but will reduce to about 50 per cent after the
rights issue money is received. The company said a more normal gearing level
would give it flexibility to pursue any opportunities.

CRA, the Australian mining house in which Britain's RTZ holds a 49 per cent
stake, yesterday reported a sharp increase in full-year profits, to ADollars
806.7m (USDollars 576.7m), on an equity-accounted, after-tax basis, but
warned that it might be difficult to repeat this performance in the current
year. The year-ago figure was ADollars 411.4m.
The advance came partly from strong performances in a number of CRA's
businesses - including iron ore, coal, gold and salt - and partly from
pension fund surpluses, and some abnormal gains.
'Higher sales volumes for iron ore, gold and coal combined with the weaker
Australian dollar, contributed to the improved earnings,' said the group,
adding that weaker US dollar prices for iron ore, aluminium, zinc, lead and
coal offset some of this benefit.
Nevertheless, operating profits, before any of the one-off items, rose to
ADollars 886.2m, compared with ADollars 746.3m in the previous year. The
pension funds' surpluses added ADollars 114.4m above the line, compared with
a ADollars 47.2m charge in the previous year, while abnormal items
contributed ADollars 57.4m, against ADollars 31.6m. This last figure
resulted from the sale of investments in An Mau Steel and Kloeckner Werke.
After some favourable tax changes, net operating profit was left at ADollars
815.7m, compared with ADollars 410.5m. On an equity-accounted basis, taking
in CRA's share of profits from Kaltim Prima Coal and Coal &amp; Allied
Industries (before it became a subsidiary) plus a portion of the losses at
Pasminco, the figure stood at ADollars 806.7m, against ADollars 411.4m.
Looking ahead, CRA warned that prospects for commodity prices in 1994
remained weak, and that 'fundamental market circumstances remain unchanged'.
'The steady improvement in the world economy is unlikely to reduce the large
inventories of metals. Some bulk commodity prices will be lower, reflecting
the continued weakness in the Japanese economy in particular,' it said. CRA
also noted that the presence of large stocks would hold back price
improvements.
Even Australia, whose growth rates are expected to outstrip many other
countries in 1994, will 'continue to feel the impact of weaker demand . . .
for bulk commodities from Japan'. The group warned that the rise in the
Australian dollar makes export earnings harder to achieve.
The combination of these weak commodity prices, and the uncertain outlook
over the Australian currency, caused Mr John Ralph, chief executive, to
sound a warning note on prospects for the current year. 'It will be
difficult to replicate 1993 in 1994,' he said yesterday.

<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Louis Petriat, one of France's most prominent businessmen, yesterday
resigned as chairman and chief executive of Garantie Mutuelle des
Fonctionnaires (GMF), the ailing financial services group.
The departure of Mr Petriat, 59, marks the latest instalment in the troubled
recent history of GMF, a powerful force in the French insurance market, but
one which has faced heavy losses from an unsuccessful property venture in
the Netherlands Antilles, and from its travel insurance business.
The losses from these ventures forced GMF into capital-raising moves
designed to stabilise finances. Last year, it had to put up for sale its
controlling interest in FNAC, the largest chain of music and book stores in
France.
The FNAC sale, however, was clouded by controversy when the French stock
market authorities mounted an official investigation into a bid from Altus
Finance and Compagnie Immobiliere Phenix, after complaints from minority
shareholders. Altus and Phenix were eventually forced to raise the value of
their offer.
Mr Petriat, a flamboyant figure known for his penchant for bow-ties, has
been chairman of GMF since 1987. He has come under the spotlight in recent
years as the chief opponent of the Sunday trading campaign mounted by
Virgin, the UK-based retail group and FNAC's strongest competitor in France.

Canadian mining group Rio Algom's metals distribution business improved in
the fourth quarter, but mining operations posted lower revenue, writes
Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Net profit was CDollars 11.2m (USDollars 8.3m), or 25 cents a share, against
CDollars 10.1m, or 20 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 243m
against CDollars 241m. The figure for 1993 was CDollars 33.9m, or 73 cents,
against CDollars 39.4m, or 88 cents, on revenues of CDollars 955m against
CDollars 905m.
Mining operations are moving away from uranium to base metals. Production
has started at the Cerro Colorado project in Chile, which will produce 90m
pounds of high-quality cathode yearly.

products unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Alcan Aluminium wants to sell its North American building products division.
The division, which employs 1,800 people at 18 plants and 47 sales offices,
recorded sales of USDollars 425m in 1993 and, could, according to analysts,
fetch around Dollars 300m.
Margins at the division, which makes and distributes a range of aluminium,
vinyl and steel building products, were under severe pressure during the
1990-92 US recession. Added to this, aluminium's share of the big building
products market has been declining for several years.
CS First Boston will explore options for the division.
Alcan is concentrating on upgrading the performance of its worldwide raw
materials and smelting businesses, and on optimising its rolling capacity in
North America and Europe.
'We will continue to invest only in those companies that are a strategic fit
and create long-term value,' it said. 'The capital tied up in the building
products business could be better deployed elsewhere.'

savings banks
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Austria's savings banks were yesterday opposing a bid by Bank Austria to buy
a majority stake in GiroCredit, the savings banks' clearing institution.
The bid was announced on Monday - to widespread surprise - as part of an
initiative by Bank Austria, Austria's biggest bank, aimed at forcing through
a reorganisation of the savings bank sector.
At a meeting in Vienna yesterday, the savings banks decided instead to press
ahead with earlier proposals, which involve Erste Oesterreichische
Spar-Casse, the second-largest savings bank, establishing a new company.
This holding company would be formed by a consortium comprising Erste,
Austria Kollegialitat Versicherung, a leading insurance company, and the
savings banks. The consortium would offer to buy around two-thirds of Bank
Austria's 31 per cent stake in GiroCredit.
The meeting called on Erste to make preparations immediately to establish
the company, and to start negotiations with Bank Austria to agree a 'fair
price' for its shares in GiroCredit. Erste is to be joined by three
representatives from provincial savings banks in the negotiations.
Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, Bank Austria's chief executive, confirmed that the
bank intended to pursue its bid for GiroCredit, worth up to Sch400 a share.
Bankers say the outcome of the takeover tussle is likely to hinge on whether
Bank Austria's offer will find enough sellers among savings banks to give
the bank the extra 20.4 per cent of GiroCredit's shares which it needs to
have a majority.

<TEXT>
Euro Disney's creditor banks met in Paris yesterday to discuss their
negotiating tactics ahead of tomorrow's formal meeting with the troubled
leisure group, and Walt Disney, its US parent company.
Members of the steering committee representing the banks in talks over Euro
Disney's proposed financial rescue have been meeting informally for the past
10 days with representatives of the Disney camp.
These meetings began after the publication on Monday last week of an audit
of Euro Disney's finances commissioned by the banks from KPMG Peat Marwick.
Tomorrow's meeting will be the first formal negotiating session between the
63 international banks in the Euro Disney loan syndicates and the Disney
companies since the completion of the audit. Euro Disney is being advised in
the negotiations by S. G. Warburg in London, and Walt Disney by Lazard
Freres in New York.
The steering committee, led by Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque
Indosuez, has already told the Disney companies it envisaged the final
restructuring package being worth between FFr12bn and FFr13bn (Dollars
2.2bn). Walt Disney would share the burden of the restructuring equally with
the banks.
However some of the smaller banks in the syndicates (which are not
represented on the steering committee) are anxious for Disney to play a
larger part. A number of these smaller lenders yesterday called on the
committee to consult them more closely on negotiating tactics.
The banks plan at tomorrow's meeting to discuss ways in which Disney can
participate in the restructuring. They will propose that Disney should
significantly reduce its entitlement to various contractual payments from
Euro Disney, to alleviate the financial burden on the company.
These payments include the US group's entitlement to royalty income from the
EuroDisneyland theme park, a management fee on sales and a
performance-related incentive fee.

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Strong growth at US insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, BOSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Prudential, the US insurance group, reported a Dollars 869m increase in
its capital during 1993, to Dollars 10.7bn, as most areas of its business
grew strongly.
Changes in its capital base are the best indication of the insurer's
performance - as a mutual, it does not report conventional profit figures.
The growth came despite a move by Prudential Securities, the broking arm, to
set aside Dollars 430m to cover the costs of settling thousands of claims
from investors in limited partnerships sold by the firm in the 1980s.
After these charges, Prudential Securities still managed to maintain
after-tax earnings at Dollars 145m, down only slightly from Dollars 150m the
year before.
Mr Robert Winters, Prudential chairman and chief executive, said the results
of the securities arm showed that customers had not lost confidence in the
broker.
Following the widely-publicised limited partnership problems, which continue
to dog it, the broking firm has embarked on an extensive advertising
campaign to try to rebuild investors' trust.
The increase in Prudential's capital base compared with a rise of only
Dollars 80m the year before, when the insurer suffered losses from Hurricane
Andrew.
Among individual insurance lines, the Prudential said sales of property and
casualty insurance sales had fallen slightly during the year, to Dollars
441m in new premiums, reflecting efforts to cut its exposure to catastrophe
losses.
Sales of life insurance and annuities in North America climed to Dollars
2.7bn in annualised premiums, up from Dollars 2.1bn the year before.
Sales in the Far East and Europe rose by around a third, though from a far
smaller base.
Bank of Boston is to acquire privately-held Pioneer Financial, a
co-operative bank, for Dollars 118m in cash, Reuter reports from Boston.
Bank of Boston said Pioneer Bank, with Dollars 773m in assets and Dollars
720m in deposits, is the largest co-operative bank in Massachusetts.
The acquisition is expected to close this autumn.

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banks to restructure loans to
embattled Mexican farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's private banks are to restructure about 5.5bn pesos (Dollars 1.74bn)
of agricultural loans in default, in a move that will help rescue up to
18,000 farmers from bankruptcy.
Mr Roberto Hernandez, the head of Mexico's bankers' association, estimates
the restructuring will cause 1bn pesos in lost revenues over the next three
years. Private banks have largely replaced the state rural development bank
as the main source of financing for the sector.
The restructuring comes after intense political pressure on the banks to
offer solutions to the farm sector's debt problems. These have grown since
the new year peasant uprising in the state of Chiapas.
Last week, thousands of farmers from the Barzon campesino movement blocked
the entrance to banks in eight state capitals in an effort to prevent their
land from being seized.
The banks have agreed to restructure loans over 15 years. The farmers will
pay a fixed annual interest rate of between 4 and 4.5 per cent above
inflation: in the first five years they will be able to defer the inflation
component of the interest rate for debts less than 200,000 pesos. After the
eighth year, they will have to start paying back the principal.
Most Mexican farmers pay more than 20 per cent interest on their debt in
nominal terms.
However, Fira, a government agricultural trust fund run by the Bank of
Mexico, will offset some of the cost to the banks. It has agreed to
guarantee 50 per cent of the non-performing loans and to provide cheap
funding to recapitalise the loans.
'Overall, this is positive for the banks,' says Ms Susana Ornelas of Baring
Securities 'This will improve the asset quality of their loans. Although
they will be receiving less interest payments, they will be making fewer
loan-loss provisions.'
Mexico's farmers have suffered from low international prices for basic
commodities such as coffee, and have been hit by the government policy of
opening up the agricultural sector to imports and reducing subsidies.

<TEXT>
Shares of AST Research, the fifth-largest personal computer manufacturer,
dropped sharply yesterday when the company confirmed Wall Street concerns
about slower-than-expected sales growth in the current quarter.
AST, one of the fastest-growing companies in the PC industry, was trading at
Dollars 24 in mid-session yesterday, down from Tuesday's close of Dollars 28
3/4 . This followed a 9 per cent drop on Tuesday.
For the fiscal year ended July 3 1993, AST lost Dollars 53.8m, or Dollars
1.72 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.41bn.
The loss reflected a Dollars 125m pre-tax restructuring charge related to
the company's acquisition of Tandy's PC manufacturing operations in July
1993.
For the first half of fiscal 1994, the company reported net income of
Dollars 26.2m, or 79 cents, on revenues of Dollars 1.2bn.
Several brokerage firms lowered their ratings on AST after the company said
its February sales were strong, but below projections. Growth here was about
60 per cent over the same month last year, rather than an expected 70 per
cent increase.
Other PC stocks also came under pressure. At midday in New York, Apple
Computer was down Dollars 1 at Dollars 35 1/4 . Compaq Computer dropped
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 95 1/4 .

assets in Texas and Louisiana.
The disposal signals Cypress Amax's intention to concentrate on its mining

The assets also include 550 miles of gathering lines and three gas

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Aluminium shines for fund
managers - The stock has reflected the commodity's price rise this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mutual fund managers have taken a shine to North American aluminium stocks
as the next, and best, undervalued market in the commodities sector.
While copper and gold prices appreciated sharply last year, aluminium
lagged, depressed by worldwide overcapacity.
This year, however, the price of aluminium is already up 25 per cent, and
share prices have been reflecting this advance, although some of the shine
is beginning to wear off.
Alcoa, the world's largest and lowest-cost aluminium producer, for instance,
saw a 10 per cent rise in its share price during February, hitting a
12-month high of Dollars 82, despite reporting a fourth-quarter loss.
The share prices of other top producers, including Reynolds Metals and
Canada's Alcan, also rose to highs, even though they have not had a
profitable quarter in more than a year.
Bulls argue that aluminium demand is certain to rise as the US economy
strengthens, and that aluminium shares serve as inflation hedges in
portfolios heavily weighted to financial instruments. Some analysts,
however, have been counselling caution.
Much of this year's appreciation in aluminium shares came as investors
anticipated the international understanding reached in Brussels in February
by the world's biggest aluminium producers.
The producing countries agreed to cut worldwide output by at least 1.5m
tonnes as they sought to bring aluminium supply and demand back into balance
after years of overproduction, a flood of Russian exports, and soaring
inventories.
While the agreement provides the basis for optimism in an industry in the
trough of a five-year recession, many securities analysts believe the run on
aluminium stocks has been overdone.
Mr J. Clarence Morrison, an analyst for Prudential Securities, recommends
clients hold their aluminium shares, but not make new purchases.
He is sceptical that the Brussels understanding, which involves voluntary
cuts by five big producing regions of the world, will ever be fully
implemented.
'Sixty per cent of all the world's aluminium smelters are government or
quasi-government controlled,' Mr Morrison says, 'Many are instruments of
national policy', which makes real cuts hard to sustain.
He says aluminium output cuts have historically turned into a sort of
worldwide shell game, with producers in one region boosting production when
cuts are announced in another region of the world.
Mr Vahid Fathi, senior metals analyst at Kemper Securities, puts it more
bluntly. The Brussels understanding 'has the appearance of a cartel, and all
cartels cheat at the end of the day', he says.
'I don't believe in all the hoopla,' says Mr Fathi. 'Hedge funds and hot
money have been moving into aluminium in the wake of the understanding, but
there is very little to justify the price increases.'
He points out that Alcoa is currently priced at 160 times earnings.
Even assuming the most optimistic circumstances - where aluminium demand
strengthened and the US economy improved - Mr Fathi says aluminium shares
are overvalued.
Assuming the price of aluminium did rise to 85 cents per pound in 1997, from
the current 58 cents, Mr Fathi calculates that Alcoa is trading at 20 times
projected 1997 earnings.
Using the same model, Reynolds' share price, at Dollars 54, is 23 times
expected earnings three years from now; Alcan is priced 20 times earnings;
and Alumax, recently spun off from the Cyprus/Amax merger, is 25 times
earnings.
Analysts say that while the fundamentals do not support the aluminium share
price increases, fund managers have been so anxious to buy cyclical stocks
that they have willingly inflated prices.
In aluminium, their influence is magnified because the industry's
capitalisation is small, and indeed minute compared with the Dollars 25bn US
mutual funds have to invest.
Ms Amy Gassman, a metals analysts with Goldman Sachs, says the result will
be a very volatile and Opec-like market.
'Prices will rise when we get evidence of supply cuts, and fall when
inventory drawdowns are slower than expected,' she says.

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Time Warner delays trial of
interactive TV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Time Warner, which operates the second-largest cable television service in
the US, has delayed the start of one of America's leading trials of
multimedia interactive television, from April until the fourth quarter of
this year.
The company announced a year ago it planned to introduce a 'full service
network' - offering services ranging from home shopping to interactive games
and information services - to 4,000 customers of its cable television
service in Orlando, Florida. If successful there, it will roll the service
out across its cable franchises.
However, it now says it is postponing the launch to allow 'additional
refinements of the underlying system software and the set-top terminal'.
The operating software is being designed by Silicon Graphics, the
California-based maker of high-performance visual computing systems, and the
set-top terminal, which controls the flow of information to the home, is
being made by Scientific-Atlanta.
Mr Joseph Collins, chairman of Time Warner Cable, said it remained on track
to have 4,000 customers on the network by year-end, 'and the development
process makes us highly confident about its success'.
However, the delay is likely to puncture some of the recent hype surrounding
the development in the US of an information superhighway - a nationwide,
interactive multimedia network.
Coming on top of last week's collapse of the proposed merger between
telephone group Bell Atlantic and cable company Tele-Communications Inc, it
shows there remain many hurdles - technological, financial and commercial -
before the US creates a successful multimedia system.
Other cable television and telephone companies are involved in trials of
multimedia systems, but Time Warner's venture is widely regarded as the most
aggressive.
It draws on the company's experiment in the Queens borough of New York City,
where Time Warner has been delivering 150 channels of interactive television
to cable customers.
Mr Edward McCracken, chairman of Silicon Graphics, said it was important the
Orlando system provided a 'fully-refined environment'.

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Court rejects Blockbuster
investor move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Delaware court has rejected a move to block a Dollars 1.25bn investment by
Blockbuster Entertainment, the US home video company, in cable television
group Viacom.
The application had been brought by some shareholders in Blockbuster, which
had agreed to pay Dollars 55 a share for a stake in Viacom to provide cash
for the cable-TV company's winning bid for Paramount Communications.
Viacom's non-voting 'B' shares were trading at around Dollars 29 this week.
The Delaware chancery court said blocking the investment would cause
'enormous uncertainty with widespread repercussions, causing Paramount
Communication's stockholders to reconsider their decision to tender their
shares under Viacom's tender offer'.
Blockbuster shareholders have yet to vote on whether to accept an all-share
offer for the company from Viacom.
Although it has already received the backing of Blockbuster's board, the
deal has come under fire from some shareholders.

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Shares in two leading US banks
hit by loss report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Bankers Trust and J. P. Morgan, two of the most active US
commercial banks in the financial markets, fell sharply yesterday amid
rumours they had taken big trading losses.
Bankers Trust, which is more reliant on derivatives trading than any other
commercial bank, was forced to put out a statement after reports spread that
it had been hit by large losses on derivatives.
The bank said that its 'operations thus far in 1994 have been profitable,'
although it refused to elaborate. This statement failed to reassure the
stock market, and Bankers Trust's shares lost Dollars 2 3/8 , to close at
Dollars 78 3/4 in New York yesterday. In the first quarter last year the
bank made after-tax profits of Dollars 230m.
J. P. Morgan was also said to have lost heavily in the derivatives markets,
and in the Latin American debt market. The bank refused to respond to the
rumours. 'Our standard practice is to not comment on our results until the
end of the quarter,' Morgan said.
The bank is understood to have taken losses on Latin American debt, where it
is one of the biggest dealers, but these are thought not to have been
significant. Morgan's shares closed down Dollars 1 at Dollars 66 1/2 .
Rumours of big trading losses at several banks have swirled around the
financial markets for several weeks, prompted by volatile conditions
following the Federal Reserve's move to edge US interest rates a quarter of
a percentage point higher.
While most traders claimed to have been prepared for some movement in US
rates, the subsequent fall in European bond markets has taken many by
surprise. Many banks had predicted a continuing rise in European bond prices
in the first half of this year.
Also, the US dollar's fall against the yen - the cause of the Dollars 600m
loss admitted to last week by Mr George Soros' Quantum funds group  - had
not been expected at many trading banks. There had been a widespread belief
that, once US interest rates started to rise, the dollar would follow.
Goldman Sachs, another bank said to have taken big losses in European bond
markets, was forced to put out a statement denying the reports last month.
Even if losses prove less severe than some of the wilder speculation
suggests, banks are unlikely to be able to sustain the sort of trading
profits made last year, when the biggest bond and stock markets were moving
higher in tandem.

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Unexpected FM50m at Kemira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kemira, the state-owned Finnish chemicals group due to be privatised,
yesterday reported an unexpected return to the black, announcing a profit
after financial items in 1993 of FM50m (Dollars 9m) following a loss in 1992
of FM291m.
Sales were up 6 per cent to FM11.8bn despite the favourable effect of a weak
Finnish markka.
But Mr Heimo Karinen, chief executive, said a series of internal
cost-cutting measures, which saw the workforce reduced by 1,200 to 11,000,
has begun to pay off, producing the return to profitability.
An extraordinary charge related to rationalisation measures of FM20m left
pre-tax profit at FM30m, compared with a pre-tax loss of FM338m in 1992. Mr
Karinen said much of the cost of these measures had now been taken and he
expected higher profits in 1994 despite little sign of significant growth in
its main European markets.
Kemira, which is 100 per cent state-owned, is one of the centre-right
government's main candidates for privatisation. The government envisages a
flotation of a one-third stake in the company.
Although no timetable has been set, the company is understood to favour
moving ahead this year.

radio group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The French government yesterday abandoned plans to privatise RMC, the
state-controlled radio group, after deciding that none of the bids for was
high enough.
RMC, which owns a number of radio stations including Radio Monte Carlo for
easy listening music and Radio Nostalgie for golden oldies, was put up for
sale last November.
The government, which has a 83 per cent holding in RMC, invited private
sector companies to bid for the company rather than floating it on the stock
market. It has since received four offers for the business.
Havas, the French media group, made the highest offer with a bid worth
FFr540m (Dollars 93m). NRJ, the pop music radio station, bid FFr440m. The
offers from Alcatel-Alsthom, the electronics concern, and VSD, the weekly
magazine, were valued at FFr420m and FFr400m respectively.
However, the government had previously commissioned Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountancy group, to prepare a formal valuation of RMC. Coopers is believed
to have estimated that the company was worth FFr600m, significantly more
than any of the private sector offers.
The economy ministry yesterday issued a statement saying that it had
scrapped plans to sell RMC as none of the bids for the company had matched
its minimum valuation.
Although price was the main obstacle to the RMC sale, the government faced
an additional deterrent in that the Conseil de la Concurrence, the French
competition authority, opposed the Havas bid on the grounds that the group
already has significant advertising interests.
Havas not only controls Euro:RSCG, the largest French marketing services
concern, but already has interests in broadcasting and billboards. It was
last month embroiled in a political row over its controversial decision to
effectively take control of Canal-Plus, the television group.

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Christiania Bank back in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Christiania Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, has returned to a full-year
profit for the first time in five years, helped by interest rate reductions,
operating efficiencies and gains on securities.
The bank swung to a pre-tax profit of NKr862m (Dollars 116m) in 1993 from a
loss of NKr1.23bn in the previous year.
The other dominant feature of 1993 was 'our global share offering which
strengthened the bank's equity by more than NKr2bn in new core capital,'
said Mr Borger Lenth, managing director.
The bank's capital adequacy rose from 8.6 per cent to 13.7 per cent of
risk-weighted assets at the end of December while core capital doubled to
5.9 per cent from 3 per cent.
Net interest income at NKr3.06bn was little changed from the previous year.
Non-interest income shot up by 35 per cent to NKr2.27bn.
Gains on securities reached NKr731m, against losses of NKr94m in 1992. Net
gains on foreign exchange and other financial instruments fell to NKr286m
from NKr605m, due to lower profitability by the bank's own trading in
financial instruments, and because 1992 was particularly good, Christiania
said.
Operating expenses rose slightly to NKr2.92bn from NKr2.87bn. 'Excluding the
costs relating to the acquisition of new branches and the increase in the
charges payable to the banks' guarantee fund, Christiania reduced its
expenses by 2 per cent in 1993,' it said.
The bank almost reduced by half losses on loans and guarantees, to NKr1.45bn
from NKr2.8bn, but is still plagued by high losses in the fisheries sector,
which accounted for NKr939m of the total, of which NKr114m was incurred in
the fourth quarter.
Net non-performing loans were cut to NKr4.7bn from NKr5.9bn while gross
non-performers fell to NKr9.6bn from NKr12.1bn.
The bank said the reduction in loan loss provisions and in the volume of
non-performing commitments in all sectors except fisheries, was primarily
due to lower interest rates and a strengthening of procedures for account
monitoring.
IBCA, the UK-based credit rating agency, has raised the ratings of
Christiania Bank, Den norske Bank and Sparebanken Nor.
Christiania's individual rating was raised to C/D from D/E, the long-term
rating to A from A- and the short-term rating to A1 from A2. DnB's
respective ratings were raised to D from D/E, to A from A- and to A1 from
A2. Nor has been raised to C from C/D, to A from A- and to A1 from A2 due to
an especially strong recovery in 1993.
'The higher ratings reflect the improving financial condition of the banks
and the positive outlook for the Norwegian economy, and for the banks
themselves, for 1994 and beyond,' IBCA said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swissair, the Swiss national airline, has indicated that it made a profit
last year in spite of a fourth consecutive year of losses from flight
operations. It gave no figures.
Mr Otto Loepfe, chief executive, confirmed the positive result, which
earlier seemed uncertain, at a press conference yesterday in Zurich to
announce an increase in orders for Airbus aircraft from 26 to 29.
The airline group also revealed a finance plan to 1998 calling for capital
spending of SFr4.6bn (Dollars 3.2bn) and debt repayment of SFr500m. This
would be financed by SFr3bn from cash flow, SFr1.5bn in new capital and
SFr600m from liquid funds.
Swissair's Airbus order consists of 16 A320s, eight A321s and five A319s
worth SFr2.3bn.
The aircraft will be introduced over two years from the beginning of 1995,
more quickly than previously planned, and five of them are to be leased.
They will replace 24 McDonnell Douglas MD-81s and five A310-200s, of which
all but 14 MD-81s have already been sold.
The Airbuses will be equipped with CFM-56-5B engines which produce 40 per
cent less NOx emissions than the engines on the MD81s and are 25 per cent
more fuel efficient.

Banco Mello, a Portuguese bank privatised in 1991, yesterday announced a 1.2
per cent improvement in net profits to Es1bn (Dollars 5.7m) for 1993,
compared with 1992. Cash flow rose 20 per cent to Es2.3bn. Net assets grew
34 per cent to Es124bn.
The bank plans to hold its dividend at Es70 a share, and proposes to
increase share capital from Es9bn to Es18bn this year through a rights
issue.
It said an allocation of Es2.3bn in provisions against bad debt had
increased its coverage of doubtful credit from 48 per cent in 1992 to 87 per
cent but had slowed profit growth.

Nordic Investment Bank, jointly owned by the five Nordic countries,

to Ecu64m (Dollars 56m), from Ecu51m in 1992.
The Helsinki-based bank, a leading western investor in the Baltic states,
said net interest income grew 36 per cent to Ecu101m, but attributed much of
this to its switch during the year to the Ecu as its currency of account and
capital.
The bank said it had charged Ecu3.1m against profits to cover loan losses.
But it boasted that unlike other loan-loss hit Nordic banks, it had only two
non-performing loans in its lending portfolio which at the year-end totalled
Ecu4.5bn.
The bank said it had retained its triple A credit rating - the only Nordic
banking institution to have done so.

Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, has reported a
steep rise in pre-tax profits for 1993 and is increasing its dividend from
NKr1.75 a share to NKr2.
Group operating revenues advanced to NKr5.66bn (Dollars 764m) for 1993
compared with NKr4.92bn for the previous year after an increase in operating
costs to NKr3.97bn from NKr3.67bn. Pre-tax profits for the year were NKr1bn,
against NKr802m.
The charge for net financial items was NKr688m in 1993, up from NKr449m in
1992. Included in last year's charge is a net unrealised currency loss of
NKr451m on dollar-denominated debt.
Last year total crude oil production surged by 22 per cent to 35.9m barrels
as daily crude oil production rose to 98,400 barrels from 80,700 barrels,
helped mainly by the first full year of output from the Snorre field.
Crude oil sales rose by 4.5m barrels to 31m in 1993 as gas sales fell to
465m cubic metres from 485m. Tariff revenue from pipeline systems rose to
NKr503m from NKr450m.
At the end of 1993, Saga's remaining proved and probable oil and gas
reserves totalled 147.4m tonnes of oil equivalent.

Stat-Plus Group, the legal stationer, blamed lower interest rates for a 5

Although gross margins had been maintained and overheads reduced, enabling
operating profits to advance 14 per cent to Pounds 2.58m (Pounds 2.26m), net
interest income fell from Pounds 1.35m to Pounds 834,000.
Bank balances increased from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 14.2m. Turnover rose to
Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 11.4m).
Earnings per share were 10.7p (11.3p) while a final dividend of 4.8p lifts
the total to 8.8p (8p).

ADT, the electronic security and car auctions group run by Mr Michael

Shares in the group, which retains its London quote despite being
Bermuda-registered and having administrative headquarters in Boca Raton,
Florida, continue to trade at a discount to markets on both sides of the
Atlantic.
Shareholders in Europe in particular have had rough ride - the shares
collapsed from a peak of Pounds 21.15 in September 1989 to a low of 281p in
December 1991 - and have only recently moved up to about 700p.
On Wall Street, where more than 80 per cent the stock is held, the shares
have recovered somewhat in recent months, but are still trading at a
relatively low earnings multiple compared with the Standard &amp; Poors 500
average.
Mr Jack Blackstock, an analyst with CS First Boston in New York, said, 'a
pall hangs over investors' perceptions of the company that emanates from the
firm's often confusing and unenviable acquisition record'.
More bluntly, many investors remain suspicious of Mr Ashcroft who, long
before acquiring the US-based ADT commercial security group in 1988, enjoyed
a reputation in London as an unpredictable corporate raider having built up
'strategic' stakes in a number of companies including BAA, Lep and Christies
International.
In the process he alienated most City institutions, analysts and investors
with his secrecy, accounting techniques and inter-affiliate transactions.
However, Mr Ashcroft, 48 tomorrow, appears keen to project a new image,
though he accepts that he pushed the rules to the limit in the 1980s and
says he understands why British institutions abandoned him.
'I was chairman of a public company at 31, I had never met a merchant banker
or a stockbroker,' he says. 'I made all my mistakes in public - but we all
move on'.
He insists that 'perception is still far removed from reality in London,'
but he is clearly concerned about how he is viewed in the UK where some
19,000 individual investors still hold ADT shares.
'While New York will continue to be our primary market, we recognise the
importance of London both commercially and financially,' he says, 'and being
British, I am naturally keen to maintain my links with London'.
The partial recovery in ADT's share price over the past six months in both
London and New York reflects a reduction in some of the uncertainties which
have overshadowed ADT in recent years, and greater confidence that the group
will, under pressure from its larger North American investors, stick to its
core businesses.
'Three years ago everyone was betting against our survival,' says Mr
Ashcroft referring to early 1991 when ADT was hit by a legal onslaught
launched by Laidlaw, the Canadian waste management group and ADT's largest
shareholder. The Laidlaw suit accused ADT of 'manufacturing an illusory
profit stream' and sent ADT's already shaky share price plunging towards its
nadir.
The suit, fiercely contested by ADT, never went to court. Laidlaw withdrew
its accusations after being given four seats on ADT's board. The company was
never formally investigated but it was scrutinised by both the public and
regulatory authorities. At the time it was proceeding through the listing
process on the New York Stock Exchange where it is now traded.
Even before the Laidlaw suit, Mr Ashcroft and Mr Steve Ruzika, ADT's finance
director, were drawing up plans for an 'Americanisation' of ADT.
Since 1991 ADT has adopted American accounting and corporate governance
standards, including accepting a majority of outside directors - nine of the
current 13-strong board are non-executives.
The re-fashioning of corporate ADT was a necessary precursor to completing a
Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 890m) refinancing deal last August which averted a
potential crisis triggered by mountains of maturing bank debt and put
options on two series of convertible preferred stock.
The refinancing deal included Dollars 156m of new equity, two public debt
offerings and a new Dollars 500m credit facility which is being used to
retire the preferred stock this year. As a result ADT's debt maturity
schedule has been extended and the balance sheet cleaned up, although the
group still has high gearing.
Meanwhile, Laidlaw, which retains a 23.9 per cent stake in ADT, reduced the
perceived share overhang in December by issuing an innovative 5-year
debenture which can be redeemed for cash, Laidlaw shares or ADT shares,
depending on the ADT share price.
With the refinancing out of the way, Wall Street analysts who have begun to
follow the shares are arguing that the market will be able to concentrate
ADT's core security and car auction operations.
Both ADT's core businesses hold leading market positions in high margin
service industries, offer substantial operating leverage and are strong cash
flow generators with growth opportunities.
The security services business, which installs alarm systems and provides
round-the-clock alarm monitoring services reported Dollars 141m of operating
profits on revenues of Dollars 901m in 1992, and is the largest in the world
with over 865,000 customers.
The business is expanding rapidly, particularly in the US residential market
where growth has been fuelled by mounting concern about crime. Last year
145,000 residential customers signed up, making a total of 477,000. Most
sign 3-year contracts generating substantial recurring revenues.
Meanwhile, its smaller automotive division handled 1.4m vehicles in 1992,
generating revenues of Dollars 343m and operating profits of Dollars 68m.
ADT runs 26 car auctions centres in the UK where it ranks number one, and 31
sites in the US where the group is second after Manheim, a subsidiary of Cox
Communications.
Like other highly geared companies ADT highlights the earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of its core businesses which
have increased from Dollars 271.3m in 1990 to Dollars 321.6m in 1992,
outpacing revenues which grew from Dollars 1.14bn to Dollars 1.24bn.
The group's 1993 full-year results are due out next week and are generally
expected to show steady progress at the operating level, although earnings
are likely to be flat, reflecting the dilutive effects of new equity, higher
interest expenses following the refinancing and higher reported tax rate.
The one remaining question mark is whether ADT's current management will
stick with the strategy focusing on the two core businesses. Since 1991 the
management has moved steadily to divest all non-core operations and the new
strategy is written into the strict financial and operational bank debt
covenants agreed as part of the refinancing which specifically prohibit any
divergent acquisitions.
Mr Ashcroft owns only a small ADT stake but his position is secure. Last
year he agreed a five-year contract worth up to Dollars 5m a year together
with a valuable share option package.
It appears that even if he harbours any secret ambitions to enter new
business areas, or misses the excitement of his earlier adventures, he would
have to use his own funds and private companies outside ADT.
However, UK institutional investors have long memories and until ADT and its
management have a sustained track record of delivering solid earnings growth
based on their new strategy the stigma will not be fully removed.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BWD advances 77% to Pounds 3.08m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BWD Securities, the USM-traded financial services group, increased pre-tax
profits by 77 per cent from Pounds 1.74m to Pounds 3.08m in the year to
November 30.
Turnover for the West Yorkshire-based company increased to Pounds 14.5m
(Pounds 10.4m), while earnings per share expanded 73 per cent to 11.1p
(6.4p). A final dividend of 2.5p makes a total of 4p, up 25 per cent.
Mr Christopher Broadbent, chief executive, said that improved sentiment on
stock markets had helped growth, coupled with a switch to equities by
private investors from banks and building societies as interest rates fell.
Total funds under management at the year end were Pounds 1.63bn, after a 36
per cent increase in discretionary funds to Pounds 315m and a 44 per cent
advance in Pep funds to Pounds 65m.
The Capital for Companies offshoot raised more than Pounds 39m (Pounds 9m).
With another Pounds 30m raised this financial year, fee income from business
expansion scheme activity would continue until 1998. Recurring fee income in
the year increased by Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.8m.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: EFM aims to double Small Cos Trust's size
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edinburgh Fund Managers' Small Companies Investment Trust is aiming to
almost double in size with a conversion share issue.
The trust - launched last August - invests in UK quoted companies mainly
capitalised at under Pounds 100m. It has net assets of Pounds 58m.
The maximum size of the C share issue has been set at Pounds 50m, after the
placing drew irrevocable undertakings for Pounds 20m-worth of C shares at
100p.
The public offer opens today and closes on March 23. Warrants will be
attached on a 1-for-5 basis. Conversion will take place by September 30.
The Foreign &amp; Colonial Income Growth investment trust, the group's first
investment trust to concentrate on the UK, has raised Pounds 7m from a
placing. The public offer, which closes on March 25, has been given a Pounds
250m limit, to avoid any need to scale back applications.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Resort sells 4 hotels for Pounds 7.3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Resort Hotels has sold four of its 50 hotels for Pounds 7.28m to Cairn
Hotels, a subsidiary of Bank of Scotland, one of its banks.
The company said the consideration was based on the latest valuation, and
included the freeholds. Proceeds would be used to reduce debt. Resort shares
have been suspended since last July.
Accounts for the year to end-April 1993 have not yet been published because
of difficulties in finalising property valuations. Resort called in
independent consultants last July to investigate financing issues.
The trade and industry department has granted the group until the end of
this month to publish the accounts.
Mr Roland Lewis, acting managing director, said yesterday that the group's
strategy was to maximise immediate profitability, which called for 'some
pruning of our network especially in areas where we are densely
represented'.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Losses deepen to Pounds 48m at UES
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UES Holdings, the Rotherham-based engineering steels and forgings group in
which GKN has a 39.1 per cent stake, plunged to a record pre-tax loss of
Pounds 48.1m last year, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 10.3m in
1992.
The latest deficit could increase the pressure on GKN to resolve the future
of its stake in UES, which is the last link with its past in steel, forgings
and related 'nuts and bolts' businesses. The rest of UES is owned by British
Steel.
Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, said yesterday: 'Quite frankly, this is not
a business we want to be in'. It is included among the peripheral businesses
which GKN wishes to divest, but Sir David said prospects for an orthodox
disposal were 'pretty poor'.
The loss at UES, in which GKN's share is Pounds 19m, comes in spite of a
rise in turnover from Pounds 565m to Pounds 591m, due partly to a full-year
contribution from Lee Bright Bar, acquired in October 1992.
Scrap prices paid by UES rose more than 60 per cent last year, and with
selling prices depressed, margins were squeezed. On top of that, electricity
costs rose faster than inflation, it said.
Mr Rod Beddows, the steel consultant, said the European engineering steels
market was in great difficulties. Also, Thyssen and Saarstahl, the two main
competitors of UES in leaded, so-called free-cutting steel, used blast
furnaces and did not rely on scrap as their raw material.
UES suffered an operating loss of Pounds 21.1m last year, against a deficit
of Pounds 12.2m in 1992. The latest figure includes Pounds 2.9m of
redundancy costs as UES cut average employment from 8,322 in 1992 to 7,653
last year.
Exceptional costs were Pounds 26.9m in 1993, with Pounds 19.6m of closure
costs - principally related to the closure of the Templeborough works in
Rotherham late last year - and Pounds 8m of reorganisation and restructuring
costs, offset by small exceptional credits.
The latest loss is only the second since UES was formed in 1986, and
compares with peak profits of Pounds 67.3m in 1989.
On a brighter note, UES did increase exports last year from Pounds 222m to
Pounds 242m.
Mr Don Ford, chairman, said there was some evidence of restocking in January
and February, but signs of a sustainable uplift in volumes and margins had
yet to be confirmed.
Some observers believe the best solution for GKN would be to sell its stake
to British Steel, which could then combine and rationalise the steel side of
UES with parts of its own business.
But it is understood GKN does not want to sell at a price which would force
it to make a big write-off on the carrying value of its stake.
In the meantime Sir David said UES has to continue attacking its cost base.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Redrow plans listing to fund expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Redrow, which claims to be Britain's biggest private housebuilder, yesterday
announced plans for a stock market listing.
The company is expected to be valued at about Pounds 350m under the
flotation, which is likely to involve the issue of about Pounds 50m of new
shares. Mr Steve Morgan, the founder, is expected to raise a further Pounds
100m by selling part of his 98 per cent stake.
Mr Morgan, who started the company in 1974 when he was 21, is expected to be
left with just over 50 per cent of the shares following the transactions.
Originally the company's activities were mainly in north-west England.
They have spread to Yorkshire, east Midlands, south Wales and south-west
England.
Last year it acquired Costain's former housebuilding business in south-east
Emgland in a deal worth up to Pounds 24m.
The money raised will be used to acquire land and finance expansion.
Some 2,000 homes are expected to have been sold in the year to June 30.
During the six months to the end of December, Redrow increased pre-tax
profits by 81 per cent to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 6.8m) on turnover of Pounds
104m (Pounds 64.3m). The number of homes sold in the period rose by 81 per
cent from 636 to 1,153.
Profits included a Pounds 1m gain from the sale of its 12.7 per cent stake
in Bellwinch, a rival housebuilder.
The company traditionally does better in the first half. Even so it should
be capable of producing pre-tax profits of approaching Pounds 20m for the
full year. This would compare with Pounds 13.3m in 1992-94 and a peak of
Pounds 16.3m in 1989-90.
Annual output in the medium term is likely to be lifted to about 3,500
homes. The landbank of 6,700 plots with planning permission will need to
increase as the business expands.
The average purchase price of each plot is Pounds 11,400, equivalent to 13.5
per cent of the current average selling price of a Redrow home. This was
Pounds 80,000 in the first half, but is expected to be nearer Pounds 90,000
in the next financial year as the former Costain first-time buyer business
is moved up-market.
Net debt of Pounds 13.8m at the end of December represented 21 per cent of
capital reserves of Pounds 65.1m.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd is organising the issue, Cazenove is acting as
broker.

WH Smith, the retail and distribution group, yesterday confirmed it was
merging its Our Price music chain with Virgin Retail, its joint venture with
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group.
Smith will put all its 305 Our Price stores into the venture, and increase
its stake from 50 to 75 per cent. Virgin, which operates 24 megastores in
the UK and Ireland, will reduce its stake to 25 per cent. No cash is
changing hands.
The enlarged group will be the UK's biggest music retailer with annual sales
of Pounds 350m - 20 per cent of the market.
It will be managed by a team of Virgin and WH Smith executives headed by Mr
Simon Burke, currently Virgin Retail's managing director for the UK and
Ireland. Other directors will be Mr Peter Troughton, WH Smith's managing
director of UK retailing, and Mr Trevor Abbott, managing director of Virgin
Retail. Mr Branson will be president.
The merger is subject to approval by the regulatory authorities.
Virgin also announced a 50/50 venture with Saehan Media Corporation of South
Korea to open Megastores there. The first is expected to open in Seoul in
mid-1995.
Saehan manufactures video tape and magnetic media, and has affiliations with
Samsung, one of South Korea's largest groups.

Sanderson Bramall is increasing its involvement in the commercial vehicle
market with the acquisition of Petrogate Group, the commercial vehicle and
car distributor.
The Yorkshire-based motor distribution group has conditionally agreed to pay
a sum equal to the net asset value of Petrogate at completion, which is
expected to be about Pounds 400,000, plus a profit-related maximum of Pounds
5.25m.
The initial consideration of Pounds 4.75m is to be satisfied by the issue of
1m new shares worth Pounds 2m with the balance payable in cash. Sanderson is
also assuming bank borrowings of about Pounds 9.7m.
In the year to July 31, Petrogate, which operates in the Midlands and the
north of England, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 852,000 on sales of
Pounds 70.4m. Of its Pounds 1.9m operating profit some 70 per cent was
derived from commercial vehicle operations.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Nottingham seeks to raise Pounds 15m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nottingham Group, one of the UK's largest suppliers of educational products,
is planning to raise about Pounds 15m in new capital from its forthcoming
flotation. The funds will be used to redeem preference shares and repay
debt.
The pathfinder prospectus, released yesterday, showed 1993 pre-tax profits
of Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 7.08m) after a Pounds 1.1m write-down on fixed
assets.
Mr David Mansfield, chief executive, said Nottingham's existing business
offered steady growth, but he was looking to expand the product range
through acquisitions.
He said that government schools had built up budget reserves of Pounds 400m,
which he expected to support increased purchases of educational supplies in
the coming years.
The company was formed through a management buy-out from Coats Viyella in
1989, and the subsequent purchase of EJ Arnold, its main competitor, from
Pergamon.
The management and its venture capital backers will sell some existing
shares through the placement and intermediaries offer, in addition to the
Pounds 15m of new shares. Nottingham will have an initial market
capitalisation of about Pounds 80m.
Impact day is March 17, and the offer will close a week later. It is the
first UK flotation to be sponsored by Goldman Sachs International.

<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON

<TEXT>
The two Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index investment trusts are to merge
and raise up to Pounds 25m through a conversion share issue.
The moves will create a single trust with assets of about Pounds 95m.
The merger is based on the argument that a larger portfolio would lead to
more consistent investment performance in line with both trusts' aim of
matching the Extended HGSC Index (excluding investment trusts). Lower
administrative costs and greater liquidity in the shares are also expected.
Participation in the C share issue is limited to existing shareholders.
Commitments have already been received for 20.8m C shares at 125p.
The arrangements are likely to be approved at the annual meeting of the
first trust on March 23, as the merger offer has already been accepted by
holders of 82 per cent of the second trust's shares.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Clayton, Son agrees bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Motherwell Bridge Holdings, the private engineering and contracting concern,
is acquiring Clayton, Son (Holdings) at 128p per share, valuing the
engineering construction group at Pounds 3.4m.
Clayton shares rose 14p to 127p.
Mr John Crawford, Motherwell chairman, said the acquisition would enhance
his company's engineering and contracting strengths in the areas of design
and project engineering of specialist plant for storage of solids, liquids
and gases.
Motherwell has received irrevocable undertakings to accept the offers, to be
made by Hill Samuel, in respect of 61.2 per cent of Clayton's founder shares

Clayton also announced results for 1993 which revealed pre-tax losses of

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Yorkshire Food exceeds Pounds 5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Food Group, the Bradford-based food processor floated last March,
yesterday reported an 89 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.1m for
its first year as a public company.
The shares, placed at 110p in March 1993, dipped 3p to 119p yesterday.
Turnover for the 12 months to end-December increased by 51 per cent from
Pounds 63.2m to Pounds 95.2m, reflecting a combination of organic growth and
the August acquisition of Del Monte's dried fruit business in California.
'Clearly in our first year we can claim to have improved shareholder value,'
said Mr Mike Firth, chairman and chief executive.
Earnings per share increased from 8.21p to 9.33p. A final dividend of 2.48p
is proposed, taking the total to 3.2p, compared with an estimated 2.88p for
1992.
The group said the results fully justified the Pounds 16.9m acquisition,
which contributed Pounds 15.2m to turnover and Pounds 1.9m to total
operating profits of Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 3.9m).
Yorkshire's sales are now split equally between the US and the UK, where 24
per cent of sales go to supermarkets.
The group considered the proportion of its sales going to supermarkets as an
advantage because their demands led to efficient business practices, which
gave knock-on benefits when dealing with other customers.
The results included closure costs of Pounds 502,000, mainly reflecting the
group's withdrawal from its baking business. The tax charge for the year
rose from 17 to 23 per cent.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Serco makes Pounds 9.4m and shares rise
117p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Serco rose by 117p to Pounds 14.50 after the facilities and
contract management group announced a proposed 4-for-1 scrip issue and a 31
per cent increase in profits.
The pre-tax outcome rose from Pounds 7.21m to Pounds 9.42m in the year to
December 31, while turnover increased by 25 per cent to Pounds 187m (Pounds
150m). Of this figure, 17.4 per cent came from established businesses and
7.5 per cent from acquisitions.
Serco said its mainly public sector markets had continued to offer good
opportunities throughout the year and the outlook was promising.
The rate at which the group was winning new contracts indicated that it
would continue to expand in 1994.
Mr Richard White, managing director, was confident the pace of UK
privatisation would increase.
'The push is there from the government and we see it as a big opportunity in
the medium term.'
Serco recently won the five-year, Pounds 66m contract to manage a new jail
at Doncaster through Premier Prison Services, its 50/50 joint venture with
Wackenhut Corrections Corporation, a US private prison operator.
The prison will be the most complex to be run by the private sector, with
convicted and remand prisoners, young offenders and high-security cases
among its 771 inmates.
Overseas work won by Serco includes looking after 17,000 parking meters in
Hong Kong and winning a share of the management contract for Diego Garcia,
the US naval base in the Indian Ocean.
Earnings rose to 46.5p (37p) per share. A proposed final dividend of 11.7p
makes an increased total for the year of 17p (14p).
COMMENT
A 9 per cent share price increase in an unsettled market was tribute to the
City's growing enthusiasm for Serco, which since flotation in 1988 has
increased its market value more than eightfold. One constraint on the shares
has been limited liquidity, so the scrip issue certainly helped sentiment.
The group sees plenty of opportunities, both in the UK and overseas,
although analysts find it difficult to really understand the huge variety of
activities in which Serco is involved. Assuming 25 per cent earnings growth
this year, the shares are on a hefty prospective multiple of 25. After
doubling in value since the beginning of last year, the shares look more
than up with events.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Comac Pounds 228,000 in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Comac Group, the UK's largest information technology staff agency, returned
losses before tax of Pounds 228,000 in 1993 after exceptional charges and
unallocated overheads wiped out an operating surplus.
The results included two months' contribution from CSS Trident, formerly the
UK's largest independent supplier of contract computer staff, acquired at
the beginning of November last year. CSS Trident made profits before tax of
Pounds 2m on revenues of Pounds 53m in 1992-93.
Group turnover grew from Pounds 11.1m to Pounds 19.8m and operating profits
rose from Pounds 429,000 to Pounds 855,000. There were, however, exceptional
charges of Pounds 773,000 to pay for redundancies and reorganisation costs
and unallocated central overheads amounted to Pounds 216,000.
Losses per share were 1.9p, against earnings of 3.7p. An interim dividend of
1.5p is declared in lieu of a final.
Mr Philip Swinstead, who became chief executive in June last year, said
Comac's agency business had been integrated into CSS Trident's operations
with the closure of all the former Comac offices and some 20 redundancies.
He said that some 1,261 contractors had been placed with clients by
December. The company intended to make its first moves in IT consultancy and
systems integration in 1994 in pursuit of its declared strategy of becoming
a broadly based computing services company. Growth would be both organic and
by acquisition.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Embassy seeks funds for investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Embassy Property Group, the development company, yesterday announced a
complex restructuring together with an Pounds 8.7m UK acquisition and a
Pounds 3m Chinese investment.
Skillion, a light industrial property specialist, is being bought from TR
Property Investment Trust for Pounds 8.72m, of which Pounds 4.72m will be
settled in cash and the rest in shares. The deal will leave TR Property with
an 8.67 per cent stake in Embassy.
The proposed investment in China is a 47,850 sq m mixed use development
close to the centre of Beijing. Embassy is buying a 25 per cent stake from
Mr YP Tse, a Hong Kong businessman, in a part-paper deal which will leave Mr
Tse with a 9.2 per cent shareholding in Embassy.
Mr Tai Yu Wong, Embassy chairman, said the Skillion acquisition would
provide a strong asset base. The planned Beijing investment would be the
first of a number of opportunities in China and east Asia.
Some Pounds 15.2m is being raised from a placing and open offer of 1.6bn
ordinary shares at 1p each by Singer &amp; Friedlander. The company plans a
capital reorganisation, which will include the reduction in nominal value of
each existing ordinary share from 5p to 1p. It has applied to move from the
USM to the Official List.
Dealings in the new shares are expected to begin on March 31. The proposals
will increase the company's market capitalisation from Pounds 3.1m to about
Pounds 21.7m.
Embassy also announced yesterday a pre-tax loss of Pounds 454,000 for the
six months to September 30. In the previous first half it made Pounds 4m
before tax. Losses per share of 0.4p compared with earnings of 26p.
Mr Michael Kingshott, managing director of Skillion, and Mr Barry Russell, a
Skillion director, are joining the board.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Trans World up 54% to Pounds 1.74m -
Oyston's plan to sell stake may lead to a battle for control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trans World Communications, the independent radio group where former
chairman Mr Owen Oyston's 24 per cent stake is for sale, reported a 54 per
cent jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 1.74m for 1993.
But the shares slipped by 13p to 165p yesterday, having risen by more than
60 per cent in the last month.
Mr John Whitney, chairman, would not speculate on where Mr Oyston's shares
might go. 'Only time will tell,' he said.
Mr Oyston's plan to sell his stake may lead to a battle for control of the
company involving Emap, the publishing group which owns almost 30 per cent
of the shares, and the Guardian newspaper group which has 20 per cent.
The Guardian is unable to increase its stake under current rules on
cross-media ownership. But these are expected to be relaxed later this year
following a review by Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary.
At present, Trans World can own only one more major local radio licence and
will be applying for an FM licence for London in the spring.
Mr Whitney predicts the rules will be changed to allow newspaper groups to
own radio stations and that the market share limit will be raised to 25 per
cent.
Shares in radio companies have risen sharply over the last few months on
hopes of a wave of takeover bids and signs of a strong recovery in
advertising revenue.
Trans World recorded an 11 per cent increase for the year, pushing total
sales up by Pounds 1.15m to Pounds 13.3m.
Operating profits jumped by Pounds 678,000 to Pounds 1.71m, but a return to
a near-normal tax charge of 28 per cent left earnings at 3.1p. A final
dividend of 1p lifts the total to 1.3p (0.8p).
COMMENT
Even after boiling over yesterday, Trans World shares are trading on a
frothy 53 times historic earnings. But the rating should fall sharply this
year. Given that three quarters of the company's costs are fixed, it would
require advertising growth of only 15 per cent - compared with industry
forecasts of 20 per cent - for profits to top Pounds 3m, reducing the
multiple to about 30. Relaxation of ITV ownership rules pushed television
ratings almost as high and that for a sector which is losing advertising
share, while independent radio is starting to make the inroads it has long
promised. Add Mr Oyston's stake to the mix and there may be life in the
shares yet.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hanson asset sale raises Dollars 54m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson is maintaining the pace of asset sales with the Dollars 54m (Pounds
37m) disposal of its half share in North Texas Cement and 15 ready mixed
concrete plants. The move continues its strategy of concentrating the US
building materials business on aggregates.
The net value of the assets being sold was Dollars 45m at December 31, and
in the year to September 30 1993 they contributed operating income of
Dollars 3m.
Ash Grove Cement, of Kansas, bought the stake in North Texas Cement, while
the ready mixed plants, located in the Dallas and Fort Worth areas, were
sold to Pioneer Concrete of Texas.
The deal brings to Dollars 500m the proceeds from sales in the US so far
this financial year. The largest was the flotation of Beazer Homes USA, its
US housebuilding business which raised Dollars 232m. Hanson also completed
the sale of its US office products business for Dollars 162.5m this week.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ABC to take Unique Broadcasting stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABC of the US has reached agreement in principle to take a significant
minority stake in Unique Broadcasting, the independent producer that makes
radio programmes for commercial radio stations in the UK and the BBC.
Unique, in which Capital Radio, the London commercial broadcaster, has a 24
per cent stake, produces programmes such as the Pepsi Network Chart Show for
commercial radio, Rock Line for BBC Radio 1 and interval talks for Radio 3.
ABC, which is interested in increasing its presence in the independent
sector, is likely to take a stake of about 20 per cent in Unique, although
this could rise later.
ABC already owns a 33 per cent stake in Satellite Media Services in the UK.
In the US the company has been developing streams of radio services
delivered by satellite to local stations all over America. This helps local
stations cut costs.
It is likely that ABC may be planning something similar in partnership with
Unique, which was founded by Mr Simon Cole and Mr Tim Blackmore, who hold
about 25 per cent each.
It is believed that, as part of the strategy, ABC is in talks with the
Financial Times about the possibility of creating an FT radio service for
distribution to UK commercial radio stations.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Freeman ahead of forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Freeman Group, the building products company which is the subject of an
agreed bid from Sheffield Insulations, announced profits for 1993 ahead of
the forecast in last month's offer document.
Directors had estimated that the pre-tax outcome for the year to
end-December would be not less than Pounds 950,000. In the event, the
USM-quoted group turned in a profit of a little more than Pounds 1m, against
Pounds 496,000.
The improvement was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 58.6m to Pounds
64.3m. The pre-tax advance was boosted by the release of a Pounds 40,000
provision for expenses on discontinued operations, against a Pounds 310,000
charge last time.
Earnings per share on an FRS 3 basis came out at 10.4p (2.7p).
A second interim dividend of 4p has already been declared, which will be
paid within 14 days of the offer becoming unconditional. This will raise the
year's pay-out to 6p (5p).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perkins Foods has completed the restructuring of its debt profile with a
Pounds 30m multi-currency revolving credit facility. This follows a Pounds
32m, 10 year private placement arranged in the US last December.
Mr Ian Blackburn, finance director, said the new facility, which lasts for
four years and can be drawn in any European currency, would cover the
possible redemption of the group's D-mark convertible bonds. It gives the
group a more structured debt profile, he said.
Both the private placement and new facility have covenants that take account
of the substantial goodwill write-offs the group has taken because of its
acquisitive past. A large part of the Pounds 150m of goodwill written off is
treated in the covenants as an asset.
The facility was arranged by Barclays Bank and the other banks involved are
Nationale Investeringsbank, ABN Amro Bank and Berliner Handels-und
Franfurter Bank.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dollars 31.5m US aggregates acquisition for
ECC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English China Clays, the industrial minerals, speciality chemicals and
construction materials group, has bought Kost Brothers, a US aggregates,
ready-mix concrete, contracting and building block manufacturer, for Dollars
31.5m (Pounds 21.5m) cash.
Kost has net cash of Dollars 7m, giving a net purchase price of Dollars
24.5m, and assets worth Dollars 17m before a revaluation of its reserves. In
the year to February 28 Kost is expected to have made an operating profit of
Dollars 4.7m.
Mr Alan Shearer, managing director of the construction materials division,
said that Kost was a private company and its reserves had not been valued
for several years, so were likely to be worth more than book value.
Kost's reserves were 'substantial' with a life of over 50 years. He said
there was likely to be a small goodwill element in the purchase.
ECC is expected to announce details shortly of the demerger of the
construction materials division, possibly at the time of its full year
results on March 14. This will involve giving new shares in the division to
ECC shareholders on a pro rata basis.
Kost is based in the Fargo/Moorhead area on the North Dakota/Minnesota
border where it has a leading market share. As such it is relatively close
to ECC's other US construction materials operations in Denver, Colorado and
Minneapolis/St Pauls, Minnesota.
ECC said the deal furthered its strategy of being an aggregate-led,
regionally based business in the US.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Disposal of Devenish stake behind rise at
Boddington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boddington, the pubs, leisure and healthcare group, produced an 87 per cent
rise in pre-tax profit in the year to January 2, thanks almost entirely to
the disposal of its stake in Devenish, the rival pub group. At the trading
level, profits were up less than 1 per cent.
Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, said this was a 'continued strong performance in
very difficult market conditions'. Trading in the year to date, he said, had
been ahead of last year.
Sales were Pounds 242.3m (Pounds 236.2m). Trading profits were Pounds 32.7m
against Pounds 32.4m. However, the company pointed out that 1992 had been a
53-week year. Adjusting for that, the underlying growth in trading profit
was 5 per cent.
Trading profit in the pubs division was Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 22.7m), with
beer volumes down 3.1 per cent. Leisure hotels made Pounds 2.8m (Pounds
1.6m). Drinks wholesaling profits were unchanged at Pounds 7.5m. Mr Cassidy
said there are signs that the price war of the past couple of years may be
changing. Profits in health care, hit by the introduction of the Community
Care Act last spring, were also unchanged, at Pounds 3.2m.
After a Pounds 14.7m profit on the Devenish sale, and net interest charges
reduced from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 4.7m by the Pounds 37m sale proceeds,
pre-tax profit was Pounds 41.2m (Pounds 22m). Earnings per share, excluding
disposal profits and exceptionals, were up 9.9 per cent at 17.8p. The annual
dividend is raised 10 per cent to 8.03p with a final of 5.17p.
Mr Cassidy said the supply agreement whereby Whitbread supplies Boddington
with beer brands, including Boddington bitter and Stella Artois lager, had
been extended to 2000. The price would be tied to the general rate of
inflation.
COMMENT
Though underlying profits are flat this is not a bad performance in
Boddington's markets. In particular, both the wholesaling and nursing homes
divisions had to cope with supposedly temporary problems. This year, the
market expects about 10 per cent growth in earnings: a full year's use of
the money from the Devenish sale is worth 2 per cent on earnings alone. On
that basis the shares - unchanged at 273p in yesterday's falling market -
are on an apparently undemanding multiple of 14. The unsettling factor in
the near term is that Whitbread must unload 5 per cent of the equity.
Further out, Boddington is contracted to take the bulk of the beer it sells
through its pubs at prices linked to the RPI until the millennium. But what
if the beer price falls?

<TEXT>
BrightReasons, the private company which owns the Pizzaland restaurant
chain, yesterday announced an expansion plan which could pave the way for a
flotation.
The group, which operates 160 pizza and pasta restaurants around the UK,
said it was acquiring a further six outlets in Scotland and one in England
for an undisclosed sum.
Mr Michael Guthrie, group chairman, said the acquisition from
Edinburgh-based Pizza Gallery had been funded by loans from Samuel Montagu,
Bank of Scotland and Banque Indosuez.
Mr Guthrie, a former chairman and chief executive of Mecca Leisure, said
yesterday: 'We are now considering a float, but it's not imminent.'
The group was committed to further expansion, and intended to spend up to
Pounds 4m developing operations in Scotland, where it now has 22 outlets.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hollas seeks Pounds 17.3m to fund purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hollas Group, the Manchester-based clothing and textiles group, yesterday
announced a Pounds 17.3m rights issue that will double the size of the
company.
The proceeds will be used to acquire two companies - Textilion, a maker of
ladies' wear, knitwear and children's clothing, and JB Hunter, holding
company of Edward Macbean, which specialises in making clothing for foul
weather.
The purchases are conditional on shareholder approval at an EGM on March 25.
The 5-for-4 rights issue of 73m ordinary shares, fully underwritten by
Charterhouse Tilney Securities, will be at 25p a share. The shares closed at
31p, down 1p.
In January Hollas announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 254,000 for the six
months to end-September following a review of its activities by the new
management team which resulted in exceptional costs of Pounds 705,000.
Yesterday it forecast a final dividend of 0.3p for the enlarged share
capital, giving a total of 0.6p for the year.
Hollas is paying Pounds 5m for Textilion, subject to a downward adjustment
if pre-tax profits for the year to end-February come in at less than Pounds
440,000 or if net assets are below Pounds 2.59m. In the 1993 year Textilion
made operating profits of Pounds 442,000 on turnover of Pounds 2.2m. Net
debt at February 4 this year was Pounds 5.6m.
The initial consideration for Hunter is Pounds 3.48m, subject to downward
adjustment if it does not make a pre-tax profit for the 13 months to March
31 or if net assets are below Pounds 775,000. In the year to February 26
1993 Hunter made operating profits of Pounds 627,000 on turnover of Pounds
6.85m. Net debt at February 4 was Pounds 1.3m.
Mr Julian Lee, who came out of retirement to become group chief executive of
Hollas in October, said the company had been drifting sideways for several
years.
Textilion, whose customers include Marks and Spencer, Next and Boots, would
complement Gardner, the clothing importer at the heart of Hollas, whose
customers include BHS and Woolworths, Mr Lee said.
Edward Macbean's protective clothing was a new direction for Hollas. But the
potential for quality goods in the health and safety equipment area was
tremendous in both the UK and Europe, he said.
Mr Lee, who has 2.7m shares, plans to take up all his rights.
On Tuesday Mr Jaymin Trivedi, the biggest shareholder with 13 per cent,
resigned as a non-executive director because he felt there would be a
conflict of interest after the acquisition. He wanted to take up 100 per
cent of his rights, but has agreed to take up only 80 per cent.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Court clears Europa merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proposed three-way merger involving Europa Minerals, a small UK-quoted
finance house, and two Australian companies with which it already has close
links - Burmine and Austmin Gold - looked virtually certain to go ahead last
night.
The Western Australian Supreme Court yesterday ruled in Burmine's favour and
against Mount Edon, another Australian company which has made a hostile bid
for Burmine and is attempting to block the three-way merger.
Burmine hopes to implement this by making a recommended Pounds 15m offer for
Europa and a separate agreed bid for Austmin.
Mount Edon already owns 22.6 per cent of Burmine and previously had a 19.9
per cent shareholding in Europa. Mount Edon sold the Europa stake last week
in the hope that it would therefore be able to vote at the Burmine meeting
called to approve the mergers.
However, the court yesterday upheld the decision of the independent
scrutineers to disregard the Mount Edon votes.

FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: CRH advances 33% to IPounds
76.5m - Acquisitions and better profit margins in US provide main growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRH, the Dublin-based construction and building materials group, reported a
33 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits from IPounds 57.6m to IPounds
76.5m (Pounds 74m) on turnover up 28 per cent to IPounds 1.43bn, against
IPounds 1.11m.
The strongest growth occurred in the US through acquisitions and improved
profit margins. The US now provides a quarter of sales and 32 per cent of
trading profits with IPounds 30.1m (IPounds 15.4m). Growth of 5 per cent in
construction activity is forecast for 1994.
Profit margins in Ireland and on the European mainland were further squeezed
in 1993 resulting in trading profits of IPounds 31m (IPounds 32.1m) for
Ireland and IPounds 21.9m (IPounds 20.7m) for Europe.
Losses continued in Spain offset by strong profit contributions from
acquisitions in the Netherlands. Analysts expect the Spanish activities to
return to profit with an improvement in market conditions, although this is
not expected before 1995.
Trading profits for the UK rose to IPounds 11.9m (IPounds 3.96m) and volume
growth and improved margins point to further recovery there in 1994.
Last September's IPounds 147m rights issue substantially improved the
balance sheet, bringing down net year-end borrowings to IPounds 66.6m for
gearing of 11 per cent, against 47 per cent a year earlier.
The group is in a strong position for further acquisitions, which are being
planned in the US and the Benelux countries.
Further improvement is expected in the present year due to increased
construction in Ireland, the UK and the US, although continued difficult
trading is expected in Spain and a slight decline in activity is forecast in
the Netherlands.
Earnings per share were up 27 per cent to 19.8p (15.6p) and a final dividend
of 4.96p is recommended for a total of 7.23p (6.75p).
Mr Harry Sheridan, finance director, said dividend cover had improved to
2.55 times, 'which underpins our ability to maintain a policy of steadily
increasing the dividend'.
COMMENT
After two years of falling profits, the group's diversification into the US
and European mainland is helping the bottom line. With the exception of
Spain, management seems to be coping successfully with bedding-in its
acquisitions. The strong balance sheet positions it well to take advantage
of recovery in its main markets. Pre-tax profits exceeding IPounds 90m seem
likely this year giving a prospective p/e of about 16. This lags far behind
CRH's peers, suggesting a buying opportunity. Indeed, non-Irish shareholders
increased their stake in the company from 8 per cent to 37 per cent over the
past year.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Continental slump pulls down GKN: UK group suffers 'worst
fall in vehicle production' as French carmaker warns on orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, yesterday blamed a 20
per cent fall in profits on declining vehicle production in continental
Europe.
Pre-tax profits fell Pounds 24.3m to Pounds 97.5m last year, and the company
warned that redundancies and non-core disposals were inevitable.
Sir David Lees, chairman, said: 'We've seen the worst fall in car and truck
production ever recorded in continental Europe. There's not been a year like
this since the second world war.'
Redundancies are most likely in continental Europe, where demand for GKN's
automotive components has fallen sharply.
GKN - embroiled in a Pounds 496m hostile bid for Westland, the helicopter
maker - claimed continental car production had fallen 20 per cent, while
commercial vehicle output was down 26 per cent.
Faced with uncertain markets, Sir David warned that reorganisation and
redundancies costs - up 54 per cent at Pounds 19.9m - would be a recurring
feature. Those costs led to a 15.4 per cent fall in operating profits to
Pounds 106.5m.
Although the group received Pounds 26.6m from associated companies, compared
with Pounds 24.2m, their contribution was undermined by Pounds 19m of losses
at UES Holdings, the steelmaker in which GKN has a 39.1 per cent stake.
Sir David said that GKN no longer wanted to be involved in steelmaking and
intended to focus on three core areas: automotive engineering, industrial
services and defence.
Of those areas, automotive and engineered products - including GKN Defence -
saw operating profits fall 20 per cent to Pounds 76m on flat turnover of
Pounds 1.56bn.
Profits in the industrial services and distribution division, embracing
pallet hire, were unchanged at Pounds 31m on reduced sales of Pounds 463m,
against Pounds 471m.
Sales by associated companies helped group turnover increase to Pounds
2.64bn, from Pounds 2.53bn.
Mr David Turner, finance director, warned: 'Divestments must continue. The
number of businesses in GKN will slowly but surely fall.' Redundancy and
restructuring costs would exceed Pounds 10m this year as staffing - reduced
by 1,800 to 26,400 last year - was cut further, he added.
The company was placing greater emphasis on joint ventures in emerging
markets and increasing components capacity in the US, where it has embarked
on a Dollars 50m expansion.
It also predicted that profits in continental Europe, which fell more than
43 per cent to Pounds 38m, would pick up in 1994. It based that optimism on
internal estimates that European car production would increase by 4 per
cent, a figure queried by industry analysts.
Earnings per share fell to 18.7p, compared with Pounds 20.6p. The dividend
is unchanged at 20.5p.

FT  03 MAR 94 / C&amp;W seeks Ireland venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Cable and Wireless has this week made an offer to Telecom Eireann, the Irish
state telecommunications company, to establish a joint venture in Ireland
which would handle the bulk of the country's international calls.
Although details have not yet been released, it is understood that the
British group is prepared to invest several hundred millions of pounds for a
minority stake in the new venture, leaving Telecom Eireann with a
controlling interest.
A spokesman for Cable and Wireless said last night that a proposal was
submitted earlier this week to Telecom Eireann and the Irish government to
establish 'a strategic alliance' between the two companies.
The proposal comes after almost a year of negotiations, following a bid last
May by Cable and Wireless to take a 25 per cent stake by Telecom Eireann.
That bid was rejected by the government following fierce political
opposition to any privatisation of the state-run monopoly.
At the time, Mr Brian Cowan, the minister for telecommunications, said
'privatisation is not on the agenda'. In a statement last night Mr Cowan
confirmed that Telecom Eireann has been in talks with 'many overseas
telecommunication companies' with a view to establishing a joint venture.
Any eventual agreement, he said, would ensure that Telecom Eireann remained
'in effective public ownership'.
The Irish utility has debts approaching IPounds 1bn (Dollars 959m), and
independent analysts believe that a strategic alliance of the sort being
proposed by Cable and Wireless will be vital for the future of Telecom in a
deregulated EU market.
Privatisation is a highly sensitive political issue in Ireland however, and
even a partial privatisation of Telecom's lucrative international business
is likely to run into stiff political opposition especially from the Labour
party, the junior partner in the coalition government.
A joint venture with TE would be a logical step for C&amp;W in its bid to expand
in Europe. Although its main concern is Hong Kong Telecom, which last year
accounted for two-thirds of its pre-tax profits, it owns Mercury, the main
rival to British Telecommunications in the UK, and has interests in Sweden
and the Baltic.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Hedge fund muscle sized up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial resources deployed globally by highly leveraged hedge funds
could exceed the size of the UK government bond market.
Large and medium-sized hedge funds have an estimated Dollars 40bn-Dollars
45bn under management, according to MAR Hedge which tracks more than 100
large funds. But they exert a far greater impact on financial markets than
their nominal size would suggest because they are so highly leveraged.
Based on the MAR Hedge figures, if the funds have an average exposure of 10
times their nominal value, then they would account for global market
exposure of close to Dollars 500bn. To put this in perspective, the total
size of the UK government bond market is about Pounds 220bn, according to
BZW.
One head of bond trading in London said he believes that hedge funds'
leveraged positions in the government bond markets total around Dollars
120bn at present.
Heavy selling by hedge funds, particularly of European government bond
futures, has driven down the markets in the past fortnight. Concern about
these activities has prompted central bankers to launch inquiries about
banks' exposure to hedge funds.
While informal estimates put the total number of hedge funds at 800 to
3,000, many of these are relatively small and not widely followed. Ms Lois
Peltz, managing editor of MAR Hedge, said that industry estimates of money
under management range up to Dollars 100bn.
Ms Nicola Meaden who runs Tass Management, a fund database service,
estimates that the top 10-12 hedge funds 'probably have about Dollars 30bn
under management'. These funds include Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund, the
biggest of the hedge funds.
The degree of leverage varies between funds, so that market exposure ranges
from twice to 20 times their nominal size. By buying bond futures, for
example, hedge fund managers can create highly leveraged positions in the
fixed income markets, which can then drive prices in the cash market.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Crunch time looms for the motor crowd: Richard Lapper
examines UK insurers' shift towards direct sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No sooner have UK insurers enjoyed the fruits of premium increases in their
much-improved 1993 profits, than the threat of heavy price competition looms
in a crowded corner of the market. Premium rates are already starting to
fall in some areas of the fragmented Pounds 6bn-a-year motor market, and
many observers predict an acceleration.
This week's launch of Guardian Royal Exchange's telephone-based subsidiary
Guardian Direct highlights an inexorable trend in motor insurance - and to a
lesser extent in home cover - towards direct sales and away from the broker
as an independent intermediary.
Direct writers - which can enjoy cost advantages over rivals dependent on
traditional broker outlets - are increasing their market share at an
impressive pace. Last year, for example, Direct Line - a company formed only
in 1985 - became the biggest motor insurer in the country, increasing
policyholders from 771,000 at the end of 1992 to 1.4m. Churchill, owned by
the Swiss insurer Winterthur, is the second biggest direct writer with
470,000 policyholders.
Mr Oliver Steel, an analyst with securities house Kleinwort Benson,
estimates that direct sellers increased their market share from 17 to 22 per
cent in 1993. This was driven by the telephone-based players which now cover
roughly 3m of the UK's 18.5m insured drivers. Most of the shift has been at
the expense of high street brokers.
Mr Steel expects direct writers to account for 40 per cent of all personal
lines business by the end of the decade, while some observers believe the
final figure could be as high as 80 per cent. 'Brokers appear to have most
to lose . . . In the main they will find larger portions of their business
disappearing down the telephone and by the end of the century, we forecast
this source of business to account for less than 20 per cent (of the
total),' Kleinwort Benson concludes.
These changes are already stretching the resources of managements who have
put their faith in broker-based distribution. Companies, such as Sun
Alliance, have invested heavily in acquiring chains of high street brokers
only to find the ground shifting from beneath their feet. In the view of
many observers, the big high street chains - Swinton, AA Insurance Services
and Safeguard - enjoyed their heyday in the early 1980s and face further
decline. 'The market is clearly in trauma. The composites are losing a major
distribution mechanism,' says one senior broker.
So far the impact of these changes on the price of motor insurance has been
unclear. With the help of more technically sophisticated techniques,
insurers have begun to change the way they price their risks. This is
illustrated by the higher rates charged to high-risk drivers, such as
younger motorists or those with fast cars. Mr John Carter, chief executive
of Commercial Union, says: 'Some rates will go down and others up'.
Many insurers have increased the 'excess' - the amount of a claim a
policyholder pays - to encourage drivers to become more safety and security
conscious, making it more difficult to make a direct comparison of
year-on-year premium rates.
Mr Keith Lugton, head of corporate relations at Guardian, draws attention to
another trend which has complicated matters. Guardian increased motor rates
by 8-10 per cent last year, following rises of 25 per cent in both 1991 and
1992. However comprehensive policy rates fell by an average of 1 per cent.
The bulk of the increased charges, with rises averaging 20 per cent,
affected non-comprehensive policies covering third party liability.
It has become less attractive to underwrite such policies because of the
virtual disappearance of the 'knock for knock' arrangement, designed to
reduce legal costs and simplify the payment of claims. Under 'knock for
knock', insurers agreed to pay claims presented by their policyholders
irrespective of their responsibility for the accident.
Most major insurers have now withdrawn from the scheme. They argue that
drivers with third party insurance are responsible for disproportionately
more accidents, and so the 'knock for knock' system involves underwriters of
comprehensive policies subsidising their less 'risk-averse' competitors.
Despite the complicated picture, few doubt that competitive pressures are
increasing. According to Mr Steven Bird, an analyst with Smith New Court,
the securities house, rates for comprehensive policies could fall by as much
as 15 per cent.
The downward pressure on prices could be fed by the efforts of smaller
direct writers to build up market share to offset their heavy investment in
technology and marketing. 'They'll inevitably concentrate on price. They
will maybe budget to lose money for their first three years,' suggests the
senior broker.
Traditional brokers are also joining in, with a number launching
telephone-based operations recently.
The implication is that private customers should enjoy cheaper and better
insurance, but some companies may not be around to offer it. 'There could
well be one or two players pulling out of the market or converting
themselves into niche companies,' says Mr Bird. Or as Mr Peter Wood, the
chief executive of Direct line, puts it: 'It is a big money business -
peanut players cannot survive.'

FT  03 MAR 94 / Vickers claims it has 'turned the corner'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vickers, the UK engineering group which makes tanks and Rolls-Royce cars,
claimed to have 'turned the corner' last year by making pre-tax profits of
Pounds 32.3m, compared with losses of Pounds 36.6m. Sir Richard Lloyd,
chairman, said: 'Having fought for and won our survival, the Vickers group
is now in a position to pursue growth in 1994.'
Group turnover fell 4 per cent to Pounds 690m in the year to December 31.
Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive, said a squeeze on working capital
contributed to a net cash inflow of Pounds 58m, compared with an outflow of
Pounds 40m. The proceeds of last March's Pounds 60.3m rights issue helped
the group to net cash of Pounds 18.6m at the year-end, compared with
borrowings of Pounds 100m.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the luxury car subsidiary, managed to break even
following two years of heavy losses. The operation has been drastically
restructured to take account of a steep fall in sales.
Worldwide retail sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars stabilised last year
at 1,360 compared with 1,378 in 1992, and the business returned to profit in
the final quarter.
Overall Vickers' automotive operations, which include the Cosworth engines
and castings businesses, made a trading profit of Pounds 10.5m compared with
a Pounds 15.8m loss in 1992. Most of the profit was generated by Cosworth,
which had a successful year in both Formula 1 and the IndyCar series in the
US.
Sir Colin said Rolls-Royce Motor Cars did not have the financial resources
to develop a new model generation alone. It planned to evolve the present
models, but would need some form of partnership during the second half of
the 1990s.
Operating profits from defence rose from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 10.3m,
although sales were down from Pounds 179m to Pounds 145m. Sir Colin did not
expect any firm orders from the UK for new Challenger 2 tanks before May,
despite December's announcement that the Ministry of Defence intended to
purchase up to 259.
Sales in the new turbine technology and propulsion division, which combines
the group's aerospace and principal marine engineering business, fell from
Pounds 145m to Pounds 137m, and operating profits from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds
9m.
However, cost cuts and intensive marketing helped the medical division
recover strongly, with operating profits up from Pounds 5.9m to Pounds 9.7m.
Earnings per share of 8p compared with a loss of 12.1p last time. A final
dividend of 1.75p gives a total of 3p (1.5p).

FT  03 MAR 94 / Channel tunnellers aim for alpine projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British companies which built the Channel tunnel will today meet the Swiss
transport minister in a bid to win a share of vast tunnelling projects
planned through the Alps.
The Swiss, who last month voted in a referendum to ban transit lorries
through the Alps from 2004, plan to invest about SFr60bn (Pounds 28bn) in
public transport projects over the next 15 years.
A presentation to the minister, Mr Adolf Ogi, and senior Swiss transport
officials has been arranged in London by Mr Richard Needham, British trade
minister.
He wants UK companies to take advantage of the successful construction of
the Channel tunnel to capture work on large transport projects overseas.
The presentation will be led by Mr Haro Bedelian, chief executive of
Transmanche Link, the Anglo-French consortium which built the tunnel.
Mr Bedelian will represent the five British members of Transmanche Link:
Balfour Beatty, Costain, Tarmac, Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey.
Mr Ogi will later meet British executives of Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel
operator, to discuss the problems of privately financing and managing large
construction projects.
At the heart of the Swiss government proposals are plans to expand
trans-Alpine rail capacity to ease the strain on roads crowded with lorries
passing through the country to other destinations.
The project, known as Neat (new alpine transversal tunnel), would involve
two low-altitude rail tunnels through the Alps allowing trains to pass
through them at high speed.
One 57km tunnel under the St Gotthard Pass would be the world's longest rail
tunnel. Another 30km tunnel would run under the Lotschberg between the Berne
and Valais cantons.
A cost of SFr14.9bn for the Neat project was approved in a referendum in
1992, although the final price is widely expected to be at least double that
figure.
Test borings have begun and the first tenders for large-scale exploratory
work were published last August.
A few British companies are believed to have prequalified to bid for the
work and contracts are due to be awarded late in the spring.
The scale of the project means that Swiss companies, which are likely to
dominate management and construction, will need to sub-contract some of the
work to foreign companies.
British groups have been advised that they should join consortia led by
Swiss companies.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Independent bid seeks to escape monopolies probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consortium which is close to taking control of The Independent and
Independent on Sunday will today urge the Department of Trade and Industry
not to refer the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The bidding group, which includes Mirror Group Newspapers, will emphasise
that the delay and uncertainty of an MMC reference could seriously damage
the two newspapers, which face losses of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m
this year.
DTI approval is the last hurdle after the decision yesterday by independent
directors of Newspaper Publishing, owner of the Independent titles, to
recommend an improved offer from the Mirror's group which values the company
at more than Pounds 74m.
The new offer includes an increased cash alternative of 355p - 5p more than
the price paid by Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland for
its stake of just under 30 per cent.
The consortium is offering 104.6p in cash and 1.35 new MGN shares. At MGN's
share price of 172p at offer announcement, this values the deal at 336.7p.
Journalists at The Independent, worried about the editorial independence of
the papers, last night renewed their call for a full MMC investigation.
If the deal goes through, MGN will have between 25 per cent and 30 per cent
of the company, but its voting stake will be 10 per cent less than its share
stake. Existing Newspaper Publishing shareholders El Pais of Spain and La
Repubblica of Italy will each hold 20 per cent, but together will have a
voting majority.
The founders, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith who will become chairman as
well as editor-in-chief, will hold about 3 per cent rather than the present
10 per cent.
The Irish Independent group will now press for board representation at
Newspaper Publishing to reflect its status as the largest single
shareholder.
The signs are that Mr O'Reilly will not sell his stake but will seek to
remain an influential minority shareholder. He has given undertakings to the
Takeover Panel not to make a bid worth more than 350p within 12 months.

FT  03 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Vickers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those investors who coughed up Pounds 60m for Vickers' rights issue last
year have found their virtue rewarded. The loss of blood at Rolls-Royce
Motors, which had threatened the company, has been stemmed. Working capital
and cashflow have been substantially improved, albeit with the assistance of
advance payments from the Ministry of Defence. Cosworth engines had a good
year in both Formula One and IndyCar motor sport. The dividend is back on an
upward track.
Now shareholders must weigh how much of Vickers' future prospects are
already discounted by the share price. Another Challenger 2 tank order may
well be forthcoming from the MoD, but the timing of deliveries will only
maintain the current level of production. Further overseas orders, which
would provide a boost, are more speculative. Cosworth may well continue to
prosper in the precarious world of racing, but the collapsing market for
Ford Cosworth road cars is unlikely to recover in the foreseeable future.
While Rolls-Royce Motors has stabilised, overall demand is not rising yet.
Indeed, in the US there is little sign of renewed interest, despite the
strong economic growth. Fears that the market has shrunk for good are
probably overdone, but the concern may hold the share price back
nevertheless. And however much the company argues that Rolls-Royce can
progress through piecemeal joint ventures, a long-term strategic partner is
needed to develop a new model. Rolls is still a one horse company and cannot
afford to bet everything on changing models alone.

<TEXT>
The sharp fall in European bonds and equities will have left the French
monetary authorities shifting particularly uneasily in their seats. Not only
will the government have to pay more for the money it raises at today's
FFr18bn-20bn bond auction to finance its budget deficit, it must also be
growing anxious about its privatisation programme, given the 9 per cent fall
in the CAC 40 from last month's peak. The shares of recently-privatised
stocks, such as Rhone-Poulenc and Elf Aquitaine, are hovering close to their
offer prices. That suggests future issues may have to be priced much more
cheaply.
The bigger fear, though, is that France's precarious economy may be tipped
back into recession if the trend in long bond yields persists. The Bank of
France attaches great importance to long-term interest rates as a
determinant of economic activity. It must be disconcerted that benchmark
bond yields have risen almost 1 point to 6.4 per cent this year - especially
given that the burden has been magnified by a corresponding fall in
inflation.
Such worries must reinforce the impulse to cut short-term interest rates
further. Yet given how deeply the franc fort policy is ingrained in French
thinking, the monetary authorities' hands will continue to be tied by the
Bundesbank's actions. Mr Edouard Balladur's latest stimulus package may buy
the French economy time before the monetary constraints can be eased. But
the risks appear to be escalating just when the French government could have
expected them to fall.

FT  03 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What threatened to be a nasty bang for UK equities turned into an
uncomfortable whimper. After yesterday's 22.5 point fall, though, the FT-SE
100 index stands 8 per cent below the peak reached a month ago. Whether that
can be dismissed as a healthy correction or marks the begining of a bear
phase now turns on developments in the bond markets, not just in Germany.
Given the fog that surrounds US monetary policy following Tuesday's data,
investors might be forgiven for feeling thoroughly unsighted.
Even if bond markets did now recover some poise, these issues will not be
resolved quickly. While a yield ratio of around two hardly suggests that UK
equities are overvalued when judged against gilts, any further rise in bond
yields would doubtless spill over. The main comfort must be that - as the
Treasury's monthly monetary report yesterday confirmed - the domestic
inflation indicators remain unthreatening.
But neither is it easy to argue that UK equities are cheap in their own
right. The market's reluctance to see the FT-SE 100 below 3,200 yesterday
points to some support at this level. Yet a multiple of around 15 times this
year's forecast earnings still demands an optimistic view of profits growth.
The results season has offered some encouragement. The worry must now be
that higher real long-term interest rates will undermine recovery in Europe
and profits growth in the UK.

FT  03 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Too many marks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to dismiss the 20.6 per cent growth in Germany's January M3
money supply as meaningless. The figure is a crude annualisation of only one
month's worth of data. Some of the rise in private sector lending reflects
changes in the tax rules on mortgages. The difficulty, though, lies in
knowing how much. Since the outcome was so far in excess of market
expectations, the risk is that underlying money supply growth is still
higher than the Bundesbank intends.
The public importance it attaches to this particular indicator puts the
central bank in a dilemma. Even if money supply remains flat in February,
annualised growth over the first two months of the year will still be 13 per
cent. There may be quite a debate in Germany about the relevance of M3. But
while it is growing so fast, the chances are that the Bundesbank will
continue the glacial pace of interest rate cuts implicit in this week's 3
basis point fall in its money market repurchase rate. Although inflation is
coming down and the economy is weak, it has to worry about losing
credibility.
The irony is that, by encouraging domestic investors to hold money on short
term deposit, this may delay the slowdown of money supply growth. Until the
yield curve steepens, there is limited incentive to buy bonds, especially in
these nervous markets. Bond markets yesterday went down because they were
afraid that the Bundesbank would not cut rates, not because they were
worried it would unleash inflation by doing so. A yield of nearly 7 per cent
on 30-year government issues is attractive with inflation already below 3
per cent in Bavaria. Investors might realise that sooner if the Bundesbank
were not so short-sighted.

Another rat deserting the sinking ship? Definitely not, says Chris Huhne,

Monro-Davies's IBCA, the fast-growing European rating agency.
Having worked on the The Guardian and The Economist and tried to get into
politics - he stood unsuccessfully as an SDP candidate against John Patten -
he's going to try his hand at rating sovereign debt.
Up to now, IBCA has prospered as a niche rating agency. But Huhne's arrival
signals that it wants to compete head on with the big boys - Moody's and
Standard &amp; Poor's. An old pal of Lord Lever - they co-authored Debt and
Danger - Huhne is fascinated by emerging markets. So's everybody else these

What did Michael Portillo say at Eton? The chief secretary to the Treasury
still seems to be having trouble shaking off his unfortunate 'corrupt
foreigners' gaffe, made over a month ago.
Efforts to wipe the slate clean by apologising were spoilt by the revelation
that he had made the same remarks not once but twice, at Eton and then more
publicly later at Southampton.
Hence, when challenged by a Dutch journalist at the Foreign Press
Association yesterday, he was quick to set the record straight. Portillo
noted that an Eton master had written to the Evening Standard to confirm his
version of the events.
But when Observer contacted the Standard last night, no one could find the
letter. Typical.

The English claim to have invented fair play. No one's fooled by that old
chestnut, however, least of all the French, it seems.
'Chanteclair', a pseudonymous French author, reckons that British notions of
fair play are risible. In practice, it's claimed, the idea is for export
only, designed to weaken and humiliate the opposition.
Chanteclair's new book, Pour en finir avec l'Anglais (roughly translated as
'To have done with English'), dishes out abuse, depicting the English as the
'dirtiest', 'beastliest' and 'most hypocritical' of nations. It's gone down
a storm - in France.
Well, how's this for fair play, old chap? The London Tourist Board is
spending Pounds 30m over the next three years on an advertising campaign
promoting the capital to British, American, Japanese and continental
European tourists. British-owned advertising agencies Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and
Ogilvy &amp; Mather - presumably having played as fair as advertising agencies
do in this sort of thing - were pipped at the post by none other than
Publicis, one of France's leading advertising groups. Pour encourager les
autres, presumably.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pure coincidence, we assure you, but international financier George Soros
just happened to be in Bonn yesterday when the Bundesbank's latest money
supply figures sent the financial markets into convulsions.
In fact Mr Midas thought silence was golden, at least about his position in
the shaky markets: 'There is a lot of instability in the financial markets .
. . I would prefer not to reinforce the turmoil.'
Gee, thanks George. On threats by central banks to investigate and clip the
wings of hedge funds like his own, he was positively angelic: 'It behoves
the regulators to regulate . . . we are ready to co-operate with them.' How
sweet.
Soros was actually in town to finger-wag about instability in eastern Europe
and the threat of turmoil on Bosnian lines in neighbouring Macedonia.
His Soros Foundations are heavily involved throughout the region, promoting
open societies and market economies.
Soros describes Macedonia as 'the only multi-ethnic state left in the
Balkans'. He has already lent it Dollars 25m.
So is he a Robin Hood type, reaping riches from the west in order to feed
bankrupt economies in the east? 'I don't think that I am really a Robin Hood
. . . my shareholders are not exactly poor people.'

FT  03 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Wider Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enlargement of the European Union to the east and the north has come closer
after Tuesday's accord in Brussels on entry terms for Sweden, Finland and
Austria. The deals still have to be approved by the European Parliament and
by national referendums later this year. Whether or not agreement can be
reached for Norway, the fourth applicant from the European Free Trade
Association, will depend on next week's haggling over fishing rights. If
these four states join on January 1 1995, the Union's population and gross
domestic product will increase respectively by 7.5 per cent and 9.5 per
cent, but its gains in economic resources and political values will be
greater.
These small but wealthy economies will bring net contributions to the EU's
budget. More important, the new members will spread the Union's commitment
to liberal democracy to the borders of the former communist bloc, preparing
the ground for the crucial next stage of enlargement towards central and
east Europe.
The Efta applicants, already part of the free trade arrangements of the
European Economic Area, want EU membership to gain a political stake in
Europe's development. However, in view of their electorates' scepticism
about the benefits, entry comes with a price tag. Reflecting this week's
agreements to offset the impact of reductions in Efta farm prices, the
newcomers' budgetary contributions will be phased in, and even by 1998 will
be around Ecu2bn less than earlier foreseen. This act of compensation
requires creative adjustment to EU financing rules. Yet, provided these
concessions secure Yes votes in the referendums, the price will be worth
paying.
Tuesday's agreement does, however, raise larger questions about the much
greater amounts of money at stake in the next phase of enlargement. The
German government can be expected to make extending membership to Hungary,
the Czech Republic and Poland a centrepiece of its six-month presidency of
the Union that starts in July. Further enlargement, perhaps by the year
2000, is highly desirable for political reasons. But the accession of
members with, at present, GDP per capita of less than 30 per cent of the EU
average cannot be contemplated without large changes in financial mechanisms
governing agricultural support and structural fund payments to poorer
regions.
Prof Richard Baldwin, in a book to be presented at the Centre for Economic
Policy Research in London next month, calculates that, on unchanged
policies, membership by the most advanced eastern European economies would
add a net Ecu58bn to the EU budget by 1999. This would require a 60 per cent
increase in 1999 budget contributions - a condition that could be met
neither by Germany, the largest contributor to the EU, which is already
complaining about its rising net payments, nor by Britain or France, the
other two main net contributors.
To increase the effectiveness of decision-making among a larger membership,
the EU needs to push through institutional changes that go beyond the modest
adjustments in voting procedures currently under discussion in Brussels.
However, assembling a majority for cuts in the EU's budgetary largesse for
present beneficiaries from 1999 onwards may prove impossible, in view of the
strong vested interests of farmers and the poorer southern countries. The
road to a wider Europe is now open. Yet, if the destination is to be
reached, the EU must find answers to questions of institutional and
financial reform that so far have barely been raised.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Southern discomfort: Albania and Macedonia's war of words
could lead to another Balkan tragedy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The war in Slovenia lasted a week. Eight Slovenes were killed. The war in
Croatia lasted six months, and killed an estimated 20,000. The war in
Bosnia-Hercegovina has lasted two years and killed 200,000. Each time, while
governments focused on ending one war, they failed to take action which
might have averted a worse one further south.
Now, while the US has persuaded Bosnian Croats and Moslems to sign a
federation agreement, and Russia is trying to coax the Bosnian Serbs into
line, an even more dangerous conflict is brewing in the former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia.
Macedonia, now recognised under the provisional name of 'Fyrom' in deference
to Greek sensibilities, has been subjected in the past fortnight to a Greek
blockade.
On February 16 Greece closed the frontier to goods traffic, denying
landlocked Macedonia the use of the Aegean port of Thessaloniki, which had
become its lifeline. Two days later Albania offered Macedonia the use of the
Adriatic port of Durres. Despite this gesture, Macedonia probably faces a
greater danger of war with Albania than it does with Greece. Within
Macedonia relations between the Slav majority and the ethnic Albanian
minority have been deteriorating rapidly.
Just how large a proportion of Macedonia's population the ethnic Albanians
form is a sensitive question. Albanian estimates of 40 per cent are probably
exaggerated if applied to the population as a whole, but may not be far out
for the younger generation. The mainly Moslem Albanians have a higher birth
rate than the Orthodox Slav Macedonian majority, who fear that they will
soon be outnumbered.
In the west of Macedonia, bordering on Albania, ethnic Albanians already
form a 70 per cent majority. Two years ago they voted for political and
territorial autonomy, but the government of Macedonia declared the
referendum illegal.
Until now Albanian political parties in Macedonia have not tried to insist
on autonomy. They are represented in Macedonia's coalition government but,
according to one of their leaders, Mahi Nesimi, 'Macedonian
parliamentarians, whether or not they belong to the coalition parties, are
uniformly tough in opposing Albanian demands'.
Last month the leading Albanian party in Macedonia, the party of Democratic
Prosperity, split. The moderate PDP leadership, including ministers and MPs,
walked out. The majority then elected a new leadership dominated by Mendu
Thaci, a 28-year-old radical who has warned that Albanians could secede from
Macedonia if they are not recognised as a 'constituent nation'.
This development was hailed with enthusiasm by the state-controlled
television in Albania. The media there have also been heaping scorn on
Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the Albanian majority in neighbouring Kosovo, the
formerly autonomous province now under Serbian control. In an unofficial
referendum in 1991, the Albanians of Kosovo (85 per cent of the population)
voted overwhelmingly for independence, but Mr Rugova has restrained them
from attempting violent resistance against the Serbian authorities. Once
backed by Albania, he is now attacked by the press in Albania as an
appeaser.
Albanians, like Serbs, see themselves as a fragmented nation. The borders of
the Albanian state fixed in 1913 left half of them outside it. Today there
are about 3m in Albania; 2m in Kosovo; 400,000-800,000 in Macedonia; 100,000
in Montenegro and southern Serbia; and an unknown number in Greece. There is
as yet little evidence that they are seeking to reunite in a 'greater
Albania' but, according to an article by Mr Nesimi in the current issue of
Balkan War Report, the Albanian state 'must aggressively support the
interests of Albanians in Kosovo, Macedonia and elsewhere in the region'.
President Salih Berisha of Albania, emboldened by a defence agreement with
the US signed last October and by Nato's new-found willingness to use force
against the Serbs in Bosnia, seems increasingly inclined to respond to such
appeals. He is encouraging more radical leaders in Kosovo and Macedonia, and
violence could break out in either place at any moment.
If violence does break out, it is certain to escalate. In Kosovo, the Serbs
would respond with 'ethnic cleansing'. In Macedonia, a leader of the main
opposition party, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation, has
warned that 'if the Albanians tried to get anything by force, there would be
a much more horrible war than any there has been yet in Yugoslavia'.
Skopje, Macedonia's capital, is an ethnically divided city. It has a Serb
minority whose grievances Belgrade has been fanning. Macedonia was once
known as 'southern Serbia', and Serbs would probably seek to reannex it if
it appeared to be collapsing in ethnic war.
Unlike previous wars, this potential conflict could not be contained within
the former Yugoslavia. Bulgaria recognises Macedonia as a state, but regards
its Slav inhabitants as part of the Bulgarian nation and would be under
great pressure to intervene on their side; Turkey would be equally tempted
to come to the aid of the Albanians.
This nightmare scenario is not yet inevitable. It may even seem far-fetched.
But so did the horrors further north, until they happened.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Euro-babble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the European Union's culture and information
commissioner, says Europe needs a flourishing film industry to encourage
diversity in audio-visual entertainment. Few would disagree. However, his
ideas for achieving that goal are so wide of the mark that he should tear up
his script.
He wants the EU to end a five-year exemption from competition law which
allows big Hollywood studios to distribute films jointly in Europe. He also
appears to favour stricter quotas on the broadcasting of foreign programmes.
That, he says, will enable Europe's film and television industry to counter
domination by Hollywood.
When reviewing the distribution exemption, the Commission's overriding
concern should be whether it benefits consumers. To champion the cause of
local producers, as Mr Pinheiro suggests, would be to pervert competition
law. Tightening broadcasting quotas, meanwhile, would further compromise
free trade principles while extending an objectionable attempt at
censorship.
The danger is that Mr Pinheiro's approach would gratuitously provoke the US,
which unsuccessfully sought to liberalise audio-visual services in the
Uruguay Round trade talks, without helping European programme producers. As
he admits, their problems stem largely from an inability to make material
viewers want to watch. In any case, any protection quotas might provide
would rapidly be undermined by communications technology. Unless Mr Pinheiro
can offer a better answer than blaming Europe's failures on others' success,
he should shut up.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Message of the markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond markets have taken fright. But the slide in bond prices is only in part
a response to changes in the fundamentals. It is also a technical correction
after a long bull market. The question now is how the monetary authorities
will - and should - respond to the adjustment, which has pushed the yield on
US long-dated bonds up one percentage point since the trough in October. UK
gilt yields have also risen by a percentage point since late December and
even those on German bunds are up 0.7 percentage points since the beginning
of January.
At a time of increasing nervousness, markets tend to respond wildly to each
new statistic. On Tuesday, it was the unexpected strength in the price index
of the US Purchasing Managers monthly survey and news that US gross domestic
product in the final quarter of last year grew at an annualised rate of 7.5
per cent. Yesterday, it was the turn of German money supply: the annualised
increase in M3 of 20.6 per cent above the average for the last three months
of 1993 sent shivers through the market.
The figure is freakish. Nonetheless, it exacerbates the dilemma already
confronting the Bundesbank, which has invested a lot of credibility in its
4-6 per cent target for M3 growth. The case for some such target is strong.
The government, investors and wage bargainers all need clear guidance about
the Bundesbank's intentions. But this advantage comes to naught if the
failure to achieve the target has constantly to be explained away. It is
particularly embarrassing when the Bundesbank feels forced to cut the
short-term rate of interest even though its money supply target is
overshooting.
Yet that is exactly what it has had to do, however slowly and unwillingly.
M3 seems to have been distorted, now by one thing, now by another, ever
since unification. As for the astounding January figure, the annualised rate
in the first month of a new year is inevitably volatile. In addition, the
figure has been distorted by several special factors.
The Bundesbank must now decide whether the persistent M3 overshooting is a
warning of future inflation or a false alarm. Certainly, the real economy is
not showing any sign of overheating. This being so, the Bundesbank will
presumably ignore the latest rise. But its desire to postpone further easing
until it has more information may be strengthened.
A strong additional reason for caution, from the Bundesbank's perspective,
is what has happened to bonds. The Bundesbank tends to pay particular
attention to long-term rates of interest because of their relatively large
role in German intermediation. But it will not be the only central bank to
respond with caution. Even if part of the reason for rising bond yields is
technical, part at least must be related to economic fundamentals. Cutting
short-term rates in the teeth of such a shift in expectations could lead to
a further flight from bonds, with damaging consequences, not least for
German economic recovery.
If a central bank is to cut interest rates in the face of rising long-term
rates, it must be confident that its relative optimism over inflation will
prove justified by events. Since they can no longer be so sure, central
banks must be more cautious than they would otherwise have been. They should
at least wait for the bond markets to settle down once more. For the moment,
therefore, the right action in the main financial centres seems to be none.
But it is too early to conclude that the trend towards lower short-term
rates in continental Europe and the UK is at an end.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Expensive treat for a poor relation: Major's trip to the US
eased tensions, but shifts in the relationship are apparent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget the cosy dinner in a Pittsburgh restaurant, the night spent in the
Lincoln suite at the White House and the ride on Air Force One. Mr Bill
Clinton played the gracious host in Washington this week. Mr John Major was
an appreciative guest. But a series of photo-opportunities does not add up
to a special relationship.
That is not to say that the trip was a failure. Mr Major returned to London
yesterday confident that it had taken much of the recent chill out of
Anglo-American relations. The trip to Pittsburgh - home for a time of Mr
Major's father and grandfather - was a corny but friendly gesture.
So, too, was the invitation to the prime minister to return to Washington on
the presidential jet before becoming the first British leader since Winston
Churchill to spend a night at the White House.
The US president was magnanimous also in his public comments. The phrase
'special relationship' never passed his lips. But at every opportunity he
stressed that disputes over Bosnia and Northern Ireland had not undermined
the solidity of ties with London.
The relaxed format of the visit eased some of the personal tension between
the two. If Mr Clinton is still irritated by the overt Conservative support
for former president George Bush in the elections, he does not show it. That
unfortunate episode is, in the words of one US official, 'dead and buried'.
The whole event, though, looked staged. Good friends do not have to go to
elaborate lengths to prove it. The prime minister's aides - continually
emphasising the special treatment he was receiving - fell into the trap of
mistaking form for substance.
For the UK journalists shadowing the two leaders, this was often
embarrassing. Mr Clinton appeared as the wealthy relative indulging a less
fortunate cousin with an expensive treat. Britain may still be a special
relation. It is also a poor one.
The US media treated Mr Major's appearance with casual indifference. They
did not, though, miss the happy coincidence that the Pittsburgh photocalls
allowed the president to do some useful campaigning for Democrat candidates
in the mid-term congressional elections. The most graphic image of the trip
was that of Mr Clinton's brand new Boeing 747 towering on the tarmac over Mr
Major's tiny, antiquated VC10. British prime ministers do not necessarily
prove they have a strong voice in Washington by travelling on Air Force One.
The substantive policy discussions the two leaders slotted in around the
interminable photographs provided the British side with greater cause for
satisfaction.
The real poison in Anglo-American relations over the past year has been the
two governments' differences over Bosnia rather than the awkward
juxtaposition of a Democrat at the White House and a Conservative in Downing
Street. Britain's consistent opposition to stronger western military
intervention in the conflict and to increased support for the Bosnian
Moslems has infuriated the US.
The combination of last month's successful Nato ultimatum in ending the
Serbian siege of Sarajevo and this week's visit has provided a partial
antidote.
Mr Major has accepted a more muscular stance by the United Nations forces on
the ground to extend the success in Sarajevo to other beleaguered cities. Mr
Clinton, with some success already, has raised the profile of the US in
brokering a political deal between the warring Croats and Moslems, hoping
the Serbs will fall into line.
If this strategy fails, differences could well re-emerge. The president made
it clear that in advance of an overall settlement he remains opposed to
committing US ground troops to Bosnia. The UK prime minister did not press
the opposite case only because he knew in advance that the answer would be
no.
But for the time being Mr Major was confident enough to declare: 'I think
there is no doubt that we see the problems of Bosnia very much in the same
light. Our policy is heading exactly in the same direction.'
The trip also allowed a line to be drawn under last month's row over
Northern Ireland. Mr Clinton did not apologise for allowing Mr Gerry Adams,
the leader of Sinn Fein and an apologist for the IRA's campaign of violence,
to visit the US. But he did go out of his way to emphasise US support for
last December's Anglo-Irish initiative as the only basis for a political
solution to the violence in the province.
In their private discussions Mr Clinton made it clear he would not allow Mr
Adams another propaganda coup unless and until the Sinn Fein leader had
renounced violence.
The president and prime minister were also on common ground over Russia.
Both have visited Moscow in the past two months. Both are now wary of
investing too much of their own political capital in the personal success of
Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president.
But they agree that the west must continue to support the reform process and
to buttress Mr Yeltsin's credibility by encouraging greater Russian
involvement in Nato and the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
Standing on the White House lawn, Mr Clinton promised 'tangible' evidence of
a much stronger partnership by the middle of this year. Mr Major nodded
assent.
Both men ticked off a range of other areas where the views of Washington and
London coincide. They will press jointly for faster implementation of last
year's Uruguay Round world trade accord. They sent a joint message to Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the leader of South Africa's Inkatha movement,
successfully urging his participation in the country's first free elections.
Mr Clinton offered important public support for Britain's plans to introduce
greater democracy in Hong Kong before the colony's transfer to China in
1997.
The list allowed the president to reaffirm 'the importance of our enduring
partnership'. And to add: 'We must continue to build on it - economically,
politically, strategically.' Mr Major stressed their shared instincts and
interests on virtually every significant foreign policy issue confronting
the west.
This analysis could not be faulted as far as it went. But it was a
superficial assessment. Neither the glitz nor the substance of this week's
public reconciliation addressed a much more fundamental shift. Mr Clinton
felt no need to. Mr Major could not afford to.
The awkward truth is that the ending of the cold war, the move towards a
more integrated Europe, and Washington's preoccupation with the economic
power of Japan and south-east Asia have changed the framework of the
relationship.
Britain has long been a junior partner - despite the illusion of equality
generated briefly by Lady Thatcher's close friendship during the 1980s with
Presidents Reagan and Bush. The decisive shift in the 1990s has come from
the ending of the strategic threat to western security from the former
Soviet bloc.
The US no longer needs Britain as its first line of defence against a
potential attack from a powerful communist aggressor. It is running down the
US air bases in the UK which provided the most powerful symbol  - and the
real substance - of the special relationship. It is looking to the Pacific
for its economic future and, increasingly, to Germany and France as much as
to Britain to provide for the security of Europe. Mr Major can claim to
remain a solid ally but there is no longer anything special about that.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Book Review: Unfinished recipes of Russia's reformers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA
Edited by Anders Aslund
Pinter Publishers, London, Pounds 11.99 paperback, Pounds 37.50
hardback
It is fitting that the book which may be the first history of radical market
reform in Russia has been edited by Anders Aslund, the Swedish economist who
set out the challenge of reforming the old Soviet-command economy in
Gorbachev's Struggle for Economic Reform, published in 1989.
But Economic Transformation in Russia, a collection of essays by radical
Russian reformers and their western advisers, was not intended as a history
book. It was meant to be a progress report on reforms that were, at the time
of writing, being implemented.
Although most of its authors are no longer in power, it still provides
pertinent answers to two questions being asked by western policymakers and
some Russian voters. First, was the comprehensive but painful package of
spending cuts, industrial restructuring and free market disciplines sought
by the reformers before their election defeat in December the right policy
for Russia? Second, what can the west do to help Russia persevere along a
path to a market economy?
The only senior radical left in office, Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime
minister, gives one important answer to the latter question: he warns that
his programme for the mass privatisation of state-owned enterprises could
fail unless the Group of Seven industrial nations pushes ahead with a
promise to invest up to Dollars 4bn in newly privatised companies.
In an essay with his wife and fellow-economist, Maria Vishnevskaya, he
writes: 'The lack of actual capital inflow in 1994 may spell the failure of
privatisation in Russia, because mass bankruptcy of privatised enterprises
could undermine the hard-won confidence in privatisation for decades.'
As to the first question, the theme that emerges from the book is that the
policy was basically right but serious mistakes were made. In the event, the
mistakes contributed to the downfall of the reformers. But Professor Jeffrey
Sachs, the former Russian adviser and proponent of western financial support
for reforms, argues strongly - and in the event presciently - against a
gradualist approach such as that being embraced by Victor Chernomyrdin,
Russian prime minister. Prof Sachs describes 'confusions which are widely
held among political elites' - including the notion, discredited by
Romania's experience, that gradual reform can stop industrial decline.
If the radicals get a second chance to push for a western-backed package to
stabilise inflation and the rouble, they could learn from the book's account
of the mistakes made the first time round.
Despite supporting shock therapy, which would have shut down enterprises
around the country, Andrei Illarionov, Chernomyrdin's former chief
economist, and Professor Richard Layard of the London School of Economics,
admit in a joint article that no preparations were made to prepare for a
consequent rise in unemployment. 'The effects of this . . . rise could be
extremely serious unless major training programmes are implemented,
especially in market-orientated skills,' they write.
Elsewhere in the book, Boris Fyodorov, former finance minister, recognises
that his target of bringing monthly inflation down to less than 10 per cent
by the end of last year was 'over-optimistic'. The reasons he cites include
underestimating the need for subsidies to the northern territories, which
comprise 56 of the Russian Federation's 89 provinces. But his recognition of
the need to find a new mechanism for subsidising the north is an example of
the vision of a reformer who achieved much in just one year in office.
Other Russian contributors dwell on the psychological obstacles to reform.
Irina Boeva and Tatiana Dolgopiatova, who studied 10 plants, found only one
manager who defined the survival of his enterprise as 'having a solid,
stable financial position, enabling it to avoid bankruptcy and to develop
further'. More typical was a manager, who still expects to be bailed out by
the state, quoted as saying: 'It's not that we have no money, it's just that
we have no money in our bank account.' It is clear, however, that a start
has been made in pushing managers into more market-oriented behaviour.
'Practically all directors have understood the necessity of price
competition' and 'the importance of sales activities', say Boeva and
Dolgopiatova.
It is typically Russian obstacles to reform - such as excessive bureaucracy
and corruption - which lead Pyotr Aven, an ex-foreign trade minister, to
conclude in his essay that the Russian economy 'has to be more liberal than
any other'. A similar conclusion is reached by Vitaly Naishul, the
arch-liberal Russian economist, who goes as far as to argue that the Russian
state is so weak and incompetent that it must confine itself to the bare
mini-mum of functions: law and order.
Aslund himself dwells on perhaps the most serious weakness which caused the
Russian radicals to squander the opportunity to introduce stabilisation
policies: inadequate political skills.
He says poor political judgment allowed them to persist under the illusion,
widely held by economists, that elections are 'time-consuming
complications'. In Russia's case, parliamentary elections were 'a necessary
precondition for breaking the power of the old elite and the industrial
lobbies in Russia', he writes.
Optimists, like Fyodorov, have said it is only a matter of months before the
radicals' policies are recognised as the only option for Russia. But Aslund
predicts in the book that, in the event of an election backlash, 'this
indeterminate period could look as bad as Weimar Germany'.
Such a backlash occurred on December 12. Without a return to political
influence by the book's authors, it is difficult to see how the detailed
recipes for financial stabilisation it contains can avoid a long spell on
the history bookshelves.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Workaholic and proud of it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS WARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I read with interest John Raymond's plea for workaholism status (Letters:
February 23). Like Mr Raymond, I claim that title; unlike Mr Raymond I
scored highly in your self-assessment test. Indeed, I probably gain bonus
points for taking time off on a 'workaholic's holiday', a two-year MBA in
the heart of workaholism land, New York.
However, it seems Mr Raymond's argument misses the point - if he limits his
industrious efforts to 'normal working hours' he must surely qualify only as
a hard worker, not a workaholic. Someone who 'only' drinks for the entirety
of pub opening hours (even if they be from 11am to 11pm) is clearly
exhibiting extremist tendencies. Perhaps using his 'opening hours' analogy
is a more accurate parallel than the 'alcoholic' comparison.
Incidentally, after 18 months here, I have still to find a bar that serves
that elusive liquor, workahol. Perhaps your readers could direct me.

Sir, With reference to your article 'Greek disgrace' (Editorial comment:

Imagine also the neighbouring non-ethnic state, in search of an identity

preamble to its constitution, states that the unification of the Scottish
peoples is a national goal. Add to all this racial and religious differences
and try to swallow national interest in favour of community convention and

FT  03 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Income dispersion is the key, not
income inequality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES SPROULE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The third of your excellent series on 'Can Europe Compete' (February
28) raises some interesting questions.
You title one of your graphs '. . . wage inequality grows much faster in the
US and UK . . .' This contains an implicit bias. No one is in favour of
inequality, but your caption seems to imply equality of outcome to be the
goal, rather than equality of opportunity.
As a recent OECD report has noted (Employment Outlook, June 1993): 'There is
a general increase in the proportion of the workforce with higher levels of
education, and a relative increase in the earnings of highly educated
workers.' The OECD goes on to note that, rather than imply any political
favouritism, it uses the term 'income dispersion', rather than 'income
inequality'. This view has also been supported by The Economist, which notes
that further controls on wages (for nothing else will make incomes more
'equal') will have the same effect as the plethora of controls already in
place, namely further unemployment.
You correctly point to better education as the key. But the choice we face
is a simple one: do we want people in low-paid jobs while they try to
increase their level of skills so as to be able to earn higher wages? Or
would we prefer them to be on a government training scheme, drawing the
dole, while acquiring the skills necessary to be constructively employed in
today's market place?

FT  03 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Confusing the duties of the pensions
custodian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUGH ARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Julian Franks and Professor Stephen Schaefer (Personal View:
'Safety net for pensions custodians', February 24) suggest that the answer
to 'the Maxwell problem' is to make custodians directly answerable to a
pension fund's beneficiaries.
The picture which this conjures up, of custodians deciding whether a
particular instruction from the trustees or the investment manager is
prejudicial to the interests of the beneficiaries, is quite touching.
Instead of separating the custody and trusteeship roles, this solution
confuses them.
Rather than limit the compensation scheme to apply where the custodians have
defaulted on their quasi-trustee role, would it not accord with
Franks-Schaefer logic to make it a legal obligation that custodians did not
hold the assets at all, but that they were held by sub-custodians (who would
hold a duty of care, and so on)?
The buck must stop somewhere, and all that the Franks-Schaefer solution does
is to pass it on. Whether or not would-be custodians will be queueing up to
assume these additional duties and responsibilities is another matter.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was dismayed when Malaysia adopted its 'Buy British last' stance, but
even more dismayed by the tone of your editorial 'False moves in Malaysia'
(February 28) and some of the broadsheet responses I read over the weekend.
As one who has worked extensively in Malaysia in the last two years, I am
disappointed to find you still telling them 'they'll be sorry in the end'.
Surely we must learn that if you insult customers - and, incidentally,
suppliers these days - they have the right to take their custom elsewhere.
The developed world is queueing up for Malaysian business - I wish I could
see a similar queue at Britain's door.
We must learn - the press included - from the Japanese market approach of
'Japan plc' when looking at global markets. Insulting customers, from
whatever source, does not pay.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: We say 'No' to creeping Fringlish (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JANE JOHNSON and LINSEY MERCER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In response to David Buchan's article ('France says 'Non' to creeping
Franglais', February 24), we feel duty bound to expose the French attempt to
dominate the English language - as in Fringlish.
When dining at La Gavroche, we strenuously attempt to order only those
dishes with purely Anglo Saxon names. But unfortunately, in place of the
more acceptable 'potatoes creamed with egg, piped into mounds and baked in a
hot oven for 25 minutes' we find 'Duchesse potato' more succinct.
And attempts to order 'small pots of burnt custard' in place of creme

Perhaps our own culture minister should describe risque jokes as
'audaciously bordering on the unseemly', or enforce etymology on to the
school curriculum in place of history?
After all, who did win the Napoleonic wars?

FT  03 MAR 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Tragi-comedy of the rising yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last few days' shakeout in the financial markets bears the clear sign
'Made in the United States'. It has been triggered by an overreaction to a
couple of flash American economic indicators coupled with persistent reports
that President Bill Clinton was about to grant authority for trade sanctions
against Japan. The resulting renewed upward pressure on the yen may indeed
be more disturbing for the Japanese economy than any actual sanctions.
For two decades until the end of Bretton Woods in 1971 the dollar-yen
exchange rate remained fixed within a narrow band around Y360 to the dollar.
Trade imbalances were modest; Japan experienced double-digit growth rates;
and trade barriers came down.
After President Nixon floated the dollar in 1971, the US currency plunged
and the yen soared, at one stage reaching almost Y200 to the dollar. The
dollar recovery in the early Reagan years in the first half of the 1980s
turned out to be a blip. The yen began rising again and is now within a
whisker of Y100 to the dollar.
A believer in the exchange rate approach to the balance of payments might
expect that this three or fourfold rise in the yen over two decades would at
least have killed off the Japanese trade surplus with the US. Yet in the
course of the 1980s, this surplus has risen and now approaches Dollars 60bn
per annum: an uncomfortable result for those who erroneously believe
bilateral trade balances to be important.
There is never a conclusive answer to those who believe that the only reason
why a medicine is killing the patient is that he is not taking enough of it.
US officials have often pressed still further revaluation on Japan and
threatened to talk the dollar down.
Of course, it is impossible for either currency to move just against the
other without affecting the exchange rates of third and fourth countries.
But the Bundesbank, for instance, does not mind if American pressure for a
low dollar helps to keep the D-Mark higher than it would otherwise be. For
the moment, the action is in the US-Japanese relationship.
Judged by the standard not of GDP but of industrial production, Japan's
recession has been the worst among the main industrial countries, with
little sign of recovery so far. Indeed both the concentration of the
Japanese output fall on the internationally exposed industrial sector and
its dimensions are a strong reminder of the UK in the early 1980s. At that
time the combination of the 'Thatcher effect', North Sea oil and the second
international oil price explosion produced a ferocious rise in the pound and
consequent industrial shakeout which remain a folk memory in UK business.
Professor Ronald McKinnon of Stanford has long been an opponent of dollar
depreciation; and the present state of the Japanese economy makes a new
paper* of his specially timely. His argument is that the rising yen has
produced deflationary pressures in the true sense in Japanese wholesale
prices. Consumer prices, which respond more sluggishly to economic forces,
are rising at a minimalist 1 per cent per annum. Nominal short-term interest
rates could hardly fall very much below their present 2 1/4 per cent level.
But taken in conjunction with falling producer prices, the real rate of
interest for even blue-chip Japanese borrowers must be at least 4 1/2 per
cent.
Monocausality rarely works; and a sceptic could point to the experience of
1985-87 when a sharply rising yen and even severer producer price deflation
did not prevent a vigorous recovery in the Japanese economy. A more modest
diagnosis is that the high indebtedness left over from the recent domestic
property bust and the vulnerability of the financial system make it more
difficult for the economy to bounce back in the face of falling prices than
on other occasions.
McKinnon estimates the purchasing parity exchange rate to be about Y140-Y150
to the dollar, and he would like to make a start in moving towards this
rate. But how could the Bank of Japan manage this? The usual way that
central banks ease policy is by lowering short-term interest rates. If the
Bank of Japan cannot go much further in reducing rates, what is left?
The main way, in these circumstances, to expand the money supply is by
official purchases of foreign exchange. In these circumstances, an easy
money policy would have a double effect. The traded goods sector would be
freed from deflation and real Japanese interest rates would for a time
become negative.
Alas, in the present Washington mood, a Japanese effort to edge the yen
downwards might be taken as an economic Pearl Harbour. If the Japanese
seriously wanted to gain acceptance of a weaker yen, they would have to
persuade the Americans that the stimulative effects of a monetary expansion
combined with a lower yen exchange rate would more than offset the loss to
the US on the direct price competitiveness front. I would not like to
undertake the task.
Yet I would not despair of McKinnon having the last laugh. The present
Japanese and American authorities have in common a desire to get back to
some form of world exchange rate accord - if not a full Bretton Woods, at
least of the informal kind that marked the Louvre and Plaza accords of
1985-87. The difference, of course, is that the Americans would like this
stability around a high yen and the Japanese around a somewhat lower one.
This is reminiscent of the period when James Baker was US secretary of the
Treasury and always favoured stability provided that the dollar could be low
enough.
The Americans are, however, in a difficulty because they want Japan to
stimulate its economy. Monetary easing would involve a weaker yen. On the
fiscal side, the Japanese government has announced endless packages to
stimulate spending and cut taxes; but so far with disappointing results. The
orthodox view would be that the budget surplus that Japan runs in
non-recession years needs to be cut and that the structural US budget
deficit also needs to decline. The hope is that Japanese saving will thereby
be reduced and US saving boosted.
Is this entirely rational? The Japanese structural budget surplus represents
the effort of a high-saving society to safeguard itself against the burden
of an ageing population. It is quite rational for the Japanese to lend net
sums to the US, which has a deficiency of savings except during periods of
recession. At some time in the next century, the net flow of investment will
reverse.
Meanwhile it really is on the monetary front that action will occur, if it
does. The logjam might be broken by some chance events precipitating a rise
in the dollar or fall in the yen persisting long enough for the US to see
that it is not so damaging after all.
A US-Japanese Bretton Woods would present some delicate adjustment problems
for Europe. If it made the European Community get its act together, so much
the better.
But before we can have a Japanese-American currency accord, the threat of an
economic war between the two countries must be averted. Unfortunately, the
massive investment that the US has made in public economic education has not
killed the crudest mercantilist fallacies about bilateral trade balances.
Indeed the 'Austrian' critics of the US economics establishment, about whom
Michael Prowse wrote in the FT on Monday, may be understating their case.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Arts: The Nash plays Casken - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having been sour about the Nash Ensemble's first concert in its Wigmore
season last autumn, I am happy to report that the players were back on their
usual distinguished form for the second of four '20th Century' concerts.
Each includes a premiere; this time it was John Casken's Infanta Marina, a
concertante piece for cor anglais and a pair of competing instrumental
trios.
Casken's star has been rising steadily for several years, especially since
his Golem opera at the Almeida Festival. He is a romantic, fiercely loyal
Northerner with scrupulous musical standards. Here, his inspiration was
Shakespeare's princess Marina in Pericles, as re-imagined by the poet
Wallace Stevens: tempest-tossed, at the eccentric mercy of fate, but
resilient and calmly reflective.
While the competing trios pursue their own lively material and sometimes
coalesce, the solo cor anglais (Gareth Hulse, visually an unlikely Marina,
but musically character-laden) responds sweetly, arbitrates, offers sidelong
commentary. Immediately attractive, Infanta Marina promises to divulge much
more on further acquaintance. Some day soon, there should be a big,
definitive Casken piece which will set his music in perspective - perhaps
his forthcoming violin concerto for the BBC Philharmonic, or his
Philharmonia commission for 1996?
A refurbished work was the late Roberto Gerhard's op. 1, a dozen Straussian
songs on Catalan poems, for high erotic soprano: 'With the velvet of my eyes
I shall weave you a carpet/ Which shall lead you to my bed.' Meirion Bowen
has made clever arrangements of six of those for a dozen players - in a
couple of passages, maybe too 'orchestral' - and Rosa Mannion sang them
seductively. A rediscovery, not quite new but not yet familiar, was the
original version of Falla's El Amor Brujo.
Most of us know it in its later, more luxuriant dress. It was exciting to
hear the Nash players and their conductor Lionel Friend make so much of the
leaner original, with Jean Rigby's lusty mezzo to electrify the songs. For
good measure, we got Michael Berkeley's ingratiating, eclectic little
Nocturne and a sharply purposeful account of Falla's Harpsichord Concerto,
with Maggie Cole confident at the keyboard.

SHORT CUTS (18)
Robert Altman
SHADOWLANDS (U)
Richard Attenborough
THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JO (15)
Maggie Greenwald
Great cliches, like great mountains, take millennia to form. Consider that
old Hollywood favourite, 'All human life is here.' It looks like an inert,
ponderous, unavoidable statement: a sloganeer's massif. But how many aeons
of PR prehistory conspired to produce its perfectly hewn shape?
And what does it take to change that shape? A few seconds: given the right
tremor at the right time. We get a 'real' earthquake at the end of Robert
Altman's wonderful 3 1/4 -hour fresco of Los Angeles life Short Cuts, based
on eight transplanted stories by north-eastern writer Raymond Carver, when
the 22 casually intersecting main characters are united, after a fashion, by
a shudder from San Andreas.
But there is another earthquake in this film. It is Altman the cliche-buster
shaking up another mighty cliche. His career began with all those genre
movies that were not genre movies. M*A*S*H, The Long Goodbye, McCabe And Mrs
Miller, Nashville: private eyes, cowboys, song-and-dance, except that
nothing and nobody in these films behaved as Hollywood habit demanded.
Goodbye was a film noir shot in sunlight, McCabe a snowbound Western,
Nashville a disaster-musical.
Short Cuts uses Carver's writing partly to hack away at, and re-shape, the
soap opera tradition's spreading empire on the modern screen. If 'all human
life' is here, it is served up not in the dainty, well-formed portions of
most domestic agony-serials - opera buffet - but in raw, bleeding chunks
which we fight over like feeding birds. Here is the housewife (Madeleine
Stowe) biting on her unhappiness over an adulterous husband (Tim Robbins).
Here are three fishing friends whose weekend is disrupted when they find a
corpse in the river. Here is a mentally disturbed baker (Lyle Lovett), who
poisons a couple's lives with anonymous phone calls. Here is that couple
(Andie McDowell, Bruce Davison) whose son is dying in hospital after a car
has knocked him down. Here is the car's waitress driver (Lily Tomlin) and
her good-for-nothing chauffeur husband (Tom Waits) . . .
Grim but zany, and a little like Nashville without the music. Except that
Annie Ross is on hand, singing moody blues in a bar when not squabbling at
home with her neurotic cellist daughter Lori Singer.
These two figures, though, are the only ones not hewn from Carver's writing
 -though Ross's character 'Tess' bears the name of the writer's widow who
gave this movie her blessing - and they are the only jarring presences. They
seem too programmed-in, their problems at once melodramatic and too hazy.
The brilliance of Short Cuts elsewhere lies in its surgical casualness, at
once blithe and precise. As everyday life is cut open before our eyes, no
one in this biopsy on a blighted Paradise is allowed to escape attention by
the excuse of 'insignificance.' All human life for this director means all
human life. The audience becomes co-artist with the filmmaker in exploring
that uniquely fertile chaos - that Designer Disorder - that Altman creates
by giving credible and compelling characters their own fragments of vividly
autonomous life.
*
Shadowlands, by contrast, feels warmed-over from reel one. This film might
have been made from the remains of The Remains Of The Day, possibly
sprinkled with bits of 84 Charing Cross Road. Here is Sir Anthony Hopkins
choking back the emotions again, this time as writer-scholar CS Lewis. And
here is the woman who strives to awaken him. Only this time it is
Hollywood's Debra Winger rather than Our Emma, and she plays the American
divorcee Joy Gresham who died of cancer shortly after rescuing CS from a
mouldering Oxford bachelordom.
You may have seen the TV and stage play: now see the film. It too is
scripted by William Nicholson. It too, to judge by the number of
handkerchiefs audibly deployed during the Press show's closing stages, is
for many a substantive weepie.
I found it to be substantive twaddle, bar the performances. We know director
Richard Attenborough is good with actors, having been a good one himself.
Here he steers Hopkins and Winger through the deeps and shallows with some
skill. But how few the deeps are: mostly a lot of rendered-down Lewisian
stuff about the justification of pain in the divine plan. And how plentiful
are the shallows.
When it comes to imagery, as Gandhi and Cry Freedom taught us, Attenborough
seldom conveys a point subtly or obliquely when he can push it in our faces
with both hands. CS Lewis was an emotionally arrested man afraid of life and
feeling? Then paint his cottage interior in dingy grey-greens with yellowing
woodwork and make sure the framed prints and pictures are all in black and
white. (Only exception, the childhood favourite by his desk depicting a
golden valley).
Joy Gresham was a force of life and vitality? Then have Debra Winger do all
those noisy, pushy things Americans do in British movies, from hollering
across the Randolph Hotel tea room (tsk tsk) to forcing stiff upper Brits to
talk about their feelings.
Whenever the camera goes outside, trying to aerate Nicholson's script, we
are treated to cliches no more welcome for being marginally more scenic: the
mandatory strolls through the tourist-brochure quadrangles or - beyond
Oxford - to the odd lush margarine-commercial landscape. Ah] the golden
Herefordshire valley that CS and Joy discover together (his painting's
original), and whose delight-bringing beauty they see as part of the 'deal'
with the pain to come.
This metaphysical bromide sticks in the filmgoer's throat more than
anything. The idea of the 'deal,' a shopkeeper's-ledger view of joy and
pain, is also what we bow out on: a specious balm placed on Joy's death and
the audience's grief, a contentious comfort clipped from the pages of
Lewis's own late philosophy.
Shadowlands promises us a true-life tragedy but gives us only a weepie with
a message: one that only the actors emerge from with dignity. Amid the
encroaching schmaltz, Winger somehow manages a few strong, acerbic, moving
strokes. And Hopkins, after much diffident head-bobbing and emotion-parrying
in the approved Remains style, has a few final seconds, just before the
bell, of real histrionic fighting.
*
Sometimes a film from one country seems to die and be translated to another.
Surely Maggie Greenwald's The Ballad Of Little Jo is 'Orlando Goes West'?
Suzy Amis, who could be mistaken on a dark night for Tilda Swinton, plays a
young lass who dresses as a man. Choosing to live in wildest 1860s Montana
after being thrown out of home for becoming pregnant - child is left to
sister - she decides that britches, cropped hair and a self-inflicted cheek
scar are a must. She becomes 'Mister' Jo.
He/she still falls foul of Ian McKellen, playing a brutish hotblooded
Midwestern mine-supervisor. And he/she risks all by pursuing a Politically
Correct agenda decades before such things were fashionable. No male
chauvinist chit-chat, please, in Jo's presence. And look at the courage with
which our hero(ine) rescues from a racists' lynching - and later falls in
love with - a Chinaman called Tinman (David Chung), whose name I thought I
heard someone say was short for Tiananmen.
This is a horse opera with moral-political hindsight. Like any beast with
eyes at the wrong end of its person, it fails to get up much forward
momentum but does have a loopy charm if you are not in a hurry.

The BBC continues to dominate the younger sector of the comedy market. From
today their three-deep Thursday night line-up begins with Dawn French in a
new series of Murder Most Horrid (9.00 BBC2). I was not the greatest fan of
the first series, though French can be very funny. That is followed by
Absolutely Fabulous written by her partner, Jennifer Saunders, who also
stars as the awful fashion PRO, Edina (9.30 BBC1). Then comes Ben Elton with
his frenetic stand-up routine in The Man From Auntie (10.00 BBC1).
In preparation for a new series about one of television's most memorable
characters, steeplejack Fred Dibnah, BBC2 repeats the 1987 programme A Year
With Fred (8.00).
Channel 4 screens the second episode of Phil Agland's series about life in a
Chinese city, Beyond The clouds (9.00) and then begins a serial adaptation
of Joanna Trollope's best selling novel The Rector's Wife. Lindsay Duncan
plays the title role in a story which is like a cross between a novel by the
author's namesake and ancestor, Anthony Trollope, and 'The Archers' (10.00).

FT  03 MAR 94 / Arts: Twyla Tharp Dance - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twyla Tharp's dances, like her dancers, offer a thrilling display of energy
that knows exactly where it is going, where it has been - in the sense of
the influences that have shaped it - and what it wants to do. This is
dancing purposeful, vivid, hugely satisfying. And it can be seen for the
next ten days in the smaller of the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith.
I reported on the Tharp troupe in their current repertory at the Paris Opera
last autumn. The change of location is a shock - from the expanse of the
Palais Garnier's stage (which the Tharpians grandly filled) to the close
quarters of Riverside 2 is carrying contrast to craziest extremes - but the
dances and the dancers (their wits very much about them) triumphed on
Tuesday night on no uncertain terms.
There is a lot to complain about in this present setting. Getting to
Riverside through a maelstrom of traffic is a wall-of-death exercise; the
seating in the theatre is bum-numbing and for the most part fit only for
midgets; the dance area is reasonable, though there is no wing-space, while
the dancers must warm-up in front of the audience as it arrives, which I
suppose is a bonus for people who want to see performers' bodies at their
private devotions, but I think it an intrusion. Yet there is also a lot to
praise: Riverside's enterprise in acquiring Tharp's troupe when a tour was
cancelled; the opportunity to see superb dancers and superb dances at close
quarters, and the extraordinary immediacy this brings to performance and our
response to it.
The balance is on the right side, and the season is not to be missed. The
first of two programmes opened with the recent Sextet. Three couples; some
undistinguished mock-Hispanic jazz; popular dance - even jitterbug -
balleticised. These are ingredients which Twyla Tharp cleverly manipulates,
though despite brilliant dancing from Stacy Caddell and Shawn Stevens (fine
dancers from Balanchine's stable), I do not find the piece reaches far
enough into the music or the idea of dance-hall style to seem more than an
appetiser for the delights to come. These are the blazingly contrasted
Baker's Dozen and In the Upper Room.
While you watch Baker's Dozen you know that it is the happiest, jokiest,
nicest thing in the world. Four enchanting piano rags by Willie 'the Lion'
Smith; white clothes; dancing that is both relaxed and tautly responsive to
rhythm; twelve dancers who are friends, and can play merry tricks on each
other and on dance itself; movement that runs and slides and takes a pause
and then nips along over and through the music. Bliss.
In the Upper Room suffers at Riverside from lack of space, and more
especially from lack of the lighting that gave it such drama on the Garnier
stage - choreography roaring at us from out of the dark and mist, or
pin-pointed with singular vividness in a shaft of illumination. But it
remains a prodigious example of Tharpian analysis, of movement contrasted -
athleticism versus classicism on the most obvious terms - and activity
sprung from the grinding motor rhythms of a Phillip Glass score. It is dance
driven, relentless, sometimes fractured or trapped in the vain repetitions
of Glass's orchestra. It is made by someone who is fascinated by how dance
works, how it may be shaped and re-shaped, exposed and obscured. It is an
intellectual (quite as much as a theatrical) exercise by a dazzling
choreographer who holds our attention at every turn and twist of her
imagination, and it is danced with that energy, clarity, self-sacrificing
brilliance that we expect of Tharp's casts.
Very exciting in it are two male dancers: Jamie Bishton - massive scale to
his movement, micro-second alertness to rhythm - and Petter Jacobsson, his
classicism given a bright edge and a kind of wilful daring. Absolutely
admirable are Stacy Caddell, Shawn Stevens, and the rest of the cast.
Wonderful dancing in wonderful dances.
At The Riverside Studios with two programmes until March 12. 081-748-3354.

FT  03 MAR 94 / People: Barings' global shuffle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barings is beefing up its emerging markets coverage by sending two senior
directors, to New York and to Hong Kong, to be closer to the clients in
Latin America and Asia respectively.
Andrew Norris, 41, goes to New York as joint head of equity capital markets,
while Jeremy Palmer, 37, whom Barings is hiring from JP Morgan in London
this month, moves out to Hong Kong, as the other equity capital markets
boss.
'Latin American business naturally looks to the financial community in New
York, not London,' Norris explains. In terms of placement power, proximity
to the North American investor base for say, an Asian deal, is important,
too. He adds that 'the competition' - largely American investment banks -
had been observed last year moving more staff out to Hong Kong for similar
reasons.
'The trouble is, issuers tend to look on the Americans as being more
globally capable. Actually, it is a complete fallacy - the majority of our
staff live outside Europe. Do the majority of the staff of an American
investment bank live outside America?'
Norris's equity capital markets operation in London had recently become, for
administrative purposes, part of Baring Securities, rather than Baring
Brothers. Following the departure of Christopher Heath, Baring Securities is
now headed by Peter Norris, Andrew's brother who is two-and-a-half years his
junior. So is he pleased not to be reporting directly to him any more? 'I
rather miss him actually,' is the reply.
David Watkins, 49, a Goldman Sachs veteran between 1972-1991, joined in
January and becomes the director with responsibility for equity capital
markets not covered from New York or Hong Kong - again principally emerging
markets - as well as for London syndication of Asian, Latin American and
other issues.

FT  03 MAR 94 / People: Nigel Rudd takes on another chair
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigel Rudd, chairman of Williams Holdings, is to take up the chairmanship of
East Midlands Electricity from May 1 on a non-executive basis.
He takes over from John Harris, 55, who has been in the industry for 38
years and will be taking early retirement from April 30. In his 12 years as
executive chairman, Harris has been one of the regional electricity sector's
most powerful chairmen but his high profile and decisions on diversification
have sometimes upset investors.
Rudd's appointment is the latest in a series of appointments to key
electricity posts of people whose experience is large outside the industry,
although he has been an East Midlands' non-executive director for four
years. When Harris goes, the chairmen of half the 12 regional electricity
companies in England and Wales will have moved on since privatisation in
1990, several of them replaced by industry newcomers.
Although Rudd has made his name as the head for 12 years of a highly
acquisitive group, he made clear yesterday that his role at East Midlands
will be markedly different from that at Williams. He wants East Midlands to
focus on the 'core electricity businesses' - which the City interprets as
meaning he would be unlikely to want East Midlands to make further
acquisitions.
In the past, East Midlands' shares have been among the lowest rated, partly
because of its acquisition of electrical contracting companies which have
performed below expectations. There has also been disquiet about East
MIdlands' association with a prospective bid by the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers for British Coal mines, although the company said recently it
would not be part of the bidding consortium.
Rudd says he will not be getting involved in the day-to-day running of East
Midlands: 'The company has an excellent team to do that already.'

FT  03 MAR 94 / Technology: Check-in for the Channel rail link - A new
passenger ticketing system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Channel tunnel train services between London, Paris and Brussels
start this summer, they are expected to compete primarily with the airlines.
So it is appropriate that airline-style technology has been adopted at
London's Waterloo international station and the other terminals.
The control system at Waterloo is claimed to be the first fully automated
check-in system in use at a main line railway station. The automatic gates
will not only validate travellers' tickets but will also provide train crews
with a list of passengers, their seat reservations and meal requirements for
the journey.
Careful control of passenger flows at Waterloo will be necessary to prevent
congestion. For all the praise it has won for its striking design, the new
terminal has had to be sandwiched into a very restricted site alongside the
existing station.
European Passenger Services, which will operate the trains, is counting on
most passengers spending just 30 minutes in its Waterloo departures lounge.
With seating for 700 people and standing room for a further 1,100, the
terminal has just enough space for two full train-loads of passengers.
Passengers booking through EPS's telesales office or one of the main
terminals will receive a machine-readable ticket conforming to the boarding
pass standard (ATB2) being introduced for airline tickets. This technology
is also being adopted by the ferry companies and is in use at Dover and
Calais by P&amp;O European Ferries.
On arrival at the terminal, passengers feed their ticket into the check-in
mechanism, similar to that used on the London Underground, which
automatically opens the entry gate and stores the encoded data.
Passengers without machine-readable tickets will pass through separate
channels to manned desks. In the early stages, half of all passengers will
have the advanced tickets, rising to 80 per cent in five years.
The installation at Waterloo forms part of a Pounds 4m contract carried out
by ICL, the computer group, for EPS, SNCF of France and SNCB of Belgium.
Similar computerised local networks will be installed at Brussels Midi,
Paris Gare du Nord, Lille and Frethun near Calais, all linked to the central
booking system in Lille. One feature of the system is that it allows the
fares to be shared out fairly between the three railways.
One problem faced by ICL was that each railway used a different networking
system, so the application software written by British Rail Computing in
Microfocus Cobol and Dialog has been ported to other systems.
The automatic check-in gates were provided by Dassault Automatismes et
Telecommunications, part of the French electronics and defence group. Each
gate contains a small visual display unit, a ticket reader, a personal
computer and a programmable controller for the sensors which record the
presence of a traveller or luggage trolley. The system has been designed to
withstand the relatively hostile environment of a station entrance, says
Dassault.
Automatic passenger control will allow EPS to offer travellers a 20-minute
check-in time and, it hopes, give it a competitive advantage over the
airlines.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Technology: Testing time for AZT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does Wellcome's Aids treatment, AZT, actually work?
Sometimes, and maybe quite often, is the accepted answer in the scientific
community. But that 'maybe' has been there for several years, mystifying
academics, drug regulatory authorities and carriers of HIV, the Aids virus,
alike. The latest research, far from clarifying matters, has only served to
confuse.
AZT's usefulness for people with symptoms of the disease is well documented
and the drug is widely prescribed. But AZT's sales growth has all but
stopped at less than Pounds 250m a year, partly because the number of Aids
sufferers is relatively small: estimates suggest that less than 10 per cent
of HIV carriers have the disease.
The question that remains is whether AZT can prevent the onset of Aids in
HIV carriers who are otherwise healthy.
That question was apparently answered almost a year ago when preliminary
results from the respected, long-term Anglo-French 'Concorde Trial'
suggested that HIV carriers did not benefit from receiving AZT. These
results contributed to Wellcome shares being the worst performing component
of the FT-SE 100 index in 1993.
But, while the final version of Concorde was being prepared, other
researchers continued testing AZT on HIV carriers.
The latest findings, published last week, appear to conflict with Concorde.
Researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore,
Maryland, who studied more than 2,000 HIV-infected men, say AZT 'delayed
Aids onset or extended life'. Alfred Saah, associate professor of
epidemiology at Johns Hopkins, said explicitly that the work disagreed with
Concorde.
Resolution of the confusion may now be close. Publication of the final
version of Concorde has been expected for several weeks. City analysts rank
it alongside profits figures in importance for Wellcome.

FT  03 MAR 94 / People: Large quits Bupa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bupa, Britain's biggest private medical insurer and healthcare group,
yesterday announced the resignation of Arthur Large, managing director of
its UK membership division, after management disagreements.
A Bupa statement said Large's departure had 'arisen from differences about
the strategic direction of the insurance business', but the company declined
to be more specific about the nature of the differences.
Large was one of the central figures in a new Bupa management team built up
by Peter Jacobs, chief executive, when he joined the healthcare group from
British Sugar. Large, who was with the RAC before Bupa, worked with Jacobs
to inject stronger commercial attitudes into the management of the
previously genteel group.
Private healthcare has become far more competitive in recent years and Bupa,
although still dominant, no longer enjoys the market share it once did.
According to last month's Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on
private medical services, Bupa's share of the insurance market - although
not its turnover - fell from 59 per cent in 1985 to 44 per cent in 1992.
Large will be succeeded by Roger Hymas, 47, who joined Bupa in 1992 as group
marketing director. His previous employment history includes posts at
American Express and Burton group.

George Constantinidi is to become chairman on an interim basis at the
recently-restructured property company Greycoat.
He replaces Geoffrey Wilson, who founded Greycoat and turned it into one of
London's most ambitious property companies, with developments such as
Embankment Place. But it was undone by collapsing asset values and complex
financing, and Wilson agreed to retire at the end of March, following
Greycoat's resuscitation by South African financiers Brian Myerson and
Julian Treger.
Constantinidi has been a non-executive director since Greycoat acquired City
Offices in 1982, but his length of tenure as non-executive chairman will be
significantly shorter. It is understood that one appointment recently fell
through, but other names are under consideration. The company said it would
not rush into a final decision.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Technology: Crime on the line - Louise Kehoe examines the
greater need for security on the Internet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Internet has grown into a global metropolis but, like many large cities,
this electronic community linked by computer networks is now struggling to
deal with rising crime.
Last month, Internet officials reported that tens of thousands of secret
passwords had been stolen. The thieves obtained keys to the private computer
files and messages of their victims.
The incidents demonstrate the vulnerability of Internet and raise questions
about its use as an information thoroughfare by businesses and others who
may be sending or receiving sensitive information via electronic mail or
file transfers.
Despite its genesis in a US Department of Defence programme in the early
1970s, Internet was never intended to be a secure network - quite the
opposite. It began as an electronic communications system for researchers in
US universities and government laboratories, with the idea of encouraging
dialogue and sharing ideas.
Early Internet users seldom thought of protecting computer files from
intruders. 'Security was not a very high priority on Internet. Openness and
communications were the most important issues,' says William Yundt, director
of networking at Stanford University, California. 'As the Internet
population grows, however, that is inevitably changing.'
Over the past few years, use of Internet has grown exponentially as
individuals, businesses and colleges throughout the world have linked up
their computers and local networks to 'The Net', as it is commonly called.
There are now an estimated 20m Internet users and commercial data traffic is
increasing at a compound rate of 20 per cent a month, says Al Hoover,
vice-president of ANS, a data communications company which operates the
high-speed US coast-to-coast 'backbone' of Internet for the National Science
Foundation.
The expanding population of Internet has brought with it some undesirable
elements. These include 'crackers' who make a hobby of breaking into private
computer files. To date, most such incidents appear to have been pranks by
individuals out to prove their computer prowess.
The latest incidents are, however, unprecedented in scale and may be the
work of an organised group, Internet experts fear. A 'sniffer' program
masquerading as an innocent computer program was planted in several
computers on Internet, says Terry McGillen of the Computer Emergency
Response Team (CERT) Coordination Centre at Carnegie-Mellon University in
Pennsylvania. This secretly recorded the passwords and names of individuals
who accessed the affected computers. Armed with these passwords, the
'crackers' can examine private computer files and record, change or destroy
data or send computer messages in the name of the password holder.
Last October, a cracker obtained passwords that may have been used to access
dozens of computers in US, Japanese and European companies as well as
universities and government departments. In another case, a month earlier,
the electronic mail and files of a California magazine were invaded by a
cracker. Computers at the University of California have been 'cracked', as
has the host computer of 'The Well', a California group providing public
access to Internet.
Victims of the latest incidents include users at computer sites in the US
and Europe, McGillen says. 'And the preliminary estimate that tens of
thousands of passwords may have been compromised could significantly
increase. We have been flooded with calls and are still gathering data.'
CERT has warned all Internet users to change their passwords as a
precaution. However, this is only a temporary solution because new passwords
could be stolen in the same way.
The crux of the problem is that passwords currently flow through most
computers on Internet in 'clear type', making it all too easy for crackers
to record them illicitly. Password encryption is the obvious solution, but
implementing such a change will take time and is fraught with problems.
First, there needs to be an encryption standard for all computers linked to
Internet. Then it would have to be adopted by all computer sites.
Development of an encryption standard is under way. However, as Yundt points
out, security measures are a nuisance for legitimate network users and can
be expensive to implement. They also run contrary to the free spirit of open
communication that is at the heart of Internet culture.
Another potential hurdle is that, despite protests from the computer
industry, the Clinton administration this month determined that export
controls should remain on most types of encryption technology. These
controls have already forced the elimination of encryption features from the
latest version of the Unix operating system used on most Internet host
computers.
In the meantime, large corporate users of Internet are erecting barriers
between their internal computer networks and Internet. 'Prudent
organisations no longer keep sensitive information on any computer that is
linked to the Internet,' says Bruce Baker, head of the information security
program at SRI International, a research and consulting group.
For Nick Trio, Internet administrator for International Business Machines'
Watson Research Centre, the challenge is to provide IBM researchers with the
benefits of access to Internet, while protecting IBM's internal computer
networks.
To achieve this, IBM and many other commercial Internet users create
'firewalls' between Internet and their internal computer networks. 'We use
secure gateways - minicomputers that are one-way links to the Internet,'
Trio explains. All electronic mail sent to IBM via Internet, for example, is
collected in a 'mail gateway' isolated from the company's internal networks.
User authentification, a technique widely used to secure corporate networks,
is also used by IBM to ensure that unwanted visitors do not access its
computers via Internet. IBM researchers wanting to access their computer
files while working at home or travelling must identify themselves with a
password and also use a 'smartcard' security device that generates the
answer to a 'random challenge' which changes every time the system is used.
Fencing off computers from the Internet is, however, analogous to installing
burglar alarms on houses without having a police force to deter criminal
activity throughout a city. Ultimately, there will have to be some form of
policing of the network to ensure data security if the 'Internet metropolis'
is to remain habitable.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Name of the game -
As the value of unit trusts hits new highs, Scheherazade Daneshkhu looks at
the industry's marketing methods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The value of unit trusts in the UK climbed to Pounds 99.9bn by the end of
January. The disappointment of just missing the Pounds 100bn mark and the
excellent marketing opportunity that would have afforded the industry was
palpable.
Nevertheless, the figure is the highest recorded by the industry and is
almost three times the value at the end of 1987 (the year of the stock
market crash). Last year alone, unit trusts attracted more than Pounds 9bn
of net investment, the highest annual inflow recorded, and almost equivalent
to the sum of net investment in the five years (1988-1992 inclusive) after
the crash.
In addition, the steady fall in interest rates, particularly since the UK
left the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September 1992, has increased the
popularity of pooled equity funds which offer investors a wide spread of
holdings.
Not surprisingly, this bonanza, and a favourable economic background for
equity investment, have contributed towards a sharp increase in the
marketing budgets of many fund management groups.
'The public gets interested in investments when interest rates are low. This
is important to the sale of unit trusts - it is much easier to sell when the
market and macro-economic conditions are right,' says Mark Sylvain,
executive director of retail business at Fidelity, the US investment house
established in the UK for 15 years.
Figures from Register-Meal, the media research company, show that the
advertising of unit trusts (which does not necessarily include unit trust
personal equity plans), based on the rate card costs of advertisements in
the media, increased substantially in 1993.
The fund management groups with the highest spending were Fidelity, M&amp;G and
Save &amp; Prosper. Fidelity, for example, spent Pounds 2.2m compared with
Pounds 738,000 in 1992, according to Register-Meal, while the comparable
figures for Save &amp; Prosper were Pounds 1.2m in 1993 compared with Pounds
245,000 in 1992.
It is still far short of what the industry would like, however. In the US,
about 27 per cent of households invest in mutual funds; in the UK, less than
3 per cent of the adult population has a unit trust.
Most unit trusts sold to the public are through intermediaries, such as
financial advisers, but direct promotion is regarded as an important
marketing tool, not only as a way of attracting investors but also to
increase name recognition. With more than 1,400 unit trusts and 100 unit
trust management groups, investors do not lack choice, so an investor
consulting an intermediary is more likely to agree to invest in a
recommended fund if he has heard of the company.
Roger Jennings, M&amp;G's unit trust marketing manager, says: 'We want to have a
constant presence and we spend at least Pounds 1m a year on the direct side
 -that excludes special promotions - just to be present. It is still cheap
compared with having to maintain a branch network like the building
societies.' About 90 per cent of M&amp;G's marketing budget is spent on
advertising.
Mike Ryder Richardson, marketing manager at Save &amp; Prosper, says the company
has increased its marketing budget in the last two or three years, but: 'We
kept our promotional spending high in the bear market because we thought
that since it was a less competitive market we could gain high visibility.'
Ryder Richardson says S&amp;P's recent promotion of rugby at a cost of Pounds
750,000 for a year has been particularly successful in increasing its name
awareness.
Mercury Asset Management has turned to radio to increase brand awareness. It
has been sponsoring London Broadcasting Centre's financial news updates
since 1992. Richard Royds, managing director of Mercury fund managers, says
the drawbacks of radio are offset by the advantages. 'The problem is that
people cannot cut out a coupon as they can in a newspaper but it is
awareness-building at a reasonable price.'
None of the advertising attempts to define a unit trust. Victoria Nye,
director of communications at the Association of Unit Trust and Investment
Funds, the industry body which has just started a campaign to attract what
it terms the 'missing millions' of potential investors, says: 'We did not
want to pose a boring question: 'what is a unit trust?' but prefer to say
why it is useful to you. It becomes clear through our literature what a unit
trust is.'
Unit trusts have to compete with investment trusts and insurance-linked
products for equity investors' money. Sylvain says it is imperative to
attract the investor's attention through advertising. His is one of the few
companies to advertise on television with the goal being to get the viewer
to call a freephone number.
Newspapers and posters remain the backbone of advertising because of the
amount of information they can contain. 'Investors tend to blank out the ads
of companies they have not heard of and somehow you have to break through
that,' says Sylvain. 'We will advertise in five to six pages of a paper with
a huge ad to begin with, and ads on every page after that.'
Fund launches and personal equity plans, which allow investors to save money
in equities without having to pay income or capital gains tax, are vital
marketing tools. 'For some reason, people seem to think that buying a new
fund is better than an existing one so we try to promote old funds by giving
them a new spin, such as adding a PEP facility,' says Sylvain.
M&amp;G relies on consistency to convey reliability. Peter Emms, group marketing
and sales director, says: 'Kit-Kat has always been promoted in the same way
and we believe consistency in the style of our advertisements to get across
the message of value and simplicity is important. Our posters are a
permanent thing and people do notice them over a period of time.'
The challenge to unit trusts will come when interest rates rise again. If
the companies can retain investors' money, they will be able to regard their
marketing efforts as a success.
Says Jennings: 'We actually believe that equities are what people ought to
have. What a great pity that typically women, whose husbands have died, have
put their money in the building society and put a tiny amount into equities.
Now, after 20 years they are enjoying a very poor lifestyle. It's a pity we
have not been better at persuading them to do the opposite.'

FT  03 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): On the prowl for
copycats - The battle to stop retailers from selling products identical to
famous brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer goods manufacturers in the UK are fighting to stop retailers
selling own-label products that look almost identical to well-known brands.
A dozen of the biggest names have formed the British Producers and Brand
Owners Group to press for a change in the law - which they say lags far
behind those in other European countries when it comes to protecting their
products from 'copycat' competition by retailers.
Members include Allied Lyons, Gillette, Guinness, Grand Met, ICI Paints,
Kellogg, Mars, Nestle, Procter &amp; Gamble, SmithKline Beecham and Unilever.
They say own-label products are being designed deliberatley to resemble
manufacturers' brands - using similar bottles or packs, colours and
typography, even similar names. But while manufacturers spend millions of
pounds on research, development and marketing of brands, it costs retailers
very little to copy them.
The issue, says Michael Mackenzie, director-general of the Food and Drink
Federation, which represents manufacturers, is not so much that consumers
might mistake the own-label product for the manufacturer's brand. Rather,
look-alike brands may 'give the impression that the manufacturer of the
proprietary brand has made the own-label product'.
Brand manufacturers may have contributed to the confusion in the past by
actually making own-label products for supermarkets, but most no longer do
so. Kellogg recently ran an advertising campaign based on the fact that it
does not make cereal for anyone else.
While the big names believe the problem has worsened, they have nevertheless
been reluctant to speak out. This is because their relations with retailers
are delicate. 'The worst thing you can do is to pick a fight with your
biggest customers,' says Mackenzie. 'But the customers are giving them no
option.'
What has prompted manufacturers to move now is the prospect of changing the
law through the government's Trade Marks Bill, which was introduced first
into the House of Lords and reached the report stage last week. It will get
its third reading in about 10 days' time.
The bill is designed to harmonise UK laws on unfair competition with those
in other EU countries, based on the Paris Convention on intellectual
property. It aims to make it easier to register trade marks, as well as
certain shapes, words and logos on packaging.
But manufacturers say it does not go far enough. They want protection
against look-alike brands which imitate the overall appearance of their own
brands, without directly copying logos or designs. Lord Reay last week
introduced an amendment on behalf of the brand owners group extending such
protection.
After a debate in the Lords last Thursday, Lord Reay withdrew his amendment
when the government promised to review the issue, but the group may
re-introduce its amendment if the government does not act during the passage
of the bill.
Paul Walsh, partner at Bristows, Cooke &amp; Carpmael, a law firm specialising
in intellectual property, says the UK is out of line with most of Europe in
not giving brands proper statutory protection. Germany has a statute on
'protection of get-up', and there are similar laws in France, Benelux and
Greece.
The problem of look-alikes is particularly sensitive in the UK because
supermarkets have worked hard to change consumers' perceptions of own-label
products from inferior imitations to quality alternatives. Retailers make
much higher margins on own-label products because they do not bear the same
development costs as manufacturers. The big three UK grocers - Sainsbury's,
Safeway and Tesco - have pushed own-label sales to more than 50 per cent of
turnover, far higher than elsewhere in Europe.
But opponents of the amendment argue that the bill as it stands, coupled
with existing safeguards, is adequate. The British Retail Consortium, which
represents more than 200 retailers, says manufacturers are attempting to
restrict shops' ability to introduce own-label products.
'Shoppers are not confused,' the consortium said. 'They are very canny and
read the label carefully.' The Consumers Association found in a survey last
month that shoppers showed a preference for many own-label products in blind
tastings. It warns that tighter restrictions on own-label products could
lead to narrower choice for consumers.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Accountancy Column: Hope of audit assurance seems a Holy
Grail - Andrew Jack assesses the implications of a damning report on the
current state of regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A potent draft document circulating across Whitehall desks in the last few
weeks is causing some cheeks to redden with embarrassment among those
responsible for audit regulation in the UK.
The confidential report, commissioned late last year by the Department of
Trade and Industry from Mr Peter Moizer, professor of accounting at Leeds
University, and submitted last month, makes some significant recommendations
for change to the current regime. If they were all approved by ministers and
implemented, the result would be a radical reshaping of the way in which
firms are inspected.
The purpose of the report was to assess the effectiveness of audit
monitoring after the first two full years of operation of the structure
established by the 1989 Companies Act.
Moizer interviewed practitioners and regulators, and examined the first two
annual reports issued by the five recognised supervisory bodies: the three
chartered accountancy institutes, the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants, and the Association of Authorised Public Accountants (which
sub-contracts monitoring of its members to the certifieds).
The conclusions will not be welcomed by all those mentioned in the report,
and in particular by the three chartered institutes, which control the Joint
Monitoring Unit (JMU). They were upset by its draft findings and are opposed
to their being made public in this format.
However, the DTI said this week that it was committed to publication and to
generating comment, although it has not yet decided when or in exactly what
form. The result is, in any case, likely to a promote a strong response.
Overall, Moizer comes down in favour of the idea of the current system of
audit regulation. He says the units are working well, that self-regulation
is being operated conscientiously within its narrowly-defined role and that
the costs are worth paying for the improvements in audit procedures and
practices that will result. He says that accepting the value of monitoring
is 'an act of belief', but one to which he has been converted.
Yet there are many stings in his findings. Moizer argues that the existance
of two different monitoring units effectively organised as commercial rivals
makes no sense as an attempt to improve professional standards. They should
ideally be merged, or at the very least be co-ordinated through a joint
committee to agree best practice and encourage the transfer of information.
Contrasting the different approaches, he broadly favours that taken by the
certifieds. He argues that their inspections trigger less fear among firms,
cost less and take less time. He is not convinced that the lengthier periods
spent by the JMU, particularly in examining the larger firms, are
worthwhile. He also wants the pace of inspections accelerated, to cover all
firms within five years.
These suggestions may not prove entirely practicable, given the structure of
auditing firms - there are far more monitored by the JMU than the certifieds
 -and how this may change as a result of the government's decision to exempt
many companies from the requirement for an annual audit. This will affect
the number of the firms, their methodologies and the funding of regulation.
To be fair, some of Moizer's thoughts have already been discussed internally
at the JMU and by its masters, the chartered bodies. They have been
considering increasing the frequency of visits to firms, for example. So
change of some sort now looks inevitable.
More interesting is the question of whether his suggestion that there should
be greater public scrutiny will be implemented. He says it is, on balance,
right that the reports of inspections of individual audit firms are kept
confidential, primarily to encourage the authors and firms to be more
candid.
But he says the existing annual reports produced by the regulators are of
only limited use. He calls for the creation of an independent audit
monitoring review body, with perhaps three members unconnected with
practice, which would examine the process and produce a report each year,
rather like the US Public Oversight Board. It could also act as a focus for
complaints against professional bodies.
Those familiar with Moizer's work should not be surprised that his
conclusions go against the status quo. His philosophy was clear from a
report written with two academic colleagues published by the Research Board
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in 1992 on
the 'audit expectations gap' - the difference between what the public
expects of auditors and what they actually deliver.
Rather than taking the profession's line - that the solution is education to
combat public ignorance - the three suggested a more direct response to meet
these expectations: that auditors' responsibilities should be extended
beyond existing shareholders, that they be required to detect material
fraud, and there should be an independent regulatory agency to oversee the
fees and practices of the firms.
The DTI said at the time Moizer's appointment was announced last December
that it was aware of his views, which raises the question of its own
attitudes on the future of the self-regulation of auditing.
Some murmur that Moizer's findings in his DTI report suffer the the same
flaws as in the research document: the conclusions are not always supported
by the evidence presented as much as his personal beliefs.
However, two of his most fundamental findings deserve serious discussion.
First, Moizer highlights the circular logic implicit in monitoring the
larger accountancy firms. Since the benchmarks used by the regulators to
assess audit procedures are based on the approach taken by the large firms,
these firms are hardly likely to be found lacking.
This suggests that the 'clean bill of health' the JMU has awarded recently
to large firms entangled in high-profile corporate collapses may offer scant
reassurance: for Coopers &amp; Lybrand on Maxwell, Price Waterhouse on BCCI, and
Ernst &amp; Young for a series of audits criticised by DTI inspectors. These
audits include Sound Diffusion, Milbury, Rotaprint and Edencorp Leisure.
The real question is not just whether there are flaws in the firms'
procedures designed to identify issues of concern in the audits, but whether
their judgments in interpreting the findings thrown up by these procedures
are impaired.
However, as Moizer puts it in a second vital conclusion, the audit
monitoring process does not assess the judgments taken by staff and
partners. It concentrates instead on examining documentation and procedures.
It does not challenge the decisions made.
This means it is a poor safeguard against the pressures on the independence
of the auditor, notably the commercial threat of the company's directors
threatening to switch to a rival firm.
The likelihood of an external inspector being able to assess judgment
meaningfully is minimal. Any such hope is probably a Holy Grail. Admissions
that might suggest such weaknesses are unlikely to be committed to paper,
and only at the extreme likely to emerge under intense cross-examination in
court.
Audit regulation, at least for smaller firms, seems to be providing a useful
service. Overall, it may be working well on its own terms, but those terms
are so narrow that they should be served with a health warning. They provide
little reassurance to the users of most public company accounts.

<TEXT>
The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development and the US
Environmental Protection Agency estimate the world market for environmental
products and services is worth Dollars 200bn (Pounds 135bn). The EPA reckons
it will reach Dollars 600bn by the year 2000, but the OECD expects it to be
only half as big. They agree, though, that growth is fastest in technology
for waste management, air pollution control and water treatment, write
Bronwen Maddox and David Lascelles.
While markets for environmental products occur worldwide, suppliers are
almost entirely from the industrialised world, with Germany, Japan and the
US the world leaders. Surveys suggest Germany has a fifth of the world
market in environmental technology, exporting 40 per cent of output and
employing 550,000 people in the sector.
Legislation is one reason for growth in this market in Europe. In a survey
of 300 environmental technology companies in the UK, by Environmental Policy
Consultants, a London-based research group, nearly two-thirds said European
legislation was the main reason customers were buying 'green' technology.
But some industrialists, such as Mr Wolfgang Kuhnel, director of VDMA, the
German industrial plant maker, caution against unrealistic expectations of
the sector's potential for growth and exports. He says the size of this
market has been exaggerated, because there are no agreed definitions and
because the sector has been abused by manufacturers defining products as
'environmental' for marketing reasons. He estimates environmental exports
from his own sector comprised 3 per cent of orders last year. 'That's not a
hit.'

Case study: Soporcel
A dollars 300m paper plant leads Portugal's efforts to improve it image.
A mountain of finely-shaven eucalyptus wood clippings, a large smokestack
and a dank lagoon of treated effluent 100 miles north of Lisbon mark a
Portuguese industrial showpiece.
The pulp mill and paper plant run by Soporcel, the cellulose company, show
how the second poorest country in the European Union can live with the
environmental constraints favoured by the richer countries in the north.
Improving Soporcel's ecological track record has, however, been costly.
Other sectors of the country's economy are not financially strong enough to
make a similar effort - underlining the difficulty of fighting pollution in
the throes of Europe-wide recession.
The Portuguese government selected the country's highly export-oriented
paper industry at the start of the 1990s to lead a move to improve the
country's environmental image.
Determined to show the rest of Europe that Portugal was no longer a home for
polluting industries, the environment ministry, according to Mr Manuel Gil
Mata, Soporcel's industrial director, wanted to be 'more papist than the
Pope'.
The company has spent Dollars 33m since 1991 to meet government requirements
that are now tougher than those recommended by the EU. The Dollars 300m
paper plant near the coastal town of Figueira da Foz started operation in
May 1991 on a 60-acre site already occupied by a pulp mill. Supported by
loans from the European Investment Bank, the plant ranks as one of the
largest in the world.
The paper industry is heavily polluting, a consequence both of the residues
left over from separating wood and cellulose and of chlorine- and
sulphur-based chemicals used in paper-making.
'Three or four years ago, this industry in Portugal was thought to be a very
profitable one. The ministry considered the industry had a big investment
capacity and this could be used to bring us up to the top environmental
standards in Europe,' Mr Gil Mata says.
Soporcel has been bearing the brunt of the world-wide downturn, making
losses in 1992 and 1993. But, backed by its main shareholders - state-owned
investment bank Caixa Geral de Depositos and the Anglo-French paper-maker
Arjo Wiggins - Soporcel should meet national and EU standards for emissions
in the next few years.
Other Portuguese paper companies, with older plants, are in a less happy
position. Reflecting its favourable starting point, Soporcel has budgeted a
mere Dollars 4m to 1996 to reduce discharges. Mr Gil Mata, also chairman of
the environmental committee of the Portuguese pulp and paper association,
says the three other paper mills will need to spend Dollars 50m by 1995 and
a further Dollars 135m in 1996 to meet requirements. The scale of the
figures casts doubt on the feasibility of the plan.
Mr Gil Mata says Soporcel's environmental drive is a valuable marketing tool
for the quality-conscious German and French markets.
But he is sceptical about extending the approach to other sectors. 'We were
the first, and we are the last.'

FT  03 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Paper tiger versus the paper tiger -
Eco-labelling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's virgin wood pulp producers ought to be happy. The country's climate
and soil mean fast growing species like eucalyptus take about seven years to
mature while a pine in northern Europe takes 35. This, combined with low
labour and energy costs, gives the Brazilians a product they believe is
internationally competitive in terms of price and environmental standards.
Instead of celebrating, however, they are worried annual exports of more
than Dollars 500m to the European Union are threatened by planned
environmental legislation. They argue that the proposals are protectionist
and discriminate against developing countries. The problem stems from
proposals in Brussels to introduce 'eco-labelling' on paper products, to
inform consumers of the product's origin.
The scheme would start with tissue paper, and tissue producers would incur
penalty points if their raw materials or manufacturing processes were deemed
environmentally damaging. Producers who notched up too many points would not
get a label.
This month Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EU environment commissioner, said he
was also keen to look at eventually introducing a tax on timber to
discourage felling in virgin tropical forests.
EU member states are due to vote on the eco-labelling proposals in the next
few weeks. Brazil fears the use of virgin wood pulp in paper products will
incur penalty points. It is also worried the eco-labelling system devised
for tissue paper, which has a low virgin pulp content, will later be applied
to photocopying and writing paper, where the content is much higher.
To the Brazilians, such penalties are acceptable if they prevent the cutting
down of 100-year-old hardwoods or the Amazon rain forest. But most of
Brazil's virgin wood pulp exports come from replanted forest 'farms'
thousands of miles from the Amazon.
According to the Commission, the Brazilians are overreacting. The best
producers, who have been awarded a label, may benefit from the scheme if
consumers prefer their products, but imports will not be shut out because
they lack a label.
But Brazil's Cellulose Exporters Association argues the proposals do not
give its members credit for being environmentally less damaging than
European producers. In particular, it points out that Brazilian paper
companies draw more than 90 per cent of their electricity from
hydro-electric sources - a renewable form of energy which does not cause air
pollution - where Europe's electricity is generated largely by oil and gas
power stations.
Brazilian analysts acknowledge that the impetus for the European proposals
came largely from environmental lobbies rather than competitors in Europe.
They also agree that some of the failings which they see in the proposals
may reflect bureaucratic oversight rather than protectionist instincts. But
some Brazilian companies claim European competitors will benefit
substantially from the proposals.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Black skies, red tape, green fields,
grey area - Environmental rules have poured out of Brussels and could blunt
the competitiveness of European companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
In the past two decades European countries have wished on themselves more
than 200 environmental rules. That formidable legislative effort, which
stretches from the levels of sulphur allowed to stream out of power stations
to the circumstances in which you can legally shoot birds, has won immense
public support.
The European Commission, ministers and green campaigners argue that
regulation can bring commercial benefits. Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission's president, has said that 'an ambitious environmental policy . .
. could create hundreds of thousands of jobs'.
But many European countries are concerned that it could be a drag on their
international competitiveness. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, has warned
that 'the UK's commitment in principle to environmental protection must not
come at the expense of industry and competitiveness'.
Putting numbers to the cost of environmental protection is not easy, but
industrialists have amassed a long checklist to support their claim that the
green burden is too heavy, particularly in the oil and chemical industries.
Concawe, the oil industry's European environmental lobby, claims the cost of
meeting new limits on sulphur in fuel oils will amount to Dollars 3.3bn in
the short term, and more than Dollars 5bn eventually.
The UK chemical industry estimates spending on environmental protection rose
from 9 per cent of operational costs to 14 per cent between 1990 and 1992.
The German electricity industry has spent DM22bn on cleaning up its power
stations.
The UK water industry says the Urban Waste Water directive, under which
sewage cannot be pumped into the sea, will cost it between Pounds 6bn and
Pounds 12bn, and that roughly half its current Pounds 40bn investment
programme is prompted by European directives.
International comparisons, while difficult to make, support these industrial
snapshots. Figures suggest that environmental rules are hurting European
competit-iveness on several fronts.
For a start, European companies may be handicapped even compared to rivals
in industrialised countries, let alone developing regions. According to the
OECD, total environmental spending by public and private sectors in northern
European countries appears to outstrip that of Canada and Japan, and to be
roughly equivalent to that in the US - around 1.4 per cent to 1.6 per cent
of GDP.
The Commission's own figures also support northern European companies'
complaints that they face tougher rules than companies in southern Europe.
German spending, the highest in Europe, is roughly double that of Italy,
Portugal and Spain.
Compliance with many rules is lowest in the Mediterranean countries and in
Ireland - as far as anyone can tell. Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the
environment commissioner, acknowledges figures are incomplete and that 'in
the absence of statistics we cannot say anything' about the degree of
enforcement. He hopes the new European environment agency being established
in Copenhagen will plug these gaps.
The result of high environmental standards, companies say, is that Europe
loses companies and industries. For ICI, the international chemical group,
the need to comply with mercury emission standards was 'the final straw' for
its chlorine plant at Hillhouse, UK, according to Mr Michael Wright,
environmental spokesman. 'We just closed the plant,' he says.
Some people, including many politicians and environmentalists, reject these
fears. They argue that tough rules bring commercial benefits.
Clearly, new markets in environmental technology provide compensations. If
some companies have to clean up, then others can sell them equipment  - UK
water companies have found customers abroad for water treatment devices.
However, some studies argue the potential of these markets has been
overstated.
Moreover, studies agree that these rewards are reaped only by the handful of
countries in the lead - mainly Germany, the US and Japan. Last year the
German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) concluded that, on balance,
environmental regulation had not harmed Germany as a place to do business,
largely because tough standards had helped the environmental technology
industry.
A second claim is that higher energy and waste disposal costs make companies
more efficient. ICI's Mr Wright says that 'rules have given us an incentive
to use less inputs and reduce waste'.
But some dispute whether those gains count as a benefit of green standards.
Mr Wright acknowledges that 'we could have been doing this already without
the regulation, had we focused on it, but it depends where you put your
effort'.
A third argument is that 'green' products may be more popular with
consumers. But manufacturers say they are unsure how much market share they
gain because they tend to improve products at the same time.
These claims for the benefits of green rules are not conclusive enough to
dismiss worries about the damage to European business.
A better response to industrialists' woes, perhaps, is that even if
competition is suffering, the case is easily overstated.
Mr Martin Houldin, environmental director at consultants KPMG Peat Marwick
in London, says: 'I believe the environment is in its infancy as a
competitive factor, whether as a plus or a minus. The international
differences in the cost of labour are generally so much more important that
the environment pales into insignificance.'
Nevertheless, concern about rising environmental costs may have turned the
legislative tide within Europe. Some countries which blithely put their
names to directives a decade ago have begun to cast a beadier eye on new
proposals from Brussels. The Commission's plans for more recycling of
packaging have been scaled down after the ambitious German recycling scheme
plunged into near-bankruptcy. Brussels's most-publicised environmental plan,
a tax on fuel and its carbon content, has also stalled in the light of
widespread opposition.
Moreover, there is growing pressure, particularly from developing countries,
to prevent Europe from wielding protectionist tools to shield itself if it
finds that it cannot afford its social and industrial standards.
The conclusion of the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade has brought new heat to that accusation. Some European countries want
to shut out imports from countries that do not share their environmental
standards, but developing countries fear that Europe will abuse these
principles to shut out as much competition as possible.
The Commission has already warned Denmark that its ban on ozone-depleting
substances may have to be modified, and has questioned Dutch plans to
restrict timber imports. Mr John Gummer, UK environment secretary, says: 'We
urgently need to write 'side agreements' into the final version of Gatt to
set out a way of resolving these conflicts.'
That new scrutiny - from inside Europe and beyond - may help Europe tackle
the legacy of two decades of over-enthusiastic rule-making. It may also help
it improve a poor record in designing workable and affordable environmental
rules.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: 'We cannot continue like this' - Cost
of the rulebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increasingly, Europe is becoming aware of the costs of high environmental
standards. The question is whether it can afford them.
At Porto Marghera, in the Venetian lagoon, Mr Lucio Pisani is the director
of Italy's largest petrochemical plant, owned by the state company Enichem.
The plant has already been forced to cut back its operations because of
losses caused by foreign competition, and now the environmental pressures
are mounting, not least because of the proximity of one of Europe's most
beautiful cities.
There have even been demands that the Enichem plant be split up or removed,
which has enraged local businesses and alarmed the workforce, already
battered by thousands of lost jobs.
'The problems of the lagoon are not chemicals,' Mr Pisani says. 'The water
we put back in the lagoon is better than that which we take out.' Since
1991, his company has spent L125bn (Dollars 74m) on clean-ups, a huge sum
which Mr Pisani uses to justify the company's continued operation there.
'To those who suggest fragmentation of the site, I say we have the critical
mass. That's the reason we can afford all these environmental improvements.'
In this he is backed by his workers. 'Environmental costs don't add to
others. They improve the efficiency and quality of the process,' says Livio
Marini of the leftwing CGIL labour union.
This view gets an echo in Sweden where Mr Sven Niberg of the Swedish Labour
Organisation sees environmental pressures in positive terms. 'They have
created jobs, for example in the engineering industry which has increased
production of clean equipment,' he says. But generally, industrialists worry
about the cost and competitiveness implications of the environment.
Europe's petrol retailing industry is doing battle with the Brussels
Commission over a plan to oblige garages to recover vapours which escape
from the pump when people fill their vehicles. The Commission wants stations
to install devices which suck in the vapours and return them to the storage
tank - a small but nonetheless costly move.
'Any analysis of the costs and benefits of this proposal produces very
disappointing results,' says Mr Aurelio Ayala-Thomas, head of the Spanish
petrol retailing industry's trade group. 'It entails a lot of investment for
a tiny return in environmental terms. These emissions account for only 2 per
cent of total emissions of volatile hydrocarbons.' Like many EU businessmen,
Mr Ayala-Thomas is urging a more balanced approach. He thinks dealing with
industrial waste is a more pressing priority.
One man who has experienced the bitter costs of environmental clean-ups in
an extreme form is Mr Dietmar Hayn. He is mayor of Molbis, a little
community in the heart of the brown coal mining region south of Leipzig.
Molbis was once dubbed the 'filthiest village in Europe' because of the
neighbouring Espenhain lignite liquification plant which was run flat out by
the East Germans. The plant has now been closed down, and Molbis is being
restored.
But employment has fallen from 6,000 to only 1,000. Mr Hayn is hoping to
attract in new industries - including factories which make environmental
control equipment.
In Leipzig, Mr Arnold Vaatz, the Saxony environment minister, talks of 'jobs
versus the environment'. Coal miners in his region recently demonstrated to
persuade a Potsdam power station to burn lignite rather than natural gas,
despite the environmental consequences.
But though Mr Vaatz wants to clean up Saxony, he is acutely aware of the
price. Hourly production costs in his former Communist-run territory are
already 10 times higher than in neighbouring Poland and 100 times higher
than in Russia. Yet he still has to conform to EU water standards, for
example, which he estimates will cost DM43bn for a population of only 4.6m.
Up in Finland, the heavily export-oriented forestry and paper industry is
finding that the environment can entail two quite different types of cost.
One is the bill for cleaning up its factory operations. The other is for
adapting its manufacturing processes to produce products which meet the
environmental standards of its foreign customers. For example, Finnish paper
companies now try to make paper which uses less bleach and contains more
recycled paper.
Mr Pertti Salolainen, Finland's foreign trade minister, confesses to deep
scepticism about Europe's future - in large part because of the costs it is
loading upon itself. 'In the Far East, they are now producing products at
prices which are equal just to our raw materials. We can't continue like
this.' Even though Finland's jobless rate is already 20 per cent he warns:
'There is more unemployment on the way.'
Mr Salolainen does not believe that the answer lies in compromising on
environmental standards because he thinks they are less to blame than
unrealistically high wages. But he does believe that Europe should hasten to
reach international agreement on standards so that they do not get whittled
down by competition among countries keen to reduce their costs.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Insolvency ruling 'puts jobs at risk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The administrators to Paramount Airways, the insolvent charter airline, are
set to fight an Appeal Court ruling which could jeopardise tens of thousands
of jobs at companies in financial difficulties.
Insolvency practitioners warned yesterday that the ruling was likely to lead
to substantial job losses for employees in the thousands of companies
entering administration or administrative receivership each year.
The Appeal Court has ruled that where an administrator or receiver continues
for more than 14 days after his appointment to employ staff and pay them, he
in effect adopts their existing contracts of employment.
Insolvency practitioners said the ruling could result in substantial
additional claims on the assets of an insolvent company to meet the
employment costs, which would have to be paid before any money would go to
other creditors.
Practitioners warned that they were likely to lay off many more staff rather
than risk being held personally liable for additional costs of meeting
redundancy or unfair and wrongful dismissal claims.
Mr Robin Tutty a partner of City solicitors Fox Williams said the ruling
'drives a coach and horses through receivership practice over the past five
years'.
The 1986 Insolvency Act makes administrators and receivers personally liable
on all contracts 'adopted' by them. Since 1987 they have relied on the
Specialised Mouldings case as authority for saying they can avoid liability
if, during the 14-day period, they write a letter to employees disclaiming
liability for existing contracts.
Paramount's administrators, Mr Roger Powdrill and Mr Joseph Atkinson of
accountants Touche Ross, wrote such a letter within the 14-day period, but
Lord Justice Dillon said their assertion that they were not adopting the
contracts was 'a mere wind with no legal effect'.
The judge said where administrators and receivers 'substantially continued
after 14 days to employ staff and pay them in accordance with previous
contracts, they would be held impliedly to have adopted those contracts'.
Mr Tutty said the ruling could result in claims against receivers stretching
back over seven years and running into millions of pounds. The immediate
effect of the judgment would be that receiverships would dry up. Receivers
would not risk liability by continuing to trade and as it was unlikely that
banks would want to indemnify receivers against potential liability,
receivers would have little alternative but to lay off staff.
Mr Powdrill refused to comment on the details of the case but said it was a
'terrible decision' for the 'rescue culture' - the recent emphasis in
legislation on creating mechanisms to prevent companies from failing. He
added: 'There are very big sums involved.'
It is believed that the Paramount creditors' committee will next week be
asked to approve a decision to apply for leave to appeal to the House of
Lords.
In the Paramount case, the costs of taking on existing employees' rights of
the pilots to the company are estimated to add Pounds 600,000 to be paid out
before other creditors could receive any money.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Treasury upbeat on recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A buoyant view of the economic recovery was presented in the Treasury's
monthly monetary report yesterday. The report was published as Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, met Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England, to discuss whether a rate cut was needed in the midst of turmoil in
the financial markets.
The Treasury report dismisses a number of recent economic statistics, which
appeared to suggest that the recovery was weakening, on the grounds that
they were caused by seasonal factors.
Describing the fall in manufacturing output in December, the report says:
'The difficulty of seasonal adjustment around holiday periods always casts
extra uncertainty on the allocation of output between December and January.'
The surprise rise in unemployment in January is described as being 'broadly
consistent with a continuing improvement in labour market conditions'.
Overall, the report says: 'The latest indicators are mixed, but consistent
with a trend of continuing recovery.'
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'The Treasury
is clearly trying to talk up the recovery. This will be one of its major
themes as long as the story is remotely plausible.'
The Treasury's optimism was given some support by Mr Howard Davies,
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, who said that
regional members were becoming increasingly confident that the recovery
remained on course. Mr Davies said that given the turmoil in financial
markets the CBI was not calling for an imminent rate cut.
The chancellor and the governor will have decided whether to cut base rates
at yesterday's meeting. The timing is in the Bank's hands.
Mr Briscoe feels a unilateral UK rate cut is implausible but one might occur
as part of a co-ordinated international series of cuts.
Meanwhile, reports from two analysts, published today, predict higher
interest rates in 1995. Mr Bill Martin of UBS says base rates will have to
rise from the current 5.25 per cent to 10 per cent by the end of next year
as underlying inflation hits 5 per cent and headline inflation surges to 7.7
per cent in the fourth quarter of 1995.
Mr David Kern of National Westminster Bank sees a more modest rise in base
rates to 6.5 per cent by the end of 1995, with headline inflation averaging
4 per cent next year.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Auditors seek to limit liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Self-interest overcame fear of public criticism yesterday as the council of
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales voted to support
a campaign to limit auditors' liability.
Council members voted by 41 to 13 to endorse a paper to be submitted to the
Department of Trade and Industry calling for amendments to companies
legislation. The move stems from the profession's concern about the rising
level of litigation against auditors.
The paper backs the campaign launched last week by the UK's largest eight
accountancy firms to remove section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act, which
forbids auditors to place a cap as a multiple of their fees on their
liability if they are sued.
In the longer term, the paper also calls for reform of the principle of
joint and several liability, which means auditors can be made to pay all the
costs of a legal claim even if they are only partly at fault.
Several council members from smaller accountancy firms and those who are
employed in industry argued during the debate that the case was purely one
of self-interest, relevant only to the larger firms.
But Mr Michael Chamberlain, institute president, rejected a call for a
separate vote, which would have identified how many of those in favour of
the campaign were partners in the big firms.
Two members argued that shareholders would not be in a position to influence
the negotiations between the auditors and the company over the cap on
liability.
Others criticised the quality of information presented with the paper and
were sceptical over the seriousness of the litigation crisis.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Public optimism about economic outlook slumps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Public optimism about the economic outlook has slumped to its lowest level
for a year, according to a MORI opinion poll in today's Times.
The newspaper's economic optimism index, measuring the proportion of the
public who think that the general economic condition of the country will
improve rather than get worse over the next 12 months, has fallen to -14,
the lowest level since the -21 recorded in February last year.
Separately, Mr Kenneth Clarke used an interview with Today newspaper to
attack high executive salaries.
He said he did not think the government had the power to intervene. 'But I
do think that with the rates of taxation having been reduced, people should
think twice before allowing their boards to award them excessively high
salaries.'

FT  03 MAR 94 / Biggest monthly rise in house prices since 1988 reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further evidence of the continuing recovery in the UK housing market emerged
yesterday as Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, confirmed that
house prices rose 2.2 per cent in February, the biggest monthly gain since
September 1988.
Figures produced by the Inland Revenue show that the number of homes sold
has also risen sharply.
According to Halifax the average price of homes has risen 3.8 per cent in
the past 12 months to Pounds 62,498. The latest price rise follows two
months of small price falls. The society said this confirmed that the slow
recovery which started in the housing market last year was continuing.
Inland Revenue conveyancing records show that the 113,000 house purchases
completed in England and Wales in January were more than a third higher than
the figure in January last year.
Conveyancing completions have exceeded 100,000 in all of the last seven
months compared to just once in the previous seven. Even so sales last year
rose only 5.1 per cent to 1.19m.
This compared with a low of 1.13m in 1992. The 1993 figure was still the
second lowest annual result since transactions peaked at 2.14m in 1988.
Halifax said that if the recent trend continued transactions could rise by
between 10 per cent and 15 per cent this year, which would be the highest
level since 1990.
The society expects prices to rise at a slower rate and is forecasting an
average increase of 5 per cent this year.
It warned purchasers and sellers not to read too much into one month's
figures, saying that the rate of annual price increase was likely to fall in
the next two months 'because of the large monthly rise which occured last
March and April'.
As a result the society 'would expect to see much smaller rises in coming
months'.
According to the society the average price of a new house rose 0.4 per cent
in February and 1.7 per cent over 12 months to Pounds 67,523.
Halifax's latest figures conflict with a report on Tuesday by Nationwide,
the country's second largest building society, which said that UK house
prices on average had fallen by 0.6 per cent in February compared with
January.
It is the third month running that the societies' figures have differed.
Nationwide in January and December reported monthly increases of 0.4 per
cent and 0.8 per cent respectively while Halifax reported falls of 0.4 per
cent and 0.6 per cent.
The societies are in closer agreement on the annual rate of increase, with
Nationwide reporting 3.2 per cent and Halifax 3.8 per cent.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Crackdown urged on fraudulent links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies may be required to disclose details of all parties related to them
by transactions, under tough proposals designed to crack down on fraud.
Under Fred 8, the draft directive from the Accounting Standards Board,
related parties will include individuals or companies connected with,
influenced by or controlled by the company, its pension funds, its directors
and managers and their immediate families.
Fred 8 will make it more difficult to conceal many frauds associated with
recently-collapsed companies.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board, said: 'This is a fraud-prevention
standard. We are asking companies to tell us what they would rather we did
not know.'
The discussion document calls for disclosure of all material related-party
transactions, including the name of the controlling party, any ultimate
controlling party, the amounts involved and any other information necessary
to understand the financial statements.
It requires disclosure of any transactions involving a material difference
between the fair value of an asset, liability or service and the transacted
amount. This would disclose practices such as the transfer of assets below
real value, and movements of money to and from the company.
The standard relies on auditors to insist on disclosure. The Auditing
Practices Board is developing guidelines on the subject.
Mr Tweedie said: 'If the auditors don't do their job, we are sunk.'
Fred 8 significantly extends the existing requirements under company law to
disclose related-party transactions, which need only be shown in accounts if
they are judged by the directors to be outside the normal course of business
activities.
The board's new provisions include children of directors regardless of their
age, and managers as well as board members.
Comments on the standard are due by June 15.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Public-sector pay up 10% before general election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public-sector pay bill rose more than 10 per cent in the year 1992-93,
according to a newly-published statistical supplement to November's Budget.
The supplement shows that public-sector pay rose from Pounds 68.8bn in
1991-92 to Pounds 76.2bn in 1992-93, meaning an average pay rise after
inflation of 7 per cent. The level of the increase during a recession may
help explain the current squeeze on public pay.
In 1992 the findings of the pay review bodies were all accepted in full  -
with the general election looming. These included a 7.5 per cent increase
for teachers. One of the effects of the large rise was a slight fall in
current expenditure in 1992-93.
The swing from such a large increase to a rise of only 1.5 per cent in
1993-94, and now the planned pay freeze until 1997, will today be
highlighted by Mr Chris Trinder, an analyst at the Public Finance
Foundation, at a Trades Union Congress conference on public-sector pay.
Today's conference, to be addressed by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial
secretary to the Treasury, will also be shown a TUC analysis of the effects
of the impending tax changes on public-sector workers.
The TUC says an ambulance worker will be Pounds 17.13 a week worse off, a
local government worker Pounds 9.63 a week worse off, while a train driver
will lose an extra Pounds 10.08 a week, assuming no pay rise this year.
The statistical supplement reveals that the government plans a cut in real
terms of total civil service spending between 1993-94 and 1996-97. However,
employment is planned to fall only 25,000 to 523,000 over the same period.
White- and blue-collar workers in local government said yesterday that they
would put in a joint pay claim for the first time.
Mr Jack Dromey, public services national secretary for the TGWU general
union, said that all forms of discrimination against manual workers should
end.
He added that local government workers would be seeking a rise of at least
2.9 per cent, the level received by most workers covered by the pay review
bodies.
Local government employers welcomed moves towards phasing out the
distinction between white- and blue-collar workers, but said there was
little room for manoeuvre on pay.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Watchdog attacks credit insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit insurance sold with loans and credit cards is 'costly and rife with
exclusions', the Consumers Association says in a report published today in
its Which? magazine.
The insurance, also known as payment protection, covers repayments if the
borrower becomes unemployed or cannot work through ill-health.
Premiums have risen steeply because of the high rate of claims during the
recession. On average, insurance now adds 65 per cent to the cost of credit,
the association says.
Details of exclusions are rarely provided at the point of sale. The Which?
report cites the example of a policy sold to an unemployed man. He later
found a job, but subsequently lost it. His claim was rejected because the
policy excluded claims if the borrower was unemployed at the start of the
agreement - this had not been pointed out to him.
Credit insurance providers have frequently used inertia selling methods,
where insurance is automatically included with a loan or credit card unless
the borrower specifically ticks a box to decline it, or crosses out a clause
in the small print. The Office of Fair Trading asked lenders to end inertia
selling by the beginning of this year, but so far not all have complied.
The OFT is now threatening to review the consumer credit licence of any
lender found still to be using inertia selling after the end of this month.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Monk's order inspires followers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Columns of accountants are converging on Edinburgh today to pay homage to
the author of the first manual of double-entry bookkeeping published 500
years ago.
More than 100 accounting historians will be gathering in the city as guests
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, which says it is the
world's oldest professional body for accountants.
The two-day festival of accounting - renamed the siesta of accounting by
unkind observers - is designed to celebrate the life and works of Friar Luca
Pacioli, an Italian monk.
Among his many contributions to learning was documentation of the principles
of accountancy known as 'the Italian method' - for every credit there is a
corresponding debit. These have remained unchanged ever since.
The festivities began yesterday with the planting of a red oak in Queen
Street Gardens in memory of Pacioli. This delayed the start of the
institute's council meeting.
There will be a Pacioli seminar today and an ambitiously-named session, 'A
torch for the future', tomorrow to consider how the profession may change.
Rival professional bodies have recently been battling to come up with a
range of events to praise Pacioli during 1994. Events are planned later this
year by Italian, US and international accounting bodies.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last week
unveiled an exhibition on Pacioli called 'Figures in proportion', which
displays an original copy of his 1494 book, Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria,
Proportioni and Proportionalita.
As Pacioli concluded in his book: 'Accounts are nothing else than the
expression in writing of the proper order of your affairs.'
The Scottish institute will also have its version of the book on display,
although its attempts to launch a similar exhibition failed through lack of
sponsorship.
The English institute said proudly that 83 people had visited the exhibition
since it opened last Thursday, which was 'above expectations'. These
included the provincial curator of the Franciscan Order in London, the order
of which Pacioli was a member.
The Scottish accountants are expected to turn up in larger numbers, though
they have shown that they also have a sense of proportion.
Some 125 are expected for the Pacioli seminar today, and 215 for the
conference on Friday.
However 232 are booked in for the final event tomorrow evening - a
celebration dinner to close the festival.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Westminster auditor seizes papers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Magill, Westminster city council's district auditor, yesterday
impounded documents in the council's offices and said he is considering a
further investigation into the council's alleged 'gerrymandering' policy.
The documents were identified by Mr Magill and four of his assistants who
visited Westminster city hall yesterday morning. They will be held in 'joint
custody' by the council's acting managing director, Mr Bill Roots, and Mr
Magill at least until mid-October.
In January Mr Magill published provisional findings that six Conservative
councillors - one of whom has since committed suicide - and four council
officers should be surcharged Pounds 21.5m. He said they had manipulated the
council's housing policy so that council house sales were concentrated in
eight politically marginal wards.
Touche Ross, in which Mr Magill is a partner, said his visit to city hall
was not directly connected to the designated sales policy. It said: 'The
auditor and the council have received a number of questions on the 'Building
Stable Communities' policy of which designated sales are alleged to be a
part.' The documents held in custody are 'relevant to this matter'.
Mr Magill's priority is to resolve the designated sales inquiry before he
makes any further investigation.
He also announced that the nine people named in his January report will have
until April 8 to request an oral hearing on the allegations. This would then
take place in mid-October.
The 'Building Stable Communities' programme was launched by the council's
former leader, Dame Shirley Porter, in 1986. Its official aim is to prevent
the long-term migration of residents from Westminster and includes 'quality
of life' initiatives to improve the local environment and bans on office
developments in residential areas.
The council defended the policy by pointing to the 1991 census which showed
a rise in the borough's population over the previous 10 years. It had
previously decreased every census since 1911.
Mr Neale Coleman, co-ordinator of the objectors to Westminster's policy,
described yesterday's events as an 'anti-shredding manoeuvre'.
He said: 'If Mr Magill's final view is anything remotely approximate to his
provisional view then he plainly will have to investigate all the other
matters.'

FT  03 MAR 94 / Option of extra Bosnian troops 'not closed off'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signs of a softening of government attitudes towards sending additional
British troops to Bosnia emerged at Westminster last night amid reports of a
looming clash on the issue between ministers and defence chiefs.
As officials sought to play down differences, saying service chiefs and
ministers were 'four-square in step', senior ministerial sources said the
option of sending extra troops had not been closed off.
Last month's request from General Sir Michael Rose, the British UN commander
based in Sarajevo, for an immediate addition of 3,000 troops had been seen
as premature, the sources said. Britain was unlikely to send more ground
troops if no other country did.
In public comments to date, ministers have tended to adopt the harder line
that if extra troops are needed they should come from countries which do not
already have forces on the ground.
As recently as yesterday, writing in London's Evening Standard newspaper, Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said: 'The plan for opening Tuzla to
relief supplies should be carried out. Mostar, Vitez and the Maglaj pocket
need relief. This means redeploying the UN force and may need extra men.
Britain, France, Spain, Holland, Canada, Malaysia and many other countries
are doing their bit. The extra should come from elsewhere.'
Mr Hurd emphasised that the 2,500 British troops escorting convoys in the
region were 'a bigger contribution than any except the French'.
Contacted last night, Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the defence select
committee who is due to meet Gen Rose in Split next week, said he thought
there was a row between ministers and defence chiefs.
The chiefs were saying Britain should 'send what we can', while the
government's position was that 'others should do their bit'.
Sir Nicholas said it was his understanding that a request had been made to
the UN for an additional 7,000 troops. He 'absolutely' backed the
government's stance that Britain must not be drawn into the conflict 'inch
by inch'.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Legal aid to go to higher incomes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Lord Chancellor yesterday said he would raise the income levels below
which people qualified for legal aid.
Lord Mackay wrote to the president of the Law Society and the chairman of
the Bar proposing to raise the green form income limit from Pounds 61 a week
to Pounds 70 a week - an increase of nearly 15 per cent.
The Lord Chancellor said he was anxious to improve the coverage of the
scheme for those who are dependent upon certain benefits, particularly
invalidity benefit.
The move restores some of the cuts in the legal-aid budget.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spending by overseas visitors to the UK rose 15 per cent to a record Pounds
9.1bn last year, but higher expenditure by British travellers abroad led to
a widening of the tourism balance-of-payments deficit.
British travellers abroad spent Pounds 12.8bn last year, a 14 per cent
increase on 1992, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
The travel account deficit of the balance of payments rose to Pounds 3.7bn,
compared with Pounds 3.4bn in 1992.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The liquidators to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
have been forbidden by a British Virgin Islands judge from using information
gained from examining banking files in the country last year.
The Honourable Mr Justice Ephraim Georges made the order last month against
four liquidators to the bank and Mr Michael Holden, the inspector of banks
and trust companies for British Virgin Islands.
It follows Mr Holden's decision late last year to grant liquidators from
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, access to records about companies they
believed were connected to Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz. The liquidators are
suing National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Khalid, its former
chief operating officer.
The records related to Connaught Place Investments, a company registered in
the British Virgin Islands which is believed to own residential property in
London.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Sheerness admits unfair dismissals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Port of Sheerness conceded yesterday that it had unfairly dismissed 247 of
its dock workers nearly a year ago when they refused to accept new terms and
conditions of employment, including wage cuts of up to 60 per cent, Robert
Taylor writes.
The former dockers have been offered cash compensation that could amount to
about Pounds 10,000 each, but they are not expected to secure re-instatement
in their old jobs.
The climbdown by the employers came unexpectedly on the third day of an
industrial tribunal hearing into the case of the dismissed workers.
The dispute at Sheerness erupted after the privatisation of the port in
1991.
The workers alleged that they were told by the new company that they would
be made redundant if they rejected sweeping cuts in their pay and benefits.
When they started a work-to-rule they were dismissed, although with
redundancy.
Their jobs have since been taken by others under the new terms and
conditions.
Mr Keith Watson, an official of the TGWU general union at Tilbury, said
yesterday: 'It is a marvellous victory for our members. It shows workers can
resist successfully the imposition of new contracts of employment on them.'
The tribunal will reconvene this afternoon. It is expected that a settlement
between the port and the dockers will be announced then.

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia appeared yesterday to modify its stand against British companies.
However, this came before Mr John Major, UK prime minister, made remarks
critical of Malaysia.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister, said the Malaysian
cabinet had reaffirmed its decision that British companies should no longer
be given government contracts but emphasised that the scope of the action
applied only to government contracts and procurements, and not to the
private sector.
In recent days several private companies in Malaysia have announced that
they would support the action. However Mr Anwar said the private sector
should not become involved.
He also denied suggestions by Malaysia's education minister that relations
between Malaysian colleges and British educational institutions should be
broken off and that Malaysian students should no longer go to Britain.
Mr Anwar said Malaysia had been forced into taking action. 'We had no
choice. Why do I have to decide in favour of British companies and then be
questioned, harassed and accused when we can give the contract to some other
company?'
Observers feel that Mr Anwar, by emphasising that the action applied only to
government contracts, was seeking to modify Malaysia's stance. Some
Malaysians are concerned that action against Britain could damage the
Malaysian economy. Fears have also been expressed that the action might
contravene Gatt and bring retaliation from the European Union.
But later remarks by Mr Major to the BBC are likely once again to infuriate
the Malaysians. Mr Major described the Malaysian move as short-sighted and
said it could damage Malaysia's interests as well as those of Britain.
'I don't believe that what the Malaysian government has done to British
companies is remotely justified,' he said.
Mr Anwar said Malaysia had not sought any link between the memorandum of
understanding on British arms sales to Malaysia and aid for the Pergau dam
project.
He repeated his government's version of negotiations on the project - that
the proposals for a British company being awarded the Pergau contract only
became competitive after the British government offered concessionary loans.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Northern Ireland committee could be in place after Easter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs are to vote next week on whether to set up a parliamentary select
committee on Northern Ireland in a move expected to bring the creation of
such a body significantly closer.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, will this afternoon announce the
timing of next week's debate - which could pave the way for the committee to
start work shortly after Easter.
In an adroit piece of tactical manoeuvring, ministers have decided to hold
the Commons debate on the annual renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act
on the same day. Labour traditionally opposes renewal of the act and is
annually pilloried for its stance by Tory backbenchers.
The select committee move will be interpreted as a bid to placate the Ulster
Unionists, the province's largest political party, which vowed this week not
to return to round-table talks on Northern Ireland's future with Dublin and
other constitutional parties.
In another development certain to be welcomed by unionists, Lord Fitt
intends to use a speech today in the Lords to urge participants in the talks
to discard the old 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed' formula.
The independent socialist peer, who founded the mainly Catholic Social
Democratic and Labour party, intends to urge participants to concentrate on
agreeing a structure for a power-sharing elective assembly in Ulster.
Lord Fitt is expected to argue that many SDLP members would welcome such a
step and would not be prepared to let the absence of an Irish dimension,
dealing with relations between the province and Dublin, stand in its way.
He intends to call for the publication of the agreement hammered out last
year by Mr John Hume and Mr Gerry Adams, arguing that the SDLP leader had
put the Sinn Fein president on a pedestal.
The UUP's increasingly inflexible stance was yesterday criticised as
'regrettable and very disappointing' by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign
minister. Mr Spring is to meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland
secretary, in Dublin on Friday for informal talks ahead of next week's
meeting of the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference.
The committee move was immediately attacked by both the SDLP and Sinn Fein,
but was supported by Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party.
Mr Adams urged the government to ignore unionist demands for a select
committee, which he described as an 'exercise in time-wasting and crisis
management'.
It was unclear last night whether the Commons would vote next week on
details of the select committee's composition, which remains a bone of party
political contention.

FT  03 MAR 94 / PIA warns over non-membership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Firms which refused to join the personal investment authority, the new
regulator for retail financial services, could find themselves effectively
under its regime anyway, Mr Joe Palmer, the authority's chairman, said
yesterday.
The statutory right to choose to be regulated directly by the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, would survive but, he said,
SIB would be effective in deterring those who wanted to take that route.
SIB was 'quite likely' to tell those who wanted to come directly under its
control that it would apply the PIA rulebook and the PIA compensation scheme
arrangements.
Mr Palmer told the inquiry by the cross-party treasury committee of MPs into
financial regulation that such firms would then find themselves 'under our
framework of regulation without any say at all in how it was to be handled'.
In the 10 days since the PIA prospectus was published there have been a few
indications of support from within the life insurance industry. Many large
firms have continued to voice concern, however, while stopping short of
declaring that they would not sign up to the new regulator.
It is essential for the PIA's credibility as a regulator that it attracts
enough backing from life companies, banks, independent financial advisers
and others in the financial services sector.
Mr Palmer said: 'We need the willing support of at least the majority of the
industry we seek to regulate.'
But he and Ms Colette Bowe, PIA chief executive, faced scepticism from the
MPs about how effective the authority could be in checking standards across
its potential membership of 6,000 firms and individuals particularly since
in the case of the large life insurers and banks it would be dependent on
senior management for the control of individual sales agents.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Heseltine stresses role in winning Rover safeguards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's role in seeking to safeguard the future of Rover's
operations in Britain after its acquisition by BMW of Germany was stressed
by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, in the Commons
last night.
Pressure from Tory backbenchers and Labour MPs for a cut in interest rates
brought no response from the government during a debate on manufacturing
industry.
Mr Heseltine vigorously denied Labour charges that the passing of Britain's
last volume carmaker into foreign ownership would mark the abandonment of
the approach to industrial policy he advocated when bidding for leadership
of the Conservative party.
While acknowledging that he was in the Far East on a trade mission when the
agreement by Rover to sell to BMW was announced, he insisted: 'We did not
stand back from it.'
Mr Heseltine said Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, saw leading
figures in BMW, as a result of which 'assurances were given'. He emphasised
that if the deal was agreed, Rover would maintain its UK base with
independent manufacturing, design and development facilities.
Mr Heseltine told MPs: 'I am proud that it was one of my ministers who asked
for these assurances and got them.'
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, attacked the
government's failure to prevent erosion of the manufacturing base.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Treasury lawyer tells Scott of legal 'chaos'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior government lawyer yesterday backed a reform of the system for
handling public interest immunity certificates after admitting that there
was legal 'chaos' in the Matrix Churchill case and questioning whether it
should ever have taken place.
Mr Gerald Hosker QC, the Treasury solicitor and former legal adviser to the
Department of Trade and Industry, told the Scott inquiry on arms sales to
Iraq that in future prosecuting counsel would be expected to take a stronger
lead in ensuring disclosure of material relevant to the defence.
The inquiry heard that in September 1992, one month before the Matrix
Churchill trial, Mr Hosker received a memorandum from the intelligence
agency SIS - or MI6 - criticising the chaos affecting several Whitehall
departments in their preparations of PII claims on behalf of ministers.
The SIS note focused on the lack of co-ordination in a secret
inter-departmental Whitehall committee known as the Restricted Enforcement
Unit - involving the identification of documents subject to classification
under the PII system.
Earlier Mr Hosker said he had doubted whether the prosecution of three
Matrix Churchill executives on charges of selling arms-related goods to Iraq
should go ahead after hearing that senior Whitehall officials had accepted
that advice from Mr Alan Clark, the former trade and defence minister, may
have suggested to the executives that they had government support.
Lord Justice Scott questioned how the doctoring of official papers and the
drafting by civil servants of inaccurate witness statements could be
justified 'in the public interest'. He described one witness statement
prepared by government lawyers as 'junk'.
Mr Hosker returns to the Scott inquiry today, when he will be pressed about
the advice given to the ministers who signed PII certificates.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday avoided commenting on the row
over Mr Michael Heseltine's evidence to the inquiry. Mr Heseltine on Tuesday
accused Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, of offering contradictory
advice.
The dispute between the two ministers is expected to dominate prime
minister's question time today, when opposition MPs will try to exploit the
government's embarrassment.
Pressure on Sir Nicholas eased yesterday as he continued to insist that he
would not resign unless he was criticised in Lord Justice Scott's final
report.
There were continued rumblings of unease among Conservative backbenchers
about Mr Heseltine's evidence, which some think has significantly increased
the danger that the judge's report will severely damage the government.

FT  03 MAR 94 / PolyGram becomes first victim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Malaysian government's trade ban against UK companies claimed its first
victim yesterday - the music group PolyGram, which is Dutch.
PolyGram Television International, which has the rights to sell the
television show of the Brit pop awards, said it was told by fax that the
programme, which features artists such as Elton John, Meat Loaf and Van
Morrison, would not be shown in Malaysia.
Although PolyGram has its headquarters in London it is 75 per cent owned by
Philips, the Dutch electronics group. PolyGram, which owns PolyGram
Television International, is quoted on the Amsterdam and New York stock
exchanges but is not listed in London.
PolyGram yesterday refused to comment on the ban or to say whether it had
pointed out to the Malaysian government that it is not a UK company. The
company, one of the world's largest music groups, has a growing Asian
business. It announced this week that its operating income in the Far East
and Japan had increased by 22 per cent to Fl 197m (Pounds 68m).
The Brit awards, which took place in London last month, are organised by the
British Phonographic Industry, representing UK music companies.
The awards were sponsored by Britannia Music which, in spite of its name, is
also a PolyGram subsidiary and therefore Dutch-owned.
PolyGram Television International is believed to have sold the television
show to 20 countries. The contract to screen the awards in Malaysia is
thought to be worth less than Pounds 10,000.
PolyGram Television said the fax it had received from a Malaysian television
station said: 'Due to the recent announcement by the Malaysian government
pertaining to contracts with UK companies, we regret to inform you we are
unable to pursue this programme for now. We will contact you again should
there be any changes.'

FT  03 MAR 94 / Safeguards over Rover stressed
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's role in seeking to safeguard the future of Rover's
operations in Britain after its acquisition by BMW of Germany was stressed
by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, in the Commons
last night.
He vigorously denied Labour charges that the passing of Britain's last
volume carmaker into foreign ownership would mark the abandonment of the
approach to industrial policy he advocated when bidding for the leadership
of the Conservative party.
While acknowledging that he was in the Far East on a trade mission when the

He said Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, saw leading figures in BMW,

Mr Heseltine emphasised that if the deal was agreed, Rover would maintain
its separate base in Britain with independent manufacturing, design and
development facilities.
He told MPs: 'I am proud that it was one of my ministers who asked for these
assurances and got them.'
Mr Heseltine urged his Labour critics to recognise that, while manufacturing
was important, it accounted for only 27 per cent of the wealth producing
sector and 20 per cent of the whole economy.
He attacked Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs for damaging Britain's exporting
companies by 'innuendo and smear', and claimed that Labour's industrial
strategy would lead to the re-imposition of controls over dividends.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, launched an attack on
the government's failure to prevent the erosion of Britain's manufacturing
base.
He taunted Mr Heseltine with a reference in his book Where There's A Will to
the importance of maintaining British control over Rover.
Mr Cook said British companies distributed most of their profits in
dividends because of the fear that a fall in share price would lead to a
takeover bid.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Port admits unfair sackings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Port of Sheerness conceded yesterday that it had unfairly dismissed 247 of
its dock workers nearly a year ago, when they refused to accept new terms
and conditions of employment, including wage cuts of up to 60 per cent.
The former dockers have been offered cash compensation that could amount to
about Pounds 10,000 each but they are not expected to secure reinstatement
in their old jobs as they had wanted.
The dramatic climbdown by the employers came unexpectedly on the third day
of an industrial tribunal hearing into the case of the dismissed workers.
The dispute at Sheerness erupted after the privatisation of the port in
1991.
The workers alleged that they were told by the new company that they would
be made redundant if they rejected sweeping cuts in their pay and benefits.
When they started a work to rule they were dismissed, although with
redundancy. Their jobs have since been taken by others on the new terms and
conditions of employment. Mr Keith Watson, an official of the TGWU general
union at Tilbury, said yesterday: 'It is a marvellous victory for our
members.
'It shows workers can resist successfully the imposition of new contracts of
employment on them.'
He added: 'Employers everywhere are paying less and less attention to their
legal obligations to their workers. This case should give at least some
heart to those who want to resist employers ignoring the law.'
The tribunal will reconvene this afternoon. It is expected that a settlement
between the port and the dockers will be announced then.

Hoshizaki Electric, a private Japanese company making ice machines, is to
set up a plant to supply the European market at Telford, Shropshire.
The company, which has annual turnover of more than Pounds 500m, holds 70
per cent of the Japanese market.
It will spend about Pounds 1m setting up the operation, employing 15 people
initially and 100 by 1996. Production schedules call for 3,000 units this
year, climbing to 10,000 in 1996.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Railtrack to inherit Pounds 2bn of BR debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack, the company which takes over responsibility for British Rail's
track and signalling in April, will inherit Pounds 2bn worth of BR debt, Mr
Bob Horton, BR chairman, said yesterday, Charles Batchelor writes.
Railtrack will have to achieve a return on its Pounds 6.5bn of assets which
will allow it to service that debt, Mr Horton told a conference of the Bow
Group, a Conservative think-tank. It has already been set a target by the
government of a 5.6 per cent return on assets, rising to 8 per cent after
four years.
Railtrack has yet to decide whether to continue to service the debt or make
an early repayment, the company said.
The final details of Railtrack's financial arrangements with the government
will be decided soon. The broad outline was announced by Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, last month with an announcement that Railtrack expected
to levy track charges of Pounds 2.2bn on train operating companies. That
would be matched by subsidies.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Ministers expect no council capping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers are increasingly confident that the government will not have to
limit, or cap, the budgets of any English councils this year.
According to provisional Department of the Environment figures, none of the
137 billing authorities for which information has been received is proposing
to set a budget above the cap limit.
These include Gloucestershire and Harlow, two of the three councils capped
last year. The third, Conservative-controlled Castle Point district council
in Essex, has not set a budget yet, but will not exceed its capping limit.
Ministers expect an increasing proportion of councils to set budgets at
their cap limits, rather than below. All 39 English county councils have
made their spending plans for next year and only three have not set a budget
at the limit imposed by the government.
If the government does not need to resort to capping for the first time in
recent years, it will enable ministers to claim in the approach to local
elections in May that they are exercising increasingly tight controls on
local spending.
Last year's quota of three capped councils was less than half that of
previous years.
Neither the Association of District Councils nor the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, whose members include all the English charging
authorities, have yet been informed of any councils intending to breach
their capping limit.
Provisional figures indicate that 35 of the councils that have set budgets
so far are proposing to set council taxes lower than last year. That is in
line with last week's survey by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance
and Accountancy which found that council taxes are rising at less than the
rate of inflation.
But Dr Linda Murray, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats on local
government finance, predicted on the basis of county budgets, which have
increased by an average of 2.3 per cent, that the average household council
tax bill would rise by an average of 6.6 per cent to pay the extra costs.
Dr Murray, the leader of Berkshire county council, dismissed the local
government finance policy as 'another plank in the government's tax rise
policy', and added that the DoE's figures predicted an average rise of 7 per
cent.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Clarke turns on Labour tax critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday countered a renewed onslaught
on his November Budget by accusing Labour of 'spreading myths' about the
effects of tax increases.
Mr Clarke mounted a vigorous defence of the government's taxation record, in
line with the Conservatives' determination to meet Labour criticism head on
in the campaigns for the forthcoming local and European election and Commons
by-elections.
His comments followed claims by Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to
the Treasury, that the tax on insurance premiums announced in the Budget
amounted to a breach of the government's pledge not to extend the scope of
value added tax. 'The people of Britain will be hit by a triple whammy of
rising crime, rising insurance premiums and now a tax on their insurance
premiums,' she said.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Vosper in talks with Swans' receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vosper Thornycroft, the Southampton-based shipbuilding and engineering
group, confirmed yesterday that it is in talks with the receivers of Swan
Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder.
Mr Martin Jay, Vosper's managing director, said the discussions with
receivers Price Waterhouse were 'exploratory and tentative at this stage'.
He declined to give details of his company's intentions towards Swan Hunter,
in receivership since last May, or to say whether it had been spurred into
discussions by a likely bid for Swans from Vosper's French rival,
Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie. Teams from Vosper and CMN have been
at Swan's Wallsend premises this week.
Swan Hunter union leaders were yesterday uneasy about Vosper's apparent
interest. 'Our concern would be that they've come in to delay the situation
with regard to CMN, and in doing so CMN may very well canter on somewhere
else,' said Mr Dick Gonzalez, leader of the Confederation of Shipbuilding
and Engineering Unions at Swans.
Last summer, responding to a letter from Swans' unions, Mr Jay wrote that
his company had spare capacity at its yards on the south coast and therefore
no interest in the purchase of Swan Hunter.
Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle East, said yesterday that Vosper
could now have sound commercial reasons for acquiring Swan Hunter, which has
slimmed since receivership from nearly 2,500 employees to 1,038. But, he
added, Vosper might be only interested in Swans' intellectual property.
Vosper, with cash reserves of about Pounds 60m and a Pounds 600m order book,
exports 95 per cent of its output. It has strong overseas order prospects,
including eight patrol boats for Kuwait, for which it is competing against
CMN and German-owned Lurssen.
