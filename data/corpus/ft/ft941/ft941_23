FT  22 FEB 94 / Thatcher arms memo demanded

A prominent opposition figure in Malaysia says he will ask the government of
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, for a copy of a 1988 memorandum of
understanding signed by Dr Mahathir and Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the then UK
prime minister.
The document related to more than Pounds 1bn of British arms sales to
Malaysia.
Mr Lim Kit Siang, leader of the opposition Democratic Action Party, has been
the main force behind the setting up of a parliamentary panel to investigate
the arms sales.
'The all-party parliamentary committee on parliamentary honour and national
integrity will write to prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad for a copy of the
secret memorandum of understanding signed with Margaret Thatcher,' said Mr
Lim.
Mr Lim said the panel would also ask for a list of the local agents of the
various British companies involved in the arms sales following the signing
of the memorandum 'to ascertain whether there was any favouritism,
irregularity or hanky-panky involved'.
The Malaysian parliamentary committee has yet to meet and opposition MPs say
it is unlikely that parties that make up the governing national front
coalition will agree to being represented on the body.
In Britain the Labour party has alleged that the 1988 memorandum on defence
sales to Malaysia was linked to the granting of Pounds 234m of UK aid for
the Pergau dam project in Malaysia.
Such a linkage would be a breach of the government's own aid guidelines.
Two British parliamentary committees are investigating the affair.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Scottish assembly row brews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A political row was brewing at Westminster last night over government plans
to sell the building in Edinburgh which had been converted in the 1970s to
house the proposed Scottish assembly.
Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, used a Commons written answer to
announce that the government was offering the Old Royal High School for sale
to the City of Edinburgh District Council, its original owners.
Labour pounced on the decision saying that it showed the government's 'lack
of commitment to addressing the constitutional issue in Scotland.'
Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, said: 'It will not divert us
from our clear intention to set up a Scottish parliament in an appropriate
building.'
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour MP for Edinburgh Central, said the move was
widely seen as 'quite deliberately provocative' and 'part of a bid to
polarise Scottish opinion between the status quo and separatism.'
He said it was disingenuous of the government to offer the building to the
district council which had 'limited funds to buy anything'.
The government, which is offering the building at market value, acquired it
from the council in 1976 for Pounds 650,000.
The Pounds 3.75m adaptation and refurbishment was completed in 1978. In 1979
a devolution bill failed to clear the hurdle requiring 40 per cent of the
electorate to back it.

FT  22 FEB 94 / More use prepaid burial or cremation plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past eight years about 100,000 people have arranged and paid for
their own funerals using the services of companies which arrange everything
from a choice of coffins to hymns, procession routes and headstone
inscriptions.
Once the fees are paid, prices are guaranteed until the services are needed.
The Office of Fair Trading investigation will look into an industry which
claims to offer 'peace of mind' to those who wish to plan for their funerals
in advance. The four main companies providing pre-paid funeral schemes -
market leader Chosen Heritage, Dignity, Golden Charter and CWS - offer a
variety of plans ranging from about Pounds 750 to more than Pounds 5,000,
though most customers pay between Pounds 850 and Pounds 1,200.
Through two voluntary regulatory bodies, the National Association of
Pre-paid Funeral Plans and the Funeral Planning Council, the companies
believe they already provide many of the safeguards the OFT is looking for.
Both regulatory organisations have drawn up codes of practice and demand
that members hold fees in independent trust funds with separate custodian
trustees.
Mr Graham Williams, of Chosen Heritage, which is recommended by the charity
Age Concern and claims 60 per cent of the pre-paid market, said: 'Once the
fee is paid it does not matter if the funeral takes place next year or in 20
years.'
Dignity, which claims to be second in the market - but will not release any
figures - offers four basic plans but allows customers to specify anything
they want. Dignity claims its fees are 'significantly less than the average
price of a funeral'.
CWS, the co-operative society, provides 25 per cent of all funeral services
and does not contract out any of its services to independent funeral
directors.
Mr Alan Edwards, operations manager of CWS, said: 'We are one of the very
few firms who do everything in-house.'
Life policies offered by insurance companies can cover some of the costs of
funerals, but payments are made in instalments rather than in a lump sum.
The full cost of a funeral is not always guaranteed, as premiums do not rise
with the prices of funerals.
Mr James Duffell of Norwich Union said that some customers might prefer life
assurance plans because they could pay in small monthly instalments.
He welcomed the OFT's investigation: 'Since we are both (life and funeral
service companies) targeting the same customers, regulation would put us on
a level playing field.'

FT  22 FEB 94 / ITC to revive Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission yesterday came out in favour of
re-advertising the franchise for Channel 5, provided the government
guarantees that the necessary frequencies will remain available over the
next few years.
The commission rejected the only bid for the franchise when it was initially
advertised in December 1992 and has been considering whether to re-advertise
or reserve the frequencies for the development of digital television
channels.
The commission's move was welcomed by the consortium consisting of MAI, the
controlling shareholder of Meridian Broadcasting, Time Warner, the world's
largest media group, and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times and Thames
Television. The consortium has said it would bid if the television channel
were advertised.
The commission is seeking assurances from the government that it accepts a
Channel 5 service 'is not incompatible with a longer-term strategy for
digital terrestrial television'. It is understood that opinion within the
Department of Trade and Industry is divided on the issue.
Digital transmission would allow television signals to be compressed,
permitting the transmission of several channels in place of one. The
consortium said yesterday that it would be misconceived for the government
to block the availability of a new freely-available terrestrial channel
'whilst considering a technical system which is still some years from
introduction'.
However, Mr Nigel Walmsley, chief executive of Carlton Television and
chairman of the ITV engineering policy group, said the frequencies should be
used to create terrestrial digital television.
'While the ITC has a duty to consider the case for Channel 5, the government
needs to decide if the new developments in digital television should now
take priority'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Rule change may push up funeral costs: Pollution law could
cost Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Funeral costs may rise sharply as owners of crematoria are faced with
spending up to Pounds 100m in the next few years to meet new environmental
rules, managers said yesterday.
Britain's 200 or more crematoria need to install new incinerators quickly to
meet the standards specified in the 1990 Environmental Protection Act. They
will also need to burn four to five times as much gas to reach the
temperatures specified by the new rules.
'That hardly makes sense if we're all trying to stop global warming,' said
Mr Mike Stride, general secretary of the Institute of Burial and Cremation
Administration, which represents managers of crematoria.
Crematoria, which are currently covered by the Clean Air Act, must comply
with the new rules by 1998. The rules are intended to eliminate emissions of
dioxins, hydrogen chloride and heavy metals, but managers of crematoria said
yesterday that the risk of such emissions was tiny.
'There are more pollutants from cars that come to the funeral than from the
crematorium,' said Mr Graeme Sloan, manager of the Lewisham Crematorium in
south London.
The complaints come against a background of criticism from many sectors of
industry that the act is too bureaucratic and adds to industrial costs
without achieving adequate environmental improvement.
Mr Tim Wood, superintendent and registrar of the West Hertfordshire
Crematorium near Watford, said: 'Under the new rules, I will have to
completely rebuild the crematoria, replace the four cremators with larger
ones, and add 10 feet to its 30-foot chimney'.
He said that improvements under the EPA - which he expects to cost Pounds
1.2m - are the main reason for the steep rise in fees for a cremation to
Pounds 165, up from Pounds 98 in 1991.
Mr Stride said: 'Most places are looking at spending half a million pounds -
this will probably cost the industry Pounds 100m, and that's before the
extra gas costs'.
A typical crematorium might see its gas bill rise from Pounds 4,000 a year
to Pounds 20,000. Mr Wood said that following the announcement of the
de-regulation of gas supplies, West Hertfordshire, which buys from British
Gas, is 'trying to find a gas company to supply us with a cheaper tariff'.
Some local authorities which cannot afford the investment 'are thinking of
selling up crematoria to the private sector or leasing them', said Mr
Stride.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Unions 'a force for change'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions are now 'a positive force for change' in making the UK industry
globally competitive, a senior union leader said last night.
But workers needed the legal right to workplace representation that their
counterparts in Germany and Japan have if industry was to achieve a new
partner-ship between capital and labour, said Mr Bill Jordan, president of
the AEEU, the country's largest manufacturing union.
'A legal right to representation at the place of work would be a giant step
towards eradicating the British disease instead of just suppressing the
symptoms as successive governments have done. Good legislation is a catalyst
for change,' Mr Jordan said in a speech in London.
He emphasised that this was 'not the same thing as a right to recognition
for unions'.
But if that caused non-union employers to look at the thinking and practice
of modern trade unionism, they 'would discover Britain's biggest industrial
world-class companies are overwhelmingly unionised'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / MP urges halt to work on pit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Conservative MP yesterday urged the government to intervene to prevent
British Coal removing more equipment from a pit for which it is considering
rival bids by two companies.
Mr Peter Atkinson, MP for Hexham, is questioning why British Coal has
intensified what he described as 'scorched-earth activities' at Wearmouth
Colliery, Sunderland, while giving assurances that no equipment will leave
Ellington, Northumberland, while a private takeover remains possible.
Mr Atkinson accused British Coal of stripping Wearmouth of all essential
equipment before a decision was made on private bids.
The MP said bidders were concerned at the continuing removal of coal-cutting
equipment and hydraulic roof supports. Such new equipment can cost more than
Pounds 5m per face and may be hard to replace.
Mr Atkinson said British Coal on Friday ordered removal of the shearer and
supports from Wearmouth's second face, a move which would leave the pit with
no cutting equipment. He doubted that Longannet in Scotland, where both
Wearmouth shearers are being sent, needed so much equipment.
His comments coincided with confirmation that new cutting equipment was
delivered to Ellington and sent underground this month, barely 48 hours
before the closure announcement. 'Until a pit's closure is announced things
carry on as normal,' said British Coal yesterday.
Wearmouth bidders had been told what equipment would remain, it said. In
December, the corporation said it planned to remove equipment with a
written-down value of Pounds 8.3m from the pit.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Singer's contract defended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pop singer George Michael sued his record company in spite of achieving
everything possible in terms of fame, success and wealth, counsel for Sony
told the High Court yesterday.
Mr Gordon Pollock QC was making his closing submissions in Sony's defence to
the 30-year-old star's claim that his 1988 contract, which could run for
another 15 years, was a restraint of trade, financially weighted against him
and ultimately unenforceable.
Mr Pollock said that in previous litigation over restraint of trade, the
court would act in the public interest if its moral sense was outraged by
harrowing pictures of a party to a contract starving in the gutter while
society was deprived of his services.
But Mr Michael was a young man desperate for a contract by which to achieve
success, fame and fortune.
'We have a situation here where the person complaining has been wholly
successful in achieving the exploitation of his talent which it was the
purpose of the contract to achieve,' he said.
'At the same time we have not been deprived of the benefit of his talent.'
Mr Michael has claimed that Sony 'killed' Listen Without Prejudice, the 1990
follow-up to his 1988 debut solo album, Faith, to teach him a lesson when he
refused - as part of a change of artistic direction - to market it with a
video featuring himself.
After Mr Pollock's speech, which is expected to last all week, and
submissions from Mr Michael's counsel, the judge will reserve his decision.
The hearing was adjourned.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Labour steps up its protest over clearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party is pushing ahead with its campaign to reduce delays in
cheque clearing by Britain's banks and building societies amid growing
concern about the way in which retail customers are being treated.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, shadow consumer minister, yesterday said building
societies had been making up to Pounds 300m a year by delaying the clearing
of cheques and investing the cash overnight in the wholesale money markets.
He said that the societies were taking up to 10 days to clear a cheque when
it should take two days to do this and deduct the money from the signatory's
account. He called for an end to the practice, which he said costs customers
tens of millions of pounds a year.
Since Labour stepped up its campaign, two high street banks - Midland and
National Westminster - have announced that they will shorten their clearing
cycle for cheques to two days. Barclays Bank has a long-standing policy of
paying interest on retail deposits three days after they are made.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association,
said that there was a difference between the amount of time taken by
societies to clear cheques and the point at which they began paying interest
to customers on those cheques.
If societies were making a profit on those transactions, he said, 'then that
means that the interest rate they are able to pay savers is higher than it
otherwise would be'.
Mr Griffiths is also angered by a poll showing that a growing number of
customers are concerned about the way they are treated in general by the
banks.
The poll, conducted by the Independent Banking Advisory Service, found that
the practices of high street banks led to marriage break-ups, family rows
and insecurity.
The service questioned 1,860 people who contacted it during a four-month
period and found that one in three - 34 per cent - said they were left
desperate or depressed by problems with their banks, while 14 per cent said
they had been driven to the brink of suicide.
'This report makes me wonder whether banks did not treat their customers
better in the 1890s than they they do in the 1990s,' said Mr Griffiths.
The picture painted by the survey's findings was vigorously disputed by the
banking industry.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Prescott in row on private finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour leftwingers yesterday accused Mr John Prescott, shadow employment
secretary, of 'bouncing' the party into accepting plans for sympathetic
treatment of private financing for infrastructure projects.
The row follows the weekend release of a discussion paper on investment
which leftwingers fear may lead to a scaling down of government projects
funded by tax and borrowing. 'This was never discussed,' said one leftwing
member of the shadow cabinet. 'This is a major initiative, and I am very
worried about both the substance and the presentation. We have been
bounced.'
The document was co-authored by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry
secretary, and Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, for a symposium on
infrastructure investment later this week. Mr Brown told BBC Radio from
Geneva: 'It is the duty of a Labour chancellor to look at how we can use the
resources we have to best effect.'
The document, however, is widely believed to have been prompted by Mr
Prescott, who has been pressing the case for greater use of private funds in
infrastructure projects for several years.
There was some dismay among leftwingers about the involvement of Mr
Prescott, whose roots are on the left of the party. Mr Prescott said the
shadow cabinet and Labour's national executive committee had been kept
informed of discussions on the document 'at every stage'.
Mr Prescott blamed the row on inaccurate briefings to newspapers by unnamed
Labour 'spin doctors' who had not read the document. 'It is not very
helpful, frankly,' he said. 'This is a document about accountancy, not
socialism. There is no reason why there should be a problem.'
The document says there is scope for much greater use of private finance in
the provision of transport infrastructure, inner-city redevelopment,
training, housing, childcare and defence diversification. It also suggests a
limited application in the provision of publicly led projects in education
and health.
The document calls for 'imaginative' financing solutions, such as
transferral of development benefits and regulatory changes in return for
investment. Ideas include:
Clearer rules on risk division, project-approval procedures and intellectual
property rights.
Redefinition of the public sector borrowing requirement to exclude
government-owned trading companies.
Relaxation of Treasury controls on jointly financed projects to take account
of social benefits.
A cut in the required rate of return, now 8 per cent, to between 6.5 per
cent and 7.5 per cent, the average real return on private non-oil assets.
Assessment rules giving priority to job-creating projects.
A task force to resolve problems, and an 'investment broker' to investigate
proposals, leaving the government to decide on priorities.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the document
amounted to a disguised attempt to embrace the government's private finance
initiative of 1992.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Electricity bills face rise from nuclear levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electricity bills, which already face the imposition of value added tax,
could also be hit by a rise in the nuclear levy to offset the recent
price-capping agreement in the power generation industry.
The levy, now 11 per cent, provides more than Pounds 1bn a year of the money
needed by Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear utility, to cover the
cost of decommissioning ageing plant. A small proportion of it also goes to
finance renewable forms of energy such as wind farms.
The price-capping agreement by National Power and PowerGen will reduce
electricity bills and also, therefore, the yield from the levy. This means
that it will have to be raised if it is to reach its target of Pounds 8.5bn
by 1998, when it is due to be phased out.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator who arranged the
price-capping agreement and sets the levy, recently announced that it would
fall from 11 per cent to 10 per cent next April. He was thought to be
responding to government pressure to offset the introduction of VAT on home
heating.
But the levy is already several hundred million pounds below target, and the
combination of the cut and price-capping means it will almost certainly have
to be raised quite sharply to get it back on course.
Dr Bob Hawley, chief executive of Nuclear Electric, yesterday accused Prof
Littlechild of granting the generators 'a licence to collude' by sanctioning
the price-capping arrangement, which Offer, the electricity regulator, says
could lead to a 7 per cent cut in wholesale electricity prices.
Nuclear Electric stands to lose more than Pounds 200m a year from the
agreement because it sells most of its output in the wholesale market. This
is on top of whatever it loses from the reduction in the levy.
Dr Hawley said that National Power and PowerGen agreed to price-capping only
because their profits were protected by long-term contracts to sell
electricity to the retail market.
Delay in reaching the price-capping agreement - originally due by the end of
last year - has also forced the government to reconsider the timing of its
sale of the residual 40 per cent shareholding in National Power and
PowerGen. Originally set for next autumn, the Pounds 4bn sale is now likely
to be postponed to February 1995.
However, provided the government can complete the sale by the end of March
1995, the revenues will still enable it to achieve its target of Pounds
5.5bn privatisation receipts in the next financial year.

FT  22 FEB 94 / University cuts first-year intake
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The University of East Anglia will cut its intake of first-year students by
8 per cent this year because of cuts in government funding.
The university said the cut was 'much greater than had been expected', and
that there were 65,000 more students in the English university system in
October 1993 than the Treasury had expected to pay for.
Figures on next year's grants for each university will be announced next
week by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Both the funding
council and the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals suggested that
East Anglia's cut might prove exceptional, and predicted an average
reduction closer to 3 per cent.

FT  22 FEB 94 / MP urges review of competition policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Conservative MP has criticised the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission in calling for a comprehensive review of competition policy.
Mr John Watts, chairman of the Commons Treasury committee, yesterday used a
Westminster meeting to urge a 'thorough investigation into the British
process for regulating competition'.
'There was a time when the great and the good could be relied on to
interpret the public interest according to a widely-held consensus view,' Mr
Watts said, arguing that recent MMC reports 'clearly demonstrate that this
is not the case today'.
Mr Watts, MP for Slough, was supported by Mr Stephen Locke, director of the
Consumers' Association policy unit, who said there was 'considerable
duplication of activity' by the MMC, the Office of Fair Trading and the
Department of Trade and Industry.
The DTI said yesterday it would examine what Mr Watts had to say before
commenting further.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Hanging rejected by larger majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs rejected a demand for the return of hanging for all murderers aged over
18 by a large majority of 244 (403-159) in a free vote in the Commons last
night, Ivor Owen writes.
It was the biggest setback suffered by the pro-hanging lobby since capital
punishment was abolished in 1965, and in effect removes the issue from the
political agenda at Westminster.
An attempt to amend the criminal justice and public order bill to provide
for the reintroduction of hanging for all murders of police officers was
defeated by a majority of 197 (383-186).
The votes followed a blunt warning by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary,
that miscarriages of justice could result in innocent parties being hanged.
In a mainly low-key debate, advocates of the restoration of capital
punishment highlighted the growing number of elderly people being murdered
in their own homes.
They also cited the rise in the number of police officers killed while
investigating robberies and other crimes.
Mr Howard, who had consistently voted for the return of the death penalty
until 1990, described how the overturning of the convictions for terrorist
pub-bombings of the so-called 'Birmingham six' had changed his mind.
Acknowledging support among the police for the view that criminals were now
more ready to use firearms in pursuit of crime, he reaffirmed his acceptance
of the need for a strong deterrent for the murder of police officers.
Mr Howard stressed: 'Those responsible serve as a minimum 20 years in
prison. Many will serve much longer than that.'

FT  22 FEB 94 / Employers criticise Tecs as inflexible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than one-in-four employers find training and enterprise councils in
England and Wales and local enterprise councils in Scotland inflexible, says
one of the first large-scale surveys of business attitudes to the
employer-led bodies.
It also found that one in five criticised the relevance of the help the
councils gave.
The survey of 234 employers - with a combined workforce of nearly 500,000 -
found a significant mismatch between what employers believed Tecs and Lecs
should be doing and what employers thought they actually were doing.
For example, local economic development was given the highest priority by
employers - 33.8 per cent gave it top priority - but only 7 per cent
believed that Tecs and Lecs put this at the top of their agenda.
However, the Tecs (which deliver government training schemes) and Lecs
(which have a wider economic development role) will find some encouragement
in the survey by employment analysts Industrial Relations Services. It
reported that 87.2 per cent of companies use the councils' services.
An Industrial Society report in May 1991 found that less than half of
companies had such contact. But the IRS survey is biased towards larger
organisations and 23 per cent of respondents were represented on the local
Tec or Lec.
Those companies that did have contact tended to come more from manufacturing
than services, with financial services particularly under-represented.
Companies gave four main reasons for contact, all of them connected with
government-inspired initiatives: Investors in People, National and Scottish
Vocational Qualifications, training courses and Youth Training.
Less encouraging for Tecs and Lecs was that only one-third of respondents
who contacted the organisations said they did so about issues of central
importance to them.
Smaller companies generally reported more satisfaction than larger ones,
although between 65 per cent and 88 per cent - depending on the issue in
question - were either satisfied or very satisfied.
The biggest complaint from larger companies in particular was 'civil service
attitudes'. Most organisations that spanned several Tecs or Lecs complained
of problems and one national organisation said that the only way it could
deal with the Tec was to employ one person full-time.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Sports Council complaints backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A top Whitehall official acknowledged yesterday that there had been
justifiable complaints about recent financial management and practices at
the Sports Council, the government body charged with promoting sporting
activity in the UK.
Mr Hayden Phillips, permanent secretary at the Department of National
Heritage, told MPs that the Sports Council had not established a proper
'arms-length relationship' with a subsidiary trust company that it had set
up in 1990.
He also accepted a claim from the National Audit Office, the government's
accountancy watchdog, that 'potential conflicts of interest' had been
created by the award of a tender to a company whose chairman and principal
shareholder was the Sports Council's finance director.
Mr Phillips, whose department administers the Sports Council's affairs, was
giving evidence to the Public Accounts Committee, the committee of backbench
MPs which examines how public money is spent.
Yesterday's enquiry was given no evidence of financial impropriety. However,
the complexity of the council's arrangements was frequently criticised by
PAC members. Mr Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea, said 'it would be hard
to think of a way of organising financial arrangements more likely to arise
suspicion.'
Mr Phillips said that there was some merit to claims that there had not been
full transparency of cashflows between the council and a trust company which
it had set up in 1990. 'The potential conflicts of interest in the
relationship between the trust company and the council did cause real
concern,' he told MPs. The main decisions had preceded the setting up of the
department in 1992.
'I quite accept that the sort of arrangement whereby the same person appears
in different capacities is one which should be avoided,' he said.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Tory peers reject clause on police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday suffered a further embarrassing setback in the
House of Lords at the hands of Conservative backbench critics of the police
and magistrates courts bill.
Peers voted 107 to 100 to reject plans to speed up police disciplinary
procedures after Earl Ferrers, the Home Office minister of state, ignored
Tory calls to back down.
The defeat is the first since the bill entered its committee stage last
week. However, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, has also backed down twice
to avoid a vote.
Peers from all parties supported the amendment, moved by Lord Bethell, a
Conservative adviser to the Police Federation, who said there was 'deep
concern' among police officers about the bill.
The bill would have removed from the statute book provisions guaranteeing
legal representation to police officers accused of disciplinary offences.
Backbench peers said the proposals would place police officers in danger of
double jeopardy - being tried twice for the same offence.
The government faces further trouble today when the Lords debates provisions
intended to streamline the judicial system by improving the administration
of magistrates courts.
Conservative backbenchers have tabled a series of amendments opposing
government plans to reform the duties of magistrates' clerks and to
introduce fixed-term contracts.
The proposals were strongly opposed by Tory peers during the second-reading
debate. However, in spite of growing backbench unrest, the government has
pressed ahead.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Homosexual age of consent lowered to 18
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The age of consent for sex between homosexuals is to be lowered to 18 after
the Commons last night rejected a common age of consent for homosexuals and
heterosexuals at 16 and voted for the compromise favoured by Mr Major.
Mrs Edwina Currie, Conservative MP for Derbyshire South, whose clause to the
criminal justice bill advocating a common age of consent was defeated by 307
votes to 280, pledged to continue the fight for equality.
And she warned that the UK was likely to be forced to change the law by the
European Court of Human Rights if the Commons delayed the matter much
longer.
Although two cabinet ministers were among 42 Conservatives voting for a
common age of consent, a number of prominent Labour members ensured the
reform was defeated. An overwhelming majority of 265 voted to reduce the age
of consent for gay sex from 21 to 18.
Mr Jerry Hayes, a Conservative co-sponsor of Mrs Currie's clause, said: 'It
does not say a lot for tolerance and equality.'
Rightwing Tories said they would vote against any change at third reading.
During the debate Mrs Currie was frequently interrupted from her own side.
She was accused by Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton North) of 'voting to
legislate buggery of adolescent men'. While Mr Bill Walker (Tayside North)
argued that homosexuality was 'neither natural nor normal'.
But Mrs Currie said a law which allowed heterosexuals to marry at 16 but
judged homosexuals to be different was 'nuts', adding: 'There is no logical
argument for discrimination and there is no biological one either.'
Sir Anthony Durant (Reading West) put forward an amendment proposing 18 as
the age of consent for gay sex, which was backed by the prime minister and
his cabinet.
He argued that most 16-year-olds were 'very confused about their sexuality'.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, made an impassioned plea to lower
the age of consent for homosexuals, arguing that in some cases it was
important for the House of Commons to be a step ahead of public opinion.
After the vote homosexual rights activists attempted to storm the entrance
to parliament but the doors were locked.

FT  22 FEB 94 / South Wales Police Authority fails to resolve financial
crisis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The South Wales Police Authority yesterday failed to resolve a financial
crisis that threatens to shut as many as 60 police stations. After a heated
discussion behind closed doors, the authority rejected as 'totally
unacceptable' Chief Constable Robert Lawrence's closure plans.
Instead, it ordered a review of its finances in an attempt to find other
ways of offsetting a deficit of nearly Pounds 2m before the next financial
year - just six weeks away.
A budget review team will meet on Friday to examine possibilities such as
switching some functions, such as the traffic warden service, to the control
of county councils.
More than 3,000 police officers, represented by the Police Federation,
passed a vote of no confidence in the authority.
The local government union Unison, representing 800 of the 1,300 civilian
staff, supported the move, claiming south Wales had been made to look 'a
laughing stock' and warned that the force was in danger of losing its
official certificate of efficiency.
After the meeting in Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan, Mr Roy Jones, authority
chairman and county councillor, said the budget review group would attempt
to draw up an alter-native to police station closures.
As well as closing police stations, the chief constable's report included
the option of selling police cars and cutting spending on uniforms.

MPs rejected a demand for the return of hanging for all murderers aged over
18 by a massive 244 majority (403-159)in a free vote in the Commons last

pub-bombings of the so-called 'Birmingham six' had changed his mind.
He also quoted the case of Mr Stephan Kiszko, convicted when he confessed to
the murder of a schoolgirl and released after 15 years imprisonment when
forensic tests proved he could not have been her killer.
Mr Howard said miscarriages of justice were a 'blot on civilised society'.
He endorsed the view of Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the lord chief justice,
that it would be wrong for MPs to seek to require the judges of the court of
appeal to decide which types of murder should be punished by the death
penalty.
Mr Howard said 'I do not think it is right for parliament to hand over to
others this responsibility. The decision must be ours to take.'
Acknowledging that support among the police for the view that criminals were

He stressed: 'Those responsible serve as a minimum 20 years in prison. Many
will serve much longer than that. Some will remain in prison for the rest of
their lives.'
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, agreed with Mr Howard that the most
powerful argument against restoration of the death penalty was the risk
'that we kill the innocent through a miscarriage of justice'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Merrett may set up outside Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Merrett Group confirmed yesterday that it could set up a new
underwriting business outside of the Lloyd's market, following its
withdrawal last year from the active management of Lloyd's syndicates.
The group, which is chaired by Mr Stephen Merrett, the former deputy
chairman of Lloyd's, transferred management of its syndicates to rival
agents after losing the backing of Names, the individuals whose assets
support the market.
It subsequently restructured its activities around its loss-adjusting and
insurance services companies and is conducting a sizeable 'run off' business
 -administering the payment of claims on business underwritten by its
syndicates in previous years.
Merrett said yesterday: 'The group has been considering various
opportunities . . . However, while the strategy is firm, the structure and
constitution of any new Merrett-linked insurance vehicle remain under
discussion.'
Meanwhile, 39 Names who were members of syndicates managed by the Oakeley
Vaughan agency have dropped their legal action against the corporation of
Lloyd's, the body which regulates and administers the market. After a
six-year legal battle, the Names face a heavy legal bill, with costs
estimated at about Pounds 1m, or an average of Pounds 26,000 a Name.
The Names alleged that supervisory failures by Lloyd's were responsible for
their insurance losses of more than Pounds 6m incurred in the early 1980s.
They had been due in court on February 28 to attempt to prove that they were
owed a legal duty of care by Lloyd's.

Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Commons speaker, yesterday rebuked a group based
in India which has urged a boycott of goods manufactured in the
constituencies of 16 British MPs.
She told the Commons in a statement the call was an 'undoubted contempt of

boycott.
The boycott threat appeared to be targeted against people in Britain who
have campaigned against human rights abuses in India.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
McDonnell Douglas of the US is expected to select the joint aero-engine
venture between the German car maker BMW and the UK aero-engine group
Rolls-Royce to supply the power plant for its new MD-95 100-seater airliner.
Mr Richard Turner, Rolls-Royce's group marketing director, yesterday said at
a Financial Times Asia Aerospace Conference in Singapore that 'detailed
discussions' with the US manufacturer were under way to supply a more
powerful version of the BR-700 engine being developed by BMW Rolls-Royce for
the new MA-95 twin-engine aircraft.
The decision is a setback for Deutsche Aerospace, whose MTU engine
subsidiary in partnership with General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the
US and Snecma of France, are proposing to develop a rival engine to the
BR-700.
BMW Rolls-Royce is also proposing the BR-700 to re-engine older McDonnell
Douglas DC-9 twin-engine airliners. It has already been chosen by Gulf
Stream of the US to power its GV, the business jet, and by Canadair for its
Global Express long-range corporate jet. But the proposed deals with
McDonnell Douglas would enable the Anglo-German venture to break into the
much bigger regional jet airliner market.
Mr Turner said the first full BR-700 engine would start testing later this
year, although the engine core had already run successfully.
Mr Robert Hood, president of the Douglas Aircraft Company, said the US
company would soon start marketing to potential airline customers the MD-95,
a derivative of the company's 130-seat MD-90 and the larger MD-80. All these
twin-engine airliners are derivatives of the older DC-9s.
Aircraft makers expect the market for 100-seater regional jets to show
strong growth in the next 15 years.
Saudi Arabia's decision to award a Dollars 6bn contract for commercial jets
to Boeing and McDonnell Douglas will cost the European aerospace industry up
to 20,000 jobs, Mr Jean Pierson, managing director of the Airbus consortium,
said in Singapore yesterday.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Poland eager to settle UK air dispute -
Warsaw wants London flight row resolved for summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poland is seeking a quick end to the long-running dispute between British
Airways and Lot, the Polish state-owned airline, which has blocked all
direct flights between Poland and the UK since October 30.
'We've lost the winter, that was clear when we failed to get a deal by
Christmas to catch the seasonal traffic, but we now want to resolve the
dispute in time for the summer season starting in April,' says Mr Boguslaw
Liberadzki, the Polish transport minister.
The dispute arose out of the Polish government's refusal to allow British
Airways to double its flights to Warsaw from seven to 14 a week. BA wanted
to introduce an afternoon flight from London which would return from Warsaw
in time for transit passengers to transfer onto flights to North American
and other destinations. Lot feared that this would cream off passengers from
its own transatlantic flights serving the large Polish communities in
Chicago and other cities.
The two airlines, backed by their respective government agencies, have
ignored the protests of thousands of business and other passengers who have
been obliged by the dispute to change aircraft at other north European
airports, doubling travel time between the two countries.
Mr Liberadzki says he reached an 'understanding' with Lord Caithness, the UK
minister who was dealing with the matter until he left the government
earlier this year. 'Both sides agreed they should emerge from the clash
without losing face with the number of flights by both carriers gradually
increasing to 14 a week over three years,' he said. The UK minister now
responsible for resolving the dispute is Lord McKay of Ardbrecknish.
The dispute between BA, which last week announced a threefold increase in
profits to Pounds 65m for the third quarter of 1993, and Lot, which is being
prepared for privatisation, reflects a tough battle by international
airlines for a share in the fast-growing east European travel market.
BA, whose proposed Air Russia joint venture is currently holding fire, has
discarded all previous pooling arrangements with east European airlines,
with the exception of Aeroflot, and has held aloof from the kind of tie-ups
with east European airlines which led Air France to take a stake in CSA, the
Czech airline, and Alitalia to buy a stake in Malev of Hungary.
Instead BA opted to double its flights into Prague, Budapest and Warsaw. It
obtained agreement from the Czech and Hungarian authorities, increasing the
competitive pressure on CSA and Malev and helping to fill seats on its
owntransatlantic and other flights with transit passengers from central
Europe. BA's hopes to achieve the same results in Poland, however, came up
against stiff resistance.
Morale at Lot has improved in recent months and so has profitability. The
company yesterday reported a Zl 62.9bn (Dollars 3.4m) profit for 1993 after
a Zl 84.1bn loss in 1992. It has managed to sell all its old Soviet aircraft
and now runs an all-western fleet of three Boeing 767s, eight 737s and five
Italo-French ATR 72s, leaving it with total debt of around Dollars 1bn.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Trade News: First steps to 'green the Gatt' - A look
at preparations for a negotiating programme for trade, environment and
sustainable development after Uruguay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talks on a work programme to tackle the nettlesome issue of world trade and
the environment are starting to gather momentum after a slow start. Further
impetus may come from a special session today of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade's governing council to discuss the matter.
Though ministers are due to approve the work programme in Marrakesh in
April, governments appear to have only a vague notion of what should go into
it.
The 118 nations taking part in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks
agreed in December that a comprehensive work programme on trade, environment
and sustainable development should be put to ministers when they meet to
sign the final package of trade-liberalising accords.
Informal consultations since then suggest broad agreement on the need to set
up a committee to carry out the work. However, its mandate, and lifespan,
remain controversial.
No one disputes the need for Gatt, and its successor, the World Trade
Organisation, to confront the way in which trade and environment policies
interact and may conflict. There is nevertheless a wide gulf between the
views of environmentalists, who favour changing Gatt rules to facilitate the
use of trade restrictions for environmental protection, and those of
developing countries who fear that moves to 'green the Gatt' may spread a
virulent new form of protectionism.
There has thus been strong resistance among developing countries to
presenting the Marrakesh meeting with a fixed agenda which is bound, they
believe, to reflect rich-world concerns. Instead, they want the Marrakesh
declaration to confine itself to approving the principles guiding the
committee's work and for the committee to decide its own agenda in its own
time.
'Creating a committee on trade and the environment will already be a big
step,' says one influential developing country Gatt ambassador. 'I don't
think we should try to prejudge what the committee should discuss.'
The principles underlying the work programme were outlined by Uruguay Round
participants in a statement last December. They include the need to promote
sustainable development, preserve the open trading system and avoid
unilateralism while ensuring the responsiveness of the trading system to
environmental objectives.
'There should not be, nor need be, any policy contradiction between
upholding and safeguarding an open, non-discriminatory and equitable
multilateral trading system on the one hand, and acting for the protection
of the environment, and the promotion of sustainable development on the
other,' the statement says.
Environmental groups, for their part, fear that leaving the committee to
devise its own work programme will be a recipe for delay and issue-dodging.
More than 40 groups from around the world last week backed proposals calling
for an 'action-oriented' agenda aimed at reaching recommendations within two
years.
Conscious of the sensitivities of developing countries, the proposals stress
support for sustainable development and down-play the role of trade
restrictions. At the same time, however, the Gatt/WTO is urged to address
the two issues which most raise third world hackles.
The first relates to so-called processing and production methods (PPMs).
Environmentalists want Gatt rules changed to allow discrimination between
identical products produced in different ways. This would, for instance,
validate US trade curbs, now judged Gatt-illegal, which ban imports of tuna
caught in ways which kill too many dolphins.
The second concerns 'eco-dumping' - the competitive advantage allegedly
gained by countries with low environmental standards. Mr Charles
Arden-Clarke of the WWF-World Wide Fund for Nature insists that there is no
intention to oblige poor countries to adopt the high environmental standards
of rich ones.
Rather, he says, the issue turns on the more general need to make product
prices reflect full environmental costs. But the suspicion remains that in
practice 'eco-dumping' will serve as a new pretext for protectionism aimed
primarily at poor countries.
Other agenda ideas are less controversial. For the last two years, a Gatt
working group chaired by Mr Hidetoshi Ukawa of Japan has been discussing the
relationship of Gatt rules with the trade provisions of multilateral
environmental agreements, the need for transparency in trade and
environmental policies, and the vexed question of eco-labelling and its
impact on trade.
While the group did not seek to reach conclusions, the ground has been well
worked over. These areas are likely to be priority items for the new
committee even if they do not appear specifically in the work programme
approved in Marrakesh.
The US, despite its high-profile campaign for early Gatt talks on trade and
the environment, has no plans to draft its own agenda proposals. Mr Timothy
Wirth, environment adviser to the US secretary of state, said recently the
main US priority was creating a permanent committee to examine the
trade/environment link.
Washington and like-minded European governments may thus prefer to play safe
and see the committee safely established in Marrakesh before the real
haggling begins.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Japanese airline applies to slash fares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A price war broke out yesterday in the Japanese airline industry when All
Nippon Airways, Japan's second largest airline by turnover, asked the
Japanese Ministry of Transport to allow it to slash international economy
fares by up to 55 per cent.
The move followed a request earlier this month from Japan Air Lines, ANA's
main rival, to cut fares to the US and Honolulu by up to 50 per cent.
ANA said it wanted to reduce its economy fares to Europe by an average of 41
per cent, although the maximum cut would be as great as 55 per cent. It also
wanted to offer a 44 per cent reduction for the standard fare to the US east
coast. JAL said it was looking to cut fares to Asia and Europe, but had not
yet decided by how much.
The ministry has the right to set maximum and minimum fares. The new
tariffs, if approved, would be available from April 1.
The moves represent urgent attempts by both Japanese airlines to boost their
passenger loads. They are suffering from poor demand, caused by Japan's
worst recession since the second world war, fierce competition from other
airlines, and high cost bases.
International routes have suffered particularly badly. ANA's international
loading factor - the proportion of available seats filled - fell from 69.7
per cent during the 1992 financial year to 63.2 per cent during the six
months to last September. Meanwhile JAL's international loading factor fell
from 70.9 per cent during the six months to September 1992 to 66.6 per cent
for the same period last year.
Meanwhile, ANA said it was suspending its joint flights with Sabena, the
Belgian airline, between Brussels and Tokyo's Narita airport. It also
revealed plans to set up routes from the new airport at Kansai to Shanghai,
Beijing, Dalian and Tsingtao in China, as well as Seoul. The company said it
aimed to set up an Asian hub at the airport, due to be opened in September.
ANA forecast it would increase the number of international passengers
carried during the 1994 fiscal year by 6 per cent to 1.6m.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Mexico economic growth at seven-year low: Government blames
restructuring of country's private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's economy grew 0.4 per cent last year, the lowest rate for seven
years, and far short of the November government forecast of 1.1 per cent,
government statistics show.
For the first time in the administration of President Carlos Salinas,
economic growth has been outstripped by population growth.
The manufacturing sector shrank by 1.5 per cent from 1992, with the textile
industry declining by 7.4 per cent, printing and publishing by 6.4 per cent,
and timber by 10.1 per cent. The service and agricultural sectors grew by
0.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively.
The government has blamed the low overall growth and recession in
manufacturing on the restructuring of Mexico's private sector, as companies
closed or reduced operations to compete under free trade.
However Mexico's strong exchange rate and high real interest rates and the
government budget surplus have made the process of restructuring deeper and
more costly than had been forecast.
The 0.4 per cent growth for the year would imply a growth of 0.15 per cent
for the fourth quarter, suggesting that the economy has recovered from the
third quarter, when it contracted by 1.1 per cent.
The government also announced that Mexico's trade deficit fell to Dollars
13.6bn (Pounds 9.3bn) in 1993, a 15.1 per cent reduction on the previous
year. The low economic growth helped slow growth in imports to 5.2 per cent,
to reach Dollars 65.4bn in total. Imports of capital goods fell by 4.7 per
cent, an indication of the difficulties faced by the private sector last
year.
Mexico's exports reached Dollars 51.8bn last year, an increase of 12.2 per
cent. Manufacturing exports, which account for about half the total,
increased by 17.7 per cent.

<TEXT>
The Mexican government and delegates from the rebel Zapatista Army of
National Liberation opened peace talks yesterday in the hope of ending the
nearly two-month conflict in the southern state of Chiapas, Damian Fraser
reports from San Cristobal de las Casas.
The two sides appeared together after the opening session and said they
would meet today to continue to discuss the agenda of negotiations.
Bishop Samuel Ruiz, acting as mediator, said there had been 'sincerity' and
'mutual respect' in the talks.
The Zapatistas seemed to be led by so-called Sub-Commander Marcos, with 17
other delegates.
The government side was represented by Mr Manuel Camacho, peace envoy of
President Carlos Salinas. For the first time he explicitly recognised the
guerrillas as the Zapatista Army of Naional Liberation, and called them a
fully Mexican and predominantly Indian movement.
The two sides at the begining of the talks appeared divided on a number of
issues. Mr Camacho insisted in a communique on Sunday that negotiations
exclude national issues, contrary to the apparent aspirations of the rebels.
However, Mr Camacho left some room for negotiation, saying that 'certainly
there will be a discussion on national issues and we also know that the
solutions to some local problems have national implications.'
With many towns in southern Chiapas divided between Zapatistas and
supporters of the government, the rebel demand for political autonomy for
Indians in Chiapas is likely to meet resistance.
Rich landowners, and some of the estimated 20,000 mainly Indian people who
have fled their homes since the New Year uprising, partly in fear of
Zapatistas, are likely to oppose autonomy that gives political power to
rebel leaders.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Drug cuts transfer of HIV virus to babies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome, the British pharmaceutical company, said yesterday that a new
study found that its drug AZT cut by two-thirds the transmission of the HIV
virus from pregnant mothers to their babies, Reuter reports from New York
and London.
The transmission rate was 8.3 per cent when mothers and babies both received
AZT, marketed by Wellcome as Retrovir. The rate was 25.5 per cent among
mothers and babies receiving placebos.
Wellcome said the US study had been halted and investigators were now
offering Retrovir to all pregnant women and babies who were participating in
the study.
The company plans to submit a package to the US Food and Drug Administration
this week seeking approval for the use of the drug in reducing
mother-to-baby transmission. It will also pass the data on to regulators in
other countries.
Each year in the US an estimated 7,000 women infected with HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus) give birth. About 25 per cent of their babies are
infected with the virus.
The study was sponsored by the US National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, in collaboration with the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development and Institut National de la Sante et de la
Recherche Medicale of France.
Wellcome said investigators found that both mothers and babies tolerated the
drug well, with no significant short-term side effects apart from reversible
mild anaemia in some infants.
Dr Harold Jaffe, an epidemiologist and HIV specialist at the US government's
Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, told the New York
Times the study was 'the first indication that mother-to-child transmission
of HIV can be at least decreased, if not prevented'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Trying hard but could do better, says World Bank: Report for
the 1990s calls for overhaul of the legal system and significant reforms in
other areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For nearly a decade Mexico has been the model pupil of the World Bank,
following its advice on economic policy and receiving in return subsidised
loans of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year, more than granted to any other
middle-income country.
The bank played a crucial part in Mexico's decision to join Gatt in 1986,
the restructuring of its external debt in 1989, and the redesign of
environmental policy two years ago. Bank economists were powerful and
successful advocates of the liberalisation of Mexico's agriculture sector.
The bank has now prepared a restricted circulation report on the economic
challenges Mexico faces in the 1990s. While largely praising economic policy
to date, the bank calls for a sweeping overhaul of Mexico's legal system and
important reforms in the labour and financial sectors, environmental policy,
and provision of public infrastructure.
The bank is worried about Mexico's slow economic growth and low savings
rate, which it believes makes its economy over-dependent on foreign capital.
It concludes that the high current account deficit and modest improvements
in productivity 'raise concern about the sustainability of economic growth'.
The low economic growth is largely attributed to the 'substitution of
foreign goods for domestically produced goods'. This it believes is a result
of the low competitiveness of Mexican companies, partly because their old
technologies have become obsolete and new investment has replaced existing
capital stock rather than adding to it.
Specifically, the bank calls for further economic reform in four areas to
remove constraints on economic growth. The report is highly critical of
Mexico's legal system, concluding that 'weaknesses in the commercial law
framework and the mechanism for the resolution of disputes constitute
important constraints to private sector development.'
The report recommends new laws on secured transactions, which would make it
easier for banks to take possession of property when a borrower has
defaulted. Such a reform should lower Mexico's high financing costs, a
principal complaint of Mexican companies.
The bank says 'the resolution of disputes through the courts is a lengthy,
costly and unpredictable process'. It blames this in part on an
'unacceptable level of competence and integrity of the judges, especially in
the local court system'.
Suggestions for reform are vague, but include a national training institute
for judicial personnel and the establishment of an authentic civil service
in courts at state and federal levels. It proposes reforms to encourage the
provision of binding private-sector dispute resolutions. The bank says
Mexico faces two key labour challenges - increasing the quality of its work
force, and establishing a flexible labour market.
On the first, the report says the problem 'is the low and disparate quality
of the educational system, and especially of basic education'; the failure
of Mexican companies to train workers sufficiently holds back productivity
growth.
Mexico's labour market is regulated by antiquated labour law that makes it
costly to dismiss workers, exhorts companies to promote according to
seniority rather than ability, and makes it difficult to move workers
between jobs, the bank reports.
However, the bank says the main problem is not exactly the law but
agreements companies have reached with unions. The law allows for some
flexibility, but how much depends on the ability of management to win
concessions from the unions.
On infrastructure, the bank approves of the government's move to let the
private sector build and finance toll roads, electricity plants, water
systems and provide telecommunications, but is critical of the way the
policy has been carried out.
The bank calls for more competition, or regulation where that is not
possible, in the provision of infrastructure. It says the manner in which
toll road concessions have been granted needs to be improved, further
deregulation and privatisation is needed in railways, and an independent
regulator should be established in both telecommunications and the
electricity market to prevent monopoly abuses.
On environmental policy, the bank describes the government's threat of
closing polluting plants as costly, ineffective and arbitrary, since it
gives the government too much discretion in responding to businesses'
environmental violations.
Instead it says the government should rely more (as it is now doing) on
mandatory fines for lack of compliance. It recommends economic incentives,
such as taxes on polluting inputs and outputs and higher prices on natural
resources, rather than command and control regulations, as a way of
improving the environment.
Overall, the World Bank says Mexico has been a pioneer in private-sector-led
development, and gives the government high marks for stabilising the
economy. However, it evidently believes the government still has to draw up
and enforce laws that foster competition and efficiency in the private and
public sector and allow benefits of economic reform to filter down to
consumers.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Canadian budget will take only small steps: The Liberals'
real new broom is unlikely to start sweeping until 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's Liberal government has worked hard in its four months in office to
prove that a new broom is sweeping through Ottawa. From promises for a
speedy overhaul of the social-security system to prime minister Jean
Chretien's modest sedan, the Liberals have tried to project a fresh,
down-to-earth approach.
The finance minister, Mr Paul Martin, is expected to try to build on that
theme when he presents his first budget in the House of Commons this
afternoon.
Mr Martin's economic assumptions and deficit forecasts are expected to be
more conservative than the perennially optimistic projections by his
Progressive Conservative predecessors over the past nine years.
The minister will undoubtedly point to a series of pre-budget 'town hall'
meetings, held across the country over the past month, as proof that he has
listened to the concerns of Canadians from all walks of life.
But anyone hoping for an imaginative new plan to achieve the Liberals' twin
goals of cutting the deficit and creating jobs is likely to be disappointed.
Judging from hints dropped by Mr Martin and his officials, the main elements
of today's budget will follow much the pattern set by the Tories. On the
spending side, the minister is expected to extend restraint on civil-service
wages and announce further defence cuts.
Despite the Liberals' criticism of Tory tax increases and signs that
Canadians' tolerance of their heavy tax burden is wearing thin, Mr Martin
plans to squeeze more revenue from taxpayers. Among the possible casualties
are the tax-free capital-gains exemption, currently set at CDollars 100,000
(Pounds 51,020), and a range of business expenses.
Mr Martin has indicated that he will aim for a budget deficit of CDollars
39bn-CDollars 40bn for the year to March 31 1995. That is down from the
CDollars 45bn estimate for the present fiscal year, but still far above the
Liberals' election promise to cut the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP, equal to
about CDollars 22bn in 1994/95, by the end of their third year in office.
While fewer tax breaks and the modest deficit cut will come as a
disappointment to the business community, the word from Ottawa is that the
main purpose of today's budget is to set the stage for bolder measures in
1995.
The Liberals have promised to draw up proposals over the next 12 months to
overhaul the social security system and to conclude a new agreement on
transfers to the 10 provinces of responsibility for health, social welfare
and education.
With these two envelopes making up close to 80 per cent of total federal
spending, no meaningful assault on the deficit is possible until the reforms
are in place.
Financial markets are expected to take today's budget in their stride.
'There's no reason for anyone to be surprised,' says Mr Ted Carmichael,
senior economist at Burns Fry, a Toronto securities firm.
Domestic and foreign investors are more unsettled for the time being by
Ottawa's monetary policies. Uncertainty on this front has been heightened by
three recent developments: the first rise in US short-term interest rates in
five years, the appointment from February 1 of a new governor of the Bank of
Canada, and Mr Martin's tendency to ruminate about interest rates in public.
Mr Martin and the new bank governor, Mr Gordon Thiessen, have a strong
incentive to keep Canadian interest rates falling. Canada is pulling out of
recession far more slowly than the US. The economy is growing at an annual
rate of only about 3 per cent, compared to more than 5 per cent in the US.
The traditional gap between US and Canadian interest rates is already at its
narrowest in more than a decade. The gap on three-month Treasury bills is
only 33 basis points, compared to a peak of 600 points in early 1990. The
spread on 30-year bonds is currently 80 basis points.
The question in the minds of traders, investors and policy-makers is whether
there is room for this gap to narrow still further, or even to disappear,
without causing the Canadian dollar to nosedive.
Inflation in Canada is expected to be no more than about 1 per cent this
year, about half the rate in the US. Even so, Mr Martin sent the dollar into
a spin this month when he suggested that the rise in US rates might bring
Canadian rates below those south of the border. His comments were
immediately followed by a rise in short-term rates to protect the currency.
Bank of Nova Scotia economists noted in a recent commentary: 'The central
bank may have little choice but to sanction higher rates and spreads if
currency pressures continue.'
Despite the impressive inflation performance, the markets have yet to take
the measure of Mr Martin and Mr Thiessen. Although the new governor is
reputed to be a dedicated inflation fighter, he has yet to establish the
credibility of his predecessor, Mr John Crow.
Similarly, Mr Martin and his counterparts in the provinces (whose combined
deficits are even bigger than the federal government's) have not convinced
the markets that their deficit-cutting actions will match their words.
Until they do, economists predict that Canadian interest rates will reach US
levels only at the expense of a further slide in the Canadian dollar.

<TEXT>
Pakistan's elite commandos last night rescued five schoolboys and their
teacher and killed three Afghan gunmen who had been keeping them hostage at
the Afghan embassy in Islamabad.
The rescue ended the 39-hour drama which began with the kidnapping of 67
children and seven teachers in a school bus, in the northern Pakistani city
of Peshawar on Sunday.
During yesterday's five-second operation, at least seven commandos threw
stun grenades and then shot the hijackers at close range.
Earlier military and civilian officials persuaded the gunmen to release 62
children and six teachers.
However, one of the gunmen threatened to kill their captives by noon today
unless they were paid a ransom of Dollars 5m and were provided with military

FT  22 FEB 94 / Right wing rejects ANC compromise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Right-wing parties in South Africa yesterday rejected compromise
constitutional proposals from the African National Congress and refused to
attend a multi-party conference to discuss amending the constitution to meet
their demands.
In an attempt to split the right-wing Freedom Alliance and tempt some
moderate members to defy their leaders and accept a constitutional
compromise, the ANC-dominated multi-party negotiating forum yesterday agreed
to enshrine the ANC's compromise offer in the constitution, with or without
Freedom Alliance approval.
Towards this end, the 1993 constitution was amended to give provincial
governments some powers of independent taxation,to protect provincial powers
from diminution after the April election, and to introduce separate ballots
for national and provincial elections - all important Freedom Alliance
demands.
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC chief negotiator, appealed to the right wing to
accept the compromise. 'We urge them to do South Africa a favour, and not to
plunge this country into a crisis,' he said, after a violent weekend left 48
people dead, some of them in election-related violence.
However, only a limited concession was offered to the Freedom Alliance on
the crucial issue of the powers of provincial governments in areas such as
policing and a host of other functions.
The Freedom Alliance yesterday demanded that provincial governments have
sole authority over areas such as provincial policing, provincial defence,
and the regional civil service, while the ANC continued to insist that
central government should have broadly defined powers to override provincial
government in all areas.
As part of the continuing battle to avoid blame for the failure of
constitutional talks, government and ANC negotiators last night changed the
wording of the constitution dealing with provincial powers to a form of
words which would appear more attractive to the Freedom Alliance, but which
would not have any practical effect.
It was hoped this further concession might make it possible for moderate
right-wing leaders to claim victory, without substantially affecting the
nature of the constitut ion.
Government and ANC negotiators said that there was no legal deadline for
further constitutional amendments before the April 27 elections, but that
practical difficulties would prevent any further changes after last night's
session.

Australia yesterday announced a realignment in defence priorities, shifting

War priorities, Reuter reports from Canberra.
'The clear message of this review is that Australia's security, like its
economic future, lies in and with our region,' Mr Robert Ray, defence

'This means we must be a participant, not an onlooker, in regional security

Two French companies have invited a high-level Iraqi oil team to Paris, the
first such formal invitation by a Western country since the 1991 Gulf War,
the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said yesterday.
Iraq had accepted the invitation - issued by Total and Nationale Elf
Aquitaine - and would send Senior Undersecretary Taha Humud as delegation
leader.
MEES said the two companies had held many meetings in Baghdad since mid-1991
on developing the two giant fields of Nahr Umar (Total) and Majnoon (Elf)
but more negotiations would be needed before draft agreements were
finalised. No agreement can be signed until United Nations sanctions are
lifted.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Lagos still hopes to reach policy pact with IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria has not abandoned efforts to reach a policy agreement with the
International Monetary Fund, Mr Kalu Kalu, the country's finance minister,
told a press conference in London yesterday.
The minister, who meets British officials today on the first leg of a tour
of the main western capitals to explain the government's policy,
acknowledged there was little prospect of an early agreement with the Fund.
The recent IMF mission to Nigeria had 'no problems on the objectives of the
(1994) budget but they expressed reservations on how the objectives we have
set ourselves would be achieved by controlling the foreign exchange rate and
interest rates,' said Mr Kalu.
But he said it remained an open question whether some of the direct controls
recently imposed would continue in 1995.
Western creditors last night saw this as a hint that the government might be
prepared to reconsider its decision to fix the naira's exchange rate at 22
to the US dollar.
The free market value is half of that.
The minister said he was concerned by rise of arrears in service payments on
the country's Dollars 28bn (Pounds 19bn) external debt. Last year arrears
reached Dollars 6bn and are expected to exceed Dollars 8.5bn by the end of
this year.
This assumes that Nigeria will allocate up to 30 per cent of its export
earnings for debt servicing, and a projected oil price of Dollars 14 a
barrel.
If the price dropped below Dollars 14, said the minister, 'we will have to
put another hole in our belts', adding that debt service payments were
already at the 'barest minimum'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Cairo bankers play down extremist threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers in Cairo yesterday sought to play down any possible threat from
Islamic extremists who have warned that Arab and foreign banks were a target
in their anti-government campaign. The extremists had set today as a
deadline for people to withdraw money from what they called 'usurious
monuments'.
A handful of bankers said they had reinforced security, though most said
they were content with measures in place for more than a year, since the
Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the militant Islamic group, first warned that Arab and
foreign businesses might become targets in their campaign.
'There's not much more we can do, and anyway we'd rather not play into the
hands of the militants' propaganda,' one foreign banker said.
A straw poll of bankers in Cairo found few concerned by the militants'
threat and none suggesting they might avoid going in to work.
The Gama'a al-Islamiyya issued their deadline earlier this month after
planting explosive devices outside three banks in Cairo. A fourth explosive
was planted on February 15. Only two of the devices detonated, causing
superficial damage and injuring no-one.
The banks have been made targets because they charge interest, which is
forbidden according to the Islamic Sharia law the militants would like to
see strictly installed in Egypt. All but a minority of specialised Islamic
institutions charge interest, however, and banks yesterday reported no
unusual withdrawals.
The militants' warning appears to be an attempt to prove they retain the
ability to wage a continued and co-ordinated campaign against the government
despite a frequently violent crackdown by security forces.
The Gama'a al-Islamiyya's follow-up to its deadline may therefore prove some
guide to its present strength, and a test of the government's confident
claims to have broken the organisation.
Nevertheless, Gama'a claimed responsibility for an attack on Saturday in
which four people, including two foreign visitors, were injured, when gunmen
opened fire on the Cairo-Luxor train as it passed through a militant
stronghold in Upper Egypt.
In a statement faxed to news agencies, the Gama'a's standard means of public
communication, the group claimed the attack to have been in retribution for
three death sentences passed by a military court on three men charged with
an attempt late last year on the life of Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak.
The three, according to Gama'a, were an army officer and two conscripts
charged with mining an airstrip close to the Libyan border at Sidi Barrani
shortly before a visit by Mr Mubarak.
More than 300 people have fallen victim to the violent campaign between
Islamic militants and security forces over the past two years.
The militant groups have specifically targeted members of the security
forces, high-ranking government officials and the tourism industry, the
latter in what has been a largely successful campaign to damage a vital
component of Egypt's economy.
Last month, Gama'a issued specific warnings to foreigners to leave the
country or risk becoming embroiled in what it called its 'ferocious' battle
with the government.

The trial of five men charged with breaking Singapore's official secrets act
by disclosing a government economic growth figure before it was officially
released resumed yesterday, with the defence presenting its case.
The five, two financial journalists and three local economists, are accused
of colluding in the disclosure of the 4.6 per cent second-quarter growth
figure for 1992 which was published in the Singapore Business Times
newspaper.
Among the accused are Mr Patrick Daniel, editor of the Business Times, and
Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, director of the economics department at the
Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore's de facto central bank.
The trial, which ran for 26 days last year before being adjourned, has
greatly interested Singapore's financial community.
The judge has given the defence five weeks to present its case. If found
guilty, the five accused face a maximum two years' jail or a SDollars 2,000
(Pounds 860) fine or both. They are on bail of SDollars 5,000 each.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Bolger welcomes US thaw

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand's prime minister, Mr Jim Bolger, yesterday welcomed a US
decision to upgrade military and official contacts with Wellington.
Relations were restricted in 1987 when New Zealand passed a law prohibiting
visits by nuclear powered or armed vessels.
Mr Bolger said the policy shift would enable New Zealand to have the kind of
dialogue 'commensurate with our shared interests and values on both
bilateral and broader strategic issues'.
In a weekend statement, the US State Department emphasised that the Clinton
administration had decided to resume senior level contacts, but this did not
mean a restoration of US defence relationships with New Zealand or the
revitalisation of the ANZUS pact, which formerly linked Australia, New
Zealand and the US.
The statement said the US would continue to press for a change in New
Zealand's anti-nuclear legislation. However, the State Department now
recognised that 'our two countries had important business to conduct outside
the area of defence relations. . . To advance that goal, we have decided to
restore senior level contacts with New Zealand on political, strategic and
broad security matters,' it said.
Asked whether the government would now consider amending legislation to
allow American or British nuclear warships to visit, Mr Bolger said there
was no proposal to review the law. 'I would caution against seeing the thaw
as a full restoration of ANZUS.'
President Clinton had undertaken to review the relationship at a meeting
with Mr Bolger at Seattle in December.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Islamic state waits in Algeria's bloody wings: A look at a
nation contemptuous of the old and distrustful of the new
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never has the holy month of Ramadan meant such misery for millions of
Algerians. They do not have to wait for the agreement being negotiated with
the International Monetary Fund - which is bound to include a hefty
devaluation of the dinar - to appreciate the extent to which the government
has lost control of the economy.
The price of onions has nearly trebled since December, that of coffee has
doubled and of cooking oil has increased by more than half. On the black
market, lentils cost three times more than in state shops, while sugar costs
50 per cent more.
Meanwhile the confrontation between the security forces and armed Islamic
groups is claiming at least 100 dead every week. The death of a Russian
civilian technician last Thursday and of a French shopkeeper yesterday
brings the number of foreigners slain since last September to 30. Foreigners
have withdrawn to the major coastal cities of Algiers, Oran and Annaba or,
in the case of foreign oil companies, to the comparative safety of the
southern desert.
Although Ramadan has brought a little life and some cars into the streets of
Algiers after dusk, most people lock themselves up at home as soon as the
sun sets. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, sleep in a different apartment or
house every night. The most radical group, the Armed Islamic Group (GIA),
has threatened to kill women, intellectuals and civil servants who dare
question the need to impose Islamic 'sharia' law.
Earlier this month a GIA spokesman publicly stated for the first time that
his movement would attack 'Jews, Christians and other non-believers because
they support a colonialist plot. This will help the return of Islam as
defined by the prophet Mohammed'.
Last week the group stepped up pressure by threatening 17,000 tax
collectors, arguing that under Islam, zakat is the only acceptable form of
revenue collection. Tax revenues excluding the oil sector and customs duties
were AD112bn (Pounds 3.2bn) last year, AD41bn of which came from direct
taxation.
In the Mitidja plain around Algiers local 'Islamic enclaves' flourish, where
Algerian newspapers in French are banned, as is smoking. Many Algerians who
two years ago applauded the army for suspending the second round of
elections, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win, now appear
resigned to the advent of an Islamic state.
Many simply pray that violence will stop and that the increasingly savage
acts of terrorism will be halted. The nervousness of many young soldiers
manning roadblocks and policemen bear witness to the distress and confusion
that the events of the past two years have brought to 26m Algerians.
In his first speech as head of state, General Liamine Zeroual recently made
clear his belief that security measures alone would not help Algeria out of
a crisis which requires a total rethink of the economic, social and cultural
policies adopted since independence. He acknowledged Algeria's aspirations
for 'radical change'.
General Zeroual is however faced with a dilemma. Many members and leaders of
the now banned FIS movement appear willing to talk, but are increasingly
outflanked by their more radical supporters, a number of whom are switching
support to groups such as the GIA and the myriad other proponents of
violence.
Those Algerians who oppose an Islamic state are not united, but millions
find it difficult to tolerate the same faces on television and in the
newspapers that they have had to endure since independence in 1962. Their
resentment at 32 years of single-party rule and the corruption of a state
command economy is considerable. Yet senior officials continue to make
public statements that few Algerians believe.
Mr Baba Ahmed, the director of the treasury, said last week that negotiating
with the IMF was a decision 'freely' taken by the government. Mr Mourad
Benhachenhou, the minister of the economy, whose vitriolic attacks on the
reforming government led by Mr Mouloud Hamrouche in 1989-91 have not been
forgotten, said that the kind of medicine Algeria will accept from the IMF
must be 'defined in such a way that it does not bring about any kind of
social unrest'.
For his part, Mr Redha Malek, the prime minister since August, who was
confirmed in his post by the new head of state, insisted that terrorism has
gone 'beyond the stage of barbarity and must be liquidated'. As Algerian
ambassador to Washington, he played a key role in securing the release of
the US diplomats held hostage in Tehran in 1981, but his language and manner
cut little ice with the mass of his countrymen, two thirds of whom are under
30 years of age.
The prime minister and other senior Algerian officials are pleased with the
French government's 'clear policy' of support for Algeria. The prime
minister insists that the time for declarations is finished. Referring to
the desperate need to loosen the burden of Algeria's foreign debt payments,
which this year will absorb all the country's oil and gas income, he added:
'We will now count our friends.'
Most western capitals are worried and bewildered by the violence which is
increasingly engulfing North Africa's largest country. Many believe dialogue
with the radical Islamic groups is inevitable, and all know it will be
difficult. Some even fear that it might prove impossible.
The Algerian army, which holds centre stage, has tried and failed to
convince respected members of the former Hamrouche government to take senior
government posts. It knows that Algerians want to see new faces. It also
knows that, were its ranks to split, disaster could ensue.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Singapore suffers an embarrassment of riches: Growth is
greater than is comfortable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many finance ministers can feel as comfortable preparing their annual
budget as Singapore's Mr Richard Hu. Mr Hu's budget address tomorrow will be
set against the background of a far stronger economic performance last year
than had been expected.
According to official figures published yesterday, the Singapore economy
grew 9.9 per cent in 1993, the biggest increase since 1988, and a sharp
acceleration from the 6 per cent growth of the previous year.
Fiscal deficits are virtually unknown in Singapore, and there is little in
the country's recent economic performance or near-term prospects which could
give Mr Hu cause for serious concern.
The surge in growth last year was due mainly to a big increase in activity
in the financial services sector, with rapid bank-loan growth combined with
a sharp increase in stock market turnover. The financial and business
services sector grew 13 per cent last year, more than double the growth rate
in 1992.
But there was also an unexpectedly big jump in manufacturing activity, with
overall manufacturing output increasing 9.8 per cent in 1993 against 2.5 per
cent in the previous year. Singapore's electronics industry, which produces
half the world's output of disk drives as well as many other computer
peripherals, benefited from the US recovery and a computer price war in many
export markets.
Mr Hu says last year's economic growth rate was 'somewhat higher than is
comfortable' and is forecasting expansion of 6-8 per cent this year;
economists generally expect 7-8 per cent.
In spite of the high growth, the government would appear to have little to
worry about on the inflation front: Singapore's consumer price index rose
2.4 per cent last year, a marginal increase on 1992. This year will see a
one-time blip in inflation caused by the introduction of a 3 per cent
general sales tax (GST) in April, expected to add 2.5 per cent to the
consumer price index.
The government, which oversees foreign exchange reserves of more than
Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27bn), controls inflation primarily through currency
market intervention to help a steady appreciation of the Singapore dollar.
Mr Hu says foreign capital inflows, particularly into the stock market, in
effect mean government policy not to internationalise the local currency has
been relaxed somewhat. But he says: 'Our fundamentals are strong enough to
avoid destabilising flows'.
Also warding off an over-heated economy are domestic interest rates which
had already begun to edge up before the US Federal Reserve tightened the
monetary reins earlier this month, a factor expected to dampen domestic
economic activity during the year.
Few surprises are expected in tomorrow's budget. Mr Hu had already announced
the introduction of GST this year. Economists say the finance minister is
likely to cut corporation tax at some point within the next few years from
the present level of 27 per cent to the government's stated target of 25 per
cent. Mr Hu may also raise employers' contributions to the central provident
fund, the government's forced savings system.
However, Mr Hu does admit concern about wage increases in Singapore's large
public sector and therefore may be reluctant to increase employers' costs
further. The need for Singapore to remain competitive is a constant
government theme. Singapore, with only 2.8m people, faces severe labour
shortages. Another constraint is a shortage of land.
Surrounding countries with lower wage rates are challenging the island
republic's export competitiveness. Ministry of Trade and Industry officials
say last year saw an improvement in productivity and a drop in overall unit
labour costs: but Singapore has to keep climbing the technological ladder to
gain advantage over its neighbours.
In spite of high costs relative to other rapidly-growing Asian countries,
Singapore's efficiency and infrastructure continue to attract substantial
new investment, particularly from US companies which committed SDollars
1.45bn (Pounds 625m) or 37 per cent of new manufacturing investment last
year, mainly in the petrochemical, electronics and medical supplies
industries.
Singapore's fortunes remain closely linked to economic activity in the US,
which accounts for nearly a quarter of domestic exports. Singapore's exports
to the US grew 12 per cent last year, while Malaysia overtook the EC as the
island republic's second biggest export market.
Seeking to turn its expertise and other countries' cheaper labour costs to
its advantage, the government has invested several hundred million dollars
in its programme to assist local companies in investments abroad,
principally in industrial parks such as at Wuxi in China, Bangalore in India
and Batam island in Indonesia.
In a country where carefully worked out policies are repeatedly driven home
by a chorus of ministers and officials, the drive to 'regionalise' the local
economy is likely to be a theme of Mr Hu's budget. He has ample resources at
his disposal, though Mr Philip Yeo, chairman of the Economic Development
Board which is spearheading the policy, warns that Singapore will not be a
'regional Father Christmas' and will ensure that every project earns a good
return.

Printers who produce most of Algeria's newspapers yesterday threatened an
unlimited strike, a new blow to a press already suffering from tougher
censorship and the murder of journalists, AP reports from Algiers.
Employees at the state-run printing centre said the military-backed
government, which has cracked down on the press since seizing power two
years ago, had failed to seek a settlement after strike notice was issued on
Jan. 17.
Islamic gunmen have recently targeted journalists. At least nine have been
killed, including one foreigner, a freelance French TV cameraman last month.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Danes aim for lower deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mogens Lykketoft, Danish finance minister, promised yesterday a lower
budget deficit in 1995. This follows criticism by leading economists and
opposition parties that the government's expansionist fiscal policy,
introduced to kick-start the economy out of recession, will get out of hand.
The budget deficit rose from 2.4 per cent of GDP in 1992 to 4.4 per cent
last year, in 1993, according to economy ministry figures. The deficit for
1994 is projected at 4.8 per cent.
Inflation in Austria rose an annualised 3.1 per cent in January after rising
3.5 per cent in December. Inflation rose 4.1 per cent in January last year.
Germany's gross monetary reserves fell DM500m to DM117.6bn in the week ended
February 15, the Bundesbank said. Its foreign liabilities rose DM500m to
DM23.8bn.

<TEXT>
Poland's budget policies have won the approval of the International Monetary
Fund, opening the way to a 20 per cent reduction in the country's Dollars
33bn debt to western government creditors, writes Christopher Bobinski in
Warsaw. Mr Michael Deppler, IMF mission chief, said yesterday Poland had
fulfilled the terms of its 1993 agreement and would be negotiating a new
stand-by arrangement.
The draft budget, which foresees an 83,000bn zlotys (Pounds 2.56bn) deficit
(4 per cent of gross domestic product), will be approved by parliament next
month. IMF approval is needed by Paris Club government creditors, which
wrote down 30 per cent of the country's debt in 1991 and promised a further
20 per cent this year if the country remained in favour with the Fund.
Poland can also use the Dollars 500m stand-by loan which becomes available
at the end of March to help finance its debt reduction agreement with
western banks in the London Club although the talks centre on a Polish
suggestion, resisted by the banks, that the Dollars 12.3bn owed them be
reduced by half to match the Paris Club deal.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Azeris want UK help in Karabakh conflict: Aliev talks to
John Lloyd on eve of his visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Azerbaijan's president, Mr Heydar Aliev, is to press Britain to take a 'more
active part' in finding a solution to the former Soviet republic's conflict
with Armenia around the Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno Karabakh.
In an interview in Baku, Mr Aliev said: 'Britain has always taken a good,
objective position on this conflict, and there has been some sympathy shown
with our position from the United Nations, with four resolutions calling on
the Armenians to withdraw their forces from our territory.
'Now I would like Britain. . . to more actively concern itself with getting
those resolutions fulfilled.'
The Azeri president, who recently visited Turkey and France, arrives in
Britain today.
He wants to use his three-day trip to 'make Britain and Europe more aware of
our point of view, and the possibilities of doing business with us'. He and
his advisers are convinced the west is strongly influenced on Nagorno
Karabakh by Armenian communities in the west.
He and Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, have exchanged letters on the
desirability of signing a contract on Caspian Sea oil exploration. Mr Aliev
is aware this gives him leverage to press Azerbaijan's case for withdrawal
of Armenian troops and settlement of the Karabakh issue under international
auspices.
Mr Aliev said 20 per cent of Azeri territory outside Nagorno Karabakh was
occupied by Armenian forces. 'We now have over 1m refugees, living in
terrible conditions,' he said.
Mr Vafa Gulizade, his adviser on international affairs, said on Sunday a
ceasefire had been agreed between Armenian and Azeri defence ministers under
the chairmanship of General Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister. Forces
were to pull back to defined positions and a meeting at presidential level
was to be held next month.
However, Mr Aliev was cool on the agreement. 'Russia has announced a
ceasefire several times and said it can get the withdrawal of Armenian
troops,' he said. But during the ceasefires Armenian troops had taken
several regions.
Mr Aliev admitted Russian influence had increased since he became president
in a bloodless coup last year. 'Russia is our neighbour,' he said. 'It's one
of the most powerful countries n the world. It's been connected with the
fate of Azerbaijan for 200 years. So what should we do - have a state of
hostilities with it?'
He said it was possible the Russian oil comopany Lukoil would join the
consortium of western companies led by British Petroleum which is likely to
sign a contract soon for exploitation of Caspian oil reserves. But 'further
negotiations' were needed.
Asked about the possibility of Russian bases being established in
Azerbaijan, he said: 'The question hasn't come up before me. Maybe there is
such a desire on the part of the Russians. And of course there are Russian
bases in Armenia and in Georgia.'
Mr Aliev, a former Communist party leader, now says: 'We must never go back
to the days of communism and socialist economy. My most important task,
besides ending the war, is to bring a civilised level of democracy and a
market economy to Azerbaijan.'

FT  22 FEB 94 / Sarajevo guns set to find new targets: A look at the likely
moves to consolidate territory won in other parts of Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials from the United Nations, the European Union, the Russian
Federation and the US meet in Bonn today to discuss what gains made in the
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo can be extended to the rest of the republic.
But military analysts are pessimistic that diplomats will be able to
capitalise on the ceasefire in Sarajevo, let alone react in time to stem the
flow of more artillery to eastern Bosnia, halt the fighting between Moslem
and Croats in central Bosnia, or lift the siege imposed by Croats on the
city of Mostar in the west of the republic.
While attention remains focused on Sarajevo, military analysts believe the
Serbs in eastern Bosnia, and the Croats in western Bosnia, will speed up
their attempts to consolidate their grip over territory they have won in
battle. The Bosnian government forces, now backed by a well-trained
infantry, will also focus their attention beyond Sarajevo.
'Sarajevo is important for the Bosnian Serbs, but it is not as important as
what they want to achieve strategically in the eastern part of the country,'
said Mr Charles Dick, head of the UK-based Conflict Studies Research Centre
at Sandhurst.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, has always aimed at linking
eastern Bosnia to Serbia proper. The Bosnian Croats have a corresponding
goal in western Hercegovina. They may still be able to realise those aims.
For instance, Mr Dick and other analysts believe that Bosnian Serb forces,
without too many restrictions, can transfer any weapons moved out of the
12-mile zone around Sarajevo to other parts of the country.
'There is nothing to stop them,' a Nato diplomat said. 'The point is that
Nato cannot keep declaring a new ultimatum to lift the sieges of Gorazde,
Zepa, or Maglaj because it might be seen as bluffing if Serb - and Croat
forces - do the minimum to meet any deadline' and the threat is not followed
through.
Already Bosnian Serb forces are attempting to link up the Serb-held
territory of Krajina, in south-western Croatia, with Serbia-proper.
This involves cutting a deal with Mr Fikret Abdic, a former Bosnian
government minister who broke away from the Bosnian side, and took over the
control of Bihac, a Moslem enclave in the north-western corner of Bosnia. It
would also involve negotiating a passage through, or around Brcko, on the
Croat border.
'If you want to prevent any more killing, and more territorial gains, you
have to provide thousands of peace-keepers,' a Nato diplomat said. 'But the
omens are not good. General (Sir Michael) Rose (the UN commander in Bosnia)
has not even managed to obtain 3,000 extra troops which he requested last
week. So what kind of message is that sending out to all three sides?'
In the case of Croatia, he added, the government in Zagreb had given no
indication it would withdraw its troops from western Hercegovina.
'We applied some kind of pressure. But it has had little affect,' a US
military expert said. 'I sometimes wonder do our threats carry clout or not?
If not, then there is no reason for the Bosnian government to stop fighting,
because, unlike the Croats and Serbs, they have nothing to lose.'
That is why any UN follow-up plan to the ceasefire in Sarajevo will be
watched closely by all three sides. 'If the roads leading into and out of
the city are not placed under UN control, and if the siege is not completely
lifted very quickly, we will have squandered what political will we mustered
last week,' the Nato diplomat said.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Russia cracks down on banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia yesterday increased the minimum capital requirement for commercial
banks by 20 times in an attempt to flush out hundreds of small
under-capitalised banks and consolidate the Russian banking sector.
Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, said that from next
Monday, the minimum capital requirement for new banks would be increased to
Rbs2bn (Pounds 868,000 at the market rate) from a present threshold of
Rbs100m. Existing banks, as well as those which manage to get a licence by
next Monday, will be given until January 1995 to increase their capital to
Rbs2bn. From 1999, the minimum capital requirement for all players will rise
to a European Union threshold of Ecu5m (Pounds 3.78m).
Mr Tulin said the aim was to protect depositors, reduce money-laundering
through the banking sector and help banks compete internationally.
Exempt from the new requirement would be agricultural co-operative banks
which the authorities want to establish in the Russian countryside and which
would keep the Rbs100m threshold. Another threshold of Rbs500m would be
established for banks which did not take deposits from the population.
With inflation of around 20 per cent a month, unchanged minimum capital
requirements have made it increasingly easy to start a bank. 'A situation
where entrepreneurs face the choice of either buying a good car or setting
up a bank is paradoxical and abnormal,' Mr Tulin told a news conference.
Despite the fact that many of Russia's 2,000 banks are small and
under-capitalised, many of the threats to Russian banking come from larger
banks, in particular those owed lots of money by ailing enterprises which
also happen to be their shareholders. Other problems are institutional,
including a shortage of tools for assessing project risk and recovering
loans.
Mr Andrei Tsumailo, vice-president of Most-Bank, one of Russia's big private
commercial banks, hailed the plan's 1999 target as a 'reasonable long-term
goal'. But he believed that in the shorter term many banks' shareholders,
such as ailing industrial enterprises, would be unable to raise the
necessary capital. At best, such companies would have to divert funds
earmarked for investment 'in an economy which is under-capitalised in every
sector'.
Mr Tulin said banks which could not meet the new requirements would either
have to merge with bigger institutions or fold. The central bank last year
withdrew the licences of 19 banks, many of which met its minimum capital
requirements but abused the central bank's overdraft facility.

FT  22 FEB 94 / EU up in arms over Alpine truck ban: Last weekend's vote in
Switzerland could complicate the path to a wider Europe

<TEXT>
Switzerland yesterday came under blistering attack from European Union
countries over its voters' decision to ban foreign trucks from travelling
through the Swiss Alps.
Italy and Germany, which depend heavily on the Gotthard Pass for the
transport of goods, said they would seek talks within the EU to consider the
implications.
There were worries in Brussels yesterday that the Swiss vote in a referendum
on Sunday could scupper chances of the EU reaching an agreement with Austria
on lorry traffic through its Alpine passes. This has been an obstacle in the
negotiations on Austrian entry to the EU, due to start their final stage
today.
Germany warned that closer ties between the EU and Switzerland would suffer
because of the vote to ban foreign road transit within 10 years. The
decision was supported by nearly 52 per cent of those who took part, in
defiance of the Swiss government's campaign against a ban.
Italy called for an urgent meeting of EU transport ministers, warning that
the decision had set a dangerous precedent and could have a serious knock-on
effect in other countries. France, Spain and the Netherlands also demanded a
tough EU response.
About 1,000 foreign trucks a day cut through Switzerland along the Gotthard
Pass, which bisects the country north to south.
The Swiss government had argued, in its campaign against the ban, that a
12-year accord with the EU restraining heavy traffic provided adequate
protection. EU and Swiss negotiators recently agreed that Switzerland could
maintain its 28 tonne limit and a ban on trucks using roads at night and
weekends. This agreement may be undermined by the vote, provoking
retaliatory measures.
Yesterday, representatives of the Italian road hauliers' association said
the annual cost of the Swiss ban would be L750bn (Pounds 300m) in extra
mileage alone. They calculate journeys will be 400km longer on average.
Mr Raffaele Costa, Italian transport minister, said yesterday: 'Even if the
Swiss are talking of introducing these measures over a period of 10 years to
allow plans for alternative transport, matters will not be easy if not
impossible.' He also pointed out that environmental considerations already
made transalpine traffic difficult.
In Bonn, the transport ministry said: 'The acceptance of the Alp Initiative
(campaign against transit traffic) makes the negotiations with the EU
considerably more difficult.'
The German association of long-haul carriers denounced the move as 'a
further step for Switzerland on its way towards isolation in Europe'. The
move would lead to traffic problems in France, Austria and in the southern
German state of Baden-Wurttemberg.
The association said it would lobby Brussels to threaten Switzerland with
reciprocal measures for Swiss trucks, such as forcing them to use railways
only.
However, Germany's opposition Social Democrats welcomed the Swiss move as a
victory for environmental policy, and Bund, the German association for the
protection of nature, said the ban represented 'a milestone toward resolving
the ecological problems of the Alps'.
Austria believes the Swiss decision will strengthen its hand in negotiations
for EU entry. Mr Viktor Klima, transport minister said Austrian voters would
support entry only if a 12-year transit treaty with the EU, due to run until
2004, remained intact.
The treaty restricts lorry traffic through Austria's passes on environmental
grounds. This would have to be entirely renegotiated once Austria enters the
EU, but the Twelve were poised to offer a three-year transition before
replacing the agreement.
EU diplomats now say that a Swiss ban would displace Alpine transit traffic
to Austria. Many Austrians argue that they should not have to accept the
EU's lower environmental standards as a condition of EU membership.

IG Metall, the German engineering workers' union, is set to begin strike
action in the north German state of Lower Saxony on March 7.
Union leaders said yesterday the strike would start there if, as they
expected, this was agreed in a local ballot of workers.
If the walkout fails to force employers to agree to union demands within two
weeks, the strike will be broadened through northern Germany, Mr Klaus
Zwickel, IG Metall chairman, threatened.
Despite the confrontational stance, Germany's biggest union was at pains to
spell out it had no wish to drive companies to the wall in the country's
severe recession.
The choice of Lower Saxony was designed to minimise the impact of the strike
on industry, Mr Zwickel explained. 'We want to avoid massive social
conflict,' he added.
The strike will initially affect only 90,000 workers at 230 companies. If it
spreads to Hamburg, Bremen and Schleswig-Holstein, a further 170,000 workers
at 380 businesses will be involved.
The numbers are small compared to the 1m metalworkers in the state of
Baden-Wurttemberg in the south-west, traditionally an area where strikes
have started in order to have maximum impact.
Moreover, the union stressed it wanted to avoid disruptive knock-on effects
and would steer clear of sectors worst hit by the current downturn.
'In order to keep the conflict within boundaries, we will at first call out
strikes at companies where there will be no knock-on effect in the metal and
electrical industries,' Mr Zwickel said.
Companies in the troubled car components sector, of which there are many in
Lower Saxony, will not be affected by the strike call. Nor will financially
troubled companies in other sectors be targeted, the union said. The strike
will have no impact on Volkswagen, the car group based in Lower Saxony: its
workers are covered by a separate agreement with the union.
The stoppage seems aimed at financially stable companies, primarily in
machine tools.
Union members will be balloted between March 1 and 3. The decision to
postpone further strike action until two weeks after the beginning of a
strike in Lower Saxony shows the union's desire to avoid conflict, Mr
Zwickel argued.
'It is up to the employers to decide whether the strike remains within
boundaries or whether it becomes a full-scale conflict,' he declared.
IG Metall's tactics seem designed to put pressure on the Gesamtmetall
employers' association to reach a compromise in the pay talks, which broke
down after both sides had made significant concessions.
The union has already stepped back from its initial claim for wage rises of
up to 6 per cent, while employers have relented in their calls to abolish
holiday bonuses. The dispute now centres on how employees should be paid for
working flexible hours.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Enlargement talks snagged on fishing

European Union foreign ministers were last night struggling to agree a
common line on fish in the EU membership negotiations with Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Norway, which restart today in the increasingly remote hope of
concluding by March 1.
Intractable opposition from Spain, France and Ireland to Norwegian ambitions
on future fisheries arrangements could prevent agreement on entry terms with
the four, EU negotiators predicted.
Norway wants to retain control over its rich fisheries resources, but at the
same time to have full access to the EU market for its fish products from
the day it becomes a member, as well as access to Union waters.
Spain, which joined the EU in 1986, will not get full access to the latter
until 2003. Madrid persuaded its partners yesterday that Norway, and in
lesser measure Sweden and Finland, could not be offered a deal which
'discriminates' against existing member states.
The 12 foreign ministers also mandated the European Commission to seek the
'best possible access' for Union fishing fleets in Nordic waters - tacit
acceptance of Spain's insistence that it has historic rights in Norwegian
waters, from which its vessels were barred after 1981. Norway has repeatedly
refused to countenance any further access for the EU.
But the Twelve could not agree on market access for Norwegian fish. France
and Ireland produced a joint paper yesterday calling for restrictions on
Norwegian salmon, herring and mackerel entering the EU. The UK too has
concerns about cheap Norwegian salmon imports but held back from supporting
import quotas. Ministers were last night trying to agree on some form of
safeguards regime against sudden import surges.
Even before yesterday's talks began, the vexed negotiations to bring
Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into the EU had been complicated by
other hardline Spanish demands, among them Madrid's insistence that money
the rich new northerners put into the Brussels budget should be spent in the
poorer south of the Union.
But as what should have been the beginning of the last lap of the
enlargement talks began in Brussels yesterday, tactically ill-timed requests
by Sweden and Austria that their budget contributions should be phased in
served only to prematurely sharpen the money issue. The Swedes in
particular, who want exemption from three fifths of their EU payment for
three years, appear to have made Spain's partners more receptive to the
agenda Madrid is trying to set in the talks.
If membership terms are not settled by the first week of next month, it will
be virtually impossible for the four to enter the EU by January next year.
Missing the deadline, says the senior EU negotiator, 'could decrease their
interest (in joining), and increase our lust for a bigger cake' in terms of
the Nordic and Alpine countries' money and resources.
The UK and Germany, which contribute most to the EU's Ecu70bn (Pounds 53bn)
budget, are already positioning themselves to demand that the newcomers' net
contributions - worth Ecu1.7bn on the Commission's first serious estimates -
should be used to reduce their own EU payments.
Until the Swedish budget request, Spain's main concern, shared with the UK,
was to preserve existing EU majority voting rules enabling relatively modest
alliances within the Twelve to block measures affecting national interests.
But wherever Spain's demands settle, yesterday's lunchtime talks between the
EU foreign ministers left little doubt that the money and resources question
is nagging away at several member states, rich and poor.
Spain has German support in opposing Commission plans to make thinly
populated and inhospitable parts of northern Sweden and Norway eligible for
the same levels of EU regional aid as Andalucia and the eastern German
Lander. Brussels yesterday backtracked and proposed an analogous, slightly
less generous, and possibly time-limited aid regime the applicants at first
sight are inclined to reject.
But it is in the cost of aligning the farm subsidy regimes of the candidate
countries with EU norms that blood could be spilt. Sweden's farm prices are
now close to the EU's, but Austria's are about 25 per cent higher, Finland's
50 per cent more, and Norwegian prices are double those within the 12.
The EU concedes that for a mix of socio-economic, cultural, environmental,
and even security reasons, extra farm subsidies to keep the Alps and the
Arctic populated are legitimate. But who is to pay?

FT  22 FEB 94 / Brussels to study Procter acquisition

<TEXT>
The European Commission is to hold a full investigation into the acquisition
by Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, of Vereinigte
Papierwerke Schickedanz, a subsidiary of the German partnership Gustav und
Grete Schickedanz, it was announced in Brussels yesterday.
The commission will consider whether the acquisition by Procter &amp; Gamble
GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Procter &amp; Gamble, breaches the
Commission's competition rules in the European market for female sanitary
protection.
The Commission inquiry follows a preliminary investigation into the
implications of the acquisition for the European markets in diapers and
feminine protection.
Procter &amp; Gamble has promised to divest VPS's baby diaper business and part
of its feminine protection business to comply witb EU competition rules.
But the Commission remained concerned the moves still left Procter &amp; Gamble
in breach of EU competition rules in the sanitary-towel sector of the
feminine protection market, not least because Procter &amp; Gamble would acquire
VPS's leading sanitary-towel brand in Germany, the commission said.
'Whether the geographic market concerned is national or EEA-wide, the
combined market shares of Procter &amp; Gamble and VPS raise serious doubts as
to the operation's compatibility with the Common Market,' the Commission
said.
It pointed out that factors such as consumer brand loyalty, high promotion
costs and the strength of Procter &amp; Gamble in branded consumer products
meant there were already significant barriers to market entry.
The key task for the commission now would be to define the feminine
protection market, especially if it was national or European in nature, Mr
Bruno Julien, commission spokesman said.
Under EU rules the investigation will take up to four months.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Newcomers swell Italian election lists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
More than 80 per cent of the members of Italy's next parliament are likely
to be either new to national politics or politicians who have changed
parties. This became evident yesterday as the list of candidates in the
March 27 election closed before the campaign begins formally on Friday.
Former leading figures such as former prime ministers Mr Bettino Craxi and
Mr Arnaldo Forlani have stepped down, discredited by corruption scandals.
The parties, new and old, have recognised that all those tainted by the
scandals risk being a political liability and the emphasis is on new or
acceptably recycled faces.
The greatest haggling has been within the Popular Party (PPI) - previously
the long-governing Christian Democrats - who have forged a tenuous electoral
alliance with the Italian Pact movement of Mr Mario Segni, the referendum
leader.
The PPI and the Pact were the last to hammer out an agreement on candidates
for the 475 seats in the chamber of deputies to be elected by the new
first-past-the-post system. The remaining 155 seats will be decided by the
old proportional representation system.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate turned politician who has injected
the main element of uncertainty into the result, is to contest a seat in the
historic centre of Rome having originally sought a Milan constituency.
He is being opposed by Mr Luigi Spaventa, the budget minister in the present
government, who is standing as a candidate for the Progressive Alliance,
dominated by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS).
The two men could not be more different. Mr Berlusconi represents
entrepreneurial success and television soap opera culture; Mr Spaventa, a
Fellow of All Souls at Oxford, is a brilliant intellect with a technocratic
background. The third main candidate in this constituency is Mr Alberto
Michelini, the closest aide of Mr Segni and strongly identified with the
Roman Catholic organisation Opus Dei.
Mr Berlusconi had originally considered a Milan constituency but, following
an agreement with the populist Northern League, agreed to let Mr Umberto
Bossi, the League's leader, treat the city as his seat. The League alliance
with Mr Berlusconi's new Forza Italia movement appears to be holding. But
there are continued strains over Mr Berlusconi's links in southern Italy
with National Alliance, the renamed neo-fascist MSI movement of Mr
Gianfranco Fini.
The polls show Mr Berlusconi and Forza Italia holding 25 per cent of the
vote, well clear of any other party. The polls also indicate that Forza
Italia, League and National Alliance movement would win about 45 per cent of
the vote, insufficient to form a government. Also, once the campaign starts,
the polls are likely to change and the PDS alliance believes it can recover
ground.

FT  22 FEB 94 / O'Reilly moves to increase stake in Independent battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for control of The Independent and Independent on Sunday
newspapers intensified last night as Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish publisher,
moved to increase his stake in Newspaper Publishing, owner of the two
titles.
If successful, this move would make it unlikely that a rival consortium led
by Mirror Group Newspapers could structure a deal satisfactory to all its
members. It is the second time within weeks that the plans of the MGN-led
consortium have been frustrated by Mr O'Reilly's group, Independent
Newspapers of Ireland.
It is expected that Mr O'Reilly, who yesterday morning held 24.99 per cent
of Newspaper Publishing, will shortly be able to raise his stake to 29.99
per cent - just below the level that would trigger a full bid for the
company.
Independent Newspapers of Ireland was last night contacting institutional
shareholders and offering 350p cash per share, conditional on approval from
the Department of Trade and Industry, for the increase in its shareholding.
A bid by the MGN consortium was earlier this month trumped within hours by
Independent Newspapers of Ireland. On Sunday the consortium increased its
offer in an effort to move its 48 per cent stake above the 50 per cent mark.
It raised its bid from 261.6p to 350p a share, in a mixture of cash and MGN
shares but, as the independent directors of Newspaper Publishing noted
yesterday, the cash alternative has not been raised beyond 250p. The latest
move means MGN itself could end up with a 20 per cent stake - in second
place to Mr O'Reilly - compared with the nearly 40 per cent it originally
envisaged.
All parties to the battle are due to meet DTI officials today to discuss the
future of Newspaper Publishing. The MGN consortium has asked Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to allow a takeover without a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry on the grounds that the newspapers
are not economic as a going concern.
Apart from MGN, the consortium includes El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica
of Italy, and founders of the newspapers, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith,
the editor-in-chief. It has so far refused to co-operate with Mr O'Reilly's
camp and he has been denied representation on the board. But this latest
development will put pressure on the consortium to come to an arrangement
with him.
The independent directors of Newspaper Publishing, who are due to meet again
tomorrow, held back yesterday from recommending to shareholders the
increased bid from the MGN consortium. They said they welcomed the
'significant improvement' in the bid, but wanted to see further details of
how the consortium planned to run the business.
The directors are also waiting to see if Mr O'Reilly is prepared to make a
full bid, which they have been urging him to do.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Firms could be barred under PIA regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A number of firms in the financial services industry could be prevented from
doing business by the proposed new watchdog body intended to improve
protection for private investors.
The Personal Investment Authority, which yesterday published details of how
it intended to work, gave a clear warning that firms approved by present
regulators would not be guaranteed acceptance under the new regime.
Mr Joe Palmer, the authority's chairman, said: 'Though we'll be relying on
data from existing regulators, the standards and decision-making are the
PIA's'
Ms Colette Bowe, PIA chief executive, emphasised that the onus would be on
firms to show why they should be admitted to the regulator, rather than on
the regulator to admit them.
Up to 6,000 individuals and firms, from small independent financial advisers
to large banks, building societies and life companies, could be eligible to
apply for membership.
The authority expects to be in operation by mid-July this year, but still
faces resistance from some sections of the financial services industry,
including several leading life insurance companies.
The PIA's hand in overcoming industry opposition was strengthened yesterday
by a statement from the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
regulator, that it was 'minded to recognise' the PIA as the new watchdog for
private investors, and that it intended to end its recognition of present
retail regulators.
This means that members of Lautro, the self-regulatory organisation for the
life insurance industry, and Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for
independent financial advisers, with misgivings about the PIA will not be
able to remain under their present regulators indefinitely.
Instead, firms will have to choose between being regulated by the PIA or
directly by the SIB, which has hinted it might 'sub-contract' this task to
the PIA.
There was a cautious reaction from the financial industry to the authority's
prospectus but it was largely welcomed by existing regulators. Lautro
highlighted the improvements in procedures for dealing with complaints
against members and the 'risk-based' approach to regulation.
The Consumers' Association called the PIA the 'last chance for
self-regulation' and urged the new body to 'ratchet up the threshold of
minimum competence'. The PIA has faced some criticism for deciding that
people working in the financial services industry should make up only 10 of
the 21 board members.
Mr Palmer insisted the plans still amounted to self-regulation. Mr Anthony
Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, urged potential PIA members to
'consider the prospectus positively'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Western leaders divided on next move in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM, JUDY DEMPSEY and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Disagreements between western capitals were emerging yesterday over how to
capitalise on the ceasefire and continuing demilitarisation in the Bosnian
capital, Sarajevo.
President Bill Clinton promised to renew US efforts to achieve peace in
Bosnia, using the 'breathing space' won by Nato's apparent success in
forcing the withdrawal of heavy guns from around Sarajevo.
But he remained wary about issuing further ultimatums in other areas of
Bosnia, cautioning that Nato should 'not undertake a mission it is not able
to perform'.
However, Mr Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister, said Nato should be
ready to go further: 'The Nato partners . . . in consultation with the UN,
should tell the parties concerned in Bosnia that we will not hesitate to
widen this measure to other places in Bosnia if there too the hostilities do
not stop.'
Nato and the United Nations called off plans for air strikes after Bosnian
Serbs and government forces moved or handed in their heavy artillery by the
Sunday midnight deadline.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned that the threat of air
strikes remained. 'If there are heavy weapons discovered within the
exclusion zone or if they go back in there, they are subject to attack by
Nato,' he said before meeting Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's prime minister.
US officials said they would look at ways of encouraging peace moves at
talks with the UK, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union in Bonn
today. The possibilities included efforts to arrange an agreement between
the Moslem-led Bosnian government and the Bosnian Croats so as to increase
the isolation of the Bosnian Serbs, and a widening of the Nato ultimatum to
ease conditions in other besieged towns such as Tuzla, Srebrenica or Mostar.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said any ultimatum to help other
cities in Bosnia was 'weeks away' and Nato's priority was to make sure
Sarajevo remained free from shelling.
But a UN official in New York said the UN planned to reopen Tuzla airport on
March 7 in an operation that could involve close air support.
Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, said yesterday that France
would ask the UN security council this week to put Sarajevo under UN
administration. It was vital, he said, to build quickly on the success of
Nato's ultimatum.
The need to maintain momentum was echoed by Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's
foreign secretary, who was speaking in Paris after talks with Mr Edouard
Balladur, the French premier.

Honda, the Japanese carmaker, is to end its minority shareholding link with
Rover in the wake of the controversial takeover by BMW of Germany of a
controlling stake in the UK carmaker.
Industrial collaboration will also be wound down, but co-operative projects
already under way may be continued.
Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda, and Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder,
chairman of the management board of BMW, met in Tokyo yesterday for the
first time since the German executive and luxury carmaker stunned Honda
three weeks ago with its Pounds 800m deal to buy British Aerospace's 80 per
cent stake in Rover.
Honda said after the 90-minute meeting that it intended to end its 'mutual
equity holding relationship' with the Rover group, which was taken in 1990.
Honda currently holds a 20 per cent stake in Rover's vehicle operations
(including Land Rover), while Rover holds a 20 per cent stake in Honda of
the UK Manufacturing, the Japanese carmaker's Pounds 370m car and engine
assembly plant at Swindon, Wiltshire.
Honda made clear yesterday that in the long term it intended to wind down
its collaboration with Rover, which dates from 1979, although it left the
way open for existing co-operative projects such as the production of the
Rover 600/Honda Accord and the Rover 200/400/Honda Concerto to be continued.
In a statement, Mr Kawamoto said: 'The series of contracts now existing
between Honda and Rover will be reviewed in future business discussions.
'In the future we intend to create a more independent operation in Europe,
using our own resources,' he added.
In London, Mr John Russell, managing director of Rover International,
emphasised that Rover believed there would be no changes in existing
collaboration agreements or component supply arrangements.
He expected that project HH/Theta, Honda's and Rover's respective
replacements for the current Honda Concerto/Rover 200-400, would also go
ahead as planned. Production has been scheduled to start in the autumn.
Yesterday's meeting in Tokyo, which included Mr John Towers, Rover managing
director, had taken place in a 'friendly' atmosphere, said Mr
Pischetsrieder.
While Honda would not reveal details of the talks, it emphasised that its
decision to sever the equity links had been based on what BMW had brought to
the negotiating table at the meeting.
'This time we listened to what BMW had to say and then told them what our
intention was,' Honda said. Terminating its equity relationship with Rover
was one of several options Honda had been considering until yesterday's
meeting, it added.
BMW said that the 20 per cent cross shareholdings between Rover and Honda's
UK manufacturing subsidiary would be swapped, leaving it in 100 per cent
control of Rover. In addition, it would make a cash payment of around Pounds
30m to Honda under the terms of the original 1990 share exchange agreement.
Mr Tony Woodley, of the TGWU union, said the relationship between Honda and
Rover appeared to be 'dead'.
Meanwhile, Sir Teddy Taylor, the Conservative MP for Southend East, called
on the government to apologise to Honda for the 'scandalous' way it had been
treated.
Sir Teddy commented: 'It seems to me it was scandalous to sell off the
company to this ailing German giant for a small fortune without even
consulting Honda.'
Mr Robin Cook, Labour shadow trade and industry secretary, said the deal
could 'throw up serious problems for the existing Rover model range and will
undoubtedly create problems for the future development of Rover'.
Ministers must ensure 'that Rover and its workforce will not suffer from the
takeover'.

THE ROVER-HONDA LINKS - HOW MANY WILL SURVIVE?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Honda owns 20 per cent of Rover Group.
2. Rover owns 20 per cent of Honda of the UK Manufacturing.
3. Rover produces under licence from Honda the Rover 400 and Rover 600
   and PG1 gearbox for its own T-Series engine.
4. Honda supplies V6 engine for Rover 800, 2.0 and 2.3 litre engines
   for Rover 600 and 1.6 litre engine for Rover 200/400.
5. Rover provides body panels for Honda Accord and supplies Land Rover
   Discovery to Honda for sale in Japan as Honda Crossroad.
6. Honda and Rover are developing a replacement for Rover 200/400/Honda
   Concerto due to be launched next year. Rover production would be
   under licence.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Chancellor denies prejudicing defence in arms to Iraq trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke told the Scott inquiry yesterday he was convinced he had
served the national interest by attempting to restrict information on
Britain's intelligence services from the Matrix Churchill trial about the
export of arms to Iraq.
The chancellor, pictured arriving at the inquiry, gave a robust performance.
He insisted that his actions had not prejudiced the defence in the trial and
refused to accept any personal blame.

FT  22 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cider activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A profits warning from Merrydown sent the cider group's shares tumbling 54
to 159p. It also prompted speculation that another drinks group might be
tempted into a bid move. Merrydown blamed a downturn in sales to the
wholesale market.
Analysts, who had been expecting a doubling of profits to around Pounds
3.5m, pulled back to the Pounds 400,000 mark. Although initially hit by the
news, the other two listed cider groups recovered as some market investors
decided that the problems were specific to Merrydown. Taunton finished 7
adrift at 162p, while HP Bulmer declined 5 to 449p.
The regional electricity companies (recs) remained under heavy downside
pressure. Dealers said worries about a potential 40 per cent hit on pre-tax
profits after the distribution review, expected sometime in July, was behind
the slide in the share prices.
On the plus side for the recs, however, were hints that there could be news
later this month of the sell-off of the recs' shareholdings in the National
Grid. These range from 5 per cent to 12 per cent.
The biggest losses in the sector were recorded by Manweb, which dropped 31
to 744p, and London and Norweb, down 27 apiece to 636p and 699p.
Broker recommendations ahead of tomorrow's full-year figures from British
Aerospace helped the shares bounce 5 to 531p, putting it among a handful of
Footsie stocks that moved against the poor market trend.
The group is expected to report a loss because of the inclusion of a Pounds
250m provision, but substantial improvement is expected in the underlying
performance. Strauss Turnbull reiterated its buy recommendation, as did
NatWest Securities.
Sentiment was further boosted by reports that BAe would soon announce a
Pounds 50m property sale, and news that airline Cathay Pacific had firmed up
an order for six aircraft from Airbus Industrie, in which BAe has a 20 per
cent stake.
Anglo-Dutch food giant Unilever slipped ahead of full-year figures due
today, on concern that these might contain hefty restructuring charges.
Speculation has focused on the company's US detergents business, which
operates in a highly competitive market, and in which Procter &amp; Gamble,
Unilever's arch rival, has already disclosed substantial provisions.
Analysts' forecasts for today's profits figures from Unilever range from
Pounds 2.250bn to Pounds 2.325bn. The shares ended 7 off at 1199p.
Shares in Thorn EMI approached their all-time high ahead of today's
third-quarter results as NatWest Securities drew investors' attention to the
group's multi-media potential. In the light of several recent deals in the
sector, the most recent being the Dollars 10bn Paramount deal in the US, the
broker believes Thorn to be undervalued.
Mr Jason Holden, sector analyst at NatWest, said: 'Thorn's music interests
offer prime access to the rapid growth of 'superhighways' in the new
multi-media era. The market has underestimated the potential for a
rerating.' The stock gained 9 at 1138p.
Chemicals leader ICI fell 14 to 760p as a number of analysts repeated their
unenthusiastic views on the company ahead of full-year figures expected on
Thursday. Kleinwort Benson has the stock as a sell and anticipates
fourth-quarter profits of Pounds 65m to give an annual figure of Pounds
305m. NatWest Securities, James Capel and Hoare Govett are similarly gloomy.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo firmed 2 to 681p against the trend as the
closure of the US market, where most of the sellers are congregated, gave
the bulls a chance.
SmithKline Beecham 'A' held steady at 406p ahead of today's full-year
figures. Hoare Govett's forecast of Pounds 1.22bn is at the high end of the
range, but Lehman Brothers, the US house, cut its estimate to Pounds 1.18n
from Pounds 1.21bn because of what it considers disappointing third-quarter
sales.
Wellcome failed to respond to positive reports on its anti-Aids treatment. A
federally financed study found that AZT dramatically reduced the
transmission of the Aids virus from infected mothers to their newborns, a US
newspaper reported. However, Wellcome receded 13 to 643p.
In a sagging property sector, Land Securities retreated 17 to 723p amid talk
of one broker cutting its net asset value forecasts. British Land fared
slightly better, off 4 at 428p, as it announced a deal to buy a 29.9 per
cent stake in Stanhope, the indebted developer. The news lifted Stanhope 14
to 42p as hopes rose that its refinancing discussions with its banks might
be boosted by its British Land link.
One of the market's leading agency brokers was said to have tried
unsuccessfully to place a block of 2m Royal Insurance shares in the market
at 310p. Royal lost 8 at 306p.
BT was weakened by a sell note published by Credit Lyonnais Laing, the
French-owned stockbroker, which forecast a slowing down of the rate of
dividend growth.
CLL said cost-cutting measures at BT 'will be insufficient to offset the
assault on revenues'. BT shares declined 7 1/2 to 441 1/2 p and the 'new'
stock 8 to 323p.
The oil and gas sectors braced themselves for two sets of crucial results
this week with British Gas and Shell both reporting on Thursday.
Action in the stock market concentrated on BP and Shell, with international
funds said to have been switching out of Shell and into BP. The latter have
fallen sharply against the FT-Actuaries All-Share index recently and also
against Shell.
BP closed 2 1/2 up at 363 1/2 p on turnover of 7.1m. Shell fell 8 1/2 to 720
1/2 p on 2.2m traded. The market range of current cost net income for Shell
is said to range from Pounds 740m to Pounds 990m.

<TEXT>
The paper and packaging sector suffered the effects of a shift in funds
after UBS, the Swiss-owned securities house, advised investors to switch
holdings from Bunzl to Bowater. The former dipped 4 to 178p while the latter
resisted the overall market trend to rise 7 1/2 to 483 1/2 p.
The Swiss house argued that, after a fall of 40p over the past month,
Bowater was on an undeservedly low market rating. It told clients that the
company was a recovery stock with long-term growth prospects and had made
acquisitions in 'some above-average growth markets'.
Alternatively, UBS believes that Bunzl's share price has already taken on
board the recovery in paper prices and that the company needs to make both a
rights issue and acquisitions if it is to maintain its premium rating.

FT  22 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Support levels regained in spite of
late setback : Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market struggled hard yesterday to hold on to its nearest
support levels as confidence was challenged by a renewed sell-off in
European government bond markets after the strike talks at IG Metall, the
German steel group, took an aggressive turn. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 32.3
down at 3,350.3, having dipped through the support level to touch 3,347.9 as
both stock index futures and UK gilts fell sharply in late dealings.
Trading in the London market was inhibited by the public holiday closure of
Wall Street yesterday and by uncertainty ahead of today's testimony to
Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve Board, when he is
expected to spell out his views on inflationary pressures on the US economy.
UK stocks opened lower but the initial fall of nearly 30 points on the FT-SE
100, leaving the 3,350 level secure for the moment, was reduced to 12 points
when the March future on the index rallied from its early loss.
With the big institutions unwilling to sell stock until Wall Street returns
to normal trading, probably tomorrow, share prices steadied and the market
traded calmly in modest turnover for most of the session. Once again, the
setback in equities reflected a withdrawal of buyers rather than an increase
in selling pressure.
The shock came very late in the day, when the March contract on the Footsie
dropped to around 3,330, a significant discount against the stock market, as
the IG Metall news provoked renewed selling of bonds in Germany and the UK.
The fall was prompted by an extension of earlier losses in British
government bonds which left longer dated issues with falls ranging to around
 3/4 of a point.
The FT-SE 100 Index last traded below 3,350 on December 21, so any further
slide from last night's close will finally wipe out the gains scored in the
surge in the index at the beginning of this year. Interest rate prospects
have been the principal factor in the market.
Traders stressed that uncertainty, rather than bearishness, was the keynote
of the day. This week also offers a heavy list of trading statements from
leading British companies, with Unilever and SmithKline Beecham leading the
way today, and ICI and British Aerospace following later in the week.
Hopes that British base rates can still be reduced soon in spite of the
latest rise in rates across the Atlantic were shaken by the renewed selling
in European bond markets yesterday. 'A steadier trend in bond prices is a
prerequisite for any recovery in share prices,' was the blunt comment from
one leading dealer.
Although the general uncertainty spread across equities yesterday, bringing
a fall of 41.6 points in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to a closing level of
3,983.9, trading volumes indicated no overall threat at present to market
confidence. Seaq volume dipped to 506.1m shares from Friday's 630.9m.
Daily value of retail, or customer, business in equities, which has been
falling away over the past week, stood at only Pounds 1.3bn on Friday, well
below the levels of a fortnight ago, albeit still a satisfactorily
profitable level for the London-based securities industry. Investors remain
convinced that the UK authorities will be able to trim domestic base rates
again shortly and hope that France will set the lead to lower rates in the
near future.

FT  22 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed selling of the Footsie futures contract in the closing minutes of
the session cut short attempts at a rally, indicating another sell-off
today, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened sharply down at 3,358 but well
above the worst fears. The continued depression in global bond markets,
along with continued fears on US inflation, brought further selling of the
contract and it fell through its recent support level of 3,342.
Although March stabilised at the lower levels over the lunchtime period, it
traded at a discount to cash throughout the session, pulling the underlying
cash market lower.
An attempted rally in the last hour petered out after another retreat in UK
gilts and German bonds brought a further sell-off. March closed at 3,332, a
17-point discount to cash and around 10 points below its fair value premium
to cash of about minus 7. Volume at the official close stood at 14,736 lots.
In traded options, most of the activity was carried out in the index option.
Of the day's total of 35,745, some 14,525 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option
and 6,312 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. British Steel was the busiest stock
option with a total of 4,313 contracts.
In the FT-SE Mid 250 futures contract on the OMLX, a mere 105 lots were
transacted.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Toronto down ahead of budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada
Toronto was under pressure from weaker Canadian bonds ahead of today's
release of the 1994/95 federal budget.
The TSE 300 Composite index ended 29.3 down at 4,349.0 and declines
outscored advances by 580 to 216. Due partly to the fact that US markets
were closed yester-day, Toronto volume was thin at 43.6m shares.
All but one of the 14 stock groups ended lower. The mining sector fell 2.03
per cent and real estate lost 1.65 per cent.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo closed a net 1.7 per cent easier in heavy trading as
investors decided to cash profits in the afternoon session after the
conclusion of the options market settlement earlier in the day, which had
seen shares initially rise.
The Bovespa index was finally 163 down at 9,286. Turnover hit a record high
of Cr873.3bn (Dollars 1.5bn) due to the large amount of investors settling
stock options positions.
Foreigners invested a net Dollars 5.47bn in Brazil's capital markets in
1993, almost five times the amount that flowed into the country in 1992,
according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Reuter reports from Sao
Paulo.
This compares with Dollars 1.21bn in 1992 and Dollars 288m in 1991.
According to latest estimates, investment in January was Dollars 1bn, some
four times that which flowed into the country in the same month last year.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Equities react to unexpected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of largely unexpected political and economic developments in Japan,
Europe and the US provided the impetus for equity markets last week.
Most European markets managed modest advances over the week, although Paris,
Amsterdam and Madrid were exceptions, but the FT-Actuaries World index
dipped as sharp falls in south-east Asian markets took their toll.
In Tokyo, a higher yen in the aftermath of the breakdown in trade talks with
the US left equities sinking. Kleinwort Benson, which sees very little
possibility of a trade war, comments: 'The real worry for Japanese equity
markets is that the administration will talk the yen higher. A higher yen
means lower profits. With the market always having been earnings, rather
than interest rate, driven through the current economic malaise, lower
profits mean lower equity prices.'
Conversely, Nomura, which was surprised by the speed and extent of the rise
in the yen, remained bullish on the outlook for the Japanese stock market.
'The impact of an overvalued currency (and possible trade sanctions) and the
full force of domestic reflation could see the trade surplus shrink with
surprising rapidity,' the bank says. 'A further cut in the discount rate in
Japan, and rise in the US, should also help. The pace of corporate
restructuring, moreover, could well accelerate, increasing visibility of a
dramatic profits recovery as and when the recovery gets under way.'
Europe, meanwhile, had interest rates on its mind, although in the event the
Bundesbank's decision to act on Thursday took most analysts by surprise.
UBS notes that after innumerable false dawns the Bundesbank's decision to
lower the discount rate by 50 basis points represented the first reduction
in German official rates since early October.
'The nature of the reduction - lowering the discount rate and keeping the
Lombard rate constant while maintaining the repo rate fixed at 6 per cent -
gives the Buba plenty of room to manoeuvre over the coming months. European
rates are now firmly back on the agenda and a return to last year's 'salami
slice' reductions in the repo rate is now in prospect.'
UBS adds that the German move paves the way for the Banque de France to cut
its rates after its council meeting on Thursday, although perhaps by less
than the German 50 basis points.
'The (French) central bank's continued dogged attachment to relatively high
interest rates remains a source of puzzlement. The central bank alternates
between exchange rate concerns and credibility worries to publicly justify
its obstinacy,' UBS notes.
At the same time, the debate over the relative attractions of Europe and
Asian markets for equity investors continued apace.
A Smith New Court-Gallup poll revealed that 18 per cent of UK fund managers
planned to reduce their exposure to continental European equities - the
biggest negative balance since the survey began in the middle of 1990 - in
favour of Japan, although the broker notes that the worries for Europe
seemed to be mainly short term.
James Capel, however, takes an opposite view, saying that there remained a
huge weight of money to be invested in equities, and while the Far East
needs longer to simmer down and Japan to return to the boil, Europe was
expected to be a major beneficiary.
By the end of last week, attention had turned to the sell-off in US bonds
after bad news on the business outlook and inflation from the Philadelphia
Federal Reserve. European equities and bonds felt the pinch on Friday as
Wall Street tumbled, but investors were adopting a cautious attitude
yesterday, awaiting new clues when Wall Street resumes trading after the
long holiday weekend.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): Bullion weakness
pressures gold stocks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg struggled to attract investor interest owing to the closure of
Wall Street, with traders commenting that only weakness in the price of
bullion provided some direction throughout the session.
Sentiment also remained under pressure from the stalled constitutional talks
and further violence at the weekend, when 15 ANC election campaigners were
killed in Natal province.
The golds index lost 40 at 1,862, industrials gained 9 at 5,704 and the
overall index edged down 21 to 4,831.
Both De Beers and Anglos declined R1.50 to R105.50 and R194 respectively. In
golds, Kloof shed 50 cents to R43.25 and Vaal Reefs R12 to R406.
Among the industrial stocks, Barlow Rand dipped 10 cents to R28.50 and SAB
fell by 75 cents to R87.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bond market declines push
shares lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Friday's free fall in US long bonds gave bourses another bad day, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT returned to the real world, said Mr Edgar Benischek, head of
trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt. The big financials, such as
Allianz, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner, had studiously ignored a falling bund
market last week, he said, with options expiring on Friday; yesterday they
dropped with the Dax index which closed the session 32.44 lower at 2,119.53,
the Ibis-indicated Dax easing later to 2,108.06.
The Bund future, said Mr Benischek, was the key to the decline; it dropped
87 basis points to 97.24 yesterday after a rough Friday in New York.
Turnover fell from DM9.9bn to DM6.4bn. Story led stocks were clearly
uncomfortable. Metallgesellschaft dropped another DM20.50 to DM175.50 ahead
of today's results conference; BMW, with Honda planning to sell its equity
stake in Rover, fell DM19.50 to DM848, and shed another DM8 after hours on
profit-taking after last week's 8 per cent gain.
Mannesmann, a recent Anglo-Saxon choice on its cellular telephone prospects,
lost DM8.50 to DM428 on the session and another DM4 in the afternoon. PWA,
the papermaker, which had led the market early this year on its cyclical
recovery prospects, fell DM10, or more than 4 per cent to DM228 on a group
net loss of DM240m.
PARIS was disappointed on a number of counts: weakness in the bond market,
lack of a rate cut from the Bank of France and worries over the direction of
Wall Street when it re-opens later today.
On the last day of the account the CAC-40 index lost 36.58 or 1.6 per cent
to 2,215.20.
Turnover was moderate at FFr4.6bn.
Elf Aquitaine continued to fall back in heavy volume, the shares losing
FFr3.80 to FFr415.00.
AMSTERDAM featured a steep fall in Nedlloyd as the market reacted to a
larger than expected convertible bond issue, the shares dipping Fl 3.20 to
Fl 74.80.
The AEX index closed off 1.33 to 425.53.
Unilever, with results due today, and Akzo, which is expected to report
later in the week, both advanced by Fl 2.30, to Fl 227.80 and Fl 215.90
respectively.
MILAN produced some winners as the Comit index lost 4.48 to 684.55 in thin
trading.
Fiat added L15 to L4,965, after a low of L4,880, in spite of protests and
last-minute wrangling which delayed final agreement on a key deal with
unions to shed 16,500 jobs.
Banks saw BCI climb a further L52 to L6,221 ahead of its privatization at
the end of the month; longer term privatization prospects for Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro and recent management changes helped the savings shares
L1,527 or 10.9 per cent higher to L15,540; and Banco di Napoli rose by L195,
or 9.2 per cent to L2,315 on speculation that it could be added to the list
of privatisation candidates.
MADRID, one of the European markets picked out for growth by the strategists
this year, had profits left to take after a gentle decline last week. The
general index tumbled by 7.10 to 338.36 in turnover of Pta25.7bn.
Dealers said that the downtrend was stronger at the end of the day. Banks
and electrical utilities led the way down, with Argentaria Pta230 off at
Pta6,300 and Sevillana Pta29 lower at Pta772.
ZURICH edged lower in quiet trading as weakness in the bond market continued
to weigh on equities. The SMI index shed 28.3 to 2,997.6.
Mr Simon Marshall Lockyer at Kleinwort Benson, who maintains a neutral
weighting on the Swiss market, noted that profit-taking in financials, and
particularly the insurance sector as the reporting season began had
contributed to the flat performance of Swiss market, compared with the FT-A
Europe ex-UK, over the last month. However, a sharp fall in January
inflation to 2.1 per cent suggested that further cuts in domestic interest
rate cuts were possible, although large reductions were more likely
elsewhere, which suggested an end to the trading run in the bank and
insurers.
ISTANBUL resumed a downward course after Friday's advance with a fall of
10.5 per cent in the composite index, which lost 2,024.52 to 17,250.12.
Trading remains volatile, with investors still attracted by high money
market rates: the central bank raised overnight interest rate to 110 per
cent yesterday from 90 per cent.
WARSAW remained confident. In spite of a sharp fall in Bank Slaski, which
lost 8.7 per cent to 4.2m zlotys, the WIG index rose 299 or 1.6 per cent to
a record 19,358.3 in turnover of 3,700bn zlotys.
Last Thursday, Bank Slaski's stockbroking licence was revoked. Late on
Friday, however, the stock exchange said that it would not suspend trade in
the bank; the finance ministry felt that new shareholders had been
penalised, because trading had begun before everyone had registered their
stock.
TEL AVIV dropped as small investors, acting through mutual funds, dumped
stocks into institutional hands following stock exchange investigations into
alleged insider trading and share-price manipulation. The Mishtanim index
lost 11.04 or 4.9 per cent to 214.99.
ATHENS closed 4.9 per cent higher as hopes grew that a peaceful solution to
the Bosnia crisis lay ahead. The general index added 51.82 to 1,119.7 in
volume of 1.8m shares.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo gains 2.3% as Hong
Kong falls

<TEXT>
The yen's fall against the dollar encouraged buying among arbitrageurs, and
the Nikkei 225 average gained 2.3 per cent, recovering the 19,000 level for
the first time in three trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 rose 434.34 to 19,393.94 as the yen fell to the Y105 level on
continued buying of the dollar by the Bank of Japan. The index registered a
day's low of 18,826.68 in the morning before rising to a high of 19,415.14
in the afternoon on index-linked buying.
However, some analysts were ambivalent over a continued rise in share
prices. 'There is not much significance in the rise, since volume was so
low,' said Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel. He thought that the
yen would not weaken much further, and that it could remain at current
levels for at least another month until a decisive breakthrough was made on
trade talks between the US and Japan.
Volume was 220m shares, against Friday's 265m. In spite of a sense of relief
over the yen's weakening, most investors remained inactive. Large-lot buying
by foreign investors, seen during the past month, was also absent.
The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 12.85 at 1,569.96 and the
Nikkei 300 added 2.55 at 290.51. Advances overwhelmed declines by 661 to
327, with 188 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed
3.69 to 1,307.11.
Arbitrage buying supported bank shares. Industrial Bank of Japan improved
Y10 to Y3,200 and Sakura Bank moved ahead Y20 to Y1,470.
The yen's decline supported export-oriented high-technology shares. Sony
advanced Y80 to Y6,110 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y20 to Y1,720.
Toyota Motor was also strong, rising Y60 to Y1,930, while Honda Motor
appreciated Y40 to Y1,660.
Telecommunications-related stocks gained ground, with buying focused on the
multi-media theme. Nitsuko, the most active issue of the day, climbed Y70 to
Y1,410 and Fujitsu Y26 to Y1,010. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone added
Y14,000 at Y914,000.
Sega Enterprises fell Y60 to Y7,220 on continued pessimism over its earnings
following a downward revision in profits last Friday. Pioneer Electronic
slipped Y10 to Y2,570.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 168.20 to 21,264.40 in volume of 41.3m
shares. Roundup
There were mixed performances from the region's markets yesterday, although
Hong Kong's decline was almost mirrored in Australia.
HONG KONG closed sharply lower on institutional selling. The Hang Seng index
fell by 369.43, or 3.4 per cent, to 10,456.45. Turnover slipped to HKDollars
4.3bn from Friday's HKDollars 4.7bn.
Profit-taking was evident in the banking sector, where HSBC Holdings
surrendered HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 116 and Hang Seng Bank receded
HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 70.50.
The property sub-index dropped 791, or 4 per cent, to 18,616, with Cheung
Kong declining HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 43 and Sun Hung Kai Properties
retreating HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 58.
AUSTRALIA was dragged down by sharp falls overseas and weaker futures and
bonds, and fell 2 per cent to its lowest level in a month, the All
Ordinaries index finishing 44.7 down at 2,178.5.
Worst hit were media and some resource stocks, particularly coal. News Corp
fell 40 cents to ADollars 10.08 and the Nine Network 8 cents to ADollars
5.84 as the media index weakened 3.1 per cent.
SINGAPORE moved cautiously higher, with many investors remaining absent
ahead of tomorrow's budget. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 16.60 to
2,350.87.
SEOUL moved upwards for the third consecutive session, helped by activity in
blue chip issues, and the composite index added 13.07 at 946.00.
Kepco, the electricity utility, and Posco, the steel manufacturer, gained
Won800 and Won2,000 respectively at Won31,100 and Won64,200.
TAIWAN eased back in the lowest day's volume seen so far this year. The
weighted index receded 29.93 to 5,783.89 in turnover of TDollars 42.2bn.
MANILA declined in late trading, influenced by the fall in Hong Kong and a
setback in PLDT in New York on Friday.
The Manila composite index shed 39.8 to 3,005.6 in turnover of 779m pesos,
compared with Friday's 1.3bn pesos. PLDT, which lost Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 74 5/8 in New York on Friday, dropped 1.4 per cent to 2,140 pesos.
JAKARTA fell 2 per cent, blaming overall bearish sentiment and increasing
foreign sell orders as the JKSE index dipped a further 11.02 to 543.76.
KARACHI anticipated more foreign buying as it rose on government incentives
for the energy sector, the KSE-100 index closing 26.86 stronger at 2,375.41.
BOMBAY climbed 5.5 per cent, the BSE index ending 214.48 higher at 4,129.52
in expectation of further economic reforms, including fiscal concessions to
industry in the national budget next Monday.
Brokers said that budget rumours included a reduction in corporate taxes,
the raising of tax limits on individual incomes and full convertibil-ity for
the rupee on current account.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Dollar recovers ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday retraced recent losses against the yen, finishing in
London at Y106.25, nearly Y2 up from Friday's close of Y104.30, writes
Philip Gawith.
The lack of any fresh data, and a public holiday in the US, contributed to a
quiet afternoon's trading, but dollar/yen trading in particular was fairly
brisk in the morning.
In Europe the D-Mark traded steadily in spite of the IG Metall engineering
union calling for a strike ballot in one of the regions. The French
government resisted the temptation to ease policy and kept its repo rate
unchanged at yesterday's auction.
A lot of attention will today be focused on Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the US Federal Reserve, who will deliver his biannual Humphrey Hawkins
testimony to congress today.
The most significant move in the markets yesterday was the sharp
appreciation of the dollar against the yen in Asian trading, and later in
Europe. Traders said the dollar's rise had been helped by Bank of Japan
intervention. The US currency reached a high of Y106.80 before closing
moderately beneath that level.
Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, said that with US markets closed
because of the President's Day holiday, American banks left stop-loss trade
instructions in London. A number of these were triggered at Y106.10 and the
selling thus triggered had forced the yen down to Y106.80.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London, said the
strength of the dollar could reflect nervousness ahead of the weekend
meeting of G7 finance ministers meeting in Frankfurt. He added that markets
were wary of a statement emerging whereby other countries agreed to assist
the BOJ in its efforts to stabilise the yen.
Ten days after the failed trade summit in Washington between President
Clinton and Mr Hosokawa no proposals have emerged yet from Japan about how
to curb its large trade surplus with the US. Mr Koichiro Matsuura, Japan's
deputy foreign minister (and chief trade negotiator), said yesterday:
'Prospects for proposals which will lead to agreement are far from certain.'
The D-Mark was weaker against most other European currencies. A firmer start
was cancelled out by fears that industrial unrest in Germany might escalate.
IG Metall, the giant engineering union, yesterday announced that it would
hold a strike ballot in Lower Saxony from March 1 to 3.
The news caused the D-Mark to weaken more than  1/2 pfennig against the
dollar to DM1.7310, but it ended slightly firmer in London at DM1.7275. a
net pfennig down from Friday's close. Analysts said that if anything the
market had overreacted to the news. From an inflation perspective the key
issue is the quantum of the wage settlement and it appears already likely
that there will be no real growth.
Mr Parsons said the dollar was also benefiting from foreign exchange markets
catching up with bond markets, which have taken a view that a further
tightening in US monetary policy is likely.
Sterling was modestly higher against the D-Mark, ending in London at
DM2.5488, after Friday's DM2.5406. Mr Hawkins said this reflected the
general weakness of the German currency and a retreat from the recent
sell-off of the pound, which had been 'fairly aggressive'.
He said the market was using the opportunity to buy back sterling. 'The
underlying fact is that the UK economy is growing substantially faster than
most of continental Europe, and the downside for UK interest rates is also a
good deal less than in those countries,' he added.
The pound closed mildly easier against the dollar at Dollars 1.4755, from
Dollars 1.4788 on Friday.
Attention will shift firmly back to the US today when markets reopen after
yesterday's public holiday. With the recent  1/4 percentage point rise in
the Fed Funds rate having unnerved international bond markets, Mr
Greenspan's comments will be closely watched.
Mr Parsons said that, whereas European markets took the Fed's recent
tight-ening of policy to be a pre-emptive strike against inflation, US
markets had taken it as a sign that the Fed was privy to information showing
inflation to be worse than previously thought. 'You had the bizarre
spectacle of a 25 basis points rise in the discount rate putting 40 points
on bond yields,' added Mr Parsons.
He predicted that the Fed chairman will today try to reassure the bond
market by stressing that the inflation outlook is a healthy one.
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 200m of
assistance yesterday, in line with its forecast of a similar liquidity
shortage, revised from an earlier Pounds 350m estimate.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shephard says probe of French
pig aid does not go far enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK agriculture minister Mrs Gillian Shephard yesterday welcomed European
Commission moves to investigate alleged illegal state aid to French pig
producers but said they did not go far enough.
Speaking at the farm council in Brussels, Mrs Shephard said: 'Although the
French authorities announced two schemes, for FFr30m (Pounds 3.5m) and
FFr300m in September and October last year, the commission action appears to
be against only the first scheme.'
Britain's National Farmers' Union, complaining to Brussels last week, said
the French payments were causing the UK pig industry to bleed to death.
Urging swift action by the commission, Mrs Shephard said pig producers
throughout the European Union had suffered for the past year from
oversupply, because of an expansion in pig herds in most member states.
'France is as much to blame as anyone,' she said. 'By introducing its own
national measures, the French government adds to the problems in every other
country, and rewards its own producers who have contributed to the
oversupply and current market difficulties.'
Special aid is not the only form of financial support for continental pig
producers that encourages expansion and puts British producers at a
disadvantage, according to a report by the UK Meat and Livestock Commission.
Corporate tax arrangements are more flexible in Denmark, France and the
Netherlands than in Britain, it says. 'The main areas of flexibility that
could be encouraged in Britain are in the depreciation of capital
investment, the ability to average net income over a three- to five-year
period and the use of tax credits for training.'
Institutions lending to pig farmers see them as a lower risk on the
continent than is the case in Britain, and price stabilisation schemes also
help, the report says.
It adds that 'a striking feature of the Danish, French and Dutch pig
production systems is the degree of producer co-operation, normally
encouraged by respective governments.'
This provides strong links between producers, processors and retailers,
improved power when buying supplies, and an ability to negotiate
advantageous loans. 'Whereas almost 100 per cent of pig production in
Denmark, France and Netherlands is covered by collaborative arrangements,
the coverage for Britain is only about 40 per cent.'
The report says a British ban on the use of sow tethers and stalls in 1999
will bring extra costs for producers compared with their European
counterparts. 'This change is a watershed and may result in major
disinvestment by a significant proportion of the industry,' it concludes.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian tin giant poses
export conundrum - A look at questions raised by Paranapanema's
recently-announced production cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The drastic production cuts announced recently by Brazil's Paranapanema, the
world's largest tin company, is not expected not lead to an equivalent
reduction in its exports this year because of purchases of tin ore from
wildcat miners.
Despite Paranapanema's denials, market analysts expect the company to
increase these purchases, particularly if international tin prices continue
to recover.
Paranapanema announced on February 3 that it would cut its production of tin
concentrate by 45 to 50 per cent - from 12,955 tonnes last year to between
6,500 and 7,000 this year - in an attempt to reduce world tin stocks,
conserve its own reserves and push up prices. The company made two cuts of
10 per cent each last year in response to falling international tin prices.
It said the cut would contribute to bringing down world tin stocks from
41,000 tonnes at the end of last year to 22,000 by the end of this year.
The production cut, which Paranapanema says represents about 3.5 per cent of
estimated world tin demand this year, will be concentrated at the company's
Pitinga mine in the Amazon, which has traditionally accounted for more than
90 per cent of the company's production and half of Brazil's.
Ms Adriana Franca, an analyst at the Brazilian subsidiary of London-based
broker WI Carr, says: 'Paranapanema wants to maintain its reserves at its
Pitinga mine until prices are higher and increase its purchases of tin ore
from wildcat miners'.
Mr Arislando Prado, Paranapanema market relations director, said in a
written statement that the decision had nothing to do with the unexpected
resignation of company president Dr Samuel Hanan at the end of last year. Dr
Hanan is still working with Paranapanema as a consultant and resigned as
president for personal reasons, according to the company.
In addition to Pitinga, Paranapanema owns half of the Ebesa joint venture,
which buys ore from wildcat miners at the Bom Futuro site in Rondonia state.
Last year Paranapanema's share of Ebesa production was about 4,000 tonnes.
Ms Franca says she has been told by Paranapanema that its purchases from Bom
Futuro via Ebesa will increase by 1,000 tonnes and she calculates that the
company's exports will therefore be reduced by about 30 per cent. The local
media has also reported Paranapanema's intention to increase purchases from
wildcat miners. However, the company is now denying that any increase is
planned.
Mr Heinz Feldenheimer, a Sao Paulo-based tin trader, says he expects higher
prices to attract more wildcat miners to Bom Futuro and that Paranapanema
will increase its purchases substantially: 'For Paranapanema it makes sense
because they don't have to invest or risk anything, they just buy from the
independent miners'.
Mr Feldenheimer also expects the recovering world tin price to spur
Brazilian companies to export more this year than last, even though its
quota, agreed with the Association of Tin Producing Countries last October,
is lower. Although Brazil is not a member of the organisation it has agreed
to an export quota of 20,175 tonnes this year, compared with 24,000 last
year.
Because of the closed nature of Paranapanema and its dominance of the
Brazilian tin sector, accurate production and export statistics are
difficult to obtain.
The Brazilian Tin Producers Association, whose president is a Paranapanema
official, refuses to comment on the company's cuts and the association says
that it cannot yet release figures for Brazil's tin concentrate exports last
year. However, preliminary data from the association puts last year's
production at 21,000 tonnes, of which 15,000 tonnes was exported - far below
the 24,000 tonne quota.
This raises questions about Paranapanema's stated production of 17,000
tonnes last year, which includes Ebesa production. According to Ms Franca,
98 per cent of the company's production is for export and that would mean
that Paranapanema and its share of Ebesa exceeded Brazil's total tin
exports.
Mr Feldenheimer speculates that the company could have retained stocks last
year because of the low prices, which hit Dollars 4,600 per tonne in
September. Since then the London Metal Exchange three months delivery tin
price has recovered to over Dollars 5,600 a tonne, partly because of the
ATPC agreement, and producers are hoping that it will reach Dollars 6,500 by
the end of the year.
Other tin companies are not expected to increase production to compensate
for Paranapanema's cut, according to Mr Luiz Carlos Bacil, executive
director of Corumbatai Metais. He says his company is operating at half its
600-tonnes-a-month capacity.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia bursts aluminium balloon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The aluminium market's balloon was burst yesterday by the Russian official
who single-handedly pumped it up just a week ago.
The metal's three month delivery price climbed to an 18-month peak of
Dollars 1,332 a tonne last week following Mr Vladimir Kalchenko's assurance
on Tuesday that his country's output cuts of 100,000 tonnes under the
multilateral scheme agreed in Brussels last month would grow to 300,000
tonnes by the end of April. But yesterday, Mr Kalchenko, first deputy
general director of producers' group Aluminiy, told the Reuter news agency
in Moscow that Russia was suspending further cuts because it was not
satisfied with other producers' compliance.
The LME price quickly fell to Dollars 1,303.25 a tonne, down Dollars 18.25
on the day, but still more than Dollars 70 ahead of the level ruling at the
time of Mr Kalchenko's original statement.
'We have already cut output by more than one third of what we promised,' the
Aluminiy official said yesterday. 'We will continue only after we see other
world producers doing the same.'
He pointed to the failure of French producer Pechiney to give details on the
size and timing of its promised output cuts as 'an exact example of what we
are displeased with'. Pechiney said on February 10 that it would lower
production temporarily but had not decided where the cuts would be made or
how big these would be.
Some of Brazil's aluminium producers are studying the possibility of
reducing production but so far no new cuts are planned, according to company
officials, reports Reuter from Rio de Janeiro.
At a meeting of the Brazilian Aluminium Association on Friday, producers
decided against industry-wide cuts and agreed that individual companies
should be responsible for production levels.
'We have not decided whether or not to cut production,' said Mr Carlos
Ermirio de Moraes, director of Companhia Brasileira de Aluminio, which
produces 215,000 tonnes of aluminium a year. 'We do not think, however, that
cuts should start with CBA'.
Aluvale, an aluminium holding of state mining giant Companhia Vale do Rio
Doce, was also considering cutting production at its two associated
companies, Valesul and Albras, said Mr Francisco Pitella, the sales
director. But he added that an early decision was not expected.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee rise meets resistance -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE prices rose again at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday. The May
futures position edged up to resistance at Dollars 1,250 a tonne before
backing off Dollars 1 by the close, still up Dollars 6. Traders said
sentiment was still friendly although some thought the market looked
overbought and that producer selling might be attracted .
The COCOA market cautiously embraced Friday's strong gains in New York,
which were attributed to chart-inspired fund buying. By the close the May
position was Pounds 13 higher at Pounds 932 a tonne, having eased from an
earlier peak of Pounds 937.
Traders said the US jump was primarily a short-covering rally and predicted
more sober gains for London. 'We'll probably consolidate here, we don't have
the spec interest,' one said.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa pact relaunch likely
today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cocoa-producing and consuming countries are expected today to launch a new
five-year agreement to bring supply and demand into balance, despite
continuing delays in signing up members.
Delegates at a council meeting of the International Cocoa Organisation
(ICCO) in London yesterday were optimistic that a gathering under United
Nations auspices would put the agreement into force.
The cocoa pact, agreed last July, requires the backing of countries
representing 80 per cent of world exports and 60 per cent of imports.
It appeared yesterday that these thresholds had still not been formally
reached. It was unclear whether Brazil, the second largest producer, had
completed membership formalities, while Italy, Portugal and Ireland on the
consumer side faced procedural delays in ratifying the agreement.
However, countries that have joined have the right to decide under the
sponsorship of the UN Conference on Trade and Development whether to start
the new agreement anyway, pending the arrival of the new members.
The pact, which was due to come into effect last October, will set up
management committees to control output and encourage consumption. Despite
the prospect of a third or even fourth consecutive shortfall in cocoa
supplies, world stocks are around 1m tonnes and the ICCO still has 180,000
tonnes of buffer stock to liquidate. World prices are about Pounds 900 a
tonne, compared with Pounds 2,000 in 1984.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Codelco divisions to have more
autonomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Codelco, Chile's state copper company, is to change its management structure
to allow its six divisions more autonomy. The new structure will come into
effect on March 11 when Mr Juan Villarzu takes over as head of Codelco under
the new administration of president-elect Eduardo Frei.
Mr Villarzu has scrapped the post of vice-president for operations, an
intermediary between the Santiago-based headquarters and the managers of the
mining, power and workshop divisions.
'The transformation of Codelco into one of the most profitable large mining
concerns in the world requires rapid and effective decentralisation,' Mr
Villarzu said. He proposed the scrapping of the operations vice-presidency
and the 'immediate creation of an administration council in each of the
divisions, with the consequent strengthening of decision-making at that
level'.
Pressure to streamline Codelco's structure has grown enormously since last
month's metal futures fiasco, in which one Codelco trader is alleged to have
lost the company Dollars 206m. Critics of Codelco argue that its unwieldy
structure and 'giganticism' were partly responsible for the lack of control
over futures operations.
Even before the scandal, Mr Villarzu had emphasised the need to 'modernise'
Codelco through the creation of autonomous divisions. Each unit, including
some of the break-even mines, may eventually be required to operate at a
profit.
Many of Codelco's top executives resigned after the futures trading scandal,
giving Mr Villarzu free hand to bring in an entirely new team.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Beef mountain is down but not
out - More curbs are on the Brussels agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Racks of frozen beef stacked in a cold store in east London bear witness to
one of the European Union's more costly and complex schemes to support
farmers. It will spend about Ecu1.38bn (Pounds 1.08) on buying up surplus
beef from farmers this year as part of the common agricultural policy's
intervention system.
Stocks of beef in cold stores across the EU hit a record level of 1.1m
tonnes a year ago, leading to calls for cuts in the beef mountain. The
amount of beef in intervention stores has since more than halved to 430,000
tonnes as a result of CAP reform and increased export opportunities.
But the European Commission believes this is only a short-term respite and
is urging farm ministers to agree further production curbs this year.
Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner, recently warned that the drop in
beef stocks has not so much been caused by reform, 'but has to be explained
by the cyclical movement of production'. He fears that the market will not
remain so positive but will move into imbalance caused by over-production in
one to two years.
Mr Steichen is calling for prompt action to make adjustments to the beef
regime in a 'calm' environment 'rather than in an emergency situation as has
all too often been the case in the past'.
His calls are backed by the UK government which wants to trim spending on
beef - the second most expensive support system in the agricultural budget,
beaten only by cereals. The commission is proposing adjustments to beef
premium payments and is hoping that reforms already in place will reduce the
role played by intervention.
'It's days are numbered as a real outlet and we hope it will end up as what
it was always intended to be: a last resort,' a commission official
explains.
Instead of acting as a safety net to keep farmers producing beef, the
intervention system encouraged over-production and the EU still raises far
more beef than it needs. Ireland, for example, produces seven times its own
beef consumption, with about 75 per cent usually going straight to
intervention stores.
'Some farmers were producing heavyweight carcasses that had no commercial
market and were going straight into intervention,' a UK farming official
says.
The irony about the support system is that the beef is often sold years
after it is bought at a price that is not high enough to cover the costs of
keeping it in cold storage - about Pounds 2.30 a tonne each week.
Intervention beef hit the headlines in the UK last year when six-year old
meat turned up at a butcher's shop in Devon. Sensitivity still runs high
over frozen meat and the manager of an east London cold store demands
anonymity for himself and his store even though his beef is a mere 18
months' old. Outside, 'Meat is Murder,' is scrawled on a wall.
CAP reforms are starting to bite into the intervention system and will have
an effect on overall beef production. Intervention prices have been cut by 5
per cent and will be come down by another 10 per cent over the next 2 years.
On top of this, boards cannot buy until the market price falls to 80 per
cent of the intervention price (which is set each year). This level will be
cut to 60 per cent.
At the same time, the EU has set gradually falling ceilings for the amount
of meat that can be bought by intervention boards each year. This year
650,000 tonnes can be put into store, falling to 350,000 tonnes by 1997. It
has also restricted the size of carcasses that can be bought.
The commission can take action on its own to limit further the size of
animals that can be bought by intervention as a way of reducing stocks. But
if the EU's beef regime is to fit in with the requirements of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, farm ministers will have to consider further
reforms such as reducing beef premium payments, cutting export refunds or
further restrictions to intervention as a way of trimming output.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Germany leads continued slide in European
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the wake of Friday's slide, Europe's bond markets continued to tumble
yesterday, led by heavy selling in the German government bond market.
Although US markets were closed for a holiday, traders reported continued
selling by US hedge funds, albeit at a less frantic pace than last week.
Bond traders today will keenly await US Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, weighing his words for hints of
further tightening.
'Everyone is petrified of another tightening,' said Graham McDevitt, bond
strategist with market analysts IDEA.
The slide in European bonds began earlier this month when the Fed surprised
markets with a small rise in rates and bonds have not regained their poise
in spite of last week's round of European rate cuts.
While many observers agree that most European bond markets are now heavily
oversold, investors remain side-lined, awaiting buying opportunities at even
lower levels.
'Markets are so volatile, it would be prudent to let the air clear before
getting back in,' said Mr Richard Woodworth, head of economic and bond
research at Merrill Lynch, 'I would not recommend testing the waters at this
time.'
However, others said the market recovery, when it comes, could be so fast
that buyers might miss the boat.
'When the market does turn around, it'll be an extremely powerful rebound,'
said Mr Karl Haeling, head of Deutsche Bank's futures and options group.
After weakening steadily throughout the morning, bunds were were knocked
sharply lower in the afternoon when Germany's engineering union IG Metall
said it had called a strike vote from March 1 - 3 in the northern state of
Lower Saxony. If approved, a strike could begin on March 7, and could spread
to other parts of northern Germany, the union warned.
Fears of another bad M3 money supply number also put pressure on bunds, with
talk of a January rate of between 7 and 10 per cent - well above the
Bundesbank's target range - rattling the market. German January M3 and
February inflation data should be released this week.
'We are having a bear panic - there are still a lot of sellers with long
positions left from last year's rally, and I see no one who is willing to
buy,' said a senior futures dealer in Frankfurt. 'It's purely psychological
and has very little to do with fundamentals,' he added.
The March bund futures contract closed at 97.49, down 0.69 points on the day
but off its 97.21 intra-day low.
French government bonds also fell sharply, dragged lower by bunds but also
pressured by disappointment that the Bank of France left interest rates
unchanged at its latest repo operation. Traders now are pinning their hopes
on Thursday's repo, which is also the day the French central bank's
policy-making council meets. But given that the Bundesbank left its key repo
rate unchanged last week, some say there is little chance of a French rate
cut.
The March notional bond futures contract on Matif fell 0.64 points to
127.52.
Gilts followed the rest of Europe lower, with the long gilt future dropping
by 1 3/32 points to 114 1/2 , up from its low of 114.
Despite widespread nervousness, most participants appeared confident that
tomorrow's auction of 7 per cent gilts due 2001 will go relatively smoothly.
'Its saving grace is that it's only Pounds 2.5bn and it's partly-paid,' said
Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Borrowers play safe with floating-rate
note issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of yesterday's supply of new issues in the Eurobond market came in the
defensive form of floating-rate notes (FRNs) as the persistent weakness in
government bond markets deterred issuers and underwriters alike from
committing themselves to fixed-rate offerings.
Officials at the Asian Development Bank were said to be anxiously waiting
for a stabilisation in the markets so they could launch their first offering
of global bonds. The market had expected the proposed Dollars 750m
transaction, which will be jointly led by IBJ International and Salomon
Brothers, to surface tomorrow but now believes it will not appear until
later in the week. The African Development Bank is also likely to tap the
Eurodollar sector for around Dollars 500m when market conditions improve.
Among yesterday's issues, UCB Group, a subsidiary of Compagnie Bancaire of
France, raised Pounds 500m through an offering of mortgage-backed FRNs
through a special-purpose vehicle called Leo 2. UCB performed a similar
securitisation last year. Lead manager JP Morgan said the deal was the
largest offering of sterling-denominated mortgage-backed notes to date.
JP Morgan said the notes sold out quickly as investors were attracted by
their relatively high yields. The discounted margin on the notes with an
average life of 1.4 years is 18 basis points over the London interbank
offered rate while the discounted margin on the notes with an average life
of 5.1 years is 30 basis points over Libor.
Woolwich Building Society also tapped the Eurosterling sector with a Pounds
200m offering of five-year FRNs which yielded 15 basis points over Libor.
Lead manager UBS said the offering injected fresh liquidity into the
sterling FRN market where issuers had called more than Pounds 1bn worth of
paper since the new year.
Elsewhere, Toyota Motor Credit Corp, whose triple-A rating was affirmed by
Standard &amp; Poor's earlier this month, raised SFr150m through an offering of
six-year FRNs. Lead manager SBC said the offering, Toyota's first public
transaction in the Swiss bond market, was targeted at retail investors
interested in intermediate maturities.
The notes, which carry a first coupon of 4 per cent and then Libor minus 20
basis points thereafter, had an issue price of 100 5/8 and were quoted at
minus  3/8 point in the afternoon, within fees of  3/4 point.
The Kingdom of Sweden has appointed a permanent dealer group to its Dollars
10bn debt issuance programme. They are Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and
Morgan Stanley, the arranger of the programme.
The Sydney Futures Exchange is planning to list flexible options, a
derivatives product introduced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange last
year, Reuter reports.
The flexible option was the industry's most successful product launched in
1993 and has been widely accepted by derivatives participants as
complementary to the fast growing over-the-counter markets, the SFE said.

PT Indosat, Indonesia's international telecommunications company, plans a
flotation of its shares in London or New York, Reuter reports from Jakarta.
This will be the the first state company to make such a move, according to
finance minister, Mar'ie Muhammad.
He said that Indosat would be listed in Jakarta but most of the shares would
be offered overseas.
No date was given for the offer but 'Indosat . . . will be given the first
opportunity to go international,' he said.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Oman fund to invest in Muscat
exchange

<TEXT>
The foreign investment drive into emerging stock markets has begun to focus
on the oil-rich region of the Gulf with the launch next month of a Dollars
45m Oman fund which will invest in the Muscat stock market.
The Oryx Fund will be jointly managed by London-based Blakeney Management
and the Oman National Insurance Company in Muscat.
The fund will be registered in Oman and stock market listings are being
sought in both London and Muscat.
Initially, 51 per cent of the capital will be raised in Oman and the balance
internationally - in line with Omani foreign investment law.
Al Ahlia Portfolio Company in Muscat will manage the Omani issue and Baring
Securities the foreign portion.
The fund will have exclusive access to the Muscat stock exchange, as the
only fund with foreign shareholders, for a minimum of six months.
'The fund will be the first vehicle for non-Arab investors to enter any of
the Gulf stock markets,' says Mr Miles Morland of Blakeney Consultants.
Of the six member states of the Gulf Co-operation Council, only Oman and, to
a limited extent, Bahrain permit foreign investors to participate in local
equity trading.
Other Arab bourses allowing non-Arab participants are Morocco, Tunisia,
Jordan and nominally Egypt.
Mr Morland said that the Oryx Fund will eventually expand to include other
emerging markets in the Arab world.
Last year the Muscat stock exchange had a turnover of around Dollars 200m.
It has 62 listed stocks and is capitalised at around Dollars 1.5bn.
This compares with a capitalisation of Dollars 10bn for the United Arab
Emirates stock market and Dollars 50bn for Saudi Arabia, both of which are
closed to foreign investors.
Oman is going through a period of rapid economic change. The government is
diversifying the economy away from the oil sector and promoting non-oil
commercial activities.
A widespread programme of privatisation of state holdings and an opening-up
of the economy to outside investment also aim to boost private sector
activities.
Oman's trading links with Iran and good political relations with other
neighbouring countries, including Iraq, place Muscat in an ideal position
for rapid growth.
'It is a classic emerging market story,' says Mr Morland.

Foreigners invested a net Dollars 5.47bn in Brazilian capital markets in
1993, almost five times the inward flow in 1992, Reuter reports from Sao
Paulo.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) said capital inflows under the
Annex IV rules, which regulate foreign investment in capital markets,
totalled Dollars 14.6bn, while outflows were Dollars 9.12bn. Brazilian
markets received a net Dollars 1.21bn from abroad in 1992.
The CVM said foreigners invested a net Dollars 1.008bn in January, almost
four times the amount in same month last year.
Of these funds, 82 per cent were invested in stocks, 16 per cent in
debentures, 1.4 per cent in privatisation paper and 0.16 per cent in
fixed-income funds.
Chase Manhattan Bank managed the largest foreign portfolio through Annex IV
with a total Dollars 3.53bn, followed by Banco Garantia, Citibank, Banco de
Boston and Banco Pactual, the commission said.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch to trade in gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merrill Lynch, the US Securities house which pulled out of dealing in UK
government bonds (gilts) in 1989 after incurring heavy losses, said
yesterday that it had won approval from the Bank of England to start dealing
in gilts again with effect from February 28.
Merrill was one of several foreign houses to pull out of the gilt market in
the late-1980s, a time when the various gilt-edged market makers - known as
Gemms - faced tough competition in an overcrowded market.
Merrill had incurred accumulated losses of more than Pounds 20m (Dollars
29.2m) by 1989, following the Big Bang reorganisation of the gilt market in
1986.
However, conditions in the gilt market have improved dramatically for the
Gemms in recent years: the UK government started to borrow again in the gilt
market, issuing large, liquid gilt issues, and inflation was brought under
control again, allowing interest rates to decline.
Combined operating profits for the Gemms have risen and reached bumper
levels in 1992 and 1993, according to figures compiled by the Bank of
England. While the Gemms made a total operating loss of Pounds 190m between
October 1986 and the end of 1988, combined profits soared to Pounds 64m in
1992 and were Pounds 59m last year.
The more favourable trading environment has encouraged speculation that
other houses may be considering applying for Gemm status. Hoare Govett
recently hired Mr Chris Anthony, a gilt analyst at UBS, leading to
speculation that it would seek permission to set up as a Gemm. Other houses
frequently rumoured to be considering applying for Gemm status include
Chemical Bank, Societe Generale, and Morgan Stanley. After Big Bang, 12
market-makers pulled out of gilts either because the business was no longer
profitable or because they were taken over by another house.

Mr Marineau said that, despite disappointing fiscal first-quarter earnings,
the company was on track to 'achieve our target of 7 per cent real earnings

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Consumers' champion in the
Japanese high street - A look at the innovative approach of the leading
supermarket chain's founder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Isao Nakauchi, a blunt talking baseball fan and former street trader, is
doing more than almost anybody in Japan to change people's daily lives.
He is doing so partly as one of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's top
private sector advisers on the government's campaign to sweep away retail
and distribution regulations, to stimulate the comatose economy, and ward
off threatened US trade retaliation.
But Mr Nakauchi, 71, is best known to millions of Japanese consumers through
the profound changes in high street shopping he has pioneered as founder of
Daiei, Japan's only national supermarket chain.
Mr Nakauchi predicts the prices of most goods sold in his supermarkets will
halve, to US levels in dollar terms, but this will take almost 20 years.
Japan's retail market has already become free enough for deregulation to
gain its own momentum, pushed by foreign competition, he believes.
Daiei, which started life as a corner store in 1957, has led a slow campaign
against countless middlemen, suppliers and sometimes bureaucracy, to nibble
away at Japan's notoriously high prices and introduce new ways of shopping.
Its innovations include Japan's first own-brands in 1978 and the first
wholesale warehouse club outside the US, opened in Kobe 18 months ago. While
Daiei is not the heaviest discounter in today's price battles in Japanese
retailing, it led the first rounds of the war.
Its acquisition last year of three regional supermarket chains has speeded
up the rationalisation of Japan's overcrowded retail industry, eroding the
dominance of the small corner store which forms a picturesque but overpriced
staple of urban community life.
Like his shops, Mr Nakauchi's personal style challenges the run of the mill.
The corridor outside his office, for example, is lined with 75 historic cash
registers, instead of the badly hung Impressionist masterpieces usually
found in Tokyo corporate headquarters.
The difference in style expresses a difference in conviction. Unlike most of
his colleagues in the Keidanren business federation, devoted to defending
the interests of big industrial producers, Mr Nakauchi made his fortune by
pursuing consumers' interests.
He got his first job after the war in his father's small town chemist shop,
and founded the first small shop of his own outside a railway station in
Osaka, rather than joining the bottom rung of the salaryman's corporate
ladder, the usual way to the top.
Mr Nakauchi befriended Mr Hosokawa after Daiei bought melons and grapes from
Kumamoto prefecture during the future prime minister's period as governor
there from 1983 to 1991.
Daiei's patronage was a valuable boon to Kumamoto, since the nearly 10,000
stores it owns or manages under its own and other names take a 4 per cent to
5 per cent national market share in most products.
Daiei's turnover of just over Y2,000bn (Dollars 19bn) in the year to last
February, on which it made Y24bn taxable profit, makes it slightly larger
than Sainsbury, the UK supermarket chain.
This might explain why the equally straight talking Mr Hosokawa turned to Mr
Nakauchi for advice on deregulation in the retailing industry.
Mr Nakauchi's report pointed out that Japan's chain stores would save nearly
Y52bn annually if the government scrapped the 42 permits required to open a
supermarket. Why, asked Mr Nakauchi's report, is it necessary to have
separate permits to sell meat, milk, tofu and soft ice cream? Another is
needed to operate a dry cleaning service and yet another to sell
thermometers.
Small shopkeepers have staunchly opposed deregulation since the web of rules
has provided them with valuable protection from competition.
Until recently, they were helped by their ties with the Liberal Democratic
Party, which ran Japan for an unbroken 38 years until its election defeat
last July.
The break-up of the LDP is one factor to lighten small retailers' former
political clout. Another, says Mr Nakauchi, is the ageing of the current
generation of shopkeepers. Unlike Mr Nakauchi's two sons, both senior
managers in Daiei, ambitious young people now see no future in joining their
shopkeeping parents' business, he says.
All this points to dramatic change in the high street. Mr Nakauchi believes
half of Japan's 1.5m shops will go out of business.
It will, in line with his theory of gradual change, be a slow process,
taking until the middle of next century. But it will be inevitable, says Mr
Nakauchi. He cannot see how Japan's retailing industry can sustain twice as
many shops per head - 12 for every 1,000 people - as the US.
Neighbourhood retailers will then broadly divide into supermarkets and
convenience stores, 'so long as they are really convenient,' he says. Daiei
itself neatly captures both sides of Mr Nakauchi's vision of retailing, with
225 Daiei supermarkets and nearly 5,000 Lawson convenience stores.
He dismisses suggestions that the social cost of closing 750,000 shops will
create a backlash. The process will take such a long time, perhaps 50 years,
the lost jobs will be mopped up by service and leisure businesses, Mr
Nakauchi predicts.
Again, the shape of Daiei's own business deliberately reflects this, with
its investments in hotels, consumer finance and even a baseball stadium, to
house Mr Nakauchi's own team, the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks.
Contrary to some other businessmen's attempts to dabble in field sports,
Daiei's baseball projects are turning a healthy profit, despite the
recession and the Hawks poor performance in the professional leagues.
Mr Nakauchi has no plans to export the Daiei formula. His thoughts are more
of learning from foreign retailers. He cites as his models Kmart of the US
and Britain's Marks and Spencer, because of their devotion to value for
money.
He laughs when he is reminded that Baroness Thatcher, the former UK prime
minister, is among Marks and Spencer's customers. Does Mr Hosokawa shop at
Daiei? 'I don't know, but I certainly hope so,' says Mr Nakauchi.

mine property

<TEXT>
Placer Dome, the international gold producer, expects to decide within the
next 12 months whether to press ahead with construction of a gold mine on
the rich Las Cristinas deposit in north-east Venezuela.
The Vancouver-based company said yesterday it had approved a USDollars 13m
feasibility study on the property which, according to initial studies,
contains about 7.7m ounces of gold.
Placer's 70 per cent share of Las Cristinas is equal to almost 60 per cent
of current reserves at its 17 operating mines in North and South America and
Australasia.
Placer also reported a slight drop in 1993 earnings, but a 44 per cent jump
in fourth-quarter income. The latter was largely due to gains from the sale
of investments and favourable tax adjustments.
Earnings for the year were USDollars 107m, or 45 cents a share, down from
Dollars 111m, or 47 cents a share, in 1992. Sales dipped to Dollars 917m
from Dollars 1.02bn.
Placer's share of gold output totalled 1.83m ounces, down from 1.95m ounces.
Average cash production costs edged down to Dollars 184 from Dollars 189 per
ounce.

<TEXT>
Finmeccanica, the Italian state engineering group, is considering possible
shareholding links with McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace group, according
to Italian newspapers, Reuter reports from Rome.
A spokesman for Finmeccanica's parent Istituto per la Ricostruzione
Industriale declined detailed comment on a report in La Repubblica that the
Italian group was planning to buy a stake of up to 20 per cent in the US
group.
Finmeccanica confirmed that talks were being held but that there had been no
discussion on the size of any possible holding.
The IRI spokesman added that a recent IRI board meeting gave the go-ahead to
Finmeccanica to hold talks with McDonnell Douglas, but declined to elaborate
on the purpose of the negotiations.
Earlier this month, Flight International magazine reported Finmeccanica was
considering buying a 10-20 per cent stake in the US group's Douglas Aircraft
subsidiary.
Finmeccanica last week agreed to buy eight defence and aerospace firms
controlled by Efim, Italy's third state holding group which collapsed in
1992. Finmeccanica is part of the ATR consortium which makes medium-range
commuter jets.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Daiei forges import buying link
with trader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Daiei, Japan's largest supermarket chain, has formed an import buying
partnership with Marubeni, a general trading company, the first tie-up
between a leading Japanese trader and retailer.
Marubeni is to help Daiei, a pioneer in Japan's embryonic discount shopping
industry, obtain access to cheap foreign goods such as food, clothing and
sports goods, for sale in Daiei's stores.
This is the latest stage in the strategy of Mr Isao Nakauchi, Daiei's
chairman, to make use of the yen's strength to pass on discounts to
customers.
Daiei is also understood to be seeking a similar alliance to develop cheap
cosmetics with a Japanese maker of beauty goods.
The Marubeni accord, to take effect from April, is expected to lead to a
more than threefold rise in Marubeni's sales to Daiei to Y100bn (Dollars
959m) in the next two to three years, representing 5 per cent of Daiei's
estimated sales this year. Food will form a large part of the first
transactions, including chicken from China, Brazilian coffee and Alaskan
fish.
This is part of Daiei's continuing efforts to bypass Japan's multilayered
distribution system. The costs imposed by many layers of middlemen
contribute to the fact that Japan's grocery prices are roughly twice US
levels.
A representative basket of 30 goods cost the equivalent of Dollars 138 in
Japan and Dollars 68 in the US at 1992 exchange rates, according to Daiei's
estimates.
However, previous Daiei alliances have sometimes lacked substance, warned Mr
Dean Perry, retail analyst at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo.
Last month, Daiei announced a 'broad-ranging' tie-up with Ajinomoto, Japan's
largest food processor, to gain access to low cost domestic and foreign
food.
Overall earnings for the six months to August at the leading Japanese
supermarkets sagged. At the halfway stage Daiei along with other Japanese
stores, such as Ito-Yokado, and Jusco, all suffered declines in profits, and
they were pessimistic on prospects for the full year.
Daiei said last October that its parent pre-tax profit fell 8.4 per cent in
the first half of the year, as a rise in operating costs outpaced a sales
pick-up.

volumes at halfway stage
</HEADLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Suncrush, South Africa's authorised bottler of Coca-Cola and Schweppes soft
drinks, suffered a decline in sales volumes in the half-year to December 31
which was masked at the pre-tax level by a sharp improvement in investment
receipts.
Although sales revenue improved to R317.4m (Dollars 92m) from R296.7m, sales
volumes at the Natal-based company shrank 3 per cent as consumption was
knocked by a company price increase in January last year, added to a 25 per
cent increase in excise tax, the introduction of VAT, sluggish consumer
spending and the impact of township violence on Suncrush's market.
Mr Robin Hamilton, chairman, said Suncrush would expect real growth in
demand in the current six months were it not for the uncertainty surrounding
the country's first non-racial elections in April. He said: 'Question marks
must hang over business prospects around the election, with the probability
of political stayaways hitting consumption of our products and productivity
at our plants.'
Operating income rose to R53.1m from R49.1m before investment income
improved to R5.46m from R2.8m and interest charges declined to R1.2m from
R4.07m. Pre-tax profit jumped to R57.3m from R47.8m. Distributable profit
rose by nearly 30 per cent to R38.1m, equivalent to 25.5 cents against 22
cents a share, after the company's 50-for-one share split in late 1993.
The interim dividend is raised to 4 cents from 3.4 cents.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Top jobs change for third time
at Philippine Airlines
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philippine Airlines (PAL), the national flag carrier, is to carry out senior
management changes for the third time since it was privatised 25 months ago.
The revamp, including the appointment of a new president/chief operating
officer, is being instigated by PR Holdings, the consortium that acquired 67
per cent of PAL at a public auction in January 1992. Mr Carlos Dominguez,
currently chairman and president, is likely to stay as chairman/chief
executive officer, but it is thought the task of overseeing day-to-day
operations will be assigned to a PR Holdings nominee.
No names have been mentioned yet, and the search will have to be
co-ordinated with the government, which owns about 28 per cent.
PR Holdings said that in the nine months to December 1993 unaudited net
profits slumped to just 56.9m pesos (Dollars 1.4m), from 1.17bn pesos the
year before. Revenues had risen by almost 12 per cent but expenses grew by
19 per cent.
PR Holdings is controlled by tobacco-and-banking magnate Mr Lucio Tan, but
owing to his relations with former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the government
had refused to allow him to run PAL directly.
At the time of the auction the consortium was headed by Mr Antonio
Cojuangco, president of Philippine Long Distance Telephone and a relative of
former president Mrs Corazon Aquino. Mr Cojuangco, however, failed to raise
enough cash, forcing him to seek the support of Mr Tan.
Mr Dominguez, a former agriculture secretary and bank executive, was picked
a year ago by the government to head the airline, after the resolution of a
squabble over representation in PR Holdings. The quarrel arose after a
discovery that two state banks had put up cash to support PR Holdings'
takeover of PAL.
Although the government continues to support Mr Dominguez, there is
agreement that he cannot cope with both positions. Late last year, Mr Tan
placed a number of his people to key managerial posts.
Over the past few months, Mr Tan has been the subject of state
investigations for alleged tax evasion.
At PAL, Mr Dominguez reported that the big drop in net profits had been due
to higher maintenance costs, particularly after a decision to contract out
to foreign companies the repair of aircraft engines.
If the trend does not change, PAL will suffer its first loss in three years.
Monthly losses had been recorded since September and early estimates for

Aberfoyle, the Australian mining company, has passed the interim dividend
and launched an ADollars 82.3m one-for-four rights issue after staying in
the red in the six months to December, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
Higher output and improved lead and zinc prices helped the company to a 31
per cent sales boost to ADollars 55.2m (USDollars 39.4m). . Its loss for the
half was reduced to ADollars 2.6m from Dollars A5.8m.
Depreciation provision eased to ADollars 6.9m from ADollars 7.8m and
exploration write-offs fell to ADollars 7.9m from ADollars 8.7m. New shares
will be issued at ADollars 4.35 each.

<TEXT>
United Westburne, the North American plumbing, heating and electrical
equipment wholesaler, plans a CDollars 38m (USDollars 28m) restructuring to
restore profitability, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Westburne, controlled by France's Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, cut back in
1991-92 because of the broad construction slowdown. It cut staff by 1,000
and sold a US division. But recovery has been slow, mainly because of the
construction slump in eastern Canada.
Mr Robert Chevrier, recently appointed chief executive, said 350 jobs would
go and the Burlington warehouse near Toronto closed. A CDollars 18.5m
special charge will be taken to cover the expenses. Other warehouses may be
closed and some transport services contracted out.
He said Westburne would report operating net profit of CDollars 4.5m for
1993 but a final loss of CDollars 29.8m after special charges. In 1992 the
loss was CDollars 10.8m, or 29 cents a share, on revenues of CDollars 2.1bn.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Kersaf first-half profit up 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong performances from its hotel, casino and cinema interests boosted
interim results at Kersaf Investments, the South African-based leisure
group. Pre-tax profit advanced 15 per cent to R233.9m (Dollars 67.7m) from
R202.9m in the half-year to December 31.
Earnings improved 13 per cent to 119 cents a share, but the interim dividend
is increased by only 3 cents to 69 cents, covered 1.7 times against 1.6
times last year.
Mr Buddy Hawton, executive chairman, said the increase in retained earnings
stemmed from 'traditionally inadequate' dividend cover, which needed to be
raised for further investments and to run down long-term debt. He said
Kersaf's focus on the entertainments business left it vulnerable to
political instability ahead of elections in April, hence the need to be
prudent.
In addition, the group's acquisition of the City Lodge hotel chain in
December, settled by issuing new scrip, meant the group would be servicing
more shares. Mr Hawton said it was difficult to be more optimistic than to
predict satisfactory growth by year-end in the current political climate.
The 20 per cent increase in turnover to R1.18bn from R999.6m reflected the
strong interim showing by Sun International, in which Kersaf has an 80 per
cent stake.
Operating profit rose to R256.7m from R210.7m, before a rise in net
borrowing costs to R22.8m from R7.8m. Income from associates improved to
R42.5m from R36.8m, and after-tax profit climbed to R224.1m from R189.5m.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: CSR puts ADollars 45m into
Chinese venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CSR, the Sydney-based building products and sugar group, is investing
ADollars 45m (USDollars 32m) in a new Chinese joint venture which will
supply pre-mixed concrete in northern China.
It is the first time the Australian company has made a major commitment to
the Chinese market, and its largest foray into Asia to date.
At the outset, CSR will have a 63 per cent interest in the joint-venture
company, to be called CSR Tianjin Readymix, with the government-controlled
Tianjin Building Materials Supply General Corporation holding the minority
interest. The Australian company will make an initial investment of ADollars
23m.
However, when a second stage of the expansion programme is completed in
approximately three years' time, CSR's stake will have risen to 75 per cent,
and its total investment is expected to amount to ADollars 45m.
The joint venture, to be managed by CSR, will operate a large aggregate
quarry and construct four pre-mixed concrete plants close to Tianjin, an
industrial centre in northern China and about 140 kilometres south-east of
Beijing.
It is scheduled to start supplying the market with concrete - most of which
is currently mixed on site in northern China, according to CSR - in August
this year. Within the three-year time-frame, sales are forecast to top
ADollars 70m, and production should top 750,000 cubic metres of concrete a
year. Output from the quarry is expected to treble to 3m tonnes a year.
About 125 concrete trucks should be operational.
CSR is understood to have other Asian projects under consideration.
It recently reached a joint venture agreement to build and operate a
ADollars 29m concrete products factory in Taiwan.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: TNT fills two board positions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TNT, the Australian transportation group, has filled two of the boardroom
vacancies created by the resignation of six directors last year.
The company said yesterday that Professor Fred Hilmer and Mr Ian Salmon had
been appointed in a non-executive capacity.
The large number of vacancies occurred after Sir Peter Abeles, who played a
major part in building up TNT, resigned from the board after policy
differences. Other directors in the Abeles camp followed suit.
TNT subsequently indicated that all seats might not be filled, and that the
board size would probably shrink.
Professor Hilmer is Dean of the Australian Graduate School of Management in
the University of New South Wales, and also an MBA from the Wharton School
of Finance in the US. He is a former senior partner of McKinsey &amp; Company,
the consultancy firm.
Mr Salmon is managing director of the Australian Mutual Provident Society,
one of the country's largest financial institutions.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Brambles in loss after US
write-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A large write-off at its US incineration subsidiary caused Brambles, the
Australian transport, equipment hire and waste disposal group, to post a
ADollars 313.9m (USDollars 223.9m) loss after tax and outside equity
interests in the six months to end-December. In the same period in 1992, it
made an ADollars 88m profit.
Even at the operating profit level, Brambles reported lower earnings, with
pre-tax profits dropping to ADollars 120.9m from ADollars 141.8m. The
equipment services division fell to ADollars 76m from ADollars 93.6m, while
earnings from the waste treatment and disposal side dropped to ADollars
3.81m from ADollars 21.3m.
A more cheerful performance was notched up by the transport services
division, where earnings rose to ADollars 43.4m from ADollars 33.6m. Group
sales were ADollars 1.33bn, against ADollars 1.37bn.
Brambles blamed the 'severe economic downturn in Europe and the structural
changes in the hazardous waste market in the US' for the poor trading
results. The latter problem centres on Environmental Systems Co (Ensco), the
US company that Brambles bought in 1992 after a prolonged acquisition
process. Since then, Ensco, a high-temperature incinerator operator, has
been struggling against competition from cheaper alternatives - notably
cement kilns and industrial furnaces.
Yesterday, Brambles admitted this situation was unlikely to go away.
'Despite representations by the incineration industry to the US
Environmental Protection Agency, there is no evidence at this stage of
pending changes to the regulations,' it said. These, Brambles claims, allow
cement kilns to operate on more favourable terms.
'Although the high-temperature incineration industry might get some relief .
. . in the long term, it is likely that cement kilns will continue to be a
permanent feature of the US hazardous waste market.'
Accordingly, Brambles is writing off the total value of the goodwill arising
from the Ensco acquisition. This and a ADollars 19.6m provision for
rationalisation costs in certain European operations led to a ADollars 377m
abnormal charge.
The company was more optimistic about its equipment rental and transport
activities in continental Europe. These declined sharply in the first half,
but 'there are signs that the worst may be over with the apparent bottoming
of the German economy'. It also noted that, in contrast to the US and
Europe, the Australian interests had generally performed well during the
period.
The company said it expected results to improve during 1994, assuming no
further deterioration in Ensco's performance and continued recovery in
Europe, Australia and the US. It said that it still expected to maintain
dividends, despite the abnormal charges.

sell-off

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The international promotion of the privatisation of Banca Commerciale
Italiana (BCI) has moved to continental Europe and the Far East following a
roadshow in London yesterday for institutional investors.
Pricing of the issue will be set next Saturday in the wake of the
announcement of a 37.8 per cent increase in net profit to L301.2bn (Dollars
180m) last year.
The sharp increase in profitability of the group, controlled by IRI, the
Italian state holding company, was attributed largely to a turnround in the
performance of BCI's Canadian and French subsidiaries.
The results had already been foreshadowed in those of the parent company and
during the road-show in the US.
Net interest income was marginally up at L3,430bn from L3,386bn; while
non-interest income jumped 89 per cent to L2,100bn. With operating costs of
L3,409bn held to a 6.5 per cent rise, group operating profit rose 74 per
cent to L1,901bn from L1,088bn.
The group set aside L853bn for possible loan losses compared with L566bn the
previous year. Pre-tax profits were L1,163bn against L599bn but BCI was
obliged to make substantially increased tax provisions, up from L367bn to
L840bn.
At the year end, the group's total assets stood at L134,106bn compared with
L128,607bn in 1992. Deposits grew 5.7 per cent to L113,657bn while total
cash loans increased 7.5 per cent to L99,232bn.

<TEXT>
The committee representing the creditor banks of Euro Disney, the stricken
leisure group, yesterday received a long-awaited audit of the company's
financial situation from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy group.
The report, which clears the way for detailed negotiations between the
banks, Euro Disney and Walt Disney, includes an assessment of the commercial
strategy being pursued by the group.
According to one source, however, the report did not advocate significant
changes to Euro Disney's strategy, drawn up last year, and which includes
greater emphasis on cost controls, increased variation in pricing to smooth
seasonal variations and measures to encourage short-stay visits.
Negotiations are expected to start later this week or next. Walt Disney,
which holds 49 per cent of Euro Disney's equity, has set March 31 for the
conclusion of negotiations. After then, it warned, it would no longer
provide financial support.
The negotiations will focus on how restructuring is to be shared. According
to the report, Euro Disney requires a capital injection of up to FFr13bn
(Dollars 2.17bn) to reduce its FFr20.3bn debts.
Walt Disney is pressing the banks to reduce Euro Disney's debts through the
combination of a rights issue and a debt for equity swap. But Euro Disney's
60 banks want concessions from the US parent company.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The DSW, Germany's small shareholder organisation, has called for a special
investigation into the role of the supervisory board at Metallgesellschaft,
in addition to that of the management board.
If shareholders reject an investigation at the special shareholders' meeting
of the troubled metals, mining and industrial group next Thursday, the DSW
would consider going to court to force such a measure, it said yesterday.
At the meeting, Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the supervisory board chairman, is to
defend the supervisory board's role in the events leading up to the
dismissal of Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the former chief executive, and other
boardroom colleagues in December.
Mr Schimmelbusch was sacked for allegedly not informing the supervisory
board of developments at MG Corp, the group's US commodities trading
subsidiary. Losses there triggered a liquidity crisis which forced the group
to turn to bankers for a DM3.4bn rescue package last month.
While the supervisory board is likely to agree to an investigation into the
management, it may not want to subject its own decisions to scrutiny. Last
week the DSW said it wanted to examine whether lack of internal controls at
Metallgesellschaft meant it was impossible for the supervisory board to
fulfil its responsibilities.

<TEXT>
Ahold, the Dutch-based supermarket group which already ranks among the 10
largest food retailers in the US, is to bolster its position in the
south-eastern US by acquiring Red Food Stores from Promodes, the French
retailing group.
Red Food Stores, with annual sales of Dollars 585m, operates 55 grocery
stores in eastern Tennessee and Georgia.
When the deal is completed in late April, it will mark Ahold's sixth
acquisition of a US supermarket chain since it entered the US market in
1977. The latest purchase will lift its annual US turnover by almost 9 per
cent to about Fl 7.25bn (Dollars 3.75bn), representing slightly more than
half of Ahold's total sales.
Ahold declined to give financial details but said the purchase would be
financed out of 'available resources'. In May the company, which has long
been seeking a new US acquisition, raised roughly Fl 450m through a 1-for-10
rights issue.
Away from the US, Ahold has been concentrating its expansion in recent years
on Portugal, where it has bought several grocery and hypermarket chains, and
the Czech Republic, where it is slowly building up the Mana chain.
The acquisition of Red Food Stores fits the pattern of Ahold's earlier US
growth, which has relied on buying supermarkets in contiguous regions to
promote partnerships between its chains and to spread the Dutch company's
presence across the eastern US.
'We see new opportunities for synergy, benefiting both our customers as well
as the bottom line,' Mr Robert Zwartendijk, president of Ahold USA, said.
Red Food Stores' base in Tennessee and Georgia is close to that of Ahold's
Bi-Lo chain, which operates 187 supermarkets in Georgia, North Carolina and
South Carolina.
Ahold's four other US chains cover the eastern US from Virginia to
Massachusetts.

was an operating loss of DKr132m against a 1992 loss of DKr1.09bn. Only
extraordinary income of DK325m enabled the savings bank to report a small
profit.
Mr Borge Munk Ebbesen, chief executive, described the result as 'not
satisfactory'. Total assets increased to DKr100m from DKr95m and the group
said the capital adequacy ratio was 11.1 per cent compared with the Danish
minimum level of 9 per cent.

venture talks

<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz, the German engineering group which owns Mercedes, will discuss
today a possible joint venture with SMH, Swiss maker of the Swatch watch, to
develop a small, economical car.
Mr Roland Klein, Daimler-Benz spokesman, confirmed yesterday that a possible
collaboration between the two companies was on the agenda as the company's
board meets for its usual Tuesday meeting. But he warned that no final
decision was yet in sight.
The 'Swatchmobile' project has been promoted by Mr Nicolas Hayek, SMH
chairman, for several years. Volkswagen was involved, but withdrew in
January last year. Volkswagen said then it was under pressure to cut costs
and wanted to avoid the heavy invest-ment associated with the project.
Speculation that Daimler-Benz would build the long-awaited Swatch car has
recently increased after Mr Helmut Werner, the chairman of Mercedes, said
last week in Frankfurt that his company may team up with Swatch. SMH has
been talking with various carmakers for about a year.
The new two-seater, environmentally-friendly small car would be a welcome
addition to the Mercedes range in the face of increased competition in what
is deemed an increasingly important strategic market segment.
German rival carmaker Volkswagen recently announced that its Audi subsidiary
would build a small car starting in 1996. And BMW is taking control of the
British car producer Rover, which manufactures similar cars.
'Nothing has been decided,' a spokeswoman for Swatch said, adding that the
group would be making no announcement today. Mr Hayek said recently he
expected to name a partner this year.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Spaniards set for record Dollars
300m equity placement
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas (FCC), a leading and highly
diversified Spanish construction company, is to make the largest ever equity
placement by a private Spanish company.
The bulk of the placement, which could raise more than Dollars 300m, will be
offered to US and UK institutions, with Goldman Sachs, the US bank, leading
the US tranche and co-leading the UK and continental Europe tranche with
Schroders of the UK. Banco Central Hispano will place a smaller tranche
among domestic institutions.
Analysts said FCC's decision could inspire more domestic companies to tap
the markets. Large Spanish corporate placements are usually the domain of
the public sector, the latest being the utility Endesa which announced a
Dollars 1.4bn global offering last weekend.
Some 20 per cent of FCC will be offered to the markets which will raise the
amount of its shares that are freely traded to 40 per cent, one of the
biggest among the domestic construction companies.
The equity being offered is made up of treasury stock, stock owned by FCC's
cement subsidiary Valderribas and a portion of the 74 per cent shareholding
in FCC that is owned by the Koplowitz family.
In addition to its lead management role, Goldman will act as the global
co-ordinator of the placement and the design of the global offering -
private placements on two international tranches, one for the US and one for
the UK and continental Europe, and a third tranche for domestic institutions
 -follows closely the pattern that Goldman established when it brought
Repsol, the state-owned energy group, to the market last year.
The FCC mandate turns Spain into one of the US bank's leading profit
centres. Goldman will be advising Endesa's global offering, which is likely
in May, and it could also place another portion of Repsol equity on the
market after the summer.
FCC is a holding company with divisions covering construction, cement,
property, car parks, waste management, and waste collection and street
cleaning. It shares the leadership of the domestic construction industry
with Dragados y Construcciones, has a 70 per cent quota of the fast growing
waste management sector and is the second largest cement company after
Cemex, the Mexican producer which acquired large Spanish cement companies
two years ago.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro sharply ahead at
NKr3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest publicly-quoted company, yesterday reported a
sharp increase in 1993 profits, helped by lower costs, higher crude oil
production and the disposal of the group's 38.3 per cent stake in Freia
Marabou, the Norwegian chocolate producer.
It also plans to spend between NKr600m and NKr700m on expanding its three
PVC plants. If the plan is adopted later this year annual production of the
raw material S-PVC will rise to 400,000 tonnes a year over a four-year
period, from the current figure of 265,000 tonnes.
European capacity is almost 6m tonnes a year, and PVC prices have fared
relatively well in a petrochemical sector dogged by overcapacity in Europe.
Norsk Hydro's net profits in 1993 advanced to NKr3bn (Dollars 403m) -
including a pre-tax gain of NKr2.53bn from the Freia disposal - from
NKr1.8bn in 1992. Excluding the gain, net profit was NKr1.2bn.
The board proposed lifting the 1993 dividend to NKr3.50 a share from NKr3 in
1992. Group operating profit rose by 37 per cent to NKr4.04bn from NKr3bn as
sales increased by NKr4.23n to NKr62.4bn.
'Prices for most of our core products have been very low, but this was
largely offset by a higher exchange rate for the US dollar. The improvement
was due primarily to lower production costs and higher crude oil
production,' Mr Egil Myklebust, president, said.
Hydro said the weak international economy and large exports from the former
Soviet Union have depressed markets and continue to cause uncertainty,
particularly for light metals. Low crude oil prices and continuing
structural problems in the European fertiliser industry also represent
challenges, it added.
Group financial costs last year were cut to NKr1.94bn from NKr2.62bn a year
earlier as foreign exchange losses fell sharply to NKr496m from NKr1.4bn.
For the group's core business segments, agriculture swung to an operating
profit of NKr481m in 1993 from a loss of NKr215m as sales rose by NKr1.5bn
to NKr26.9bn.
The advance was due to significantly lower costs following two years of
restructuring, and higher sales volume in Europe. In 1992 Hydro charged
accounts with restructuring costs NKr160m, but since 1991 costs have been
cut by NKr922m, far above a goal of NKr800m set by the company.
Oil and gas boosted 1993 operating profit by NKr497m to NKr3.15bn as sales
rose by NKr1.41bn to NKr14.1bn. Petroleum production increased by 1.1m
tonnes of oil equivalent to 9.4m, helped by two new fields being brought on
stream.
Light metals, the only one of the group's divisions to suffer a setback, saw
operating profits fall NKr92m to NKr453m as sales rose NKr69m to NKr16.3bn.
Weaker prices for primary aluminium and lower demand for aluminium
extrusions were behind the decline.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: MAM's Pounds 5m for venture group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury Asset Management, the fund management arm of SG Warburg, has bought
Grosvenor Ventures, the venture capital company featured in the 1992 BBC
series 'The Adventurers'.
The move is the first outright purchase by one venture capital group of
another but confirms a trend towards a consolidation within the industry as
the raising of funds has become increasingly difficult in the UK.
MAM is understood to have paid about Pounds 5m for Grosvenor Ventures, which
manages Grosvenor Development Capital and four limited partnerships and has
investments of more than Pounds 50m.
The Grosvenor team will remain in the Slough offices and will join MAM's
development capital arm, which manages about Pounds 400m of venture and
development capital investments.
The sale has been expected within the industry since Grosvenor failed to
raise a new fund from investors and the departure of chairman Mr Robert
Drummond after a disagreement over the future direction of the company.
MAM said Grosvenor's business was complementary and that the new owner would
discuss over the coming months the injection of new funds for Grosvenor to
manage.
'They (Grosvenor) have good access to a regional deal flow at the smaller
end of the market for deals of Pounds 750,000 up to Pounds 2.5m which is
what we want them to do,' said MAM's Ms Sandra O'Neill. 'MAM will
concentrate on larger buy-outs from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 30m.'
The announcement of the sale came as Grosvenor Development Capital, the
listed invested trust, which is managed by Grosvenor Venture Managers,
announced its best annual performance since it was listed in 1989.
Net assets increased by 31 per cent to Pounds 15.5m, in the year to 31
December 1993, and assets per share rose to 192.3p.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Kynoch rationalises after Pounds 644,000
loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kynoch Group, the specialist manufacturer of healthcare equipment, swung
from profits of Pounds 958,000 to losses of Pounds 644,000 pre-tax for the
year to December 31.
Turnover of continuing activities rose to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 13.3m). There
was also a Pounds 226,000 contribution from acquisitions.
The group warned in September that profits for the year were likely to be
well below those for 1992. For the opening six months they fell by 67 per
cent to Pounds 126,000.
To stem the tide of losses, the group has rationalised its MDH offshoot, to
give cost savings of Pounds 423,000 in 1994.
It has also sold its large capacity steriliser business which was the main
cause of the 1993 deficit.
There were exceptional charges for non-recurring items in 1993 amounting to
Pounds 249,000 (nil). Losses per share emerged at 1.9p (earnings 3.4p).
Looking ahead, Mr John Salkeld, chairman, said trading in recent months had
stabilised and the pattern of demand had begun to improve from the low
levels experienced in the second half of 1993.
Panmure Gordon has agreed to become stockbroker to the group with immediate
effect.

Benefits of new store openings enabled Essex Furniture to raise pre-tax
profits by 14 per cent, from Pounds 619,000 to Pounds 703,000, in the six
months to December 31. Sales at the USM-quoted furniture retailer and
manufacturer grew 44 per cent to Pounds 7.47m.
Mr Michael Franks, chairman, said trading from Boxing Day was ahead of
forecast with excellent input from new locations. Results for the full year
were expected to be 'very satisfactory.'
He reported that the interim performance had exceeded budgeted forecasts and
the company had absorbed the opening costs of a new head office and
distribution facility of five new showrooms in the period.
An additional 60,000 sq ft had been added to selling space and the company
said it intended to open a minimum of five showrooms in 1994.
Earnings advanced from 3.73p to 4.06p and the interim dividend is 1.8p
(1.5p).

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: A promise of no jam tomorrow - A look at
Trafficmaster, which is en route for a market quote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growing traffic congestion - and offering customers a way of avoiding it -
are key elements in the strategy of a group which will soon come to the
market with a capitalisation of about Pounds 25m.
Trafficmaster is a Luton-based company which claims to offer the world's
first commercially available on-board traffic monitoring system. A
dashboard-mounted screen advises of upcoming traffic jams and road
accidents, in time for drivers to alter their route.
Mr David Martell, chief executive, said Monday mornings were the worst time
to travel on the UK's motorways, while Friday mornings were best in all
parts of the country. He said: 'Cynically, I think this is because salesmen
don't work on Fridays - they play golf.'
Trafficmaster has installed infra-red sensors which monitor traffic speed,
transmit it by radio to a central computer and then feed the information to
visual display units in subscribers' vehicles. The complete network is
updated every three minutes, and advises motorists of the average speed and
direction of any hold-up.
The system already covers more than 1,000 miles of motorways and trunk roads
in the south of England and the Midlands.
Part of the flotation proceeds will be used to extend the network to cover
the main motorways in England, Wales and Scotland by the end of this year,
and main trunk roads during 1995 and 1996.
Trafficmaster units can be rented for Pounds 30 a month, or Pounds 19.50 a
month if purchased. The screens currently cost Pounds 199, but, like other
electronic products, prices are likely to fall rapidly if and when they
start being sold by high street retailers.
Mr Martell, 45, is an accountant with interests in property and wine
shipping. He said the idea for Trafficmaster came to him when sitting in an
M25 traffic jam on the way to Heathrow with an old school friend, Mr Ian
Williams, who is now a non-executive director of the company they founded.
Mr Martell is a fan of motorways and believes some of the critical press
coverage about them is undeserved. However, he was struck by the poor
quality of information about traffic conditions available to drivers.
The company was established in 1988 and, backed by Hambro venture capital
funds, developed the necessary dedicated hardware and software. A pilot
scheme, covering 250 miles of motorways around London, was successfully
concluded in 1992, after which the company was awarded a 12-year licence to
operate the system on all English motorways and trunk roads.
The licence is non-exclusive, and Mr Martell acknowledges that other
organisations might seek to enter the market. However, he believes the
company's investment means it has a four-year technological lead and a
window of opportunity to market its product.
To date Trafficmaster is still incurring trading losses, but has installed
about 2,000 screens. It is close to break-even at that level, but further
investment on extending the network will raise that hurdle. However, once
the network is complete, revenue from each additional subscriber should make
profitability climb quickly.
Trafficmaster said that existing subscribers, which include mainly senior
employees from 55 of the FT-SE 100 companies, report that the system helps
save time, reduces frustration and provides insurance against delay.
There seems little danger of diminishing demand. The Confederation of
British Industry estimates that traffic congestion now costs the UK Pounds
15bn a year. According to Department of Transport forecasts, the number of
vehicles in the UK will grow by 60 per cent by 2020, and road usage will
more than double in the same period.
Trafficmaster has patents pending in 48 countries. In the US - where
Trafficmaster is a registered trade mark - Westinghouse Electric, the US
conglomerate, has signed an exclusive agreement to introduce the system,
probably starting on Washington DC's beltway.
About 20 per cent of current subscribers pay extra to use the system as a
personal pager. A new generation of screens will use 'smart-card' technology
to provide extra services, such as demonstrating each user's position, and
sending local information and routing from motorway sites.
So far the company has installed giant Trafficmaster screens at 20 Welcome
Break motorway sites, with plans for 25 more at ports and airports this
year.
Each site can generate more than Pounds 18,000 from advertising and also
acts as a strong marketing tool to potential subscribers.
The screens have also been installed in the reception area of several
corporate customers, so staff can check road conditions.
The company's big breakthrough to the mass market could come when motor
manufacturers start providing guidance systems in new vehicles. Renault and
BMW are among the car manufacturers working along these lines.
Trafficmaster will be floated by way of a placing, sponsored by Allied
Provincial, to raise about Pounds 5m of new money.
Peek, the quoted electronics group, currently has a 23 per cent stake in the
company, but is not expected to sell any of its shares.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Merrydown shares lose sparkle after warning
on profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Merrydown tumbled yesterday after the Sussex-based cider and soft
drinks maker issued a warning on profits and announced plans to restructure
its activities.
The shares were marked down to 125p in pre-market dealings, as analysts
hastily revised their profits forecasts downwards, before rallying to finish
at 159p - still 54p below Friday's closing level.
The board, chaired by Mr Richard Purdey, said that sales in the crucial
Christmas period had been 'very disappointing'. Despite growth from the
repackaged Original brand, the sales outcome for the full year to end-March
was likely to be 'well below previous expectations with a considerable
adverse effect on profitability'.
While the recently acquired Shloer and PLJ brands had maintained sales,
cider was hit, particularly in the bulk cash and carry and wholesale
sectors, reflecting competition from economy brands, the directors said.
The full-year was unlikely to show more than a modest profit, and the level
of the final dividend - 6p last time for a total of 7p - was 'under review'.
The proposed restructuring, aimed at increasing working capital by
concentrating on the company's main brands, would involve a reduction in
stock levels and overheads and the disposal of Martlet Natural Foods and
other 'non-core assets'.
Merrydown's quoted competitors - HP Bulmer and Taunton Cider - both
responded to the statement.
Bulmer, which produces the Strongbow, Woodpecker and Scrumpy Jack brands,
described its trading over Christmas as 'reasonable'. It said its brand
portfolio was more 'balanced' than Merrydown's and stressed that economy
brands accounted for just 5 to 6 per cent of the total cider market.
Taunton, which warned in December that lower-priced brands had adversely
affected the take-home market, said its own trading over the period was
'satisfactory'.
The group, which makes Dry Blackthorn and Autumn Gold and the premium Red
Rock, Diamond White and Brody brands, is launching fresh promotional
campaigns from next month, but declined to make a formal statement on
trading.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth helps Ashtead leap to
Pounds 3.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ashtead, the plant and machinery hire group which had a Pounds 20.4m rights
issue in November, more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.61m to
Pounds 3.26m in the six months to October 31.
Although the shares fell 12p to 439p yesterday, they have been rising
sharply from the 378p level of a fortnight ago.
With organic growth coming from all three divisions, Mr Peter Lewis,
chairman, said that operational gearing of the business - underpinned by
maintained, and even increased, investment across the group throughout the
recession - lay behind the sharp profits rise. During the period, capital
expenditure rose to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5.3m) and is expected to be Pounds
8.5m (Pounds 4m) in the second half.
Group turnover advanced 24 per cent to Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 16.8m) with
volumes up 24 per cent. Mr Lewis said that further volume growth was the
short-term aim, though there had been sporadic price increases of between 2
and 3 per cent on some lines since last spring.
A-Plant, the core UK plant hire business, raised operating profits to Pounds
2.63m (Pounds 1.47m) on turnover of Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 13.4m).
Ashtead Technology, the offshore services division, lifted profits to Pounds
603,000 (Pounds 489,000) on turnover lower at Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 2.37m)
after the withdrawal from low margin sales programmes. A Singapore branch
was opened in January.
Sunbelt, the US plant hire side, increased profits six times to Pounds
442,000 (Pounds 74,000) on turnover of Pounds 2.73m (Pounds 1.1m). This year
it is spending Pounds 1.3m on plant: next year the figure will be Pounds 3m.
Earnings per share more than doubled from 5.2p to 10.9p and the interim
dividend is raised to 1.3p (1.133p).
COMMENT
At this stage in its development, Ashtead leaves the cynic clutching at
non-existent straws. There will be fewer billings days in the second half -
115 against the first half's 129 - so volume growth will ease slightly. But
even if prices don't firm as they are half-expected to, that will hardly
dent the group's progress, as, apart from anything else, interest charges
will fall as the rights' Pounds 8m cash pile offsets previous borrowings.
The management has steered the group through the recession admirably -
investing heavily, not rushing at fences in the US, using profit-sharing
schemes well - and they can afford to look a little smug. With Pounds 5.5m
pre-tax pencilled in, giving earnings of about 16.5p, the p/e is 26.5. With
no profits decelaration likely at least until 1997, the shares are worth
staying with.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Smirnoff aims at Kazak market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Metropolitan has formed a joint venture to market Smirnoff vodka in
the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan.
Having seen dramatic growth in Smirnoff sales in Russia, GrandMet's IDV
spirits arm is now keen to attack the Kazak vodka market which is 40 per
cent bigger than the UK.
Mr Paul Curtis, IDV's head of international marketing, said:'Kazakhstan
represents another great opportunity for developing the strength of IDV's
international brands in emerging markets.
'We are uniquely positioned with Smirnoff, which is already available and
well known in some of the major cities.'
He said there was also potential for IDV's other brands which include J&amp;B
Rare Scotch whisky.
IDV, which recently secured US distribution rights to Stolichnaya Russian
vodka, has been marketing US-made Smirnoff in Russia since 1989. Last year
it sold 600,000 cases in Russia, compared with just 10,000 cases in 1991. In
June, the Pierre Smirnoff Company set up its own office in Moscow.
The new Kazakhstan company, called IDV Central Asia, is a joint venture with
Coromin Inc, an importer and marketing company with warehousing and
transport facilities.
Unilever has acquired 90 per cent of the shares in Severnoye Siyaniye, a St
Petersburg-based producer of lotions, after-shaves and colour cosmetics.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Wills ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wills Group, the distributor of fluid handling equipment, reported doubled
pre-tax profits of Pounds 575,000 for the six months to January 1, against
Pounds 287,000.
The result was achieved on turnover up 44 per cent from Pounds 8m to Pounds
11.5m.
Wills also announced a further acquisition with the purchase of Cellar
Services Technology, a Manchester-based supplier to the brewing industry,
for Pounds 60,000.
In the year to May 31 it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 64,000 on turnover
of Pounds 1.5m.
The figures were the first to include a full contribution from Platon,
acquired in April last year. At the beginning of November, SRL, based in
Lyon, was acquired helping the French activities to show a good performance.
In Italy buoyant results in some areas balanced downturns inothers. Trading
in Germany and the Netherlands was poor, while in the UK there has been some
sign of improving market conditions but this has yet to show through in
significant increases in demand. Earnings per share improved to 0.36p
(0.28p) basic. or 0.35p (0.24p) fully diluted.
The interim dividend is raised from 0.1p to 0.115p.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bullough restates after shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bullough, the office products and refrigeration group, has been forced to
restate its full-year results following the discovery of a Pounds 1.4m
shortfall in the assets of a subsidiary.
As a result the group yesterday reported restated audited pre-tax profits of
Pounds 7.78m for the year to October 31 and earnings per share of 2.29p. The
shares closed 12p lower at 161p.
The shortfall was discovered in one of the branches of the group's General
Refrigeration business. Investigations are under way to determine the exact
nature of the loss.
However, the company said that until the investigation was completed it was
not known how much of the loss was represented by the misappropriation of
assets nor how much might be recovered from insurers. A member of the branch
accounting staff had been dismissed.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Quality Software in US link-up - Venture
gives distribution access to 45,000 prospective customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality Software Products, the Gateshead-based accounting software company
which joined the main market last year, has secured distribution in North
America for its principal product through an innovative revenue sharing
venture.
The deal has been signed with Global Software, a US accounting software
house based in Raleigh, North Carolina. The venture gives QSP access to
45,000 prospective customers - the UK market for large scale accounting
software is only about 3,000 customers.
At no cost it gives QSP a 5 per cent equity stake in Global with the option
to purchase a further 5 per cent at a later date.
QSP and Global will share both software licence fee and maintenance revenues
from QSP's new client-server accounting software, Universal Olas.
Analysts were enthusiastic about the deal, arguing that it provided QSP with
a low cost and low risk method of entry to the US market.
Sales in the North American market are critical for any software company
with global ambitions but UK companies have a poor record of success in the
US. QSP's share price was unchanged yesterday at 407p.
Mr Alan Mordain, QSP chairman, said the company had been seeking a suitable
US partner for two years and had been encouraged by the similarity of
approach between the two companies. The Global management, which recently
bought the company from Hathaway Corporation, had powerful incentives to
make the relationship work, he said.
QSP has been successful in the UK with a mainframe accounting package, but
is pinning its future hopes on Universal Olas, developed for client-server
systems at a cost of some Pounds 12m.
Client-server systems are increasingly taking over from mainframe computers
in large companies and could represent half of all installed systems by
1998.
Global, with revenues of Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) in 1993 and over 1,000
customers in the US, including Federal Express and the American Hospital
Association, is a competitor to Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software and Computer
Associates of the US, and SAP of Germany in mainframe software, but has no
client-server software.
Mr Thomas Roberg, Global's vice president, said that without the QSP deal
the company would have had to develop its own client-server product.
QSP now has 10 customers for Universal Olas and has completed all the
principal modules.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Prior makes second cash call
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson's Beazer Estates subsidiary is taking a 3.5 per cent stake in Prior,
the property group and architectural ironmonger, as part consideration for
the sale of two properties in Hull and Liverpool.
Beazer, which has given Prior an option on a further property, has
undertaken not to sell the shares for at least 12 months.
Prior is also buying Bouverie House in London's Fleet Street for Pounds
11.5m from a company controlled by the family trust of Prior's chairman, Mr
James Prior.
It is seeking Pounds 4.55m net through the placing of 108.3m shares at 4 1/2
p. They are being made available to shareholders on 3-for-4 basis. The
shares were suspended last week at 7 1/4 p. The company also announced
pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.02m (losses Pounds 467,000) for the six months
to September 30 as a result of the placing in May, which raised Pounds 2.37m
net, allowing a release of bank indebtedness of Pounds 2.05m. Turnover was
Pounds 609,000 (Pounds 596,000).
Prior is buying the three properties for an aggregate Pounds 12.7m,
satisfied by the issue of 32.2m shares, Pounds 2.28m cash and a loan of
Pounds 9m from Century Life, which has also been granted an option for up to
4m shares at 4 1/2p.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Costs and squeezed margins hit FII
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FII, the shoe manufacturer which supplies Marks and Spencer, yesterday
announced a drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.48m to Pounds
551,000.
The fall was due to a squeeze on margins and a series of one-off costs in
the science and footwear divisions.
The interim dividend is maintained at 6p, as forecast in November's profits
warning. Earnings fell from 15.3p to 2.2p per share.
Turnover was 2 per cent higher at Pounds 42m. Mr Monty Sumray, chairman,
said that was largely due to FII's increased share of the UK footwear
market. Sales in that division rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 38m in a
stagnant market, he said.
Pre-tax profits in the division were affected by a Pounds 44,000 exceptional
cost of recalling a defective shoe design and rationalisation charges.
Profits fell by Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 1.5m.
The shoe business continued to suffer from tight margins, Mr Sumray said,
and there were indications that leather prices were likely to increase.
On the brighter side, the recent decision by the European Union to impose
quotas on Chinese shoe imports 'may help our cause,' said Mr Sumray. The
science division incurred costs of Pounds 650,000 following the cancellation
of a development contract and a product recall during the first half. This
resulted in a Pounds 1.2m pre-tax loss, against a profit of Pounds 200,000
last time.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Govett rises 21% to Dollars 54.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Govett, the fund management and insurance group, reported a 21 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to Dollars 54.6m (Pounds 37.3m) for the year to
December 31. Profits growth came largely from fund management fees and
investments, after a good year for international equity and bond markets.
The US profile of the group, which has half its assets and employees in the
UK and half in the US, has been helped by gaining a Nasdaq listing last
year. It is seeking a New York Stock Exchange ADR listing.
Funds under management grew by 31 per cent to Dollars 8.5bn, but a large
portion of the Dollars 2bn increase is attributable to the acquisition of
North American Trust Company last August, which has Dollars 1.5bn under
management. Other inflows came from four large new US institutional
accounts, new investment funds, and sales of US mutual funds.
Weekly sales of US mutual funds leapt from Dollars 250,000 to Dollars 10m,
and Mr Ian Whitehead, chief financial officer, said that growth was expected
to continue this year. The group is aiming to increase the US mutual fund
business from Dollars 340m to Dollars 1bn in the near term. Govett has
benefited from US investors' general move to international markets, driven
by low interest rates and poor prospects for US stocks.
Income from fund management improved to Dollars 19.6m (Dollars 15.4m), and
investment income almost doubled to Dollars 18.5m (Dollars 9.7m). The
contribution from the US life assurance and annuities arm slipped to Dollars
18.3m (Dollars 19m), but Mr Whitehead said this did not reflect significant
unrealised gains. Income from development capital dropped to Dollars 4.5m
(Dollars 7m).
A share buy-back programme contributed to the improved fully-diluted
earnings per share figure, up 38 per cent to 62.1 cents.
There is a final gross dividend of 18 cents (14.5 cents), to make a total of
28 cents (24 cents).

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Low &amp; Bonar jumps to Pounds 32m -
Near-fourfold advance helped by restructuring and new subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low &amp; Bonar yesterday announced a near fourfold increase in profits as the
packaging and plastics group reaped the benefits of a wide-ranging
restructuring and contributions from new subsidiaries.
Britain's self-proclaimed market leader in food packaging saw pre-tax
profits climb from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 31.6m in the 12 months to November
30 last year.
Although the 1992 figures were distorted by heavy reorganisation costs in
North America and the closure of its UK non-wovens business, profits before
exceptionals showed a 43 per cent improvement.
Mr Jim Leng, chief executive, said the group - which wraps products as
diversified as soap and silage - was now in a dominant position as
manufacturers consolidated orders with a few key suppliers.
'We've got rid of the bits and pieces which were not central and we now want
to grow in our main businesses, particularly in North America and Europe,'
he added.
Of the group's three core areas, packaging showed the sharpest improvement
with a 55.4 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 20m.
The division, representing more than half of group profit, was boosted by
contributions of Pounds 5.3m from its latest acquisitions: Cereal Packaging,
purchased from Kellogg for Pounds 33.5m, and designer CMB Carton Systems,
the packaging equipment company acquired for Pounds 17.4m.
The acquisitions - funded by a Pounds 50.2m rights issue last April -
contributed Pounds 36m to group turnover of Pounds 368.9m (Pounds 307.3m).
Sales of specialist materials improved by 15 per cent to Pounds 82.8m, with
profits ahead 35 per cent at Pounds 13m (Pounds 9.6m).
The input, however, of the plastics division was more modest. Turnover
increased 6.5 per cent to Pounds 52.8m, while profits rose 4.5 per cent to
Pounds 4.84m.
Mr Norman McLeod, finance director, said the division had failed to keep
pace with the other sectors because of the recession in continental Europe,
where profits fell to Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 3.8m).
'Nevertheless, we still managed to generate Pounds 25m in cash during the
year and brought gearing down to 8 per cent from 30 per cent,' he added.
Earnings per share rose 31 per cent to 21.77p, compared with 16.56p before
exceptionals in 1992. A proposed final dividend of 7.1p lifts the total to
10p, a 10 per cent increase.
COMMENT
Low &amp; Bonar has begun to make its assets sweat. Having introduced new
management and completed disposals in the UK and North America, it has
improved productivity sharply and cut borrowing. A five-year contract with
Kellogg has also insulated it from the worst effects of supermarket price
cuts. With orders stabilising in Europe and only a 25 per cent exposure to
the consumer packaging business, profits are expected to exceed Pounds 39m
this year on a forward earnings multiple of 16. The shares, up 7p at 407p
yesterday, appear inexpensive.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Odds shorten on Racecourse win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Racecourse Holdings Trust, owned by the Jockey Club, remains the favourite
to win the race to own Epsom, home of the Derby.
But yesterday Mr Stan Clarke, who has turned round Uttoxeter racecourse from
losses five years ago, confirmed that he was putting in a private bid, along
with Mr Anthony Solomons, chairman of Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant
banking and property group, and Mr Andrew Cohen, managing director of
Betterware, the home shopping company.
Also in the running is Sunset + Vine, which makes sports television
programmes.
Epsom is being sold, along with Sandown Park and Kempton Park, by the
Horserace Betting Levy Board, the statutory body that acquired the courses
more than 20 years ago in order to protect them from possible property
development.
All three courses lie within the M25, London's outer ring road. Estimates of
their total value run up to Pounds 30m.
The bids must be submitted to Lazard Brothers, the merchant bank handling
the sale, by the end of this week. The winner is expected to be announced at
the end of March at the earliest.
Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation, the shipping and property company,
which was also shortlisted, said that it would not be submitting a bid.
Also out of the running is the Racehorse Owners' Association, which feels
aggrieved that it did not make the final list. The association, which has
4,500 members, is thought to have put in an indicative bid of well over
Pounds 20m last month.
Mr David Hillyard, managing director of Racecourse Holdings Trust, said his
group had a good track record for managing large racecourses. The trust owns
nine, including Cheltenham and Newmarket, and ploughs all its profits back
into racing.
Mr Clarke, owner of Uttoxeter, said he had served his apprenticeship in
racing over the past five years, turning the course from losses of Pounds
36,000 in 1989 to Pounds 400,000 profits this year.
'We are committed racing men', said Mr Clarke, who sold his housebuilding
business for Pounds 51m in 1986. He believes he can transfer to racing the
management expertise learnt in building up two businesses.
Mr Gerry Buckland, of Sunset + Vine, said the company specialised in sports
and horse racing television programmes, and believed it could use its skills
to enhance the potential of the three courses. 'The Derby has not had the
crack of the whip it might have had', he said.
Meanwhile Mr Bill Gredley, chairman of the Racehorse Owners Association,
feels that the association's bid was unfairly dismissed. Its committee,
which included Mr David Sieff of Marks and Spencer, and Sir Eric Parker,
former chief executive of Trafalgar House, felt the bid timetable, squeezed
between Christmas and March 1, was too tight.
'Nevertheless we put in a very competitive bid and we feel that we need some
answers', Mr Gredley stated.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Rover and Honda - Going Their Own Ways: Co-operation on an
ad hoc basis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Bacchus, Rover's head of collaborative strategy, was in Tokyo
yesterday seeing the corporate umbrella over his Honda projects snatched out
of his hands. He has been Rover's point of contact with Honda as the two
companies worked together over new models and fostered co-operative
manufacturing.
Although Rover and Honda exchanged board members, the arrangements for
collaboration under that level were loose.
Rover never had a group of people who spent all their time collaborating
with Honda. The role of Mr Bacchus was to facilitate contacts whenever they
were needed. And he has been making about 18 trips to Japan every year to
that end.
Another frequent visitor to Tokyo has been Mr Alan Curtis, managing director
of product supply at Rover and responsible for bringing new models to
market. But neither side ever had a permanent presence in the plants or
offices of the other.
At working level the Rover and Honda executives who came into contact most
frequently were the designers and engineers. Rover formed teams to undertake
projects and tasks. When the work was complete the team would be dissolved,
its members moving on to something else.
Practically, the collaboration of the two companies was done on an ad hoc
basis - 'as the need arose - interface at any level,' as Rover put it
yesterday. As an example Rover designers spent considerable time in Tokyo
when they were developing the 600 model.
The changes in Rover's manufacturing processes over the last 15 years have
been helped by a running series of visits to Honda factories, but executives
learned more from the Honda plants in the US than they did from those in
Japan. 'In the US you could see how the Japanese adapted to western
structures,' Rover explained.
The contacts have resulted in a growing network of executives across the two
companies accustomed to co-operating with each other, which has so far been
unaffected by the BMW purchase. 'Many friendships will continue regardless,'
said one Rover executive.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Rover and Honda - Going Their Own Ways: Few fears over other
link-ups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT, ANDREW TAYLOR and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that the breakdown of Rover's relationship with Honda could harm other
Anglo-Japanese joint ventures were played down yesterday by one of the few
other companies to enjoy a cross-shareholding in a Japanese corporation.
Allied-Lyons, the drinks, food and retailing group, said it did not expect
the Rover affair to have a significant affect on its links with Suntory,
Japan's largest whisky distiller and one of the country's biggest private
companies.
Since 1989, Allied-Lyons has been able to take advantage of a 1 per cent
holding in the privately-owned company to distribute its alcohol products in
the fiercely competitive Japanese market.
In turn, Suntory has taken a 4.3 per stake in Allied Lyons - worth about
Pounds 230m at yesterday's market price.
Under the 40-year joint venture agreement, signed in 1989, the two groups
agreed to set up distribution and marketing companies in Japan.
Allied-Lyons owns 51 per cent of the distribution group and 49 per cent of
the marketing company, with Suntory holding the remainder.
The Osaka-based group sells Allied-Lyons' products in its home market, while
the UK company distributes some Suntory products in North America.
Such links are rare because Japanese companies have usually opted for
outright control in the UK, often starting from greenfield sites. Toyota and
Nissan have built their own car plants, for example.
These investors may feel vindicated after the treatment meted out to Honda
but fears of a backlash against Japanese investment in the UK seems unlikely
given the Japanese preference for local ownership.
Most importantly they regard the UK as a vital manufacturing base to break
into European markets. It is unthinkable, therefore, that they might run
away at the first hint of trouble.
The priority given by Japanese companies to employee and trading
relationships with component suppliers has meant that a lot of time and
money has been committed during the last decade to establishing a large
presence in the UK.
In fact, the commitment in many areas is deepening as Japanese manufacturers
have gone beyond seeing the UK simply as a cheap production country and a
way to avoid trade friction when selling into European Union markets.
Komatsu, the construction equipment producer, manufactures hydraulic
excavators for the European market from its factory in Birtley, near
Newcastle.
When the plant began production in 1987 it was producing machines to
Japanese designs. It now has its own UK design team, making Birtley the
first Komatsu overseas plant to manufacture non-Japanese designed models.
Yamazaki, the world's largest producer of computer controlled machine tools,
also began manufacturing in the UK in 1987, supplying European markets. The
range of products built at the Worcester plant is now being expanded to
serve world markets instead of just Europe.
An example of 'high yen effect' is NSK Bearings in Peterlee, County Durham,
which recently secured its first orders from east Asia supplying bearings to
white goods manufacturers in China and Indonesia. These previously had been
supplied by NSK's parent in Japan.
Japanese property and construction companies, which also established wholly
owned operations in the UK, have fared less well. Companies like Kumagai
which bought expensively at the peak of the property market in the late 1980
are now seeking to retrench. But this is for reasons other than a breakdown
of relationships with British partners, as in the case of Honda and Rover.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Rover and Honda - Going Their Own Ways: Capable of producing
from the ground up - The loss of its Japanese partner does not necessarily
present a significant setback for the UK carmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A critical question faces Rover Group. How will it survive without Honda's
technology and expertise in the wake of their failed relationship?
Rover has 2,000 design, development and engineering staff. It has the
capability to take a car from first concept on a computer screen to
production, with no outside help. This capability includes the design,
development and production of engines and gearboxes.
Senior Rover executives insist that this capability has not been utilised to
the full during the period of Rover's 15-year partnership with Honda, for
straightforward commercial reasons rather than for any lack of technical
ability.
There is no logic, they maintain, in Rover developing wholly separate
vehicles or powertrains for market slots that can be occupied perfectly
adequately by shared development models enjoying good economies of scale.
And Rover's full technical capability will in any case be amply demonstrated
in new, as-yet secret, models already scheduled for production and in which
Honda has played no part, according to Mr John Towers, Rover's chief
executive.
That such core expertise has been retained by Rover is easily overlooked,
however, given that the UK car maker being sold to BMW appears to have been
so overwhelmingly dependent on Honda.
Two of Rover's key model ranges, the 600 and 200/400 saloons, are the
subject of simple licensing agreements with Honda or are joint developments,
while a key Rover gearbox is also a Honda design made under licence. All the
licence agreements can be terminated by Honda at three months' notice.
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, has indicated that BMW will be more
than willing to place some of BMW's own 6,000 engineers at Rover's disposal
as future new model plans develop without Honda.
'6,000 BMW engineers? - I don't know what we'd do with them,' said one Rover
executive yesterday. 'We are fully capable of seeing through our new car
projects.'
Where Rover executives and engineers, many of whom regret the loss of Honda
as a long-term partner, do see major benefits in BMW's ownership is in the
finan-cial resources that they expect to be made avail-able.
Currently Rover spends some Pounds 200m a year on new model development,
bringing cars into production and upgrading or maintaining plant and
equipment to build them.
This is a very small amount by mainstream motor industry standards, and Mr
Pischetsrieder has indicated that he would expect to see Rover increase it
to at least 7 per cent of its Pounds 4.3bn of annual sales, or slightly more
than Pounds 300m a year.
That would give Rover the ability to bring to fruition various new model
ideas which have been beyond its financial grasp.
'All car makers have more model ideas than finance, and so have to
prioritise what is actually built,' the company said yesterday.
Rover's design, research, development, and engineering facilities are more
extensive than many realise.
They are concentrated at Canley, near Birmingham, and at a vast, 900-acre
complex including 26 miles of test track at Gaydon in Warwickshire.
The Gaydon facility, currently employing 900 engineers and the subject of a
Pounds 100m-plus new building programme, includes: climatic wind tunnels,
prototype build centre, structural analysis facilities, electro-magnetic
compatibility centre to test car computer and wiring systems, component test
laboratories, noise, vibration and harshness analysis centre, engine test
beds and anechoic (sound-free) chambers.
It contains within it the capability to develop engines from scratch. It is
where Rover's state-of-the-art K series multi-valve engine was developed and
which in turn is being developed from a small-capacity four cylinder unit
into a full range of engines, including a V6, capable of powering almost any
vehicle Rover might make in the future.
Commercial logic once again dictates, however, that BMW and other
manufacturers' units are used instead in some applications, such as diesels,
where they can be simply taken 'off the shelf'. Peugeot diesels, for
example, are used in Rover 200, 400 and Metro ranges.
The Canley centre is occupied by some 1,000 designers and engineers, where
vehicles are styled from scratch, and where a master database of dimensions
and other elements is created off which Rover's and component suppliers'
project engineers can work.
However, one of the most valuable benefits Rover has gained from its long
relationship with Honda has been how to break down old barriers between the
various development departments and use simultaneous engineering to bring
products to market more quickly and with many fewer mistakes in the build-up
to production.
Honda has changed Rover's methodology radically, to the extent that new
vehicle projects are not even centred at Gardon or Canley, but at the plant
where they are to be built.
For the 600, for example, a project leader was appointed at the Cowley
manufacturing plant. He appointed a team and they 'lived' within just one
room while ideas for the car took shape. Gaydon and Canley personnel simply
became part of the project team.
It is this Honda-taught approach to development, costs and quality which
allowed Rover to take its Discovery four-wheel-drive model into production
in a record-breaking 21 months and is where, Rover executives acknowledge,
Rover's greatest debt to Honda lies.
Understandably perhaps, Honda is not anxious to see it all handed to such a
fierce rival on a plate.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Rover and Honda - Going Their Own Ways: Government comes
under pressure to intervene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was yesterday under pressure from some of its own
backbenchers to encourage Honda to continue its collaboration with Rover.
Angry calls for intervention from Tory MPs are likely to dismay ministers,
who only a few weeks ago were privately expressing relief that Rover's sale
to BMW had not caused a political row.
Sir Teddy Taylor, (Southend East), said: 'Honda has been treated shamefully.
A minister should now make a public statement saying the government regrets
the way the sale of Rover to BMW has been handled to alleviate the problem.'
Another senior backbencher said the Department of Trade and Industry 'should
start batting for Britain' by encouraging the Japanese to guarantee a
long-term working relationship with Rover.
However, Downing Street dismissed calls for intervention arguing that it was
not a matter for the prime minister.
It was made clear that Mr John Major hopes that co-operation will continue
between Honda and Rover, but does not share the 'apocalyptic vision' of
those who fear a speedy end to the relationship.
However, Mr Simon Coombs, (Swindon) warned that a decision by Honda to sever
all its links with Rover could prove very damaging.
Although Honda stressed that the 2,000 jobs at its plant in Swindon would
not be affected by its decision to sell its 20 per cent Rover stake, Mr
Coombs said an end to joint contracts would affect many of his constituents
reliant on Honda.
He has already asked Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, to find out why
there was no British company interested in buying the country's last car
volume manufacturer.
There is deep unease among backbenchers that Honda's decision to sell its
stake in Rover could herald the end of the relationship between the two
companies.
There is also concern that it could harm Britain's chances of continuing to
receive the biggest share of Japanese inward investment in Europe. The UK
accounts for 40 per cent of all Japanese European investment, according to
government figures.
'We now know that Honda are deeply distressed' said Sir Teddy. 'If its not
to have an affect on Japanese inward investment, the government must make a
statement'.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade and industry spokesman, called on
ministers to live up to their promise that Rover and its workforce would not
suffer from the BMW takeover.
'The danger for Rover is that customers will lose confidence and the
workforce will lose morale if the uncertainty is not ended swiftly,' he
said.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Bond markets rattled by US and Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN, TERRY BYLAND and JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's bond markets took another tumble yesterday, rattled by strike
threats from Germany's largest trade union and by the possibility of further
US monetary tightening.
Dealers said most of the selling came from professional traders in the
futures markets, while investors were reported to have remained on the
sidelines.
Although US markets were closed for a national holiday, traders reported
continued selling by US hedge funds, albeit at a less frantic pace than late
last week. Hedge funds - private pools of highly leveraged funds - were big
buyers of European bonds last year and have recently been reported to be
liquidating their holdings.
German government bonds dropped by almost a point after the country's
powerful engineering union, IG Metall, said it had called a strike vote in
Lower Saxony. Fears that a strike would be approved and spread to other
parts of northern Germany were used as an excuse for further selling amid
bearish sentiment.
The sell-off of European bonds began earlier this month when the US Federal
Reserve raised interest rates. Despite last week's round of European
interest rate cuts, bond markets remain dogged by fears that the end of the
global rally has come.
'It's a case of the end-of-cycle blues,' said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond
strategist at market analysis firm IDEA.
UK gilts fell by more than a point, dragged down by their European
counterparts. The long gilt futures contract on Liffe dropped by 1 3/32
points to close at 114 1/2 , having recovered from an earlier low of 114.
In the UK equity market, the FT-SE 100 index fell 32.3 to 3,350.3, with
losses intensified in late trading after reports of the German strike talks.
Although trading was subdued by the holiday closure in New York, the London
market found difficulty in holding on to the important 3,350 benchmark,
which was briefly lost just before the close of business. Hopes that
domestic interest rates can still be cut remained solid at first but were
bruised later when bond prices weakened afresh.
Other European equity markets eased under the pressure of falling bond
markets and fears of a further decline in Wall Street later today. In
Germany, the Dax index of the 30 most widely traded stocks fell 1.5 per
cent, while in France the CAC-40 index slipped 1.6 per cent.
Today the markets will be listening out for the comments made by Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, to Congress.

FT  22 FEB 94 / British Land buys into Stanhope: George Soros and John
Ritblat have moved to gain control of the Broadgate centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Land has acquired 29.9 per cent of the property company Stanhope, in
a deal aimed at giving Mr John Ritblat and Mr George Soros control of the
prestigious office development at Broadgate in the City of London.
The share price of Stanhope rose 14p, or 50 per cent, to 42p, on the
announcement.
The Stanhope stake will be transferred to the Pounds 500m British Land
Quantum Property Investment fund, the joint venture formed last June between
British Land and Mr Soros, the US investor who made massive profits betting
against sterling in the 1992 currency crisis.
British Land hopes to implement a financial restructuring which would leave
the fund with 100 per cent of the Broadgate Centre and the Ludgate office
development in the City, which are valued at close to Pounds 1bn, and leave
Stanhope as an independently managed company.
Stanhope announced in November that it was considering ways to strengthen
its balance sheet. In June 1993, it had negative net worth of Pounds 15.8m,
and its rental income has remained insufficient to cover its debt financing
and overheads.
Stanhope's main asset is its half share in the Broadgate development, next
to London's Liverpool Street station, which cost Pounds 2bn to build and
still carries Pounds 800m debt. Stanhope also holds pre-emption rights over
the remaining stake, which is in the hands of the receivers at Rosehaugh,
which collapsed in December 1992.
The company responded to the announcement with a statement that it intended
'to begin discussions with British Land to seek clarification of its
proposals for Stanhope'. Stanhope, which has been working on restructuring
plans, has been unenthusiastic about the prospect of selling off its prize
assets in their entirety. It said it would 'continue to assess, on their
merits, all the alternatives available to Stanhope, including any proposal
which British Land may make'.
Mr Ritblat, British Land's chairman, said: 'The best case scenario would
that we take out the Broadgate and Ludgate complexes from Stanhope and the
receivers, and we so organise it that Stanhope is solvent and able to return
to doing what it does best.' He wanted Stanhope to remain independent, and
British Land would not request board representation.
The Stanhope shares were part of Olympia &amp; York's 33 per cent stake, which
was taken on by the Bank of Nova Scotia. British Land is paying Pounds 1.64m
cash, and issuing 753,562 new shares at 440.5p, valuing the deal at Pounds
4.96m, compared with the Pounds 124m paid by O&amp;Y in 1988.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Small price to pay for prime seat: George Soros and John
Ritblat have moved to gain control of the Broadgate centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement that Mr John Ritblat's British Land has bought a stake in
Stanhope, a struggling developer, has turned the spotlight on Broadgate, the
City of London complex which is Stanhope's main asset.
For a small outlay, Mr Ritblat has won a seat at the negotiating table, from
which he intends to gain control of Stanhope's Broadgate assets.
The deal was greeted by analysts as a potentially important deal for British
Land. 'It looks as though John Ritblat is making sure that he either gets
Broadgate through the corporate route, or that he has a ringside seat
whenever it goes up for sale,' said Mr Chris Turner, director of research at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities.
'This is potentially another big hit by British Land,' says Mr Robert Fowlds
of Kleinwort Benson.
'Mr Ritblat is paying a small amount for potentially a slice of a Pounds 1bn
property.'
It is not yet clear whether Stanhope will play according to Mr Ritblat's
plans, although its alternatives appear limited.
Stanhope also appeared to query the validity of the stake acquisition by
drawing attention to the pre-emption rights belonging to Mr Stuart Lipton,
Stanhope's chief executive, by which he would have first refusal on the
shares that originally belonged to Olympia &amp; York.
If British Land succeeds in achieving its goal, the prize could be a
substantial one.
Stanhope owns a half share of Broadgate Properties, which owns six buildings
in the Broadgate Development, as well as the 600,000 sq ft Ludgate
Development on the western edge of the City of London.
It also has pre-emption rights over the other half, which is controlled by
the receivers of Rosehaugh.
Broadgate was one of the largest developments to be built in the 1980s.
At a ceremony during the building work in July 1986, Lady Thatcher, the
former prime minister, described it as the largest development in the City
since the Great Fire of London in 1666.
The Pounds 2bn development was successful in attracting the financial
services industry as it expanded in the aftermath of 1986's Big Bang. Its
large buildings, constructed to accommodate the computer cabling and
air-conditioning needed by large trading floors, succeeded in persuading a
workforce of some 20,000 to move to hitherto unfamiliar territory north-east
of the City.
Broadgate and Ludgate have been affected by falls in the London office
market, where values have fallen by two-thirds from the peak of the market
three years ago. Half of Broadgate has been sold, and the two are now worth
about Pounds 1bn.
Broadgate was a remarkably ambitious scheme for two small companies. Carried
out in partnership with the British Rail Property Board, it was conceived in
1983 by Mr Lipton and Mr Godfrey Bradman, both property entrepreneurs.
The key for such relatively insubstantial companies to build such a large
development lay in the use of non-recourse loans - commonplace in the US but
new to the UK. These allowed the borrower to confine the security of the
loan to specific assets, rather than the parent company.
Despite Broadgate's success in attracting prestigious tenants, it was not
enough to cushion its developers from the downturn which hit the industry in
1990. Rosehaugh was one of the first large property companies to signal the
coming problems, when it announced a Pounds 125m rights issue in 1990. Its
losses continued to mount and in December 1992 the company was put into
receivership.
Stanhope has struggled on, courtesy of its bankers. Its net assets fell from
Pounds 458m in 1990 to a minus Pounds 15.8m in June 1993. Asset values have
started to appreciate again, but the company has continued to suffer
operating losses and its existence remains contingent on the approval of its
bankers. Several months ago, it began work on a Pounds 160m restructuring
plan, which involved raising new funds and merging with its associate
Broadgate Properties. Analysts expected to see some results last month, but
progress so far has been limited.
British Land said yesterday that it intended to play a role in Stanhope's
restructuring plans. Mr Ritblat said, however, that he was not interested in
gaining control of Stanhope, or even in having board representation. 'Our
objective is to ensure that Stanhope remains independent,' he said. 'We
would not expect to play an active role in the company.'
In his view, the solution to Stanhope's problems is to sell Broadgate and
Ludgate - and in the process offload the large debt they carry.
'We want to stabilise Stanhope and provide some some seed capital. We know
what we want to do,' he said.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Rhone-Poulenc bids for French drug distributor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday
launched a FFr3bn (Pounds 340m) bid for Cooperation Pharmaceutique Francaise
(Cooper), a private company which is one of France's biggest distributors of
drugs and healthcare products to retail chemists.
The offer was described as 'attractive' by Cooper. It requires the approval
of shareholders, including 3,000 pharmacists who control about 40 per cent
of the equity.
The friendly bid is the first significant strategic move by Rhone-Poulenc
since its privatisation in November last year. It comprises a cash offer of
FFr2,400 per share in Cooper, or an exchange of each Cooper share for 18
Rhone-Poulenc shares.
The proposed deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions by
pharmaceuticals companies seeking to strengthen their presence in
distribution. Last year in the US, Merck bought Medco, a drugs mail order
company, and Gehe of Germany gained control of OCP, Cooper's principal
French rival.
Rhone-Poulenc said the acquisition would strengthen its position in France's
network of pharmacies. 'Cooper has very close links with pharmacies as
supplier and adviser and does business with 90 per cent of the 22,000
pharmacy outlets in France.'
Rhone-Poulenc and Cooper already have commercial ties. Cooper distributes
Doliprane, the paracetamol tablet which is Rhone-Poulenc's biggest selling
drug in France, and the Vaxigrip flu vaccine produced by the company's
Institut Merieux unit.
The offer price of FFr2,400 per share is equivalent to 17.7 times the
earnings per share achieved by Cooper in 1992 and twice the net asset value
of the shares. Cooper, founded in 1907, achieved sales of FFr1.8bn in 1992,
and an estimated FFr2bn last year.
Rhone-Poulenc said it had structured the offer to minimise the impact on its
balance sheet. Last year, the group's net debt was reduced by more than
FFr9bn, from FFr33.7bn to FFr24.1bn.
Rhone-Poulenc said it anticipated about half of the value of the offer would
be represented by the share exchange and there would be no significant
impact on earnings per share. The company's shares slipped yesterday,
however, falling FFr4.7 to FFr140.5.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Former London head of CSFB quits parent board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans-Jorg Rudloff, long-time head of Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) in
London, has left the Swiss CS Holding financial group 'to pursue personal
and family business interests', according to CS.
Mr Rudloff was one of the leading figures in London's international capital
markets throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He joined CSFB in 1980 and kept it
among the top Eurobond and equity houses in the City.
CS said it 'very much regretted' Mr Rudloff's resignation. No replacement
for him was announced.
His sudden move last March to Zurich to the executive board of CS Holding,
parent company of the whole financial group built around Credit Suisse, took
the financial community by surprise. He too seemed surprised, saying: 'You
can never pre-judge a board in Switzerland.'
His move came amid a drive by CS Holding to eliminate fierce rivalry between
its US and UK investment banking subsidiaries.
Mr David Mulford, a former US Treasury official and a vice-chairman of CS
First Boston in New York, replaced Mr Rudloff as chief executive of CSFB.
Three months later, Mr Archibald Cox, chief executive of the US operations
of CS First Boston, also resigned 'to seek other personal interests'.
It was also a time when the traditional Euromarkets business at CSFB in
London was being eclipsed by that of its thrusting derivatives affiliate,
Credit Suisse Financial Products, run by Mr Allen Wheat.
Mr Rudloff's only responsibility at the CS Holding board was to help Mr
Rainer Gut, chairman, with strategic planning. Friends suggested that while
he was a brilliant strategist, this was an assignment, not a job, and would
not satisfy a man with his energy.
A former CSFB colleague said that he would be very surprised if Mr Rudloff,
who is 53, was about to retire.
Mr Rainer Gut is to retire from the board of Elektrowatt, a Swiss electrical
generating company controlled by CS.
Elektrowatt said that Mr Gut wanted to concentrate on the group's core
financial businesses.

FT  22 FEB 94 / OFT to investigate safeguards in pre-payment of funerals
schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading launched an investigation yesterday into
Britain's growing pre-paid funeral business.
The inquiry follows the collapse last month of a Yorkshire-based company
running a pre-payment scheme and comes amid concern about the lack of
regulation of a business that could attract billions of pounds.
In the US, one funeral in seven is pre-paid, and pre-payment schemes have
won up to 40 per cent of the market in some states.
Pre-paid schemes currently account for 3 per cent of the Pounds 70m-a-year
funeral business in the UK. The OFT estimates 100,000 plans have been sold
and expects the market to expand to 150,000 a year.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said the financial
implications of the growth of pre-paid funerals were considerable. If 25 per
cent of the UK's 20 million people over the age of 50 eventually bought
plans worth about Pounds 1,000 each, the funeral companies' funds would be
holding Pounds 5bn.
These funds would not be regulated or safeguarded, he said. Proper
arrangements were needed to cover the appointment and powers of trustees and
the deployment of returns from investing pre-payments. The funds should be
kept separately from shareholders' funds.
It was also important to ensure that elderly and vulnerable people were not
sold over-elaborate schemes they could not afford, and that plans purchased
decades before a person's death were honoured or a refund paid to the
person's estate, Sir Bryan said.
The four main companies providing pre-paid funeral schemes - market leader
Chosen Heritage, Dignity, Golden Charter and CWS, the Co-operative Wholesale
Society - offer a variety of plans ranging in cost from about Pounds 750 to
more than Pounds 5,000. The average cost is Pounds 850 to Pounds 1,200.
The companies believe they already provide many of the safeguards the OFT is
looking for through two voluntary regulatory bodies.
Dignity and Chosen Heritage are members of the National Association of
Pre-Paid Funeral Plans, and Golden Charter and CWS co-founded the Funeral
Planning Council.
Both bodies are working on codes of practice covering pre-paid schemes and
demand that member companies hold pre-paid funeral fees in independent trust
funds with separate custodian trustees.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Embargo against Macedonia illegal, Brussels tells Greece
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday branded as illegal Greece's partial trade
embargo against Macedonia and warned that the Athens government risked being
taken to the European Court of Justice.
The warning came as Greece, which holds the rotating EU presidency, found
itself isolated at a European foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels.
Ministers deplored Greece's unilateral action against the former Yugoslav
republic and demanded an explanation.
Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greek minister for European affairs, pledged to
submit to Brussels a legal defence of the embargo shortly, and hinted that
it would be based on public security grounds. Mr Hans Van den Broek,
commissioner for external political affairs, is to visit Athens and the
Macedonian capital Skopkje, probably tomorrow and on Thursday.
He will attempt to mediate in the crisis caused by a dispute over
Macedonia's name and use of an ancient Greek symbol, the Vergina, on its
flag.
However, a Brussels official made clear that the commissioner would not
negotiate on the embargo. This was being tackled separately by the
Commission.
Greece last week banned the movement of oil and other goods through the
Greek port of Thessaloniki without informing or consulting its EU partners.
The partial embargo followed the US decision to extend diplomatic
recognition to Macedonia. This move seems to have prompted the Greek
Socialist government to harden its position - even at the expense of
alienating the European Commission and Greece's EU partners.
In Brussels yesterday, the Commission described the trade embargo as an
infraction of the Treaty of Rome providing for the free circulation of goods
inside the European Union.
At the foreign ministers' meeting, there were also signs that Athens' action
has weakened already fragile confidence in the impartiality of the Greek
presidency.

Funeral costs may rise sharply as crematorium managers are faced with
spending up to Pounds 100m in the next few years to meet new environmental
rules, funeral managers said yesterday.
They will also need to burn four to five times as much gas to reach the
temperatures specified in the new rules.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Land's agreement to buy a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope highlights
how Mr John Ritblat conjures up deals that no one else dreams possible. His
immediate intent appears to be to buy a cheap seat at the negotiating table
to influence Stanhope's restructuring. The longer term goal must be to prise
free the attractive Broadgate and Ludgate developments. Whether that is
possible depends on how well Mr Ritblat can arm wrestle with Stanhope's
bankers. He will have to convince them to take a painfully large debt
write-off to ensure Stanhope's future viability given the company is still
bleeding cash.
Stanhope has been trying to stage a rights issue to recreate its balance
sheet. But that is difficult when the biggest shareholders cannot afford to
inject fresh funds. British Land may hope to underwrite that rights issue in
return for access to Stanhope's assets. But Stanhope's puzzled response to
British Land's approach suggests the negotiations will be tortuous.

FT  22 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By the supercharged standards of recent media bids, Granada's offer for LWT
does not appear wildly generous, representing a multiple of a mere 27 times
historic earnings. LWT is trading strongly. There is a natural desire not to
sell out successful management. A higher bid is always possible, especially
if the rules regulating cross-ownership of the media are changed. Such
thinking may yet tempt LWT shareholders to reject Granada's bid.
Stand back from the fray and it is not clear that ITV contractors have a
particularly rosy future. In response to the Broadcasting Act, the cossetted
television industry woke up to commercial reality and cut costs with a
vengeance, fuelling the sector's striking share price gains. But that
process is exhausting itself. Growth will now be harder won through more
advertising and programming sales.
Yet ITV contractors are facing increasingly stiff competition for
advertising from Channel 4 as well as cable and satellite operators. Their
fixed-term franchises represent a depreciating asset. A secondary market for
their television programmes has not yet developed. There is an over-capacity
of production facilities. Mature television companies would be unlikely to
sustain current valuations in the absence of takeover frenzy.
The current wave of bids is being driven by the consolidation that occurs in
any industry when regulation is relaxed. In that process, insiders can
invariably afford to pay more than others due to the cost savings that can
be achieved. No other bidder has emerged to match Granada's terms. That is
perhaps not surprising, given Granada is offering twice the price LWT's
shares were trading at before the bidder took its stake. The real issue is
whether Granada is offering too, much rather than too little. LWT
shareholders should be grateful for its generosity.

FT  22 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: BMW/Honda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given how angry - and embarrassed - Honda must be, its rebuff to BMW may be
the least that it could decently get away with. Honda's collaborative
strategy in Europe has spectacularly collapsed, while Toyota and Nissan's
self-reliance has been vindicated. Daring to be different and then failing
must be doubly uncomfortable in a country where conformity is an art form.
Honda had to be seen to respond to the slight BAe delivered when it sold
Rover to the cheeky Bavarians. It also views BMW as a serious competitor,
particularly in North America. The prospect of BMW pitching up at Honda's
Swindon plant, displaying its 20 per cent shareholding in Honda UK and
demanding to see the books, must have caused a few sleepless nights in
Tokyo. But if severing equity links marks a clear change of strategic
direction and restores some lost face, commercial realities still demand
some connections. Replacing Rover's engine orders or cutting overheads by
enough to offset the lost volumes would be very difficult, especially given
the deep recession in Japan's car industry. Abandoning the jointly-developed
replacement for the Rover 200/400-Honda Concerto would also be very
expensive revenge.
However painful, the prospect is thus for continued operational involvement
between the two companies. That leaves BMW free to invest in developing Land
Rover and a new small car. Honda, having fallen behind its domestic rivals,
will have to spend heavily on beefing up its European presence. The lessons
of trying to co-operate with short-termist westerners are unlikely to be
lost on the rest of corporate Japan.

FT  22 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Unravelling bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something perverse about the weakness of European bond markets.
Inflation is well under control in the main European economies. The
continental recovery has barely started, while in the UK a sizeable output
gap remains. The weak oil price hardly indicates general concern about
inflation. The nervousness obviously reflects worry about the New York bond
market, but that is only part of the story.
There has also been a shift in sentiment among the large US hedge funds,
which until recently have given bond markets an upward momentum of their
own. Their leverage means they cannot afford much capital loss. It was time
for them to start worrying when yields stopped falling at the turn of the
year. The risks became all the greater after the Federal Reserve began to
tighten. Since then, a vicious circle appears to have developed: the more
bond prices fall, the more they are forced to sell.
Such fickle investors may have deluded governments about the ease with which
their deficits could be funded. Now comes the question of who will step into
the breach. Domestic European investors show no real signs of selling, but
they are reluctant to buy bonds yet because, probably rightly, they believe
prices could fall further before the hedge fund sales are absorbed. Once the
immediate storm is passed, judiciously timed cuts in short-term interest
rates would help continental markets. That would encourage investors to
shift out of time deposits, replacing some of the US liquidity which has
evaporated. It would be a pity if the Bundesbank were constrained by a false
concern that the bond market has been sending a message about inflation.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Clarke denies prejudicing trial: Disclosure would have put
at risk intelligence agents, chancellor says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke said yesterday he had served the national interest by
seeking to restrict information on Britain's intelligence services from a
court case involving arms exports to Iraq.
The chancellor told the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry that while home
secretary he had signed public interest immunity (PII) certificates that
barred intelligence officers from providing certain types of information to
the court in the Matrix Churchill case.
He said he did so after satisfying himself that full disclosure would have
'damaged' Britain's intelligence services and put at risk some of its
operatives.
He told the Scott inquiry: 'Once I decided that this type of information, if
disclosed, would be damaging to the intelligence services and it was not in
the public interest for this to be in the public domain, then . . . I had a
duty, and still think I have, to claim public interest immunity . . . '
Mr Clarke has threatened to resign if criticised in the judge's final
inquiry report. Yesterday, in a characteristically robust performance, he
refused to accept any personal culpability and insisted that the PII
certificates had not prejudiced the defence in the Matrix Churchill trial.
But Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade spokesman, said that Mr Clarke's evidence
raised new questions about the conduct of other ministers and the
government's legal advisers.
Mr Clarke said he considered that as minister he had discretion as to what
evidence should be covered by the PII certificates. Other ministers and
government lawyers have argued that ministers are obliged to sign such
certificates, and that it is for the attorney-general to decide whether to
sanction them. Mr Clarke said that he had in previous cases argued
successfully against government lawyers.
But he told the inquiry that Mr Michael Heseltine, as trade and industry
secretary, had signed a PII certificate in the Matrix Churchill trial on the
advice of Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, that all ministers were
duty-bound to do so.
Mr Heseltine's PII certificates covered advice to ministers from officials,
and communications between ministers. The defence in the Matrix Churchill
trial alleged that the documents proved that three businessmen charged with
breaching rules over exports to Iraq had done so with the approval of
government. One of the businessman had been recruited by the intelligence
services.
The trial collapsed after the defence convinced the trial judge that the
bulk of the documents covered by public interest immunity should be
disclosed. Mr Clarke said he had 'never known' of such an immunity being
sought by a minister to 'seek a conviction of an innocent man'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Poll vaults and politics: The man who made Mori
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is 25 years ago to the day that Mr Bob Worcester, an American with a
background in management consultancy, set out to pioneer 'strategic decision
research' in the UK. Four years later he formed Mori, which today is the
UK's largest independent research company. Tonight, leading figures from
British industry and politics will gather in London to applaud his
achievement.
His mission, in 1969, was to persuade British companies to find out, through
research, what their employees, their shareholders, and the public at large,
thought about them. He originated the mantra: awareness; involvement;
persuasion; action. In the intervening years he has worked for most of the
top hundred companies in the UK; for local authorities; for the government;
and, most famously, for the political parties. He has become, not
unwillingly, the public voice of British market research in general and
opinion polls in particular.
Mr Worcester did not find it hard to attract customers. 'I had three clients
in 24 hours.' He enjoyed an after-glow from former prime minister Harold
Wilson's 'white heat of technology': companies were caught up in the general
enthusiasm for innovation and new approaches to management, especially when
presented by an American who had worked for McKinsey, the US management
consultancy.
By providing British industry with empirical research on changes in consumer
tastes and public attitudes, Mr Worcester can claim a small but significant
part in helping business to respond more effectively to the developing
marketplace over the past 25 years.
If industry has gained so, too, has Mr Worcester. He has rejected all
takeover approaches for Mori and now controls a research company with a
turnover of Pounds 10m, employing 130 full-time staff and another 1,150
part-time interviewers in the field. In 1988 he cashed in on his success by
selling 25 per cent of Mori to 3i, the venture capital group, for Pounds 2m.
Though industry and the government provide the vast bulk of the work, it is
for his research in the political field that Mr Worcester is best known.
This amuses him because 'in an average year political polling accounts for 4
per cent of our turnover; in an election year it is 7 per cent', though his
influence in government is far greater than these figures suggest.
Within a year of his arrival in the UK he had introduced the Labour party to
private polling. He was soon a confidante of Lord Wilson. 'Harold was the
cleverest client I ever had. He got more out of me than anyone before or
since.' Mr Worcester did not always provide the Labour party with good news.
But he was employed for 17 years before becoming a casualty of the shake-up
introduced by Labour's then communications director Mr Peter Mandelson in
the mid-80s. Mr Worcester has since worked for Conservative Central Office,
but most of his energies go into political polling for the media.
Of course, opinion polls can get it wrong, most disastrously at the 1992
general election when the predicted Labour victory failed to materialise. Mr
Worcester has tried to learn from the experience; he has employed a
researcher to find out what went wrong. Mr Worcester's explanation for the
election debacle was that a late shift by voters, worried by Labour's tax
plans and the prospect of a hung parliament, won the day for Mr John Major.
He claims not to have lost a single client as a result of what he describes
as 'a black day for polling'.
Half of Mori's projects now come from the public sector, an indication of
the importance attached by ministers to research. Mr Worcester is currently
working for the Local Government Commission, finding out what people on the
ground want from the proposed re-organisation of local government. On one
recent occasion the commission chose to ignore Mori's findings and, Mr
Worcester says, paid the price when its recommendations were criticised by
the public.
Mr Worcester has survived as technology has advanced. Clients can now be
given data an hour after a questionnaire has been received for evaluation.
But, unlike the US, where most research is conducted by telephone, he
prefers face-to-face interviews because, at least in the UK, they are
cheaper and more comprehensive.
He sees growth abroad, mainly in India, Mexico and Brazil, where he has set
up joint companies. But it is in London that Mr Worcester has made his
greatest mark. Success to date has been based on exploiting relatively
narrow areas of corporate and political research, where he has benefited
from contacts in high places. As the international market research business
matures, he may find it harder to thrive in the bigger pond.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Honda climbs out of the front seat: A look at the end of a
special relationship between the Japanese carmaker and Rover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Honda took its minority equity stake in the Rover group four years ago,
it was the symbolic value - not the size of the stake nor the financial
valuation - that was crucial.
The 20 per cent holding was the cement in a relationship unique between
Japanese and European carmakers. It made the relationship long-term and set
it apart from any other collaboration the two groups might have had with
other rival carmakers at the same time.
Honda's decision yesterday to sever this equity link is just as crucial, and
just as symbolic. It says that the Honda-Rover special relationship is over.
The cement has crumbled.
When BMW emerged three weeks ago in London as the triumphant buyer of
British Aerospace's 80 per cent holding in Rover, Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder,
BMW chairman, voiced the pious hope that 'in this new scenario Rover Cars
will naturally continue its agreements with Honda in every respect'.
That hope was dashed yesterday.
The ending of the equity link at Honda's insistence removes, too, for the
foreseeable future any thoughts of a grander global alliance between Honda
on the one side and BMW-Rover on the other.
BMW has caused Honda seriously to lose face at home. Honda's European
strategy was different to that of its domestic rivals Toyota and Nissan. As
Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda president, admitted yesterday, the strategy had
been built to an important extent around collaboration with Rover, and is
now in tatters.
At the same time Honda and BMW are potent direct rivals in the world auto
market, particularly in the US, where Honda's separate luxury performance
brand, Acura, competes head-on with BMW. Both have built their brand images
on engineering excellence and high performance with a heavy accent on motor
sport.
Yesterday's events in Tokyo rule out any joint Honda-BMW alliance. What now
must be determined is the pace and manner of the disengagement of the
industrial links between Honda and Rover.
With frostiness, Mr Kawamoto said only that 'the series of contracts now
existing between Honda and Rover will be reviewed in future business
discussions.
'Until now our European strategy has included collaboration with Rover. In
the future we intend to create a more independent operation in Europe, using
our own resources.' The relationship was unmistakeably being reduced to only
a 'series of contracts'.
As far as Mr Pischetsrieder was concerned, yesterday's one-and-a-half hours
of talks had been conducted in a 'friendly' atmosphere. The coldness of Mr
Kawamoto's later public statement apparently came as a surprise to the
urbane BMW boss.
But there can be no excuse for any more surprises. Honda has spelled out its
unhappiness and anger at the takeover of Rover by BMW through the symbolic
cutting of the equity link.
Now it is time for the realpolitik. The most pressing questions are how long
should the Honda-Rover relationship take to disentangle, and how disruptive
should the process be to either party? Rover is now only a pawn in this
process. The decisions will be made in Tokyo and in Munich.
It is in Honda's power to disrupt very quickly a significant part of Rover's
car production, if it were to choose to invoke the three-month termination
clauses of its licensing agreements. These cover products such as the Rover
600 executive car - launched last year and produced at Rover's Cowley,
Oxford, plant; the Rover 400 family car, produced at Rover's Longbridge,
Birmingham, plant; and the Honda PG1 gearbox, which Rover produces at
Longbridge for fitting with its own 2-litre T-series engine in several of
its products.
While Honda so far has restricted itself privately to spelling out the
potential strength of the cards it has in its hands, BMW was at pains
yesterday to insist privately that it expected all Rover's existing projects
with Honda to continue. It would not be in Honda's commercial interest to
abandon them.
A similar view emerged yesterday from the all-important components suppliers
in Europe, which play a vital role in the success of both the Honda and
Rover operations, and which in many cases supply identical parts for the
Honda Concerto-Rover 200/400 and for the Honda Accord-Rover 600. They expect
existing programmes to continue.
'We don't feel unease at the moment, because we think it is highly unlikely
that Honda will enact a Domesday scenario,' said a leading components
supplier. 'But they will take it down over time. There is a lot of money
involved. They will not cut off their nose to spite their face.'
The sister cars Honda Accord and Rover 600 were only launched last year.
While Rover produces the 600 under licence at its Cowley plant, and Honda
produces the Accord at its own Pounds 370m Swindon assembly plant, the
supply programme is closely woven together with a largely identical supplier
base. At the same time, Honda supplies 2.0- and 2.3-litre engines for the
Rover 600 from its Swindon engine plant, while Rover supplies Honda with the
Accord's body panels from the Rover stamping plant at Swindon.
If commercial realpolitik dictates that the present generation Accord-Rover
600 programme is left undisturbed, this alone will ensure that the
Honda-Rover industrial links cannot be severed entirely yet.
More vulnerable to potential disruption could be the so-called project Rover
Theta-Honda HH. This is the new-generation family car Honda and Rover are
developing to replace the present Rover 200/400-Honda Concerto. The project
is already advanced and production is due to begin in the autumn.
Honda Europe said yesterday that many of its suppliers were 'already tooling
up and getting ready' to supply components for the car. Its Swindon plant
has 201 suppliers in Europe and many are also common suppliers to Rover.
'We would be very surprised if Honda pulls out of this programme given the
level of investment that has been made and how close they are to getting it
into production,' said another leading UK components supplier yesterday.
If Honda allows the Theta-HH programme to go ahead - Rover will produce its
version under a licensing agreement - the two companies will be forced to
maintain close ties beyond the year 2000.
The economics of the components supply programme and the economies of scale
also suggest that Honda cannot sensibly drop Rover quickly. Last year Rover
production of its 200/400 version of the current generation car totalled
162,095, compared to production of only 18,406 for the much less successful
Concerto. The new generation cars are likely to have a production ratio of
at least 1 to 4 in favour of Rover.
Other factors also suggest that current Honda-Rover projects - in production
and under development - will continue. The Japanese carmaker is still
relatively weak in Europe. Its total new car sales across 17 markets in west
Europe amounted to only 162,000 last year, giving it a west European market
share of 1.4 per cent compared with the 3.5 per cent of Nissan and the 2.8
per cent of Toyota.
At home, Honda is experiencing serious overcapacity, which could prove
expensive to redress in the middle of recession, where three successive
years of declining sales are sapping the company's finances. In the vital US
market, where the Accord was once all-conquering, the car has been knocked
from its perch as the best-seller. Honda is having to invest heavily in a
much more aggressive marketing campaign to try to halt the decline.
In Europe, Rover always represented a low-cost way into a market where Honda
was weaker than its Japanese rivals. It will now shut the door on the
transfer of technology to Rover, which will have to look to the lessons it
has already learned and to BMW to ensure that it stays on the path towards
becoming a world-class producer. Honda will drop Rover in the long run, but
the UK carmaker may still be able to secure a soft landing until Honda is in
a position to cut all links.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Now Tuzla and Mostar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So far, so good. The shelling of Sarajevo has been stopped. Nato has not
actually launched any airstrikes, but no one should doubt that its threat to
do so was necessary. Perhaps the Russian intervention was also necessary.
Certainly it made it much easier for the Serbs to comply (more or less) with
Nato's ultimatum without loss of face. But without the ultimatum and the
threat Russia would almost certainly not have intervened in this way, and
even if it had done so the Serbs would have been less likely to comply with
Russian requests.
As it is, the ultimatum has had to be interpreted creatively to make it
possible for General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander, to certify
compliance. The effectiveness of UN 'control' over weapons remaining within
the 20km-radius exclusion zone is uncertain. UN member states have
lamentably failed to provide General Rose with the 3,000 extra troops he has
requested, thereby continuing the pattern of irresponsibility which has
characterised all previous international 'action' in the former Yugoslavia.
France and Britain, the two leading contributors to the existing UN force
(Unprofor), have smugly refused General Rose's request, suggesting it is for
others to take a share of the burden. However justified this implied
criticism of the US, it is hardly a constructive response, nor is it
calculated to strengthen Atlantic solidarity in the next phase of the
crisis. Both countries should recognise that their national prestige and
interests are now irrevocably bound up with the UN operation in Bosnia. If
the operation fails for lack of manpower they may console themselves by
blaming the US, but it is they who will look most foolish.
Strategic significance
With luck, the ceasefire in and around Sarajevo will now hold, at least for
a time. The Serbs will probably move their weapons to other fronts of
greater strategic significance, such as Brcko and Bihac, where Bosnian
government forces are still in a position to threaten communications between
the Serb-held areas in Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia proper. But a ceasefire
does not in itself mean that the siege of Sarajevo is lifted - though that
was Nato's declared objective when it ordered the withdrawal of heavy
weapons.
Likewise, the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo would not relieve the
suffering in other parts of Bosnia, including many that the UN has
officially taken under its protection. In two of these (Srebrenica and
Tuzla) specific actions ordered, on pain of airstrikes, by last month's Nato
summit have yet to take place. And even the relief of all these places would
not bring peace to Bosnia as a whole.
Exploit momentum
So it is vital to exploit the momentum of the small success gained in
Sarajevo before it evaporates. General Rose was right to press ahead
yesterday with plans to open roads into and out of the city and to repair
water, electricity and gas supplies. He is right, and should be given the
fullest support by Nato and the UN Security Council, in seeking to extend
the Sarajevo model to other parts of Bosnia. Opening the airport at Tuzla,
through which desperately needed food, medicine and shelter could be brought
to more than 1m civilians in central Bosnia, is an obvious priority. But the
plight of Mostar, which is worse than that of Sarajevo, must not be
forgotten.
The Serbs are not the only villains in this war. It is Croat forces, with
active support from the Croatian regular army, that have destroyed the
historic bridge of Mostar and are still raining down shells on the Moslem
population trapped on the east bank of the Neretva. President Franjo Tudjman
of Croatia, a protege of Germany and the Vatican, has still given no
indication that he will withdraw his troops from western Hercegovina. An
ultimatum to the Croats around Mostar would be amply justified, would
involve fewer political risks than that to the Serbs around Sarajevo, and
would make it easier to maintain Russian support for a policy of firmness
towards the Serbs.
It is good, too, that US and Russian officials are meeting with those of the
EU and UN in Bonn today, to push forward the diplomatic process. Only if the
US, Russia and Germany are very firm in urging concessions on their
respective proteges in Bosnia is there any hope of peace.

OK. So Honda's decision to sever its links with Rover might make life more
difficult for BMW, Rover's new owner. But don't underestimate what attracted
BMW in the first place. Its 3, 5 and 7 series meld perfectly with Rover's 2,
4, 6 and 8 series . . . Sounds like a perfect fit rather than a calculated
gamble.

When John Russell, Rover's international sales chief, looked into the mirror
first thing yesterday morning it was to practise his address to the FT's
London motor conference. What he should have been taking was a crash course
in damage limitation. Before he had even got up to speak, news hounds were
thrusting microphones under his nose. Forget the guff about customer
satisfaction - what did Russell think of the shock news from Japan? 'I felt
like the drama critic who went to describe a play and wound up reporting the
shooting of the president,' says a bruised Russell.

The race is on for the top editorial job at Le Monde, the venerable French
daily paper. Jacques Lesourne, who resigned earlier this month after months
of wrangling over cost-cutting, was the first non-journalist ever to hold
the post of publisher.
Although Lesourne managed to cut Le Monde's heavy losses, he was unable to
tame the paper's rather eccentric team of journalists. No surprise then to
see Le Monde returning to its old form. The two candidates for the top job
are both journalists - Bruno Frappat, editorial director, and Jean-Marie
Colombani, his deputy, who has bid for the post before.
Le Monde wants to avoid a repetition of the six-year-long power struggle
which preceded Lesourne's appointment in early 1991. In the past, the
paper's staff has chosen its candidates in Swiss-style primary elections.
This time the management dispensed with that formality and asked its own
candidates to stand. The journalists will choose between Frappat and
Colombani on March 4.
On past form, the management succession seems unlikely to proceed as
smoothly as the timetable suggests.

BAT Industries doesn't seem to be having much luck hanging on to the
investment chieftains of its Allied Dunbar insurance operations.
First Hugh Jenkins (a Welshman) jumps ship to run the investment side of the
Prudential. Now Ken Inglis (a Scot) is off to rejoin his old countrymen at
Flemings, despite being offered the prize of running the much bigger
combined Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar fund management business.
Surely, a politically incorrect company like BAT can tell its headhunters
that only English fund managers will be considered for the vacant post of
its investment supremo.

Just how far will US President Bill Clinton go to mend fences when he meets
Britain's prime minister next week? After the rows over Ireland and Bosnia,
there is plenty of groundwork in need of urgent repair.
An invitation to sleep for one night in the White House sounds jolly
generous, especially since the last British prime minister to do it was Sir
Winston Churchill. But the US administration's eagerness to rebuild the
special relationship has its limits - notably supporting the UK's nominee
for the head of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
Major put Lord Lawson up for the job, but word is that Washington, which
picks up much of the tab for the Pounds 125,000-a-year post, is preparing to
veto that idea.
The Americans believe that the OECD, after a decade in the hands of the
monetarists, would benefit from a secretary-general who made economic
growth, not obsessive control of inflation, his priority. Clearly no one
told them about the Lawson boom.

Is Merrill Lynch a contrarian indicator for trends in UK government
securities? When the US securities house pulled out of the gilts market in
the late 1980s because the latter was overcrowded and unprofitable, it had
to sit on its hands and watch a really spectacular bull run.
Now, just as it has been granted permission to become a gilt-edged
marketmaker once again, the market is suffering a serious bout of weakness.
No doubt this time round, though, Merrill has had to reassure the Old Lady

FT  22 FEB 94 / Observer: Hot wires in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese don't normally scribble on other people's walls, especially in
Tokyo. So when the local headquarters of the US electronic giant Motorola is
sprayed with an anti-US slogan, people stop and stare.
Not that yesterday's anti-Motorola graffito, sparked by a US threat to
impose sanctions on Japan unless Motorola is treated better, is in
particularly bad taste. In typical Japanese style, it amounts to no more
than a polite cough by US or even European standards. 'Crush the
hard-selling diplomacy of US imperialists . . . ', it reads. Tokyo has not
yet resorted to the tactics of America's Japan-bashers in earlier trade
disputes. Sledgehammers have not been taken to Motorola's mobile phones.
Still, tempers are clearly beginning to hot up in the nine-year-old trade
dispute, despite Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's contention that Japan
and the US have just embarked on a truly adult relationship.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Dinosaurs eye the PIA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stakes in the tortuous game of bluff and double bluff that the
Securities and Investments Board (SIB) has been obliged to play with the
more recalcitrant members of the life assurance industry were raised a
further notch yesterday. In responding to a formal application from the
Personal Investment Authority (PIA) to become the new unitary
self-regulatory organisation for the retail investment business, SIB
simultaneously announced that it was 'minded to recognise' the PIA and
'minded to revoke' recognition of two existing retail investment watchdogs,
Fimbra and Lautro.
Behind the legal jargon lies a difficult set of calculations both for the
regulators and the life assurers. The PIA has to achieve widespread support
before Mr Andrew Large, head of SIB, can obtain the Treasury's permission to
recognise the new unitary watchdog and bring down the curtain on its two
predecessors. Yesterday's publication of a prospectus inviting applications
to join the PIA constituted a formal start to this process.
The task is a formidable one, and not just because a handful of big insurers
are hostile. If the PIA's claim to raise standards in retail financial
services is to carry conviction the new body will have to reject
applications from people who are currently authorised to conduct investment
business. That is not a recipe for popularity in the industry. Nor should it
be.
Meantime the recalcitrants, who rank the Prudential and Standard Life among
their number, have to ask what they can achieve by continuing to oppose the
changes to the existing regime. They would also be well advised to ensure
that a dignified means of retreat is available if their arguments fail to
carry the day. Or, indeed, if they succeed. Treasury ministers may not
relish being railroaded into unwelcome policy options, any more than big
insurance companies enjoy changing their ways to suit the regulators.
Repeated scandals
Part of the problem is that many opponents of the proposed new structure
start from the assumption that they were promised self-regulation under the
original 1986 Financial Services Act regime and are still entitled to it.
This is hopelessly unrealistic in the light of repeated scandals to do with
the industry's sales practices. Public confidence has been severely dented
and will not be restored without some clear indication that the system is
being significantly strengthened. Against that background the special
pleading from leading practitioners about a surfeit of public interest
representatives on the PIA's board is a public relations disaster which
undermines the credibility of the whole industry.
Genuine alternative
Nor does it help to suggest that statutory regulation provides a genuine
alternative to the problem. In the long run it may or may not do: but there
is a crisis in the here and now, and one which urgently needs to be
addressed. To suggest that consumers of financial services should be allowed
to wait for several years while a statutory alternative is put in place
looks, at best, disingenuous. At worst it risks being interpreted as an
attempt by the life assurers to make hay for as long as possible before the
whistle is blown.
A unitary retail watchdog makes sense in a financial world where the
organisational boundaries between banks, insurers and other managers of
personal savings have become anachronistic. There are undoubtedly
shortcomings in the present process of accountability to parliament. It
remains to be seen how effective a watchdog the PIA might become. And there
will no doubt be arguments about specific elements of the PIA's prospectus
and its accompanying document on the new body's approach to regulation.
But only an industry suffering from extreme myopia would fail to recognise
that SIB's current approach is the only half-decent damage limitation
exercise on offer. The hostile insurers do no service to their shareholders,
policyholders or the general public by failing to offer their support. They
should wake up and shut up. The PIA is better than an interminable wait for
an ideal system that may or may not materialise in the year 2000.

Sir, Re your story on the Skye toll bridge ('Tolls will be steep on the high
road to Skye', February 10) it must be stressed that the agreement with the
developer is '. . . that the actual duration of the toll period would be the
period which results in the collection of tolls with a net present value of
Pounds 23.6m discounted back to December 1990 at a real interest rate of 6
per cent or 27 years, whichever period is the lesser'.
A 15-year period is based on the most optimistic traffic growth forecast and
has credibility only as propaganda with apologists for the high-toll regime.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Greece being too quickly criticised
over Macedonia (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN CHUDLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Greek disgrace', should be entitled 'European disgrace'.
It is two short months since Greece's so-called partners in Europe rushed
with indecent haste to recognise 'Macedonia' in a crude attempt to pre-empt
the issue before Greece's presidency of the EU, in the full knowledge that
it had been a leading factor in the electoral downfall of the moderate
former prime minister, Constantine Mitsotakis.
Led by Germany, with a long history of disastrous meddling in the Balkans,
and abetted by Britain and France, which ought to know better, they left the
Greek government with no option other than a dramatic gesture if it was to
retain credibility.
To complain now that this may rock the position of the 'moderate' Gligorov
and to introduce Bulgaria into the argument is pure sophistry.
Your leader writer, in company with most of Europe's leaders, shows no
sensitivity to the painful 150-year struggle of Greece to put back together
the ideal of Hellenism after nearly 2,000 years of subjugation to Roman,
Venetian, Frankish and Turkish invaders, or to the importance to them of
Philip of Macedonia, his son Alexander the Great, and Vergina, his
birthplace.
May I ask how the Scots would feel about the Faroe Islands (with about the
same justification) taking the name of the Republic of Scotland, using the
stone of Scone on its flag and having a clause in its constitution requiring
its government to involve itself in the protection of Scots wherever they
may be.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Peace talks with Mexican rebels to start today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Peace talks between the Mexican government and the Zapatista rebels are
scheduled to begin today, in an effort to persuade the rebels to end
formally a conflict which began on January 1 with the seizure of half a
dozen towns in the southern state of Chiapas, reports Damian Fraser in San
Cristobal de las Casas.
However, there were few indications yesterday of an early agreement as
significant differences remained between the two sides. The peace talks are
to take place in the cathedral of San Cristobal de las Casas, in Chiapas.
Yesterday, Zapatista delegates, including Sub-commandant Marcos, the rebels'
military strategist, arrived in San Cristobal. They will spend the night
there before starting negotiations with Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, the
government's peace envoy.
A truce has held for more than five weeks but the continuing presence of
armed Zapatistas has destabilised Chiapas, displaced an estimated 20,000
people from their homes, and inspired opposition to the government
throughout the country.
Sub-commandant Marcos said that the Zapatistas would only lay down their
arms after the government had enacted national democratic reforms and agreed
to broad political autonomy for regions of Mexico populated by indigenous
people.
He suggested that, while such changes were not made, the Zapatistas would
not sign a peace accord.
Mr Camacho said that he could not negotiate with armed rebels on such issues
and that to do so would not guarantee peace in Chiapas. 'A solution that is
only aimed at the Zapatista army would destabilise Chiapas. There has to be
a solution that satisfies the Zapatista army but also meets the concerns
that are fundamental for other sectors,' he said.
The government seems to intend to offer rebels some land, greater economic
aid for the region, and perhaps changes among some local political leaders.
Mr Camacho believes that any further concessions might undercut support
within the government for the peace process and lead to a conservative
backlash.
'These negotiations will be very difficult. These are people who took the
decision to begin an armed struggle and for whom political negotiation is a
total change of strategy,' Mr Camacho said.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Support for Balladur slips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Support for Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has fallen below
50 per cent for the first time since he took office last March, according to
a poll published yesterday, John Ridding reports from Paris.
The IFOP poll, in the weekly Journal du Dimanche, showed the percentage of
voters satisfied with Mr Balladur had fallen by nine points to 47 per cent
over the past month. The proportion of dissatisfied voters increased by 10
points to 43 per cent.
This followed other polls of the past few weeks which have shown a decline
from an unusually high approval of more than 60 per cent. They appear to
reflect concerns about the government's failure to curb the rise in
unemployment, as well as specific issues such as the fishermen's strike this
month.
Political analysts pointed out that support for Mr Balladur remains high,
compared with previous French prime ministers and his international
counterparts.
The decline in his popularity, however, has given heart to political
opponents. Mr Michel Rocard, Socialist party leader, who trails Mr Balladur
in the polls, said the political left would be in a position to challenge
the prime minister in presidential elections, due in May next year.
In an interview with Le Figaro, Mr Rocard said the prime minister had failed
to provide a vision for where France would stand in 10 years. Mr Balladur
has also faced criticism within the his own centre-right RPR-UDF coalition
government because he is seen as not doing enough to revive the economy.
A package of fiscal measures to boost the economy were announced at the end
of last month and criticised as timid by some members of the RPR. Public
discontent over Mr Balladur's failure to check unemployment of 12 per cent
has also been rising after initial satisfaction with his crackdown on crime
and firmness in world trade talks. Riots by fishermen this month have been
cited as a sign of simmering anxiety.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Kohl tries to rouse the party faithful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl today faces one of the greatest challenges of his
long career in German politics: to persuade his own Christian Democratic
Union to shake off a mood of deep pessimism and believe that it can win the
general election in October.
The odds are against him. Some 1,000 delegates will assemble in Hamburg for
the three-day party conference to launch an eight-month marathon election
campaign. The CDU is trailing behind the rival Social Democratic party (SPD)
in the opinion polls, and Mr Kohl's own popularity stands even lower.
The latest poll by the Allensbach institute put the CDU and the Christian
Social Union (CSU), its Bavarian sister party, on a combined 35.1 per cent
in both halves of the country, against 40.9 per cent for the SPD. As for the
chancellor's personal rating, it stood at 26 per cent last week, against 35
per cent for Mr Rudolf Scharping, the youthful challenger leading the SPD.
A large majority of electors now expects a change of government in October,
and even in the ruling parties there is no majority in favour of maintaining
the current coalition between CDU, CSU and the liberal Free Democratic party
(FDP).
Reports from local party organisers around the country suggest gloom about
Mr Kohl's prospects, not only for re-election as chancellor in eight months,
but also for the CDU to stage a comeback in a string of local and state
polls over the intervening months.
Yet Mr Kohl is clearly intending to rely on his own irrepressible
self-confidence, and an attitude of extraordinary calm and composure, to
shrug off all fears of defeat in the coming months.
In two interviews last week, he showed a refusal to pay attention to the
polls, or to national pessimism about the economic recession and rising
unemployment.
'We must not let ourselves be blown off course by every contrary breeze,' he
told the daily newspaper Die Welt. 'I see no reason for pessimism or
fatalism. . . Everybody is preaching about this lousy mood in the country,
but I refuse to let myself be infected by it.'
The Allensbach opinion poll also showed one other key trend in Mr Kohl's
favour: voters are starting to drift back to the main parties - both SPD and
CDU - from the protest parties. The extreme right-wing Republicans showed a
drop in support of almost half, from 4.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent, and the
Greens showed a fall from 10.2 per cent to 9 per cent. The SPD was up four
percentage points on the previous poll in December, and the CDU by two
points.
In spite of a large grumbling minority within the CDU about Mr Kohl's lack
of direction in his leadership, and his own unpopularity, no one expects any
serious attempt at a coup against him at the party conference.
The official aim is to endorse a new basic political programme for the
party, its first new draft since 1978, and in particular, the first for a
unified Germany.
There could still be mildly stormy debates about Europe - should the word
'federal' be applied to European integration or not - about the environment,
and about family policy.
Some want the party to be committed to a new goal of an ecological economy
as well as the traditional 'social market'.
There is a controversial move to introduce a new tax on the childless, to
help finance the soaring cost of old-age pensions.
The whole affair, however, is about how to win the next elections. The new
party programme is called 'Freedom and Responsibility'. Yet the real party
programme is called quite simply 'Helmut Kohl'.
As the Cologne Stadt Anzeiger newspaper said last week: 'With Kohl, many
admit it will be difficult to win. Without him, they know the election is as
good as lost already.'
A new protest party has attacked Mr Kohl for his pro-Europe stance on the
eve of the CDU congress. The Alliance of Free Citizens said the CDU was
anti-constitutional in striving for a European Federation. Mr Manfred
Brunner said Mr Kohl had signed a death sentence on the D-Mark.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Arkady Volsky, chief of a Russian industrialists' and entrepreneurs'
union, called at the weekend for western capital to support what he called
the new government's attempts to restore 'basic organisation' to the economy
in order to continue reforms.
Mr Volsky, a close associate of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister,
who has called for 'non-monetary' means to fight inflation and more state
intervention in the economy, denied Russia lacked the right political and
economic conditions to receive large-scale financial assistance.
He also called for 'international compensation' to Russia for 'billions of
dollars' it had lost because of its adherence to sanctions against the
former Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya.
Mr Chernomyrdin has continued to issue conflicting signals about the
intentions of his new economic team of former industrial managers. 'They are
scared of being blamed for fuelling inflation. They do not know what to do.
They have made promises but no decisions,' said one reformer still in the
government.
On Friday, Mr Chernomyrdin signed a document bringing closer a controversial
monetary union with neighbouring Belarus. Although the terms of the proposed
union have yet to be made public, this project will inevitably mean
increased pressure on Russia's finances.
In an attempt to lessen the burden of neighbouring republics, Russia last
year cut energy supplies to the Commonwealth of Independent States by 40 per
cent for oil and 25 per cent for gas, according to official figures
published yesterday.
Mr Chernomyrdin also reassured Ukraine that Russia had no desire to take
back the Crimean peninsula after Crimea's new president, who has promised a
referendum on reunification with Russia, asked a former Russian deputy
premier to head his government.
Pending a speech next Thursday, when President Boris Yeltsin is expected to
clarify whether he endorses Mr Chernomyrdin's economic policy shift, the
Russian prime minister has also issued instructions to make it more
difficult for ailing companies to be declared bankrupt.
As well as trying to attract western investment to ailing enterprises, Mr
Chernomyrdin is desperately trying to persuade the International Monetary
Fund to unlock a new Dollars 1.5bn loan to help him support new budget
expenditure. Mr Volsky's open letter is clearly designed to aid those
efforts.
In a sign of some continuing western efforts to support Russian reforms,
Russia's privatisation ministry, headed by the only senior radical left in
the government, unveiled a service providing free capitalist expertise to
help managers of privatised enterprises.
Advisers provided by leading western companies will assist with business
plans, rationalisation and cost cutting programmes, as well as staff
training, and searching for foreign investors.

Defence Minister Lajos Fuer will lead Hungary's main governing party, the
Hungarian Democratic Forum, into elections in May, AP reports from Budapest.
Mr Fuer was elected the new president of the forum in a vote late on
Saturday at the party's congress. The forum is the leading party in the
conservative coalition government, whose popularity is slipping because of
economic troubles.
Mr Fuer, 55, a historian, was the sole candidate. He won 685 of 729 ballots
cast.
He was arrested by Russian troops after the suppression of the 1956 revolt
and briefly interned. He was a founding member of the forum and has been a
member of its national presidium since 1988.
'I will continue the policies of the late prime minister Jozsef Antall,' he
told the delegates. Antall, who died in December of cancer, held both the
party chairmanship and premiership.
His successor as premier, Mr Peter Boross, said he did not want both posts.
Mr Fuer told the three-day congress that his party has a chance of 20 to 30
per cent of the votes in the parliamentary elections.
Recent opinion polls have indicated that the forum would gain only 8 per
cent of the vote. The Socialist party is leading the polls, with 18 per
cent.

One of Sweden's leading commercial banks, will confirm a strong recovery
from the country's banking crisis when it unveils its 1993 results tomorrow.
The bank, which was less badly hurt by the crisis than its rivals, is
expected to rebound to an operating profit of between SKr1.8bn and SKr2.1bn
(Dollars 265.8m), compared with a SKr840m loss in 1992. Higher revenues,
cost-cutting and reduced credit losses have spurred the turnround.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Metallgesellschaft affair will loom large again this week. Tomorrow Mr
Kajo Neukirchen, brought in last December as chief executive of the troubled
metals, mining and industrial group, will hold his first press conference
since he took over. Renowned as a no-nonsense restructuring expert, he is
expected to announce big job-cuts as well as the sale of some of the group's
258 subsidiaries. On Thursday the company will hold a special shareholders'
meeting at which Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director who is also
MG's supervisory board chairman, is likely to explain the background to the
near-collapse of the company. Chief to explain strategy, Page 19

MONDAY 21
German strike ballot
The national executive of IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, meets
to decide in which region it will hold a strike ballot, with the intention
of calling a strike in early March. Baden-Wurttemberg and North
Rhine-Westphalia are the most likely contenders. Yet there are still hopes
for a negotiated solution to the dispute concerning pay and conditions, with
engineering employers seeking drastic cost cuts.
North Korea
Today is the deadline for North Korea to permit inspection of its nuclear
facilities. An eleventh-hour agreement with the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) means that there will be no immediate clash with the UN
Security Council. North Korea's last-minute compliance ensures that it will
not be accused of violating the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty at an IAEA board of governors' meeting today.
European Union foreign ministers meet in Brussels to discuss the Balkan
crisis and the enlargement of the union. Member states are expected to use
the meeting to lodge further protests at Greece's recent decision to
blockade Macedonia. Meanwhile the foreign ministers will also be seeking to
hammer out more details in the enlargement negotiations, in advance of the
special EU council meeting on enlargement next weekend. EU agricultural
ministers also meet today.
Euro Disney's 60 banks receive the final version of an investigative audit
of the troubled leisure group's finances from KPMG Peat Marwick, the
accountancy firm. A meeting with Euro Disney will then be arranged to start
negotiations about its emergency financial restructuring. The banks last
week discussed preliminary proposals for restructuring with executives of
Euro Disney and Walt Disney.
EU networks about to extend: The European Union's ambitious trans-European
networks initiative, which aims to develop telecommunications, energy and
transport networks spanning the region, takes its next step forward today .
Mr Henning Christophersen (above), economics commissioner, chairs the second
meeting of a taskforce consisting of senior officials from member states.
The group will consider which transport and energy projects should be given
priority and various options for finance.
Holidays: US, President's Day holiday. Federal government offices closed.
TUESDAY 22
Greenspan on policy
Mr Alan Greenspan,the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, gives his
bi-annual address to Congress on the state of the economy and current
central bank monetary policy. He is likely to be grilled about his decision
to raise interest rates on February 4. It was the first tightening of US
monetary policy in five years, and some in Congress criticised the decision
as likely to hinder, not help, the economy.
Gatt and the environment: In Geneva, the governing council of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade debates the link between trade and the
environment. The ministerial meeting in Marrakesh on April 12-15, to set the
course of Gatt's future work on the issue, is uppermost in trade diplomats'
minds. Greens say trade rules need changing to secure environmental goals;
developing countries fear greenery cloaks protectionism.
UK revised GDP figures will be watched closely by the markets, in the wake
of last week's disappointing economic statistics. Traders are likely to see
any downwards revision from the earlier estimate of a 0.7 per cent rise in
1993's fourth quarter as a sign that the recovery is faltering.
Women priests in prospect: The general synod of the Church of England meets
in London for a final debate on the legislation to permit the ordination of
women priests. If, as is almost certain, the synod approves the legislation
the first women to become priests will be ordained before Easter.
Giovanni Goria goes on trial: Former Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Goria
(left), a Christian Democrat, goes on trial for alleged corruption in Turin.
Mr Goria resigned as finance minister because of his alleged involvement in
irregularities in a savings bank scandal. More than 50 deputies and senators
and 1,000 senior politicians and businessmen were investigated.
Mr Geidar Aliev, only member of the Brezhnev-era Politburo to have survived
as a leader in the post Communist era, arrives in Britain with a large
demand and a large promise. The demand is that Armenia be recognised as an
aggressor against Azerbaijan after the forces from the Armenian-populated
enclave of Nagorno Karabakh within Azerbaijan captured swathes of Azeri
territory. The promise is of exploitation rights, for BP among other large
oil companies, of reserves in the Caspian sea off Baku which has the oil
industry entranced and the more enthusiastic of the Azeris talking of a new
Kuwait.
WEDNESDAY 23
Kohl to galvanise CDU
Mr Helmut Kohl, the man who brought Germany unification, continues his
Christian Democratic Union's election campaign at the party conference in
Hamburg. He must galvanise his party and revive its spirits in the face of
economic recession and a slump in electoral support across the country. The
question is whether Mr Kohl, with his very considerable political experience
and cunning, can reverse the downward trend in the polls. His hopes rest on
three things: a recovery of the German economy; the desire of electors to
return to the familiarity and security of the ruling coalition at national,
rather than local, elections; and his own ruthless political instincts in a
frantic election year. There are 19 separate elections ahead, leading up to
the general election on October 16. The conference ends today.
Zhu Rongji starts tour of Japan: The Chinese vice premier (left) begins a
nine-day official visit to Japan, to meet Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister,
and other leaders. He is the first senior Chinese leader to visit Japan
since prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa took power last August.
Han Sung-joo, South Korean Foreign Minister, visits Mexico in the course of
what was originally planned as a trade trip in connection with the creation
of the North American Free Trade area. .
Race relations relaunched: Mr William Waldegrave, minister for public
service, and Mr Herman Ouseley, chairman of the Commission for Racial
Equality, will launch a new look for Britain's race relations organisation.
The CRE will adopt Citizen's Charter service standards and a new structure
in an attempt to provide improved services to members of ethnic minority
communities.
Fresh Guildford Four appeal: Paul Hill, 38, from Belfast, starts his appeal
against conviction for killing a soldier in Belfast in 1974. Mr Hill has
been on bail since the Guildford Four were released in October 1989. His
appeal against conviction for murdering a former soldier, Mr Brian Shaw, in
1974 will be heard by the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Brian Hutton, Lord Justice
MacDermott and Mr Justice McCollum.
THURSDAY 24
Anxiety at Yeltsin address
Boris Yeltsin is to address both houses of parliament, an event postponed
from February 18 because the Russian president was suffering from a cold.
His speech will now be heard with special attention as concern mounts
throughout the international community regarding the president's stamina.
His words will be especially scrutinised for indications of exactly how he
intends to maintain the progress of economic reform.
More US economic data are published today, providing further evidence of
whether or not the economic expansion is continuing this year. Figures
include durable goods orders and durable shipments in January, and initial
unemployment claims, state benefits, and weekly money supply statistics.
Romanian unrest intensifies: The farmers' union Agro-Star plans a one-day
strike in protest at government agricultural policies and the poor
administration of state farms. Romanian airport workers plan a one-hour
strike in support of wage claims tomorrow. Romania's three main labour blocs
strike on February 28 to back demands for a change of government. Last week
President Ion Iliescu met leaders of the Alfa trade union movement, one of
Romania's three main labour blocs.
Discontent has grown steadily among the 23m Romanians, fuelled by inflation,
since the one-party communist state collapsed in December 1989.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin ends his four-day official trip to Spain and
Portugal, hoping to persuade them to influence more Arab states to make
peace with Israel.
Tokyo court bribery hearing: Tokyo District Court holds its first hearing on
the alleged bribery case involving former Miyagi governor Shuntaro Honma and
executives at Daishowa Paper. Daishowa Paper is the country's second largest
paper manufacturer. The defendants include Mr Ryoei Saito, (above) honorary
chairman of Daishowa Paper, notorious for his desire to be buried alongside
his collection of Impressionist paintings. The arrest of Mr Saito, 77,
followed allegations that he authorised a Y100m (Pounds 630,000) payment to
a governor who approved a Daishowa-linked golf course and housing complex.
UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata visits Mbabane in Swaziland
to assess the situation with regard to refugees from Mozambique (until Feb
27).
FRIDAY 25
Greens seize protest role
In Mannheim, the German Greens begin their two-day party conference. The
Greens will be seeking to launch themselves as the main party of protest
against the political establishment in this marathon election year.
Moroccan unions take action: A Moroccan federation of unions plans a 24-hour
strike today to protest at the government's continued refusal to participate
in talks. A similar strike in December 1990 caused riots in several cities
in which at least 43 people were killed.
Keen hope for EU enlargement: Foreign ministers assemble in Brussels for a
special EU council meeting on the enlargement of the union. The participants
will aim to consolidate the progress made in preliminary talks earlier in
the week.
Japanese construction scandal: Tokyo District Court holds its first hearing
on the alleged bribery case involving Mr Fujio Takeuchi, former governor of
Ibaraki north of Tokyo. Four construction groups are involved in charges of
bribery relating to tenders for a government dam project.
WEEKEND 26-27
Group of Seven on CIS
Finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven (G7)
gather in Kronberg, in the Taunus hills north of Frankfurt, to debate the
plight of the Russian economy. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister,
whose country is most exposed to Russia's debt problems, invited them.
Italy's election in March will be the first under a new simple majority
system but the voters are likely to be as confused as ever. Fully 320
polling booth symbols have been submitted for approval before Sunday's
deadline for filing candidates' names.
Twin Towers bombing: The anniversary of the World Trade Center bombing in
New York may be marked by the end of the four-and-a-half month trial of the
alleged bombers. Prosecution and defence should have concluded summations by
Monday, and the jury may pass judgement on the four defendants - Mohammad
Salameh, Ahmad Ajaj, Nidal Ayyad and Mahmud Abouhalima - shortly afterwards.

Monday: The board of I G Metall, the German engineering workers' union,
meets to decide on possible strike ballot. A ballot will take several days
to organise and at least two days to conduct.
Tuesday: The French trade balance for December is expected to show a
Ffr6.7bn surplus, compared with Ffr6.6bn in November.
Thursday: German cost of living figures, expected today, are forecast to
show a further fall from January's 3.5 per cent to an annual rate of 3.2-3.4
per cent in February. Underlying inflation pressures have eased, allowing
the Bundesbank to cut rates last week.
Friday: The CBI monthly trends report for February will provide further
evidence of the strength of the UK economy. The quarterly report, published
last month, presented a fairly upbeat picture of business confidence.
The UK will also publish its trade balance with non-European Union countries
in January. The deficit is expected to have widened to Pounds 790m, from
Pounds 675m in December. French consumer price index figures for January are
expected to show that inflation still remains low at 2.1 per cent.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Investors scan the horizon for clouds - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street is taking a well-deserved rest today to mark Presidents' Day,
but many investors will no doubt take a moment out during the holiday to
reflect on the stormy events of last week.
When investors and brokers return to their trading screens tomorrow, few
will have any doubts that the market is now in a period of transition. Amid
the uncertainty which that has engendered, analysts see a further weakening
of share prices over the next week or two.
Mr Joseph McAlinden, director of research at Dillon Read in New York, sees a
general downward bias over the next month or two, although stocks could well
trade a little higher this week. 'But any gains should be viewed in the
context of a correction,' he cautions.
The turning point for the financial markets came a fortnight ago, when the
Federal Reserve decided to tighten monetary policy for the first time in
five years. But the true implications of the move were only driven home last
Thursday and Friday, when the underlying optimism which had driven the
financial markets forward seemed to have finally broken.
During both sessions, investors appeared to be in mourning the bygone days
when interest rates would only go down. In the bond market, holders of the
inflation-sensitive 30-year issue were unconsoled by data showing no
increase in consumer prices last month. Instead, they drove yields over 6.60
per cent for the first time since July, on the strength of a second-tier
report showing some Philadelphia manufacturers had paid higher prices for
materials.
By force of habit, stocks followed Treasury prices lower, just as they have
followed them up over the life of the three-year bull market.
'The Fed has bruised the market, there is no doubt about that,' says Mr Don
Hays, market strategist at Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer in Norfolk,
Virginia. 'It is now in a healing period, and (last week) was a classic
illustration of that.' Instead of searching for silver linings, he argues,
investors are scanning the horizon for clouds.
One of the clouds in investors' sights last week will arrive today. Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is scheduled to present his twice-yearly
Humphrey Hawkins testimony on monetary policy to a congressional committee.
Analysts fear that no matter what Mr Greenspan says, the market will find
good cause to trade down.
Will stocks necessarily follow? Only so far, say analysts. Looking back at
the Philadelphia manufacturing data, Mr McAlinden finds reason for guarded
optimism. He points out that higher prices may indeed bring even higher
interest rates, but the trend also suggests improved corporate earnings in
some sectors. In that regard, he sees no fundamental change in a dynamic
that has powered the market since the autumn.
'The two forces are involved in a tug of war,' he says. For a few weeks,
anyway, the interest-rate bears are likely to be dominant.

TOKYO
While upward pressure on the yen seems to have subsided, stock market
traders will continue to focus on the currency market and developments over
US-Japan trade negotiations. The Nikkei index is likely to fluctuate on low
volume, but may face selling by corporations realising profits ahead of the
March book closing to supplement weak operating profits.
FRANKFURT
After last week's discount rate cut, the pending M3 money supply growth
figures for January may come as an anticlimax, but there is the possibility
that the Bundesbank will turn its attention to the 6 per cent repo rate when
a DM72.2bn repurchase agreement expires on Wednesday. On Monday, IG Metall
engineering workers' union officials may have to decide whether to call a
strike ballot after the failure of pay talks.
AMSTERDAM
The big internationals feature, with Unilever's preliminary figures due on
Tuesday and the Royal Dutch/Shell group's full-year 1993 figures on
Thursday. Hoare Govett looks for a 4.5 per cent rise in net profits from the
consumer products giant, saying sterling's continued weakness through 1993
acts as a constraint on the guilder dividend; it projects a slight decrease
in earnings per share, but a marginally higher dividend from Royal Dutch.
OSLO
Weak oil prices and aluminium industry politics have not stopped Norsk
Hydro's upward share price career. Monday's 1993 results should produce
earnings up from NKr8.60 to NKr15.60 a share, says NatWest Securities.
COPENHAGEN

in Stockholm and UBS in Zurich - Den Danske is due with its 1993 figures on
Thursday. Markedly higher profits are expected: The Estimate Directory
offers a consensus EPS forecast of DKr47.0, up from DKr30 in 1992.
ZURICH
Alusuisse 1993 results are expected on Friday. The group has indicated a
sharp cut in 1993 net profits, due to weak economic conditions and poor
aluminium prices, as well as the additional costs of closing capacity in
aluminium production.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Big sell-off in bonds casts a shadow -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market kicks off the second leg of the two-week trading account
this morning under considerable threat from the big sell-off across
international bond markets late last Friday.
Share prices look almost certain to be marked down sharply at the outset of
dealings, in what could be a re-run of the pattern of trading over the past
two Mondays. The volatility was prompted by the US Federal Reserve's
decision to tighten monetary policy. Two weeks ago, a fall in the the Dow
Jones Average was matched almost point-for-point when London opened the
following Monday, before recouping around half its opening fall.
The immediate focus of attention will be the gilts market and European bonds
to see if there is any substantial follow-through selling. The closure of
Wall Street for a US holiday could provide an element of stability in
London. Another crucial pointer for international markets, with the obvious
implications for London, comes tomorrow when Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve, addresses the US Congress.
The 3,350 level on the FT-SE is viewed by market-makers and some chartists
as a strong rallying point and any decisive move below that level could be
the trigger for more big selling of leading stocks.
In spite of the wild swings in the equity market there is still no shortage
of optimists. In a reference to the recent spate of UK economic data NatWest
Securities says: 'The prospect of a further cut in UK base-rates is back on
the agenda.' NatWest remains happy with its year-end FT-SE 100 forecast of
3,900.
Salomon Brothers, the US securities house, is even more bullish, forecasting
a year-end FT-SE 100 number of 3,950. Salomon makes the point that since
1980 the UK stock market has rallied in every year after the first Fed
tightening, by between 14 per cent and 38 per cent.
The broker says that in spite of rising US rates (it expects the Fed to
tighten to 3 3/4 - 4 per cent by mid-year), it expects further rate cuts in
Europe, underpinning equities.
However, the equity market does face another searching examination of the
currently popular theory of strong earnings recovery, as no less than 10 of
the FT-SE 100 constituents unveil preliminary figures this week.
If the reporting season to date is anything to go by, the market could be
pleasantly surprised, although some broking houses, such as Nikko
Securities, believe the risk is on the downside. Nikko says: 'Further
downgradings of earnings estimates are likely as adjustments are made for
growth prospects in a low inflation environment'.
Three of the UK's big composite insurance groups, Guardian Royal Exchange,
Commercial Union and Royal Insurance, and the UK's biggest insurance broker,
Sedgwick, report during the week. While analysts will obviously focus on the
expected strong recovery in profitability, the good numbers may also revive
takeover speculation in the sector, which has underperformed the wider
market in recent months.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Money managers take a fresh look at
commodities - Risk and Reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the US, the apparent swing into the second stage of a business cycle
recovery has drawn big money's attention back to commodities. After years of
underperforming fixed-income investments, commodities - particularly metals
like copper and aluminium - outperformed bonds in the first month of this
year.
Although low oil prices have kept inflation concerns at bay, money managers
still reason that owning physical assets will pay off with big returns when
a surge in demand breathes life back into basic industries that are
commodity consumers.
Mutual fund managers and other money managers have piled into commodity
proxies - mostly shares of companies that are commodities processors -
pumping up prices to unrealistic levels.
Newmont Gold, a US mining company, is priced at almost 50 times current
earnings, while the US's largest aluminium companies, which posted large
losses in 1993, are trading at 100 times projected earnings two or three
years into the future.
What has happened, analysts say, is that the total market capitalisation of
commodity-linked equities is too small for the purposes of mutual funds,
which have an estimated Dollars 2,000bn in assets to invest. US pension
funds, also interested in commodities, weigh in with another Dollars 2,000bn
in assets.
Direct investment in commodities would seem a logical alternative, but most
mutual funds and many pension funds and insurance companies are prevented by
charter or their investment boards from owning physical commodities or
commodity futures.
Derivatives dealers have moved in to ease the strain, offering structured
notes with values tied to the price movement of an underlying commodity, but
which fit the definition of a fixed-income investment.
Swaps based on commodity price relationships are also being sold to fund
managers. These deals could gradually inflate prices in the physical
markets, traders say, again because the money to be invested is vast
compared to overall market size.
Wall Street's pin-striped fund managers have been tiptoeing into
fixed-income instruments linked to corn prices, because the unusually low
feedgrain supplies in the US this year have boosted prices; into structured
oil deals, because oil prices are at historically low levels; and into base
metals, where prices occasionally sank below production costs last year when
Russian supplies glutted markets.
Last month, a California-based insurance fund with Dollars 14bn in
fixed-income assets ventured into the oil swaps market for the first time in
a trade based on expectations that the upwardly-sloping forward oil price
curve will invert to a more traditional backwardation (whereby the spot
price is above the deferred delivery date) during the next 18 months, with
spot prices moving above the two-year forward price.
Merrill Lynch persuaded Pacific Mutual Life Insurance to invest about
Dollars 15m in the 1m barrel trade as a means of diversifying assets.
Pacific Mutual will profit if the spread returns to a pre-defined level. If
the spread does not move out of contango (whereby the spot price is below
the deferred delivery price), Merrill Lynch will profit from the trade.
The trade was an unusual one for an insurance fund, but could herald a
trend. Banks and broker-dealers are actively adding commodity-derivatives
expertise to their trading and sales rosters, viewing commodities as a
lucrative expansion opportunity as growth in foreign exchange and interest
rate derivatives businesses level out.

The gilts market faces a difficult few days, after the sell-off in world
bond markets last week. US investors were reported to be heavy sellers of
European bonds.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, described the
market as 'truly unbelievable' in the wake of a series of economic
statistics which should have been favourable for gilts.
'A week ago, if someone had said we will give you 10 statistics which point
to a weak economy and low price pressures, and a German rate cut, I would
have said gilts would be up three points. In fact they were down two. The
market has lost track with fundamentals,' Mr Briscoe believes.
With US Treasuries performing badly on a Philadelphia Fed report of an
upturn in inflationary pressures, Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research
at Yamaichi International (Europe), said: 'UK investors are looking to the
US as a guide to the outlook in the UK'.
All this is a bad omen for the next auction, of Pounds 2.5bn of 7 per cent
gilt stock, due on Wednesday. Mr Richardson said there is a chance that
gilts fell sufficiently last week to make the new stock attractive, with the
spread over German bunds now 87 basis points. But Mr Briscoe warned it could
be a make or break auction.

Although the US bond market is closed today for the Presidents' Day holiday,
the calendar is busy enough in the rest of the week to provide fixed-income
investors with something new to digest.
Tomorrow, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, gives the
biannual Humphrey Hawkins address to Congress, where he is expected to
provide more details of the thinking behind the February 4 increase in US
interest rates, which has so disturbed bond market sentiment over the past
fortnight. Any hint from Mr Greenspan that he is close to tightening policy
again would be likely to upset the already rattled market.
Also tomorrow, the Conference Board releases its latest survey of consumer
confidence, and analysts are expecting little change in the reading. On
Thursday, the January durable goods orders report is released, and continued
strength in the numbers is expected. A day later the latest monthly existing
home sales figures are published.
Finally, this week's Treasury auctions could cause a few problems, given the
current weakness in market sentiment. On Wednesday, Dollars 17bn of two-year
notes will be sold, followed by Dollars 11bn of five-year notes on Thursday.
If prices continue to fall, the auctions could prove a crucial test of the
market's mood.

While the sluggishness of the Japanese economy remains unchanged, Japanese
government bond prices may lose ground on supply and demand factors.
Profit-taking ahead of the March book-closing by life assurers and banks is
expected to accelerate, depressing long bond prices.
The Japan Securities Dealers' Association, says trust banks became net
sellers of government and corporate bonds in January for the first time in a
year, selling a net Y368.5bn. City, or commercial, banks were net sellers
for the fourth consecutive month, while long-term credit banks were net
sellers for the third straight month.
An increase in supply of medium-term corporate bonds is also adding to the
lack of appetite for government bonds among institutional investors, while
hedge selling on the futures market by underwriters has been weighing on the
market. Traders are also cautious ahead of an increase in issuance of
municipal bonds over the coming months.
However, the Bank of Japan is increasingly wary of a further rise in medium
and long-term interest rates while the slump in business confidence
continues. Some traders hope that the central bank will allow short-term
money rates, which are already at record lows, to ease further, thus
supporting bond prices.

FT  21 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Europe unwilling to decouple from US -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's government bond markets are in the most extraordinary state of
turmoil, ruled more - it would seem - by gut feelings than by anything
resembling cool, calm economic analysis.
Last Thursday, the Bundesbank surprised the world financial markets with a
half-point cut in the German discount rate, lowering it from 5.75 per cent
to 5.25 per cent.
The European bond markets, which have a tendency to hang on to every word,
twitch of the eyebrow or other signal from the Bundesbank, have been
obsessed with the question of 'will they, won't they cut rates?' for weeks.
And no sooner had the Bundesbank cut its discount rate, than nearly every
other European central bank was free to follow suit.
Belgium, Austria, Italy, and the Netherlands announced their moves on
Thursday, while Spain, Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden waited until Friday,
leaving France as the obstinate 'odd man out'.
The Bank of France could well move as early as this week given the French
franc/D-Mark exchange rate, or else could wait until Germany lowers its repo
rate.
However, while the European bond markets rejoiced at first in the
long-awaited news of a German easing, there was a pretty smart turnround by
late Thursday afternoon, followed by a sharp fall in European government
bond prices on Friday afternoon.
What on earth was going on, most people wondered as they watched gilts,
bunds, OATs and a host of other European bonds tumble in largely
futures-driven trading.
For a start, world bond markets have clearly been rattled by the revival of
concern about inflation in the US and the decision by the US Federal Reserve
to raise short-term interest rates on February 4.
Of course, bond markets hate the thought of rising inflation: the fact that
the Fed's move was intended to be a pre-emptive strike - rather than a
strong dose of medicine to cure an existing ill - was largely ignored.
The fact that the Bank of England snipped a quarter point off the base
lending rate, taking it down to 5.25 per cent, only a few days later on
February 8 should have reminded the markets that interest rates on this side
of the Atlantic are still following a downward path.
In addition, of course, the Bundesbank's decision to cut its discount rate
last Thursday, sparking off a round of similar easings in Europe, again
should have confirmed that the future direction for European interest rates
is down, rather than up.
However, the markets still remain jittery and almost determined to focus on
the very worst news on the inflation front.
Witness what happened in the US last Thursday: the announcement that US
consumer prices last month were unchanged on the previous month and ahead by
only 2.5 per cent in the year to January should have been good for US
Treasury bonds.
Instead, the Treasury market chose to concentrate on a report on regional
economic conditions by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which
showed a sharp rise in the bank's index of manufactured goods prices.
The US inflation worries have clearly spooked the European markets. On top
of this, though, rumours of substantial trading losses by certain
proprietary trading desks and reports of extremely heavy selling by US hedge
funds have swept the European bond markets.
'The market psychology right now is very very negative,' said one European
bond dealer.
Some dealers point out that the very volatile market conditions have made
trading difficult.
'It's been so choppy, some days you lose a lot but then other days you can
make it all back up again,' said one dealer at a US bond house.
But while traders are, not surprisingly, loath to discuss how much money
they have lost, they confirm that much of the selling pressure has come out
of the US, particularly from US hedge funds.
These are private pools of funds which are managed very aggressively: they
are highly leveraged and were one of the driving forces behind the surge in
European government bond prices last year.
'It's been a frightening experience to see such a massive liquidation of
bonds,' said one analyst last week.
'There's been a tide of selling, and people have got stuck with positions
they don't want to be in, and have had to offload. Nor is it possible to say
with any conviction that the selling has come to an end.'
The problem, points out Mr George Magnus, international economist at S. G.
Warburg Securities, is that a sensible valuation or economic analysis of the
European bond markets simply does not enter into the picture at all.
'Even if you point out that European yields will fall back to the levels
where they were at the end of 1993, the words just fall on deaf ears,' he
says.
For the moment, at least, the European bond markets appear unwilling to
decouple from the moves in the US.

FT  21 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Moves to develop 'structured' bonds -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Lay, the director of financial operations at the World Bank, just
cannot sit still. Now that his efforts to develop a truly international
capital market through his global bond concept have paid off, he is using
his formidable energy and influence to improve the secondary market
liquidity in derivative-linked or 'structured' bonds.
An increasing number of borrowers are issuing structured bonds because the
derivative element embedded in the bonds enables them to achieve a cheaper
cost of funds than if they launched a straightforward Eurobond or global
bond offering. Structured bonds are equally popular with investors who want
to back their views about the direction of anything from interest rates to
an individual company's share price.
But since these transactions are frequently driven by fleeting arbitrage
opportunities and tailored to specific investors, they tend to be relatively
small in relation to Eurobond or global bond market offerings. Syndicate
managers say the average size of structured bond offerings is about Dollars
100m.
As a result, investors often run into difficulty when they come to sell the
bonds. Main complaints are the lack of price transparency and liquidity in
the secondary market, which means holders often receive less than the
inherent value of the bonds.
World Bank officials have discussed with about 200 investors how to reduce
the deficiencies in the structured bond market. They believe the innovative
facilities of the World Bank's imminent Dollars 5bn global multi-currency
note programme should help to address these concerns. The programme offers
the following advantages:
Price transparency: the seven sponsoring dealers will regularly publish
indicative bid prices for World Bank structured bonds issued under the
programme on dedicated screens distributed by widely available services. The
World Bank expects that competitive pressures among dealers will lead them
to improve secondary market prices.
Secondary market liquidity: by offering to exchange outstanding structured
notes for new floating-rate or structured notes, the World Bank hopes to be
more supportive of sponsoring dealers' secondary market activities than
other issuers.
Issuance, trading and custody: global documentation (bonds issued under the
programme may be governed by New York, English or German law) will allow for
timely and streamlined issuance of structured bonds in a wide range of
markets, currencies and maturities. The programme also provides for a choice
of clearing systems and cross-market clearing and settlement in major
markets.
Mr Bim Hundal, head of medium-term note (MTN) programmes at Goldman Sachs,
one of the sponsoring dealers of the World Bank's programme, says the World
Bank's decision to formalise the role of dealers is an important step in the
development of the structured bond market.
The increased competition and the knowledge that the World Bank is measuring
their performance should encourage dealers to make realistic prices in the
bonds. The increased price transparency will benefit investors whenever they
value their holdings either for regulatory or trading purposes.
The World Bank hopes its measures will widen the investor appeal of
structured bonds since it plans to raise at least Dollars 2bn of its annual
borrowing programme of between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 12bn through
structured products. These products will be linked only to interest rates
and exchange rates.
Although structured bonds tend to have relatively short maturities - the
result of investor worries about the lack of liquidity - the World Bank
hopes its liquidity facility will enable it to achieve maturities of between
four and 10 years.
The global platform built into the World Bank's programme is likely to be
imitated by other issuers who want to have one MTN programme which allows
them access to all the world's major markets.
The volume of MTN programmes has grown rapidly over the past few years as
issuers seek to lower their documentation costs and cut the time involved in
launching a bond offering.
Mr Juan Costain, head of capital markets at Kidder Peabody, another
sponsoring dealer of the World Bank's programme, estimates that the volume
of MTNs grew by 2 1/2 times last year to Dollars 127bn. Of this, about
Dollars 60bn was in structured bonds and this year the volume could reach
Dollars 75bn.
According to Mr Costain, the documentation costs for a Euro-MTN programme,
under which an issuer can make numerous Eurobond offerings, are about
Dollars 100,000, the same as for an individual Eurobond offering. Although
the documentation cost of a global programme is closer to Dollars 300,000,
the issuer is likely to achieve even lower costs of funding because of the
immediate access to a far wider range of markets and currencies.

Last week's half-point cut in the discount rate took the markets by surprise
but did nothing to satisfy bund market investors.
There was disappointment that the cut to 5.25 per cent did not go hand in
hand with a reduction in the all-important securities repurchase or 'repo'
rate, which was fixed for this week at 6 per cent - where it has been for
the past two months.
It is difficult to see what can provide the impetus for a change in
sentiment. Good data on January M3 - which may be published this week - will
not change the fact that the easing move last week was less substantial than
the markets wanted.
Developments in the US government securities market will also be watched
carefully: further anxiety about rate rises in North America is likely to
spill over into the German market, where the average current yield was 5.78
per cent on Friday and the yield of many 10-year issues was back over the 6
per cent mark.
There is a danger that the Bundesbank reduced the discount rate merely to
put the proper margin between it and the repo rate. Mr Paul Brunker of
Robert Fleming in London thinks the Bundesbank wants to see how the currency
holds up in the wake of rate cuts. But, he warns, nerves will be stretched
if there is no signal of further easing in the next two weeks.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Rough riding ahead in China - The Emerging
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's fledgling stock markets are set for another bumpy year while traders
digest implications of a new tax law, a government credit squeeze limiting
funds available for investment, and faltering attempts to conclude a new
securities law.
Judging by sharp fluctuations in the first seven weeks of the year of both
the yuan-denominated A-share and dollar B-share indexes - they dived before
recovering some lost ground - traders are jittery.
Investors are likely to continue to be distracted by plans to float a new
batch of Chinese companies on overseas stock exchanges, by talk of a third
stock exchange by the end of the year, and by fears that China's credit
crunch may herald the beginning of a recession.
Other factors depressing share prices include improving bond yields and a
rash of new issues. Twelve-month treasury bonds yielding 11.9 per cent are
proving appealing to institutional and individual invest-ors.
The new tax law is another factor dragging markets down since it leaves it
unclear whether investors are liable for capital gains tax on top of charges
on share transactions and tax on dividends.
But if there is good news for Chinese investors and foreign institutions
warily testing the markets, it lies in the apparent commitment of China's
stock regulators to further economic liberalisation, and to stiffening
regulatory procedures.
Professor Li Yining, one of China's most influential economists and the head
of a parliamentary committee drafting the new Securities Law, believes that
additional steps to bolster public trust in capital markets are vital for
market reforms.
China's Securities Law is now in its seventh draft and Prof Li hopes that by
the end of this year it will be implemented, although a number of
contentious issues remain to be resolved.
These include differences over the degree of self-regulation to be allowed
to local exchanges; over whether over-the-counter trading will be permitted;
and whether state shares (as opposed to those held by institutions and
individuals) should be traded in the market.
Some officials fear this will lead to the state losing control of state
enterprises.
Prof Li favours stronger central control over markets, but says that given
powerful provincial interests it would be difficult for a body like the US
Securities and Exchange Commission to emerge in China.
He also believes that OTC trading should be permitted, since to outlaw it
would only encourage a 'black market'.
And, finally, he feels that 'state-owned shares' should be traded, otherwise
'they are dead'.
Most importantly, however, Prof Li sees the development of China's equity
markets as a means of facilitating a faltering process of corporatisation
and privatisation. 'If we don't set up shareholding companies we will never
be able to separate government and management,' he says.
Among the authorities' most urgent tasks is the effort to 'corporatise'  -
this is a Chinese half-way house to privatisation in which enterprises are
detached from state control - or fully privatise elements of the faltering
state sector. This involves dealing with the vexed property rights issue.
Until the question of ownership of state assets is resolved, and therefore
who should be responsible for disposing of such assets, the process of
unravelling state control will prove difficult, if not impossible.
Various creative solutions have been advanced, including channelling state
assets into a special 'State Investment Corporation' which would be
responsible for divestiture; the transfer of assets from the government
itself to larger enterprises; or the establishment of provincial commissions
which would also be entrusted with the task of selling off state assets.
These solutions are believed to be reflected in one form or another in a
draft law on 'Controlling State Assets' submitted recently to the State
Council, or cabinet. This measure, together with a new Corporate Law due to
come into effect in July, should go some way towards providing the legal
basis for a rational process of divestiture.
Prof Li himself favours a combination of the various approaches mentioned
above together with full privatisation for smaller enterprises, and mixed
state and private ownership for larger businesses along the lines of the
French or Scandinavian models.
Foreign legal experts believe that China is slowly moving towards having a
'pretty good' regulatory framework, although they criticise what they regard
as an arbitrary approach by the Securities Regulatory Commission - the
national securities watchdog - to selecting companies for overseas listing.
They note that of the latest batch of 23 companies selected for listing
abroad - six mainland companies listed in Hong Kong last year - there is a
preponderance of power companies, including three from Shandong province
alone. This suggests a less than rational approach in the selection process,
and also reflects, no doubt, powerful lobbying at the centre.
Premier Li Peng's family, for example, has long been connected with the
power company, Huaneng International, which is among the candidates for
foreign listings this year.
In light of the squeeze on credit - the authorities have placed a ban on
bank lending for new capital spending - pressures to be allowed to venture
into international capital markets are certain to grow. China's evolving
regulatory apparatus faces no easy task in a surging transitional economy
undergoing a rapid and somewhat chaotic transformation to a market-oriented
system.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Focus on Greenspan testimony
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following last week's Bundesbank-led easing of monetary policy across
Europe, attention now switches to Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US
Federal Reserve, who delivers his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to the House
Banking sub-committee tomorrow.
Mr Greenspan's bi-annual appearance, where he is called to explain his views
on the economy, will be watched for indications of the likely future course
of US monetary policy. The Fed lifted interest rates by 25 basis points
earlier this month, the first tightening of policy in five years.
Although that move was well received, the dollar has subsequently weakened
on the back of a trade dispute with Japan. The dollar last week fell to a
six month low of Y101 against the yen and was generally weaker across the
board.
Since the tightening of policy, US economic data has presented a mixed
picture, leading some to wonder whether the Fed might not have moved
prematurely. Weakness in US bond prices, however, shows that many investors
believe the Fed will respond to some inflationary signs with a further
tightening. Given this uncertainty, Mr Greenspan is sure to be closely
questioned to ascertain his views on the outlook for inflation and interest
rates.
In Europe attention will focus on Germany and France. While last week's cut
in the discount rate by the Bundesbank has paved the way for a cut in its
key repo rate, few see this happening until the wage dispute in the
engineering industry is resolved.
France, meanwhile, was the only key EMS country not to cut rates last week.
Thursday's meeting of the council of the Bank of France will provide an
opportunity to fall into line. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at
Citibank, argues that pressures are building on France to ease policy.
The G-7 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers takes place in
Frankfurt on Saturday. US/Japan trade tensions will probably top the agenda.
The meeting may provide the spur for Japanese proposals aimed at breaking
the logjam.

STRATEGY
Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley has put his bet on Poland as eastern
Europe's answer to a 'tiger economy'. Addressing himself to a longer time
horizon than many analysts - in a research paper called '2001: an investment
odyssey' - the global strategist suggests that the Czech and Hungarian
republics will also do well, 'but unlike Poland they do not offer the double
advantage of having a large and growing market, as well as a cheap
manufacturing base.'
As for emerging markets in general, he forecasts that several of the world's
restructuring economies will fail to transform: 'this could damage the
emerging markets mania sweeping the investment world.'
POLAND
Poland's finance minister is to ask the stock exchange authorities to
consider suspending trading in Bank Slaski until all investors obtain equal
access.
On Thursday the bank had its stockbroking licence revoked by the securities
commission following charges that it had mismanaged its own privatisation.
It has been given six months to wind down its operations.
Ing of the Netherlands has a 25.9 per cent stake in the bank.
KENYA
The government has scrapped several foreign currency controls, to bring the
country close to its declared aim of total liberalisation. Kenyans living
overseas will be allowed unlimited local borrowing to finance local
investment, and restrictions on local borrowing by foreign-controlled
companies will also be lifted.
Controls remain on capital accounts and rules barring foreign investors from
trading on the Nairobi stock market.
ISRAEL
The stock market closed down 6 per cent last week, depressed by the recent
arrest of two portfolio investment managers by the securities authority on
suspicion of manipulating securities for the eight companies they managed. A
third person, Mr Amos Weiss, a leading portfolio manager with some Shk1bn
(some Dollars 335m) under management, was released on bail last week also
after questioning on suspicion of stock manipulation.
NIGERIA
Activity on the stock exchange was slightly more muted in 1993 than in the
previous year, the authorities reported last week. According to the latest
estimates shares put on 39 per cent in 1993 compared with a 41 per cent rise
in 1992.
The stock exchange also reported that 21 new companies were listed on the
daily official list in 1993, up from 12 in 1992. At present there are 175
listed companies, with a market capitalisation of N50.5bn.
ROMANIA
Holders of vouchers will be able to swap them for shares in 20 state
enterprises from May, when the Private Ownership Fund issues its first list
of companies to be privatised through public offerings. The country's five
regional funds hold a 30 per cent stake in some 6,000 state enterprises
designated for privatisation over the next seven to 15 years.
BUDAPEST
The government has drawn up a short list of privatisation consultants to
help float shares of Matav, the telecommunications group, on the Budapest
stock exchange by the middle of this year.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Markets: A difficult task for testimony - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fundamental US economic factors should simultaneously be strengthening the
dollar over the next few months. The economy is expanding at a relatively
strong clip - many economists are forecasting GDP growth of 3 to 3 1/2 per
cent this year - and the Federal Reserve has started to tighten monetary
policy.
However, the central bank, which raised the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis
points at the start of this month, may have to tighten another notch or two
before it allays the jitters which have overtaken the Treasury bond market
over the past few weeks.
After a sharp drop in price on Friday, the benchmark 30-year issue ended
last week with a yield of 6.62 per cent, up from 6.40 a week earlier, and
some market analysts now think yields could rise to between 6.75 and 7 per
cent before stabilising and reversing direction, and that could feed through
to a significant dip in equity indices.
The bond market has yet to be convinced that inflationary pressures are
under control. This was graphically demonstrated on Thursday when bearish
traders brushed aside a healthy January reading for the consumer price index
and focussed instead on a much more narrow measure of price increases, from
the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Board, which showed a significant increase.
The week's fall in the dollar relative to the yen will also have fed fears
of imported inflation.
The market may not regain its composure until there is a run of slow-growth
statistics, or until after further rounds of Fed tightening, which could
nevertheless be bearish for bonds in the short term. Many analysts expect
the Fed Funds rate to rise from 3.25 per cent to 3.5 over the next two
months, with some predicting 4 per cent by mid-year.
However, short-term sentiment could be powerfully affected on Tuesday by Mr
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, who will deliver his semi-annual
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on monetary policy to Congress. At the very
least, he is expected to reaffirm his recent testimony before a
Congressional committee that the strength of the economic expansion means
the Fed must become less 'accomodative.'
Huffing and puffing the Yen up
Is the time fast approaching to sell the Japanese Yen? The question is
prompted by the surge in the currency relative to the dollar over the past
week following the breakdown of US-Japanese trade talks and threats by
Washington to take fresh trade sanctions against Tokyo.
The coming week will produce a great deal more huffing and puffing from the
two capitals, and this is likely to keep the relationship between the
currencies volatile, with the possibility of further Yen appreciation from
the rate of 104.60 to the dollar reached in late Friday trading.
The Yen's sharp rise stems from the market's expectation that Washington
will 'talk up' the Japanese currency to put negotiating pressure on the
Hosokawa Government. And the mere anticipation of such a move has obviated
the need for overt action by the US, which has sat back and tacitly accepted
the Yen's advance.
This week the Clinton administration is expected to unveil tougher action to
force the Japanese to accept numerical import quotas and reduce their trade
surplus.
In Tokyo, where the Bank of Japan has been intervening heavily to hold back
the Yen's advance, the Government is reported to be drafting voluntary trade
concessions in an attempt to head off the dispute, and it may want to have a
plan ready by next Saturday, when Finance Ministers from the G7 nations meet
in Frankfurt.
The market suspects the Japanese may ask the G7 to intervene to support a
rate of Y110 to the dollar, which officials in Tokyo argue is more
reflective of economic fundamentals.
Certainly, as Ravi Bulchandani of Goldman Sachs points out, the real
effective yen exchange rate is well above any level that the currency has
been able to sustain in the past.
And prolonged continuation of the current rate will hurt the Hosokawa
administration, undermining its economic stimulus package, hitting corporate
profitability and stock prices, and possibly prolonging recession.
US policy-makers face a trade-off between a desire to squeeze genuine trade
concessions out of Japan, and the knowledge that prolonging recession there
is ultimately harmful to US exports and geo-political interests.
Tokyo, for its part, seems to have two central policy options. One is to
give considerable ground to the US on trade issues, while appearing to stand
firm on numerical targets to shore up the Government's weak domestic
political position.
The other is to take pressure off both the yen and the domestic economy by a
further cut in interest rates. Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of
Japan, maintained last week that interest rates were sufficiently low to
support economic activity, but many analysts in Tokyo expect easing action
in the near future. Whatever the policy mix, it should exert downward
pressure on the yen.
Bundesbank action
The dollar should strengthen against European currencies over the next few
months as European interest rates continue to fall and as political
uncertainty mounts in Germany, with the approach of lander and national
elections.
The downward trend of European rates was reconfirmed on Thursday with the
Bundesbank's announcement of a 50 basis point cut in the discount rate,
which may have been delayed a couple of weeks as the bank weighed up the
impact on the D-Mark of the Fed's tightening action.
In the event, the dollar has been sliding against the D-Mark, dragged down
by its yen weakness, and the fall perversely persisted to the end of last
week, despite the Bundesbank's rate cutting action.
However, it may be a week or two before the Bundesbank cuts its most
important instrument, the repo rate, which it left unchanged at 6 per cent.
It could be holding back until it sees further progress in talks to avert
national engineering strikes, better inflation figures, or the March 1
implementation of a cut in commercial banks' minimum reserves.
SG Warburg's international bonds team argues that with inflation likely to
fall from 3.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent by the end of the year, there is a
good chance the discount rate will fall at least 1 per cent further towards
a trough early in 1995 of 4 per cent, with the repo rate about 25 basis
points higher.
Although the Bundesbank's action was widely imitated across Europe on
Thursday, France failed to match the cut.
But the weakness of the French economy means that it will surely follow suit
before long, possibly waiting for the repo rate to drop first.
Bullish on Japan
Could the current strength of the yen be due in small part to foreign
investors, who have been substantially underweight in Japanese stocks,
placing an early bet on economic recovery? A straw in the wind could be the
latest thinking of Morgan Stanley strategist Barton Biggs, who thinks the
pivotal economic event of the year in certain respects 'will not be the
gradual rise in US interest rates, but rather an unexpected and strong
economic recovery in Japan". In Biggs' view, such a revival would be bullish
for the world economy, Japanese stocks, Australia (Japan's natural resource
supplier), oil prices and maybe Malaysia (natural gas, tin, palm oil).
But it could be bearish for Japanese bonds, the yen (as the trade surplus
shrinks), and Hong Kong and other markets where Japanese money has gone. He
cautions that the government's economic stimulus programme and the survival
of the prime minister are in doubt, but 'even depressions and secular bear
markets don't last forever, and stock market bottoms are built from
discouragement and despair'.

FT  21 FEB 94 / The Markets: No advantage in pseudo-scientific futurology -
Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The willingness of newspapers to report the outpourings of model-based
forecasters gives economists a terribly bad name. If manipulating giant and
complex statistical models of the world economy delivered reliable results,
then all would be fine. But the recent record of the UK Treasury, the
International Monetary Fund or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development has been miserable.
Anyone who doubts just how bad these models are at predicting cyclical
turning points only need glance at the upper chart for a damning
confirmation.
Economics is just not suited to the kind of pseudo-scientific futurology
that these models purport to deliver. Engineering scientists can use theory
and the results of controlled experiments to make accurate predictions
about, say, the weight a bridge will bear before it falls. But economists do
not have the tools, or the information, that the engineer has to work with
when they try, for example, to predict with any accuracy when the aggregate
consumer savings ratio will fall.
Economic theory provides a powerful conceptual framework, but much of it is
based on implausible assumptions about the rationality of human responses.
Study of the statistical past can indicate plausible causal relationships,
but testing an economic inference about aggregate consumer behaviour using
controlled experiments is almost always impossible.
Not that economists can afford to stop trying to predict the future. But, if
economists are useful to have around, it is because of their
deeply-ingrained scepticism, their willingness to doubt assumptions or ask
whether the conclusions really follow.
The best UK City economists, most of whom eschew large-scale models, are
successful precisely because they continually doubt whether the future will
be like the past. Their value lies in analysis, although it their forecasts
which make the headlines.
The problem with the OECD and other large-scale forecasters, aside from
their ridiculous claims to accuracy, is that their statistical models always
require them to look back to the future, finding patterns in the past to
predict how tomorrow will be. In this recession, albeit a little late, OECD
economists produced some typically good analysis of the historically
unprecedented debt burdens facing UK, US or Japanese companies and
consumers. But the implications for the pace of recovery were not
incorporated into their forecasts, at least not until the OECD's woefully
erroneous forecasts had done terrible damage to its forecasting reputation.
Yet the danger really starts when macro modellers graduate to policy making
and try to elevate past statistical relationships to orthodox policy
doctrine. Remember, for example, the UK Treasury's repeated statements
during the final months of sterling's membership of the European exchange
rate mechanism. In or out for the ERM, the UK could not cut interest rates
below those in Germany they said. Even a modest devaluation would inevitably
lead to higher inflation, they feared.
Neither assertion seemed plausible at the time, given the depressed state of
the UK economy. And both have been proved wrong since. But the Treasury has
still not cottoned on. Worried about the resurgence of post-devaluation
inflation, it has cut rates much more modestly than the US Federal Reserve
has done with no apparent inflationary cost. If growth remains sluggish, the
Treasury will eventually sanction further cuts, although history suggests
they will come too late and stay low too long.
The failure of the IMF to engage with Russian reformers or provide funds for
a successful stabilisation provides another example of the shortcomings of
model-based, rule-bound, apolitical economics. The IMF has doggedly clung to
the details of its standard programme, tried and tested in Latin America,
which makes any release of funds conditional on the prior closing of the
budget deficit, even though state spending cuts and the associated rise in
unemployment were politically impossible in Russia.
But, as Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University has repeatedly pointed
out, there is nothing inherently inflationary about a budget deficit so long
as it is financed by external finance rather than printing money. The point
of western aid should have been to stabilise the price level before the
government started the painful task of cutting state subsidies. To make aid
a reward for success has merely made failure inevitable.
Prof Sachs criticism of the IMF is a good example of economics at its best,
challenging conventional wisdom not with the black box of an econometric
model but through a close study of all the available evidence. Economic
analysis is most powerful when it pieces together a number of theoretical
insights and statistical relations to build a convincing alternative view.
Take the Ross Perot charge that import penetration from developing countries
is undermining employment in US manufacturing industry. Is he right? No, say
Robert Lawrence and Paul Krugman of Harvard and MIT, the decline in
manufacturing is much greater than can be explained by trade penetration, as
the lower chart shows. Yes, says Adrian Wood of Sussex University, for their
alternative explanation - technological change favouring skilled workers -
is also driven by the threat of external competition.
Whether the question is how to aid Russia, why consumer spending is so
sluggish or the case for wage subsidies in east Germany, the same
methodology works best. Macro modellers, be they the OECD, the IMF or the
Treasury, should put away their crystal balls and get back to economics.
This is Edward Balls' last column. He is leaving the FT to become economics
adviser to the UK shadow chancellor, Gordon Brown MP.

FT  21 FEB 94 / International Company News: German groups reluctant to list
/ Examining a deep-seated cultural aversion of family-owned companies to the
stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last summer, Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, head of corporate finance at Deutsche Bank,
made a brave prognosis. He predicted that in the medium to long-term,
between 1,500 and 2,000 companies would come to the German stock market
In retrospect, his prediction looks excessively optimistic. In spite of
buoyant stock market conditions last year, only 11 companies went public -
up from seven in 1992 but down from the 19 new issues in 1991 and 26 in
1990. Following last year's listings, the number of companies quoted on the
eight German stock exchanges is now a modest 664.
Collectively, Germany's quoted companies had a market capitalisation of
about DM800bn (Dollars 466bn) at the end of last year. This represents 30 to
35 per cent of Germany's GDP - far less than in the UK, the US, Japan or
Hong Kong, where the stock markets account for between 60 and more than 100
per cent of GDP.
These figures show that Germany's stock market, however popular with
international investors last year (the DAX index of 30 leading shares rose
46.7 per cent in 1993) is underdeveloped.
The capitalisation of the German market is only the third largest in Europe
 -although Germany is Europe's largest economy. The total number of new
issues in Germany over the last 10 years has been about 200 - compared with
180 in the UK last year alone.
'We looked on with envy at the number of new issues in the UK last year,'
said Mr Werner Seifert, chief executive of the Deutsche Borse (the German
stock exchange).
This lack of development means that investors are denied the opportunity to
buy into important sectors of the German economy, such as food manufacturing
or services, because there are few quoted companies in these sectors.
There are at least 2,000 German manufacturing companies with turnover of
DM100m or more, that being the size at which the owners of such companies
could bring them to the stock market in they wanted to.
The problem is, as the meagre new issue statistics show, few owners of such
companies want to bring them to the market. Why should this be?
One consideration is that domestic institutional shareholders - pension
funds and insurance companies which are the natural buyers of new issue
shares - are thin on the ground in Germany.
In 1990, when the Bundesbank last published a study of the ownership
structure of the German stock market, such institutions owned just 12 per
cent of the market - compared with 55 per cent in the UK.
If institutional investors are under-represented on the German stock market,
so are private households, whose share of stock market ownership dropped
from 27 per cent in 1960 to 17 per cent in 1990.
In the case of new issues, investors' suspicions have been underscored by
aggressive pricing. A recent study from Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst, the
German bank owned by Lloyds Bank of the UK, shows that new issues have not
proved to be very rewarding investments over 1992 - 93. Only two of the 1992
new issues outperformed the market last year, while two fell in price and
one went bankrupt.
If these factors explain why there is limited demand for shares in new
companies, they do not address the problem of supply. Owners of large
'mittelstand' companies could overcome these hurdles if they wanted to. That
they do not reflects a deep-seated cultural aversion to the stockmarket.
'Why should I share my independence with anyone else,' asks Mr Reinhold
Wurth, proprietor of the Wurth group, a distributor of screws, fasteners and
other products used by the building trade. With turnover of more than DM3bn
and unbroken profits growth over 40 years, it could easily float. 'But why
should I take such a step as long as I can cover my growth with profits and
cash flow?' Mr Wurth said.
This sentiment is expressed time and time again by family owners of
companies which in the US or the UK would almost without exception be
listed.
The reason is that the move from private company to quote company status
forces a reorientation of priorities. 'It is a big step from managing the
business with a view to paying as small a tax bill as possible to generating
profits for outside shareholders,' says an official at Commerzbank.
'Owners do not want the publicity associated with a quote,' he says. 'They
are not particularly interested in money, either - they are rich enough
already. They are more concerned not to lose their special position within
their local community and are acutely conscious that their power and
influence will disappear. If they sell, they become merely rich - as the
proprietor of a company they really are somebody.'
Even when a family decides to list, it rarely abandons control to the
vagaries of the stock market. Thus the BMW group - majority-owned by the
Quandt family - can enjoy the benefits of the stock market without changing
its essential character as a (very large) family business.
Analysts predict that the number of new issues will accelerate towards the
end of the current decade. But it seems unlikely that an Anglo-American
'equity culture' will be take root in Germany until well into the 21st
century.

FT  21 FEB 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft chief to
spell out future strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled Frankfurt-based metals, mining and
industrial group which came to the brink of collapse last month, will give
the first full account of its future strategy this week following its
DM3.4bn (Dollars 1.98bn) rescue package - and the first detailed explanation
of the events which led to near disaster.
Tomorrow, Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the troubleshooter appointed as chief
executive in December last year, will hold his first press conference since
he took over from the sacked Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch.
Having kept his silence until now, but for a few sentences uttered for the
benefit of the television cameras and a handful of short press releases, he
will outline his plans for the group, which has 58,000 employees working at
258 subsidiaries. He has already said there will be massive redundancies and
that numerous subsidiaries will be sold - details will emerge tomorrow.
On Thursday, Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director who is also
chairman of Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board, will preside over an
extraordinary shareholders' meeting. There are formal legal reasons for the
meeting following the departure of Mr Schimmelbusch and other boardroom
colleagues, but the supervisory board is expected to seize the opportunity
to defend its own conduct throughout the affair.
While tomorrow's press conference is expected to focus on
Metallgesellschaft's future, the annual meeting on Thursday will concentrate
on the past. Mr Schmitz is likely to face a grilling from aggrieved
shareholders anxious to know how it was that the supervisory board -
consisting of some of the most distinguished names in German business -
could have failed to prevent the near catastrophe.
The crisis was triggered by MG Corp, Metallgesellschaft's US trading
subsidiary, whose activities in the oil futures markets are expected to give
rise to a DM1.5bn loss in the current financial year.
Critics will argue at the meeting that beyond the immediate causes of
Metallgesellschaft's problems there is evidence of a 'system failure'
reflecting the close relations between big German banks and the company. 'If
they didn't know what was going on, they failed in their duty to supervise,'
said the chief economist of a foreign bank in Frankfurt. 'If they did know,
there was a cover-up and that is equally bad.
'The problem is that the members of German supervisory boards are
self-selecting; they are members of a club,' the economist continued.
'Shareholders are formally supposed to control the supervisory boards via
the way they vote at annual meetings. But this does not work because the
banks own big stakes themselves and can vote large stakes on behalf of other
shareholders who lodge their shares for custody at the banks.
'Criticism has tended to be dismissed until now but the Metallgesellschaft
case shows that there is a weakness which threatens the fabric of the German
economy,' he concluded.
Mr Schmitz has been praised by fellow board members for the energetic way he
has led the supervisory board at Metallgesellschaft since he took over as
chairman last April. He is likely to argue on Thursday that he was entitled
be kept informed by the management board but that he was not kept in the
picture.

year

<TEXT>
Sega, the Japanese video games group, has warned that pre-tax profits will
drop this financial year, the first fall in 12 years. The company blamed the
decline on the strong yen and the recession in Europe, which led to fierce
price competition.
Pre-tax profits will fall by 24 per cent this year from Y55bn to Y42.5bn
(Dollars 407m), it said. In November, the company forecast a rise to
Y57.5bn. Turnover, which was expected to increase from Y346bn to Y380bn,
will only reach Y351bn, it added.
The group said it expects profits to increase in the next financial year,
helped by the opening of a series of theme parks in Osaka, Yokohama and
Chiba. It also has plans for a joint venture with Universal to open a park
in the US.
Profits next year will also be boosted by the launch of a new home
multimedia video game system called Saturn using 32-bit microprocessors.
Current consoles use 16-bit technology.
Sega forecast consolidated sales for the year to March 31 of Y385bn,
compared with a previous estimate of Y480bn and last year's figure of
Y416bn. Consolidated pre-tax profits would be Y20.5bn, compared with the
previous forecast of Y65bn, and last year's result of Y57.4bn.
The international credit reputation of corporate Japan was further damaged
when Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) was stripped of its triple-A rating by
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency. About Dollars
38bn of rated debt is affected, writes Antonia Sharpe.
The one-notch cut in Tepco's senior debt rating to double-A plus follows a
series of downgradings over the past year of some of Japan's best-known
companies, including Nissan, American Honda and Sony.
S&amp;P said the downgrade of Tepco's rating, which has now been removed from
CreditWatch, reflects the erosion of its financial profile.

<TEXT>
Air Canada, having settled its two-year dispute with rival Canadian
International over ticket reservation systems, is 'on the way back to
profitability in 1994,' says Mr Hollis Harris, chairman, writes Robert
Gibbens in Montreal.
An improving North American airline market, new international and regional
routes and more gains in productivity should make the turnround possible, he
said in a preliminary report for 1993.
The airline posted losses for the three previous years. Operating results in
1993 showed a profit of CDollars 77m (USDollars 57m) against a loss of
CDollars 145m in 1992. But after special items totalling CDollars 263m,
there was a final net loss of CDollars 326m, or CDollars 4.23 a share,
against a loss of CDollars 454m, or CDollars 6.13.
The special items included a CDollars 80m provision for its remaining
investment in GPA, CDollars 31m for its investment in the Gemini reservation
system and CDollars 76m for further staff cuts.

Aegon, the Dutch insurance group, has decided to withdraw from the Belgian
market and sell its insurance activities there to Almanij-Kredietbank, the
Belgian savings bank group, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam.
Neither company would disclose the price commanded by Aegon's Belgian
insurance business, which generates annual premium income of around BFr3.5bn
(Dollars 95m).
The transaction will more than double Almanij's premium income from
insurance activities to BFr8bn.
Aegon said it was withdrawing from Belgium because of the absence of
expansion opportunities and the fact that its insurance activities lacked
the necessary critical mass.

FT  21 FEB 94 / International Company News: Endesa plans share offer to
raise further Pta200bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Endesa, Spain's partially -privatised state-controlled electricity
distributor and generator, is to put 10 per cent of its equity on the market
in the first half of this year in an international public offering worth an
estimated Pta200bn (Dollars 1.43bn).
The offering, which will be managed by Goldman Sachs of the US, and
Argentaria, the government-controlled domestic banking group, will have a
domestic retail tranche and one aimed at international institutions. It is
understood that a separate tranche, representing just over half the total
equity offered, could be placed with National Power of the UK and with
Germany's RWE.
INI, the public sector conglomerate which owns Endesa, placed 23 per cent of
the utility on the market in 1988 and a further 10 per cent two years ago on
the New York Stock Exchange in the form of ADRs.
Endesa's group 1993 net profit was Pta116.8bn, up 9.9 per cent from the
previous year. Earnings per share rose to Pta449.3 from Pta408.
A further partial privatisation by Endesa had been expected this year to
offset an escalating general government deficit that threatens to rise to
8.5 per cent of GDP against an official 6.4 per cent target. Other offerings
of government-controlled equity to raise revenue this year could include
Telefonica Internacional, the international unit of the domestic
telecommunications group, and Tabacalera, the tobacco group.
Last year, as recession began to make strong inroads on the budget, the
government's energy conglomerate Repsol, again advised by Goldman Sachs,
realised Pta110bn when it placed 13 per cent of its equity on the market,
and Argentaria, using Morgan Stanley as its global co-ordinator, realised
Pta290bn in two public share offerings that brought public ownership of the
banking group down to 50 per cent.

FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Honda may hold the ace when cards are
revealed / The future of Rover as talks between BMW and Honda start today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the three weeks since Rover was sold to BMW, the German car maker and
Honda Motor, Rover's partner for 15 years, have been eyeing each other
closely to see which will blink first.
The poker game begins in earnest today in Tokyo as Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder,
BMW's chairman, begins talks with Mr Nibuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president.
Both parties have powerful cards to play.
Honda's wounded pride and loss of face caused by British Aerospace's sale of
its 80 per cent stake in Rover might suggest a complete severing of Honda's
links with Rover.
Honda, in fact, has the power in its Rover agreements to shut down much of
Rover. It can give seven days' notice to cancel its key contracts if Rover
was sold to another party.
That, however, would fly in the face of commercial common sense, at least in
the medium term. It has too much to lose from selling parts to Rover and,
anyway, the relationship cannot physically be unpicked overnight.
But BMW's wish that 'in this new scenario Rover Cars will naturally continue
its agreements with Honda in every respect', is just as unlikely to come to
pass.
BMW wants Rover, for example, to give it a market presence in the
lower-medium front-wheel drive sector. Rover plans to launch next year a
replacement to its 200/400 series, jointly developing the model with Honda
in Project Theta. Yet, the partners are understood to have failed yet to
sign a full production agreement, and Honda could baulk.
Honda sees the German car maker as one of its most potent rivals in the
world car market, and it is impossible to expect that Honda's doors can now
remain as open to Rover.
Assuming Honda does not plump for the 'doomsday' scenario, there there are
three levels of collaboration between Honda and Rover, which the Japanese
car maker and BMW must now address:
licensing agreements on original Honda products;
the selling and buying of components;
production and technology transfer from Honda to Rover.
These links are cemented by Honda's 20 per cent equity stake in the whole of
the Rover vehicle operations (including Land Rover) and Rover's 20 per cent
stake in Honda's UK assembly plant at Swindon.
Licensing: Most of Rover's cars are based on or dependent on Honda designs
and are produced under direct licence from Honda. These agreements can be
terminated at three months' notice.
Whole vehicles subject to them are the Rover 600 and 400 models. But Rover
has greater leeway on the 200 hatchback. Because the 200 was a jointly
developed vehicle, Rover enjoys component supply contracts for as long as it
builds the current model.
This anomaly arose because the Honda Concerto model, on which the Rover
200/400 range is based, appeared in Japan first as a saloon, and the 400 was
licensed directly from it, whereas the 200 was developed jointly.
Typical of critical component issues is the gearbox used on Rover's own two
litre engines. This is a Honda product made under licence by Rover at its
Longbridge plant in Birmingham. Withdrawal of its licence could disrupt much
of the rest of Rover's car range apart from the ageing Montego, Maestro,
Metro and Mini models.
The 800 executive car range would be affected even though the car itself has
long since diverged from the Honda Legend, on which it was based. However,
Honda must supply other key components in it - notably the 2.7 litre Honda
V6 engine - for as long as Rover wants to build the car.
Buying and selling components: this is a normal arm's length
customer-supplier relationship for most components, involving two-way
transactions of close to Pounds 400m a year. For example, Honda sells facias
to Rover for the Rover 600 and Rover sells Honda the body panels  - produced
at Rover's Swindon stamping plant - for the Honda Accord, which Honda
produces at its own assembly plant in Swindon.
The contracts state supplies must continue for as long as each partner is
producing a particular model.
However, these contracts are subservient to the licensing agreements. Honda
considers that it could legitimately pull the plug on much of Rover's model
range, even though Rover could still be legally required to continue
providing body panels for the Accord. But pulling the plug would severely
disrupt production at Honda's own plant in Swindon.
Manufacturing and technology transfer: much of the equipment and tooling
used by Rover to build the 600 and 200/400 were developed and supplied by
Honda.
The equipment was replicated and transferred into Rover's Longbridge plant,
thus saving Rover heavy expenditures on developing production facilities for
new models. A highly sophisticated multi-welder for body shells, for
example, is from Honda Engineering. If Honda terminated the relevant
agreements, however, Rover could maintain the equipment adequately for the
life of current models.
Another key element of the relationship is the maintenance of the component
supplier base. Honda manages its supplier base of 160 companies on behalf of
itself and Rover, and Rover does the same with its suppliers feeding Rover's
plants and Honda's at Swindon.
The overall appearance of cars might not change but their parts are updated
constantly as part of the Japanese-inspired philosophy of continuous
improvement.
Lack of access by either partner to the database which keeps track of 20,000
parts could bring chaos to production lines as component mismatches
proliferated.
One measure of the trust Honda and Rover had developed is that the database
for the Accord/Rover 600 is managed and maintained only by Honda at Swindon.
Working relationships: Honda believes BMW may not have understood how
dependent Rover is on Honda, and how close working relations had become.
'Honda-Rover is not only a business-based corporate relationship', according
to one senior Honda executive in Europe. 'So many engineers, so many
managers and so many production people have worked closely together for 15
years. This working together is a quite unique experience for the Japanese
people as well as the British and I believe that it could create very good
mutual understanding between our two cultures.
'For most of the people involved in this collaboration it has been not only
their job but their life, including their families.'
Some 150 Rover personnel went to Japan to learn production start-up
techniques for the Rover 200/400. And some 40 Japanese Honda staff and their
families went to Birmingham to stay for nearly three years in getting the
project off the ground.
When Honda asked Rover to build its Concerto model at Longbridge, Honda
opened its factories to Rover staff to allow them to feed back quality
information. The information exchange has accelerated ever since. 'So there
is not only information exchange in the conference room there was
hand-to-hand working together on the shop floor', the Honda executive said.
For its part, BMW can offer Honda the lucrative opportunity of continuing to
work with Rover and, for example, to supply Land-Rover Discovery four-wheel
drive vehicles with Honda badges for the Japanese market.
But Honda is sure of its bargaining power. As one senior Honda executive put
it informally: 'We hold a card hand of nine aces - but the British public
does not know this fact.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: 74 per cent of Europa Minerals'
shareholders accept Burmine offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 15m offer for Europa Minerals, the UK-quoted mining finance
house, was accepted by holders of 74.4 per cent of the issued capital by the
first closing date, according to its adviser Samuel Montagu.
Montagu said that acceptances included 5.5 per cent of Europa held by SBN
Nominees and beneficially owned by Mount Edon Gold, the Australian company
which previously opposed the merger. Mount Edon has also made a hostile bid
for Burmine, the Australian group making the recommended offer for Europa.
However, Mount Edon's financial public relations advisers in London said
there must be another explanation for SBN's acceptance as Mount Edon would
not have accepted the Burmine offer for any of its Europa shares. Mount Edon
owns 19.9 per cent of the UK company.
Burmine's offer has been extended until March 4 but the merger - a three-way
affair also involving Austmin Gold, another Australian company, for which
Burmine has made a friendly bid - cannot be completed until the result of
various legal actions in Australia are known. Montagu said these might be
cleared away this week.

FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Oyston puts Trans World stake up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Owen Oyston, the flamboyant businessman who owns Blackpool Football Club,
has put up for sale his 24 per cent stake in Trans World Communications, the
independent radio group. A further 4 per cent, owned by associates of Mr
Oyston, are also on the market.
The move is likely to trigger a battle for control of the company involving
Emap, the publishing group which owns almost 30 per cent of the shares, and
the Guardian newspaper group, which has 20 per cent.
Under the current rules on cross-media ownership the Guardian could not
increase its shareholding. But it might seek a 'safe' home for Mr Oyston's
stake in the expectation that the rules will soon be relaxed.
Were Emap to buy the stake and so take control, it is thought it would have
to sell one of Trans World's stations to stay within the limits on market
share. Trans World owns Piccadilly in Manchester, Red Rose in Lancashire,
Red Dragon in South Wales and Aire in West Yorkshire. Emap already owns the
Liverpool station Radio City.
Since letting it be known that the stake was up for sale Mr Oyston said that
'some quite seriously interested parties' had contacted him.
He needs the money to fund the Pounds 50m first phase of his long-planned
redevelopment of Blackpool's stadium where planning permission 'now looks
almost certain'.
Trans World's shares, which closed up 11p at 159p on Friday, have risen by
60 per cent in the last three weeks.
Mr Oyston is looking to sell the stake at a premium to Friday's market price
which valued the holding at almost Pounds 15m.

FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Unipalm to market via Pounds 5.5m placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unipalm, a Cambridge-based computer communications company, is coming to
market by way of a placing to raise approximately Pounds 5.5m net of
expenses. Sponsored by Henry Cooke Corporate Finance, it is expected to
value the company at between Pounds 15m and Pounds 18m.
Unipalm, now eight years old, is a leading UK specialist in methods of
attaching commercial organisations to a global computer network known as the
Internet. The potential of the Internet remains comparatively untapped in
the UK, but interest is growing rapidly in the US.
Unipalm has two principal operating companies. One distributes
interconnection software while the other, Pipex, founded in January 1992,
specialises in Internet connection. Pipex is under contract to the BBC to
provide a low cost Internet connection to accompany a new series 'The Net',
scheduled for April.
In the year to April 30, 1993 the distribution business made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 897,000 on Pounds 8m sales. In the first half of the current year,
pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 461,000 on sales of Pounds 4.35m.
Pipex, however, incurred Pounds 308,000 losses on sales of Pounds 381,000 in
its first year and a further Pounds 313,000 on sales of Pounds 592,000 in
the first half of the current year. Overall, the group made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 148,000 on sales of Pounds 4.94m.
The company has some 200 customers including Dixons and Pilkington
representing 70 per cent of the UK commercial Internet market. Recurrent
revenues from these customers are running at Pounds 1.5m a year.
Mr Peter Dawe, a Unipalm co-founder and now Pipex managing director, said
funds were being raised to expand the Internet interconnection business,
currently expanding at 100 per cent a year. He believed growth rates of
treble that amount a year were possible, admittedly from a low base point.
The Internet is not a single system but a self-regulating collection of over
14,000 networks across the globe. It has its origins in academic and defence
networks in the US and has been seen principally as a low cost electronic
mail system for hobbyists.
During the 1991 Soviet coup it was credited with providing a reliable path
for information in and out of Moscow.

FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pulling the global pearls together - Cable
and Wireless' investment strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT comment last June that Cable and Wireless, the UK telecommunications
group, has 'pearls scattered around the world but lacks a thread to pull
them together,' reflected the thinking of some of the company's senior
executives.
Mr James Ross - the urbane and determined former chairman of BP America
brought in as chief executive two years ago by C&amp;W's chairman, Lord Young -
insists the company has now discovered the string to tie together a host of
activities from Mercury in the UK to Optus in Australia, the challenger to
the former Antipodean state telecoms monopoly.
'We are not just a holding company for a diverse range of telecoms
activities: we make sense as a federation, and intend to strengthen the
bonds between the different parts,' said Mr Ross.
C&amp;W, he argues, is currently undervalued because it does not attract the
premium it deserves as a sum of more than its parts.
The essential bond the company has now discovered is a 'coherent investment
strategy' giving pride of place to growth in the Asia-Pacific region. This
is the home of Hong Hong Telecom, C&amp;W's richest pearl, which accounted last
year for Pounds 554m of its Pounds 829m operating profit.
Mr Ross spells out what this priority means: a commitment 'over the medium
term' to devote Hong Kong Telecom's free cash flow to investments in the
Asia-Pacific.
'Outside Hong Kong we have underinvested in the area and we are now intent
on growing other Asian opportunities.'
Mr Ross highlighted opportunities to build and operate networks in
under-developed Asian markets. China is the 'great object' but, with
telecoms racing ahead in all parts of the region, 'not the sole magnet.'
'Other companies' - for which read BT and AT&amp;T in their ambitions to be
global providers to the multinationals - 'don't really go in for those
(construction projects). We are playing a different competitive game, which
is not the big multinationals.'
He is also explicit about C&amp;W's European strategy, which is two-pronged. In
the larger markets, like Germany and France, C&amp;W will be the 'Mercury in
Europe', building networks to challenge the monopolies of state operators as
liberalisation advances.
In the smaller markets, such as Ireland and Portugal, it is looking for
opportunities to partner existing monopoly operators.
'We don't believe there is enough room for a national competitor, and the
existing operators need an international player like us.'
What will unite the federation?
People, products and a global network capacity, said Mr Ross.
He pointed to the swapping of senior managers, like the recent exchange
between the deputy chief executives of Mercury and Hong Kong Telecom; and he
emphasised the convergence, in terms of services and marketing, of world
telecoms markets. 'Take Hong Kong: we have got competition there next year,
and intend to make full use of our experience as the under-dog in Britain in
facing it.'
Mr Ross's strategy faces an immediate objection.
As a company less than a third the size of BT, how is C&amp;W going to fund
serious expansion from three hubs worldwide - the third being the Caribbean
region? More-over, to make itself attractive to the Chinese, C&amp;W arguably
needs an image more regional than global.
Mr Ross implicitly accepted both points by playing down the investment
outlays to be expected outside Asia-Pacific, and stressing the trend towards
indigenous management, as reflected in the recent appointment of Mr Linus
Cheung, deputy managing director of Cathay Pacific Airways, as chief
executive of Hong Kong Telecom.
'Partnership is the key', said Mr Ross.
'We can't even try to operate on our own in many places, but we have
experience and networks that can bring a lot to any partnership, whether in
China or Germany.'
As for resources, he cited C&amp;W's low gearing (about 13 per cent), suggesting
an increase in spending from the current Pounds 1bn a year to Pounds 1.5bn
to be 'a responsible objective'.
The strategy has clear attractions. Partnership between indigenous and
overseas operators is the industry trend, from cellular mobile services in
Europe and the US to basic line-building ventures in Asia.
For governments and indigenous telecoms operators, C&amp;W has a top-notch name
without being one of the large, perhaps more threatening, US or European
forces.
The capacity to learn in one market to profit in another will give a
critical edge as competition advances. To benefit, it may not be size so
much as presence that matters, and C&amp;W's presence is more widely spread than
most.
But if Hong Telecom's free cash flow is to go into Asia, a question mark
must be raised over the European strand to C&amp;W's thread, particularly if
Mercury's profits are depressed by the explosion of competition in the UK.
As Mr Ross puts it: 'we don't have a home market: we only came back to the
UK in the last 10 years.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Granada rejects LWT argument in bid battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada yesterday dismissed LWT's defence against its hostile Pounds 800m
bid as 'strong on presentation but weak on content'.
In a final letter to LWT shareholders, Mr Alex Bernstein, chairman of
Granada, rejects LWT's argument that the offer undervalues the company
compared with the agreed takeovers of Central Independent Television and
Anglia.
Mr Bernstein says that Granada's offer represents 27.6 times LWT's estimated
1993 earnings, while the recommended offer from Carlton for Central
represented 25.1 times brokers' estimates for the target's 1993 earnings.
As for the price paid by MAI for Anglia, Mr Bernstein said that this was
justified because of Anglia's particularly valuable investments and because
it has much higher operational gearing than LWT.
He added that 'moreover, in 1993 Anglia's share of net advertising revenue
continued to increase, whereas LWT's share fell compared with 1992.'
Granada says that LWT bases much of its argument on one year's estimated
profits and Mr Bernstein warns LWT shareholders: 'You should question how
sustainable the rate of increase shown by LWT in its 1993 profits will prove
to be.'
The offer closes this Friday.

FT  21 FEB 94 / US rail group plans gold float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Santa Fe Pacific, the US railroad group, is expected soon to float its gold
subsidiary on terms that would give Santa Fe Gold Corporation a market value
of at least Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn).
Analysts suggest the stock market launch of Santa Fe Gold will follow
closely behind the eagerly-anticipated Dollars 1bn flotation in London and
Ghana of Ashanti Goldfields.
Santa Fe Gold includes some of the US assets Hanson, the Anglo-American
conglomerate, acquired with Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK and swapped
last year for Santa Fe's coal and aggregate operations.
This deal transformed Santa Fe Gold into the sixth largest North American
gold producer with an anticipated 1994 output of 900,000 troy ounces. It
also has one of the biggest gold reserves in North America: 14m ounces.
Analysts expect the parent to do an IPO (initial public offering) of about
20 per cent of Santa Fe Gold to raise Dollars 200m to Dollars 300m. Santa Fe
would then dividend its entire holding to the parent group's shareholders so
by the end of this year the gold company would have a free float of 100 per
cent.
Santa Fe would not discuss the issue, probably because it felt constrained
by US regulations, but analysts were alerted in June when the group applied
for a ruling from the tax authorities that the distribution of the Santa Fe
Gold shares would be tax free. Such rulings typically take between six and
nine months to be made known.
Ms Lindsey Falconer, analyst at Ord Minnett, an affiliate of the Jardine
Fleming group, suggested the tax ruling was likely to be favourable but,
even it it was not, Santa Fe would go ahead with the IPO. She estimated the
gold subsidiary was worth Dollars 1.6bn or about Dollars 8.50 per Santa Fe
share.
'The stock looks very attractive when compared with other senior North
American producers, it will be seen as a core holding among the North
American gold shares and will be eligible for inclusion in the new Financial
Times Gold Index,' she said.
Santa Fe Gold now has three mines in northern Nevada: Lone Tree, Mesquite
and Twin Creeks (a combination of Hanson's Chimney Creek mine and Santa Fe's
Rabbit Creek). It is one of the biggest holders of minerals rights in the
western US - 7.2m acres in some of the most prospective regions, inherited
from its parent.

FT  21 FEB 94 / The regulator armed with a horse-whip: Andrew Large talks to
Norma Cohen on the future of the investment industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Large, the bespectacled, slightly stoop-shouldered chief City
regulator is poking, prodding, coaxing and in some cases, horse-whipping the
investment industry into the 21st century.
His personal demeanor is more of a poodle than a Rottweiler but he is the
instigator of a radical shake-up of the investment industry for small
investors and large securities firms alike.
In the 18 months since he took on the role of chairman of the Securities and
Investments Board, he has forced an overhaul of the way retail financial
services are regulated despite the implacable hostility of the insurance
industry. This week, he will unveil the blueprint for the Personal
Investment Authority, the vehicle for far tougher oversight than yet
achieved.
And last week, he launched a review of the way wholesale markets operate and
suggested that, to make markets more efficient and competitive, professional
investors may have to give up some of the practices which have protected
their profits.
He concedes that some suggestions made in his report, couched in the
non-combative language of a discussion document, are radical. But he says
London must face the issues. 'All these issues have been addressed in the
US. Any financial centre that aspires to be a major financial centre must
answer these questions,' he says. 'If we don't do this, we are not doing our
duty.'
Moreover, he has announced a permanent group of securities regulators to
improve the ferreting out and punishment of wrongdoing in the securities
industry. Regulators ought to act as a 'street-wise support' to criminal
prosecutors, helping them obtain convictions.
Mr Large acknowledges as legitimate the public anger over the failure of the
criminal courts to convict and punish individuals widely accused of cheating
investors and says that something must be done.
Former colleagues say his boffin-like demeanor is misleading. 'He is out to
win,' says a colleague who worked closely with him at Swiss Bank Corporation
in London in the 1980s. 'And if he can't win, he'll get out.'
Proof of that, colleagues say, was his decision to quit the board of SBC
after two years, despite the prestige of having been the first foreigner
named to such a post.
'He came in early one morning and tried to make himself a cup of coffee. The
staff wouldn't let him do it - they said directors don't make coffee,' says
one former colleague.
Aside from the cultural differences, there were other difficulties over the
board's reluctance to consider expansion projects he thought necessary.
For his part, he speaks glowingly of his 10 years at SBC, during which time
he established the bank as a major force in international finance,
particularly in Eurobonds. But he does describe his years on the board as
'stressful'.
Former associates give fulsome praise to him for intellectual adroitness and
management skills. 'His organisational skills are second to none,' says one
ex-SBC official. Moreover, he was sufficiently international in character -
he was carted around the world as a child by his father, an army doctor - to
win business where others could not.
Former associates describe an almost complete lack of humour. Not one
recalls a joke or prank committed by him - a unique trait in the Eurobond
markets where absurd personalities abound. In an interview, he intoned with
a straight face that he could never be a doctor like his father because 'I
don't have any patience,' oblivious to his own pun.
An intensely private person, at first blush, he hardly appeared the catalyst
to shake up the investment industry when he was appointed to head the SIB in
June 1992.
A product of Winchester College and Cambridge University, his first job was
with British Petroleum which sent him to Malaysia. Back in London, he was in
charge of an abortive project to extract protein from fuel oil. The turning
point came, he says, when BP offered him the opportunity to train for an MBA
at Insead, the French management school.
Insead was wonderful, he says. 'It was totally international. You didn't
care where anyone was from.' The year there gave him his interest in
finance.
But he says BP refused to give him a job in finance because he wasn't an
accountant, and he jumped ship to work at Orion Bank, a consortium set up by
six foreign banks. After 10 years there, he was one of a group of five
poached by SBC in 1979 to set up international activities based in London.
While he was at SBC he first entered the regulatory arena. He was chairman
of the Securities Association, the precursor of the current self-regulatory
body and in that role, fought hard to reduce the regulatory burden on
professional investors envisaged in the newly-created Financial Services
Act.
He says he still believes professional markets require a different
regulatory approach than retail markets with their unsophisticated
investors.
Asked whether he still believes in self-regulation, he demurs. 'I don't
think self-regulation should be a theology.'
'If regulation is going to work so that investors are going to be protected
in an efficient manner then you must have practitioners involved in it.'
The extent to which practitioners should be involved in writing the City's
rules will be the stickiest question for the remainder of his term. His main
challenge will be to ensure that whatever the regulatory regime when his
term is over, City hearts and minds are in it too.

Three UK composite insurers reporting results for 1993 this week are

trading conditions. Guardian Royal Exchange starts the ball rolling tomorrow
with its pre-tax profits expected to be between Pounds 135m and Pounds 170m,
before investment gains are brought into the picture. That compares with
comparable profits of Pounds 3m in 1992.
Commercial Union, the most successful of the UK composites in recent years,
is expected to post profits of between Pounds 179m and Pounds 213m when it
reports on Wednesday compared with Pounds 24m last time. Finally on Thursday
Royal Insurance is expected to register profits of between Pounds 120m and
Pounds 160m against a Pounds 27m loss in 1992.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Analysts focus on state of play
more than profits - ICI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI reports its first set of full-year figures since the demerger of Zeneca
last summer on Thursday.
Thanks largely to cost-cutting and currency gains profits before
exceptionals are expected to have doubled to between Pounds 270m and Pounds
300m.
Analysts' estimates for 1993 are in a tight range and attention will focus
on the company's comments about the state of its major markets.
It is expected to be quite positive about the US and UK but to report that
continental Europe remains very tough both in terms of volumes and prices.
Even if German interest rate cuts continue few observers expect much
recovery this year and a stronger pound would make ICI's life more
difficult. The recent failure of European manufacturers to agree on a
restructuring of ethylene production underlined the deep-rooted problems of
an industry dogged by overcapacity.
Analysts will be expecting an update on ICI's own restructuring programme,
which has meant hefty rationalisation costs over the past three years.
In 1992 the combined group reported a loss of Pounds 384m after exceptionals
of Pounds 949m. There are expected to have been further provisions last year
including a Pounds 100m charge associated with the proposed disposal of its
American composite materials business and Pounds 30m for the closure of
Electrochlor, its indirectly owned PVC manufacturer in Argentina. Analyst
Ian John at NatWest Securities predicts FRS3 pre-tax profits of Pounds 107m
after exceptionals.
Analysts have been downgrading their forecasts for the current year and,
unless ICI is more bullish than expected, most are likely to maintain their
view that the shares are now discounting its medium-term recovery potential.
The City is expecting unchanged dividends of 27.5p compared with underlying
earnings of about 22.5p.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Great expectations despite harder
 -Astra
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Satisfying investors' high expectations has become a familiar problem for
Astra as the Swedish pharmaceuticals group may discover again on Friday when
it presents its 1993 figures. The group's record speaks for itself: for 15
consecutive years up to 1992 profits growth outstripped sales and the feat
will almost certainly have been repeated last year.
Analysts' expectations range widely, but the average forecast is for pre-tax
profits of SKr7.7bn - SKr7.8bn (Pounds 655m), up around 50 per cent on
1992's SKr5.12bn. The 1992 dividend of SKr1 per share (adjusted for a share
split) is expected to be raised to at least SKr1.5.
The wide range of forecasts stems from uncertainty over the fourth quarter
performance after sizzling profits growth in the first nine months.
The key to the group's success has been the spectacular growth of two drugs:
Losec, an anti-peptic ulcer drug, and Pulmicort, an anti-asthma agent. But
like other pharmaceuticals groups worldwide, the company has had less
success in raising prices because of government clampdowns on healthcare
spending.
Investors will therefore be looking for a positive statement about
prospects. Again, expectations are running high: Kleinwort Benson, for
example, is already penciling in profits of SKr9.8bn for the current year.

FT  21 FEB 94 / C&amp;W to raim at Asia-Pacific region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable and Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, intends to make the
Asia-Pacific region its prime investment focus for the next decade.
Mr James Ross, C&amp;W's chief executive, told the FT that a strategy review had
made telecoms growth opportunities in the Asia-Pacific the company's chief
priority.
He said the 'medium-term objective' was to devote the free cash flow of Hong
Kong Telecom, which is 57.5 per cent owned by C&amp;W, to investment in the
Asia-Pacific region, allowing for a 'proper dividend' to the group.
That implies a large concentration of investment in the Asia-Pacific region,
since HK Telecom last year accounted for nearly two-thirds of C&amp;W's Pounds
829m operating profit, although the Asia-Pacific region accounted for only
44 per cent of C&amp;W's turnover.
He added that C&amp;W did not attach 'high priority' to the rush to
international telecoms alliances led by British Telecommunications and
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
'C&amp;W is a federation in its own right, and we don't need others just to give
us a global capacity,' he said.
In Europe, Mr Ross affirmed C&amp;W's determination to pursue opportunities as
the European Union liberalises telecommunications services.

FT  21 FEB 94 / BMW talks to Honda on Rover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW is expected to start learning in Tokyo today Honda's response to the
German carmaker's Pounds 800m plan to buy Rover Group, Honda's UK partner.
Talks this week involving Honda executives and teams led by Mr Bernd
Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, and Mr John Towers, chief executive of
Rover, will help determine whether Honda will continue under BMW's majority
ownership its 15-year partnership with Rover.
Last night Honda, which has a 20 per cent stake in Rover, was giving no
clues as to which way it might jump. Its agreements with Rover allow it to
break formal ties as little as seven days after the passing of Rover into
new ownership.
However, analysts this weekend said such a move would be almost
inconceivable given the commercial value to Honda of its collaboration with
Rover. Honda receives some Pounds 400m annually in parts revenue alone, for
example.
The Japanese carmaker has made clear its anger at the intended deal, which
it regards as a betrayal of the close working relationship which has
developed between Honda and Rover.
But this anger is directed solely at Rover's current owner, British
Aerospace. Honda executives say that Rover itself has been powerless to
prevent its own sale.
BMW hopes to persuade Honda to stay in the partnership. However, Honda
regards BMW as a rival, strongly wished for Rover to remain independent, and
at the least is expected to extract a high commercial price for not pulling
out.
Should Honda be persuaded to form a long-term, tripartite collaboration, 'it
would be a seminal event which could change the status of the motor industry
for ever', and guarantee the futures of all three, according to Professor
Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School
and adviser to the House of Commons select committee on trade and industry.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Swiss vote to banish transit lorries from the Alps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss moved boldly yesterday to protect their alpine environment, voting
in a plebiscite to ban all transit lorry traffic through the Swiss Alps
within 10 years even though such a ban is likely to worsen relations between
their government and the European Union.
Nearly 52 per cent of those who went to the polls voted in support of the
ban, defying the Swiss government's strong denunciation of the proposal. Two
years ago, Bern signed a 12-year accord with the EU to restrain the growth
of transit lorry traffic in the Alps. It argued in the referendum campaign
that this provided adequate protection, but will no longer be able to
respect that agreement.
It is the second time in less than two years that the Swiss people have
voted to undo agreements between their government and the EU. In December
1992 they rejected proposals to join the European Economic Area, a free
trade zone linking the countries of the European Free Trade Association with
the EU.
In Brussels, an EU official said the decision was regrettable. Bern fears
that the EU will be reluctant to enter planned bilateral negotiations over
air traffic rights in the union for Swissair and other issues.
There was jubilation in the tiny canton of Uri, which lies in a narrow
mountain valley leading up to the Gotthard Pass, the shortest road and rail
route between Germany and Italy. It was there that a petition was drawn up
in 1990 proposing that all transit lorry traffic be forced to move to the
railways after a 10-year transition period and all Swiss transit-related
motorway construction be halted.
About 2,500 lorries go through the Gotthard Pass each day, of which 1,000
are in transit. Much of this is EU traffic.
A crestfallen Mr Adolf Ogi, the Swiss transport minister, said the
government would do what it could to minimise discrimination against EU
lorries, but there is little room for manoeuvre. Under Switzerland's system
of direct democracy, the people's decision in a plebiscite is binding.
The result could also complicate the EU's enlargement negotiations with
Austria, now in an intense final phase. Austrians are also upset about the
pollution caused in Alpine valleys by transit lorries. Their determination
to prevent any further liberalisation of transit traffic could be stiffened
by the Swiss vote.
Mr Viktor Klima, Austria's transport minister, noted in Brussels yesterday
that the vote was a signal that Europeans wanted a more environmentally
friendly transport policy.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Rise in legal claims hits top accountancy firms: Auditors
say they are turning away high-risk clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's six largest accountancy firms faced about 600 legal claims last
year and paid up to 8 per cent of their audit income on costs related to
legal actions.
The number of claims has risen sharply in recent years, following growing
litigation against auditors in the US, much of it considered by the
profession to be unjustified.
The figures were compiled for two studies as part of a campaign to reform
the law of unlimited liability on auditors and will be submitted to the
Department of Trade and Industry.
The growing size and number of claims makes commercial insurance cover much
more difficult to obtain. Accountancy firms say they have started to turn
away high-risk clients, and begun negotiating limits on their legal
liability for non-audit work.
A working group of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales tackling litigation claims says the average claims in the largest
three lawsuits last year were nearly Pounds 500m, compared with Pounds 40m
10 years ago. The figures exclude exceptional claims for more than Dollars
8bn relating to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The largest claims are several times the average limits on commercial
insurance cover, currently about Dollars 100m (Pounds 68m). Payments higher
than those limits are covered from insurance mutuals and the firms' own
resources.
The working group's paper is to be discussed by the institute's council on
March 2 as part of an effort to win support across the profession for a
campaign by the eight largest accountancy firms.
Separate information compiled by the firms' insurers showing the proportion
of audit income spent on litigation-related costs has been produced at the
request of government officials.
The accountancy firms want section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act removed.
This forbids auditors to negotiate for a cap on their liabilities in the
event that they are sued.
Some observers have criticised the campaign for its self-interest, and
accused the profession of selecting favourable or incomplete data. For
example, the fee income figures to which litigation costs are compared do
not take into account revenues from non-audit income, such as consultancy
work which may have been generated by the audit.
The information on which the calculations are based is also not publicly
available. The firms refuse to publish any of their own financial
information.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Taiwan and Boeing in talks on joint regional jet project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan Aerospace is in talks with Boeing over possible joint development of
a 100-seat regional jet.
The move follows the failure of talks last year between the aerospace
company, which is 29 per cent owned by the Taiwan government, and British
Aerospace to co-operate on a similar project.
The proposed collaboration with Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of
commercial aircraft, could also involve co-operation with the Chinese
aircraft industry as well as Japan.
The talks are the third attempt by Taiwan Aerospace, created three years ago
to spearhead the country's ambitions to develop an aerospace industry, to
forge an international partnership. The first proposed link was with
McDonnell Douglas of the US.
Mr Richard Albrecht, a Boeing executive vice-president, said yesterday the
US company was discussing the possibility of developing either a 100-seat
aircraft or a small derivative of its 737 twin-engine airliner with Taiwan,
China and possibly Japan. Mr Albrecht, attending a Financial Times aerospace
conference on the eve of the Singapore Air Show, also confirmed that Boeing
was conducting separate studies with the three Japanese aerospace companies
(Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy
Industries) on development of a 100-seat airliner.
It was too early to say whether the Japanese companies, already
long-standing partners on other Boeing programmes, would participate on a
broader collaboration project with Taiwan and China. But Boeing is stepping
up efforts to put into place a longer term strategy to increase its
penetration of a fast growing Chinese aviation market.
Mr Albrecht said he would soon visit Taiwan to discuss collaboration.
Taiwan had attempted for the past year to forge a joint regional jet venture
with BAe. But the two sides failed to reach agreement and negotiations were
suspended three months ago. Even more ambitious partnership discussions
between Taiwan Aerospace and McDonnell Douglas collapsed in 1992.
McDonnell Douglas and Boeing received a boost last week with the
announcement of an intended Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) commercial aircraft
order from Saudi Arabia. The two US manufacturers are to send delegations to
Saudi Arabia on March 20 to start negotiating details of the contract to
supply about 50 aircraft to Saudia, the national airline.
Mr Albrecht said Saudi Arabia had also asked the US manufacturers to propose
a substantial aircraft support and maintenance package which could involve
'several hundred million of dollars more'. He confirmed that the Saudis had
not yet decided what aircraft types they intended to purchase.
Although Rolls-Royce, the UK aero engine manufacturer, supplied the power
plants for Saudia's existing fleet of 747s, the latest order is likely to
involve US-made engines because of the strong political impetus behind the
Saudi deal, according to European aerospace officials.

FT  21 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Index-linked gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has not been a good year for index-linked gilts so far. Having finished
1993 around 2.85 per cent, real yields are now back over 3 per cent. In
theory, index-linked paper ought to provide a haven for worried equity
investors. The two instruments have a similar structure, in that capital
value and annual payout on equities tend to increase with inflation too. But
equities carry an additional company risk and, at only around 0.25 per cent,
the difference between the FT-A All - Share dividend yield and real yields
on index-linked gilts is the lowest for almost two years. That should make
index-linked attractive, but it probably says more about the degree to which
equities are over-valued.
Part of the trouble is the perennial lack of liquidity in the index-linked
market. But inflationary and exchange rate worries have not subsided enough
to allow real yields on conventional bonds to fall much below 3 per cent.
Since real yields on index-linked issues tend to follow those on
conventional gilts, the chance of further progress is limited for
index-linked as well.
Indeed, the low coupons on index-linked gilts produce a gearing effect which
means their prices fall more sharply than those of conventional gilts when
real yields are rising. That reduces their safe-haven attraction. In
contrast, index-linked will outperform conventional issues when higher
inflation rather than upward pressure on real yields is causing fixed-rate
prices to fall. Last week's retail and producer price figures suggest that
point is still some way off.

FT  21 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Swiss banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 36 per cent increase in Swiss Bank Corporation's latest annual net
profit bodes well for other Swiss banks due to report soon. Though part of
the increase was due to an apparent drop in the tax charge, there is little
doubt that the bank has made a killing on derivative trading. And while the
44 per cent increase in provisions and other charges in part reflects
payments to the former owners of its O'Connor derivatives partnership, the
bank seems to have felt inclined to smooth its earnings jump with a high
provisions charge. Other banks, including UBS which reports on Friday,
should also enjoy a substantial increase in profits from derivatives
trading, but Swiss Bank may feel the benefit more strongly in its share
price. CS Holding needs the additional income to limit earnings dilution as
it builds up its relatively low capital base. UBS weathered the recession
better than SBC, which was caught not only by bad domestic loans but also by
large losses on overseas lending. At the end of 1992, UBS's provisions were
0.43 per cent of total assets. At 0.65 per cent those of Swiss Bank had
further to fall.
The large additional provisions made for 1993 together with restructuring
efforts by its new management means Swiss Bank is better shielded from any
fall in trading income this year. The chances are that its earnings growth
will outstrip that of UBS. Its bearer shares, which under-performed its
larger rival's by about 3 per cent over the past year, will then also start
to pull ahead.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cardiff is rarely mentioned in the same breath as Hollywood, but last week
both towns were offered a glimpse of the multimedia future. The trouble is
that no one knows if it will work. Viacom, which conquered Paramount with a
Dollars 9.7bn bid, now has to prove that its industrial vision makes
financial sense. By contrast, TCI's decision to take a 20 per cent stake in
the Welsh ITV contractor, HTV, involves an outlay of just Pounds 27m. The
deal may come to be seen as marking a symbolic shift in power from Channel 3
to cable and satellite television. Similar deals are almost certain to
follow, which makes Granada's tilt at LWT appear almost parochial.
HTV argues that advertising growth prospects for Channel 3 franchises will
be limited by the proliferation of rival television networks. Alternative
revenue streams are therefore essential. The link-up with a cable operator,
such as TCI, gives it an effective way of recycling its existing programmes
and an alternative channel for new productions. Cable television operators
foresee all kinds of possibilities for broadening their services, with
telephony and interactive home shopping just the start. In such a thrilling
world, it seems almost impertinent to observe that few cable operators have
yet made money. Some critics argue that they never will. The delivery of
television programmes may simply become a commodity service.
Television may follow the trend in computers, where power has slipped from
the hardware to software suppliers. The value attached to programme makers
is likely to grow significantly with the demand for programming hours
forecast to triple by the end of the decade.

FT  21 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Rewarding Enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil has worked hard for more than five years to bring its Nelson
field on stream. Given that, it must be galling that the oil started to flow
this weekend with crude prices around their lowest for eight years, and at
their lowest in real terms for 20. The rate of output from the company's
Scott and Nelson fields means that by 1995-96, Enterprise's oil output will
be almost double that in 1990-91. That success has won the company a share
price which stands at a premium to net assets. Measured after tax payments
but before dividends, cash will flood into the company at around Pounds 400m
a year. Yet low oil prices cut into potential profits, and earnings will not
look anything like as rosy as cash flow. The company's dividend payment may
remain barely covered.
On top of that, Enterprise must find or buy oil on the same scale as its
newly-expanded production capacity if it is not to mine into its asset base
and reduce its longer-term value. Finding reserves at the rate they are
being used will soak up almost all of that Pounds 400m a year of free cash
flow about to be produced.
There is thus an argument that the dividend should be cut, because it is
sucking too much cash out of the business. That would be a poor reward for
Enterprise's loyal shareholders. But if oil prices remain low, and
exploration remains fundamentally unprofitable, much of that money may not
be worth spending. It might then be returned to shareholders or invested
outside the upstream oil business. Weighing that decision will be the acid
test of Mr Graham Hearne's chairmanship.

Always thought that Eurotunnel chairman Sir Alastair Morton was a bit of a
loose cannon. No sooner has the government given him the chairmanship of its
Private Finance Working group, than up he pops telling the other side how to
do it.
Morton, who stepped down as chief executive of Eurotunnel last month, has
been given star billing in Labour's press release on its new public/private
sector partnership. Morton, headed the state-owned British National Oil
Corporation the last time Labour was in power, but promises that he's not
contributing to the opposition's new initiative. He has only agreed to speak
at its conference on February 24 in order to get his views across to a wider
audience. He's doing the same for the Tory's Bow Group in March.
Even so, Morton's political dexterity is bound to increase the sense in some
government quarters that the sooner he gets given a proper job to do again,
the better. Then, perhaps, the chairmanship of the Treasury working group
can be turned over to a more government-friendly type like former BP
chairman Bob Horton, now running Railtrack.

David Mellor, the former Tory Cabinet minister, is learning fast. He's been
taken on as a senior adviser to accountants Ernst &amp; Young, adding to his
increasingly fat portfolio of business consultancies.
Mellor's policy of concentrating on advisory jobs, rather than company
directorships, makes a lot of sense. Not only do most consultancy jobs pay
far better than the average non-executive director's fee, but they involve
none of the legal responsibilities of being a company director. David Howell
(ex-Queens Moat Houses) and Sir Charles Powell (ex-Tiphook), are just a few
of the political insiders who have sat on boards of companies that have run
into trouble. It doesn't look good on their CVs.
It is much more rewarding to be employed as an adviser to a company, and
much easier to disappear into the shadows if there is a hint of corporate
trouble. The habit's bound to catch on.

Spare a thought for Sir Peter Harding, the marshal of the RAF and chief of
defence staff. As if he did not have enough on his plate advising the
Cabinet about sending troops to Bosnia, he also has to find cuts of Pounds
1bn a year in the Ministry of Defence's budget.
His pinstriped troops have been forced to review everything from procurement
costs down to the things that the military really care about, such as
military bands, animals, and uniformed vets.
However, Observer can report that one vital defence cut has been restored.
When Air Chief Marshall Sir 'Sandy' Wilson takes over the RAF's new admin
headquarters at Innsworth he'll find that the number of VIP toilets under
his command is back to full strength.
The MoD has shot down a report that a proposed library in the officers' mess
at RAF Innsworth had been scrapped in favour of a powder room for the new
commander's wife. The MoD admitted that the plans had been 'amended' to
increase the number of VIP privies from one to two, but said that all its
commands have two VIP toilets.
There was also no question of the officers going without their reading
matter for the convenience of the commander's wife. The new mess would still
have a library. That's a relief.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Selling the railways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of British Rail is moving into the implementation stage.
After the furore in parliament over the legislation, the government's
ambitious plans to privatise the railways are now being put into effect. A
new industrial sector must be created and financed to operate the privatised
rail network.
The privatisation of passenger rail services as 24 rail operating companies
will present early opportunities for private sector involvement. The first
route to be put out to tender, the Gatwick Express between London and
Gatwick airport, is already running as a shadow franchise under the existing
management. Later this year, the franchise for running the line will be put
out to tender.
Several more shadow franchises will be established in April, in preparation
for tendering early next year. On most routes, the managers will be
encouraged to lead management buyouts. At the same time as passenger
services are privatised, other parts of British Rail will be prepared for
sale.
These include freight operations and the three leasing companies that will
lease rolling stock to the operating companies. BR's maintenance operations
are to be privatised as more than a dozen competing companies. And
Railtrack, the organisation created to run the rail infrastructure, will
take over responsibility for the network from April.
The success of rail privatisation, however, will be judged by the benefits
it brings for passengers. Ensuring that the customer sees real improvements
in services requires the emergence of competitive and entrepreneurial rail
operators. Businesses thinking about entering this new market - or providing
finance for it - will need to be convinced that there are profitable
opportunities.
Charges
There must be grounds for concern, therefore, over the charges that
operators will have to pay for using the railway network. The charges will
rightly reflect the operating costs of Railtrack on the routes covered by
each franchise. These include track maintenance, signalling costs, depot
charges and the cost of electricity. Amazingly, some of these were not
allocated to particular lines under BR's internal accounting system. But the
charges also reflect a Treasury target that Railtrack should make a 5.6 per
cent return on its assets, valued at around Pounds 6.5bn. The rate of return
will rise to 8 per cent within four years.
Tight target
This target is excessively tight. An 8 per cent rate of return is
unnecessarily steep for what is essentially a utility. As for the value put
on the assets, it can plausibly be argued that it should be much higher than
Pounds 6.5bn, since BR still owns a lot of land in inner-city sites.
Alternatively, it might be set much lower given the age of much of the
track, signalling and stations and their run-down state.
What is clear is that applying such a high rate of return to this asset
value will add around Pounds 500m to the charges that rail operators must
pay. Bumping up charges in this way could lead to the rail network being
used inefficiently at much less than capacity. It will also mean that fewer
of the franchises will be profitable without public subsidy. This creates a
merry-go-round in which the revenue extracted by the Treasury from Railtrack
must be paid out in subsidies to rail operators to pay higher-than-necessary
track charges.
The aim of these arrangements is to concentrate public subsidy for passenger
services on one part of the system - the rail operators. The operator can,
of course, still make a profit while receiving a subsidy, by maximising
revenues and efficiency.
However, businesses thinking about entering this new market may find the
prospect of relying on Treasury subsidies for the duration of a franchise
less than appetising. This will be especially the case if the government
agrees to franchise periods as long as 15 years to encourage operators to
invest in new rolling stock.
The arrangements for setting Railtrack's charges are likely to reduce the
attractiveness of investment opportunities in rail operations. Given the
need to attract businesses into this new sector, this cannot be an outcome
that is welcome to supporters of privatisation.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Leading Article: End-game on enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today in Brussels, negotiations on admitting four new members to the
European Union enter what should be their final lap. Foreign ministers from
the 12 existing members and the four would-be entrants - Sweden, Norway,
Finland and Austria - have every incentive to make this round conclusive. If
the talks do not show decisive progress in the next week, it will be
difficult, if not impossible, for the four applicants to hold their planned
ratification referendums and join by the target date of January 1995. As
important, the whole enlargement process may lose momentum. The result would
be further damage to the EU's battered effectiveness and self-esteem - and
further delay on the equally pressing question of bringing in the nascent
market economies of central Europe.
Fortunately, the hopes for a breakthrough are now better than at any time
since the negotiations were seriously joined last year. Public opinion is
moving in favour of entry even in the most sceptical candidate country,
Norway. Opposition among the Nordic states to the EU's terms on the
stickiest problems still to be resolved - agriculture and the budget -
appears to be softening, assisted by figures from the European Commission
indicating that their net contributions to the Union budget will be even
more modest than previously thought.
It is too soon to celebrate, however. The EU's bargaining position could yet
be thrown into confusion by additional budgetary demands from the poorer
southern states, led by Spain.
The issues of how to align the applicant countries' farm protection regimes
with the Common Agricultural Policy, and how to compensate farmers who stand
to lose in the process, still present obstacles that will only be surmounted
with creative thinking from both sides.
Volatile electorates
The challenge is to produce enlargement agreements attractive enough to
secure acceptance by the volatile electorates of the four applicants,
without destabilising the delicate web of budgetary and other agreements
between the existing 12. Even on agriculture, where Finland, Austria and
Norway currently guarantee their farmers prices 25 to 100 per cent higher
than under the CAP, that should not be beyond the negotiators.
The EU's proposal, for a 'big bang' realignment of prices, compensated
through direct payments to farmers threatened with reduced incomes, is
sensible. The alternative - a phased transition, during which price
differences would be ironed out with border levies - would generate
prolonged uncertainty, interfere with the single market, and further
complicate the still problematic task of CAP reform. What is more, the EU
proposal offers applicant governments powerful ammunition with which to sell
an agreement to their voters, in the form of sharply lower food prices for
consumers.
Frozen north
Their core problem is how to deal with their seriously disadvantaged farmers
 -those who toil in the frozen north and on Alpine pastures. Understandably
perhaps, the candidate countries are balking at the EU's suggestion that
they fund compensation payments themselves: they want assistance in doing so
from the Union, as well as generous treatment for their poorer areas under
EU regional funds. This is where the haggling will focus over the next few
days, with Spain and its southern allies pushing a hard line on the regional
funds and other EU governments withholding budgetary concessions until the
last possible moment.
While most of Spain's demands can be dismissed as predictable special
pleading, the EU as a whole is wise to adopt a hard-nosed approach on the
budget. The countries seeking membership are all at the upper end of the
EU's income scale and, if they choose for cultural, environmental or other
reasons to subsidise agriculture in regions where it is manifestly
unprofitable, they should contribute towards those subsidies from their
national exchequers, subject to EU control. Equally, it is strongly in the
EU's interests to bring these negotiations to a brisk conclusion. If the
price of doing so turns out to involve a modest top-up for such national
assistance, that should not be an insuperable obstacle to reaching a final
agreement.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Super-highways sans frontieres: European Union plans for
pan-continental networks to give the single market an infrastructure
backbone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the European Commission has a big idea these days, it is trans-European
networks. The bruising struggle to ratify the Maastricht treaty and the
near-collapse of the exchange rate mechanism last year may have knocked
monetary union off course. But across Brussels, dozens of Eurocrats are
beavering away at the next ambitious programme for European integration: a
plan to develop transport, energy and telecommunications networks spanning
the continent.
The initiative was launched with much fanfare last December by Commission
president Jacques Delors. His white paper on Europe's competitiveness listed
a large number of new railway, road, telecommunications, gas, electricity,
airport and port projects that would knit Europe's far-flung regions with
the core of the European Union, and provide an infrastructure backbone for
the single market. The networks would also extend beyond the Union into
European Free Trade Association countries and eastern Europe.
The programme's total cost is put at Ecu400bn (Pounds 300bn) by the end of
the century. Of this, Ecu220bn would be for transport projects, Ecu150bn for
telecommunications and Ecu30bn for energy.
Leaders at last December's Brussels summit gave the initiative a qualified
go-ahead. They approved the overall thrust, but not specific details - in
particular Commission plans for financing the programme.
Now the Commission's challenge is to refine its plans and win over the
doubters. A crucial role will be played by Mr Henning Christophersen, the
economics commissioner, who will today chair the second meeting of a
taskforce consisting of high-level officials from each member state. The
group will hear new Commission ideas on how the initiative could be
financed. It will also discuss which transport and energy projects should
receive priority.
A parallel taskforce, consisting of telecommunications users, operators and
manufacturers, is being chaired by Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry
commissioner. It will look at how an advanced telecommunications
infrastructure - which would be needed if, say, 'teleworking' from home was
to become much more common - can be developed. The Commission is anxious
that Europe does not fall behind the US, where the Clinton administration is
trying to encourage the construction of such 'information superhighways'.
Meanwhile, officials from more than half a dozen Commission directorates are
working on detailed aspects of the trans-European networks initiative. Both
the Christophersen and Bangemann groups will present progress reports to the
next European summit in Corfu in June.
The reason the initiative was launched was belief in Brussels that European
businesses and consumers are disadvantaged because networks have developed
on national rather than transnational lines. 'Networks were designed to
satisfy the European nation states of the 19th century,' says Mr
Christophersen.
There are many examples of what Commission officials see as anomalies:
cross-border phone calls cost three times as much as domestic calls of a
similar distance; air travellers can face long delays because poorly
co-ordinated national air traffic control systems cannot handle as many
flights as a single unified system; Italian lorries thunder through the
Rhine Valley on their way to Rotterdam because Italy's ports are not modern
enough; and there are as yet no high-speed rail links between national
capitals.
Enthusiasm in Brussels is one thing; winning the necessary support - and
finance - from member states is quite another. The general idea that
fragmented networks damage Europe's competitiveness has widespread
acceptance. That was why an article was written into the Maastricht treaty
giving the Commission authority to draw up proposals for trans-European
networks and promote their development.
But there is still much debate about three big questions. Are all the
projects identified by the Commission really necessary? Will the Union need
to subsidise the networks or can investment be left to member states and
private companies? Will the networks develop faster and more efficiently if
traditional national monopolies in telecommunications, energy and transport
are abolished?
Doubts over the list of projects stem largely from the way they have been
chosen. The Commission asked member states to propose candidates and then
collated the suggestions into master plans. But because favoured projects
may qualify for EU subsidies, each government had an incentive to get as
many of its national projects as possible included.
The initiative is viewed in some quarters as the next European gravy train.
'It is about money,' admits a transport official in one member state.
This explains why the programme's cost has reached a staggering Ecu400bn. It
also explains why the list includes projects which appear to be of mainly
national, rather than pan-European, benefit. For example, the master plan
for trans-European roads - consisting of 55,000km of roads, 12,000km of them
motorways - is largely an amalgamation of existing national road plans.
Officials argue that, even when infrastructure is confined to a single
member state, it may be of broader European interest for two reasons:
Spill-over effects. For example, Ireland has an interest in motorways being
built across England and Wales so its traffic can have easy access to the
Channel tunnel. Equally, a planned railway from Rotterdam to the border with
Germany will be more profitable if Germany continues the line into its
industrial Ruhr region.
Incompatible standards. For example, trains travelling from Sweden to
Denmark have to switch to a different electricity system. Similarly, many
advanced telecommunications services such as electronic mail systems do not
interconnect smoothly across borders.
The Commission believes it can play a useful role in co-ordinating
investment plans across frontiers. One way of achieving this could be for
the Commission to hold roundtable discussions for particular projects to
identify what is stopping them moving ahead. The Commission would then knock
heads together to remove the blockages.
A prime candidate would be air-traffic control, says Mr Robert Coleman, head
of the Commission's transport directorate. National air-traffic controllers
have been discussing harmonising their systems for years without much
progress. The new powers in the Maastricht treaty would allow aviation
ministers to vote on a common approach and then make it stick.
Mr Christophersen admits that not every project in the overall programme is
equally important. But he says the Commission has already made a preliminary
selection of priority projects which cost only Ecu160bn. His taskforce will
further refine priorities.
Examples of the priority projects include: high-speed rail links between
London, Paris, Brussels, Cologne and Amsterdam at a total cost of Ecu8.5bn;
a motorway from Berlin to Moscow via Warsaw costing Ecu3.2bn; and a new
Athens airport costing Ecu2bn.
Even if agreement is reached on priorities, the financing of the new
networks will remain controversial. In his white paper, Mr Delors argued
that the Union would need to provide Ecu20bn a year in subsidies and loans.
Of this, Ecu5bn would come from the Union's cohesion and structural funds.
These channel aid to Europe's poorest regions and countries: in particular,
Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. This money has already been earmarked
in the Union's budget.
A further Ecu7bn, Mr Delors suggested, could be raised by loans from the
European Investment Bank. The final Ecu8bn would be raised on the financial
markets by the Commission and then lent to governments or private companies.
This last proposal, for what were dubbed 'Union Bonds', caused particular
controversy at the Brussels summit. Germany and the UK criticised it on the
grounds that borrowing by the Commission would offer governments a back-door
route to avoiding public expenditure disciplines.
The critics were also concerned that the Commission's AAA credit rating in
financial markets might be damaged if it made large loans to countries with
poorer credit ratings, such as Greece and Italy. They said that, if more
money for infrastructure investment was needed, it should come from the EIB
which has a track record in project finance.
These objections have caused the Commission to beat a tactical retreat. Mr
Christophersen says Union Bonds are just one of several financial
instruments that could boost infrastructure investment.
Mr Enrico Cioffi, head of the Commission's investment directorate, suggests
other possibilities:
Bonds, issued by the Commission but linked to particular road, rail, air or
maritime traffic projects. Coupons paid to investors might depend on the
volume of traffic the project attracts. Loan guarantees by the Commission.
These could be used for those parts of a network located outside the Union
such as motorways or telecommunications lines extending into eastern Europe.
Although the Commission is no longer pushing Union Bonds as the main option,
the thinking behind the other ideas remains the same: the Commission could
use its AAA status to cut borrowing costs for countries with lower credit
ratings. The benefit for states such as Greece, Italy, Ireland and Denmark
could be the equivalent of between half and one percentage point off
interest rates, says Mr Cioffi. But such proposals could run into the same
opposition from member states as Union Bonds.
Part of the Ecu20bn envisaged by Mr Delors could be provided as direct
subsidies to projects, though the Commission has yet to spell out how this
might work. Subsidies would not necessarily be limited to regions that
already qualify for structural and cohesion funds.
Some member states, however, are worried that such handouts could be a waste
of public money. They could merely lead to the construction of grandiose
projects with little economic benefit.
Whatever is decided on Union funding, there is a consensus that national
budgets are so strapped that the bulk of the money for trans-European
networks will have to come from the private sector. This raises the question
of whether a bigger push is needed to privatise and liberalise monopoly
sectors.
There are sharp differences between member states over liberalisation. The
UK has traditionally led the free-market group, while France has supported
the continuation of public-sector monopolies.
Within the Commission, there are similar, though less sharp, differences.
Most officials agree that liberalisation would help the trans-European
network initiative, but they differ over whether the Commission needs to do
more than it is already doing.
The liberal camp believes that national monopolies in transport,
telecommunications and energy are the root cause of fragmented networks.
Public-sector monopolies have little incentive to look beyond their national
frontiers, while their monopoly status has prevented private operators
building transnational links instead.
Those who hold this view point to the US, where transcontinental networks
and competitive markets go hand in hand. In particular, they say a lesson is
to be learnt from the Clinton administration which is seeking to develop US
information superhighways by liberalising the telecommunications and cable
television industries, rather than pumping in government money.
Abolishing monopolies would allow private investment to flow into
infrastructure projects. Priorities would be chosen on economic criteria as
companies sought out the most profitable opportunities. There would also be
less need to co-ordinate investment as operators would be free to range
across boundaries.
'The big issue is lifting the restrictions. That is the only way of
mobilising the investment,' says Mr Herbert Ungerer, who runs the
Commission's telecommunications policy unit.
But others say that liberalisation is not the complete story. For a start,
it is harder to apply the approach in loss-making sectors such as railways
and roads than in profitable sectors such as telecommunications and energy.
Moreover, even in a liberalised market there would be a need for
co-ordinated investment and harmonised standards.
Such issues will have to be addressed by EU member states in the next few
months, if the foundations of trans-European networks are to be laid before
the end of the century. With the future of European competitiveness at
stake, there is already some impetus behind the plans. But if the
trans-European network initiative is really to gather momentum, members will
have to overcome any qualms they may have about a fresh commitment to
working together on a pan-continental scale.

Sir, I read with interest Barry Riley's article, 'Yielding no quarter'
(February 12-13), which discussed the problems in managing the risks
inherent in meeting the demand for fixed rate mortgages from a floating rate
funding base. I was surprised that no mention was made of the modern risk
management techniques available to mitigate and control such risks, in
particular derivatives. This omission is all the more surprising since
building societies are already extensive users of such instruments.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: BAe set the standard for winning
defence contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MAURICE C S DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'BAe shareholders weigh up old guard's power' (February
14), is not alone in dwelling on the need 'to wean' the 'operating chiefs'
of the British Aerospace defence business 'from their old cost plus ways'.
As one who held senior positions for a number of years in that business may
I set the record straight.
It was the former Hawker Siddeley Aviation and British Aircraft Corporation
that were combined through nationalisation in the late 1970s to form British
Aerospace. In the early 1970s Hawker Siddeley management had launched the
Hawk fighter trainer aircraft having won the project through competitive
tender run by the Ministry of Defence. The Hawk contract was fixed price,
covering both the development of the aircraft and the supply of the first
production batches. Meanwhile, the management of BAC had entered the
Anglo-French Jaguar and tri-national Tornado collaborative aircraft
programmes at a time when collaboration was both unproven and considered in
certain circles to be doomed to failure.
Those policies and programmes predated British Aerospace but laid the
foundations for the successes of the company throughout the 1980s and up to
the present day. The defence management team not only delivered these
products to our Royal Air Force but leveraged off of the programmes to win a
series of highly successful export orders, none of which was cost plus. The
UK defence equipment industry, including GEC Marconi, would not be in the
position it is today had the British Aerospace defence team not won those
orders.
Whatever the causes of BAe's problems of recent years, management of its
defence business is not one of them. The management team has comparable, if
not more, experience in successful management of substantial fixed price
contracts than any other major UK company.

brains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M J FEINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to John Major's exhortation to the best brains to enter
industry ('PM asks top brains to enter industry', February 12-13), can
anyone really advocate having a working life of only 25 years? Assuming the
best brains are graduates, they will not enter industry until they are 21.
Judging by the job advertisements, and current recruiting practices, they
will not be employable after the age of 45. Effectively they have to earn
enough in 25 years to keep themselves for the next 30 years. Is that really
an attractive proposition? Until industry changes its ageist attitude, it
does not deserve to have the best brains.

FT  21 FEB 94 / A Prussian in the White House: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Clinton faces a vexing decision. Should he and his general staff (the
White House National Economic Council) wear army fatigues? Or would it make
more sense to wear tracksuits emblazoned 'Team USA'?
Frankly, I don't think it matters a great deal. For trade wars with Japan, I
would recommend army uniforms with lashings of gold braid. I would give
Robert Rubin, the NEC director, a military rank and award campaign medals to
staff who devise particularly ingenious trade sanctions.
I would reserve the Team USA tracksuits for more routine tasks, such as
presidential lobbying on behalf of corporate America. Last week, Mr Clinton
described the Dollars 6bn aircraft deal with Saudi Arabia as a 'gold medal
win for America's businesses and workers'. He was too modest. Having
bombarded King Fahd with letters and phone calls - and having sent secretary
of state Warren Christopher to Riyadh to plead for business - Mr Clinton
deserves the medal himself.
The US is in its third year of a robust economic recovery. Business
investment and productivity are soaring. The US share of foreign markets is
up sharply. The budget and trade deficits are much reduced. Unemployment has
fallen sharply, to well below 7 per cent. Europe and Japan, by contrast, are
floundering in recession. In the circumstances, you might expect the White
House to feel relaxed, even magnanimous.
Instead, Mr Clinton and his senior advisers are behaving like economic
delinquents. In December, Mr Clinton hailed the merits of the Uruguay Round,
which promises to deregulate agriculture and financial services, sectors in
which the US is highly competitive. As a 'new democrat' he was all for
multilateral trade liberalisation under the Gatt.
Yet a mere two months later, he solemnly chastises Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
Japan's reform-minded prime minister, for refusing to accept numerical
targets for import growth in selected industrial sectors. Such targets -
essentially a government commitment to reserve a portion of Japan's home
market for US and foreign companies - are the very antithesis of the Gatt
principles that Mr Clinton was promoting so hard last year. Perhaps Mr
Clinton is genuinely incapable of understanding the contradiction. If so, it
is lamentable that economically literate senior aides - including Larry
Summers at the Treasury - are so eager to play this charade.
US officials, of course, sometimes claim they are not demanding numerical
targets. All they want are quantitative benchmarks to judge progress in
opening Japanese markets. This is spurious talk of medal-winning dimensions.
It is not as though Japanese trade figures are a state secret: quantitative
measures of progress in opening specific markets have always been readily
available.
In any case, as a member of a multilateral system, the US simply has no
right to act as judge and jury on Japanese trade practices. To put US
behaviour in perspective, suppose France analysed US wine consumption and
found an unfair bias in favour of inferior Californian brands. Would Mr
Clinton be happy if President Mitterrand unilaterally set a numerical target
for increased US imports of French Burgundy? Of course not: he would
instantly condemn such bully-boy tactics.
The obsession with the Japanese bilateral imbalance is even more fatuous.
White House talk of impenetrable barriers creates the false impression that
Japan buys virtually nothing from the US. In reality, US exports to Japan
were Dollars 48bn last year, making it America's second most important
market. The bilateral deficit with Japan is declining relative to US
national income. But even if it were rising, it would signify nothing.
Surely Mr Clinton's high-powered economic advisers have not forgotten the
very first lesson of economics: that trade is beneficial because it
facilitates specialisation and division of labour. The last thing we should
expect or want is balanced trade between every pair of countries.
The almost gloating way in which Mr Clinton (with Mr Christopher dutifully
in attendance) announced his trade deal with King Fahd is particularly
disturbing. Nobody can deny that political leaders in other countries have
sought economic favours. But in past years, transgressions by smaller
countries were comparatively unimportant because US commitment to market
principles guaranteed the survival of a liberal global trading order. When
the boundaries between government and business begin to blur in the world's
biggest economy, the outlook is indeed grim. European and Japanese leaders
are certain to respond by redoubling their efforts on behalf of their
national champions.
For 200 years two quite distinct capitalist philosophies have vied for
supremacy. The first is the English concept (not always respected by British
governments) of genuinely liberal competition in which governments keep off
the pitch and companies compete solely on the basis on commercial merit. The
second is the corporatist state - first perfected by 19th century Prussia -
in which government acts as sponsor of domestic business in an 'economic
war' against other nations.
Sadly, Mr Clinton seems to be leaning in the Prussian direction. No true
market liberal would brag about winning contracts for businessmen, or set
unilateral targets for another nation's imports, or pour taxpayers' funds
into a domestic industrial policy. Yet Mr Clinton is doing all of this - and
with relish. He believes the US is in a race with Japan and the European
Union for economic supremacy in the 21st century, and he intends to take the
gold. We are again seeing the ugly face of economic nationalism.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Age structure not least of Irish
economic problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr DAVID HITCHENS and Mr ESMOND BIRNIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Dr Garret Fitzgerald, (Personal View, February 15) in his consideration
of positive aspects of Ireland's economy, focuses on the age structure of
the population as the constraint on raising living standards, but Ireland
has a productivity/competitiveness problem as marked as this.
While low living standards in Ireland are largely a function of the small
proportion of the population in employment, this is only partly caused by
the greater proportion of young people in the Irish population. In 1992 just
over half of the Irish population of working age were in employment, but in
the UK the proportion was almost 70 per cent. There has been a long-run
failure to generate a sufficiently large industrial base and this failure is
a reflection of a lack of competitiveness.
In the aggregate statistics the unfavourable performance of domestically
owned firms is masked by the very rapid growth of the foreign-owned
manufacturing sector. Detailed study of Irish indigenous enterprises in
sectors such as farming, transport, energy, tourism and business services
indicates that productivity levels are substantially lower than those in the
UK. Irish products are frequently uncompetitive with respect to price or
non-price characteristics.
The increase in gross domestic product has indeed been rapid during
1988-1993 but it is usually accepted that GNP provides a better indicator of
the Irish population's material well-being because it makes allowance for
the burgeoning outflows of profit and interest payments (these outflows are
one consequence of the heavy reliance on international firms). GNP per
capita remains only two-thirds of the UK average.
Dr Fitzgerald considers the last five years, but when a longer time
perspective (eg, the last 30 or 70 years) has been considered it has usually
been concluded that the rate of 'catch up' on the levels of GDP per capita
in the UK or elsewhere is less than that which could be reasonably expected.
Past performance suggests there is more wrong with the Irish economy than
simply a delayed transition to low birth rates.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK's use of the democratic system
going wrong somewhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From D H BIESTERFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As is common to most of those who bemoan the Tories' 'steady, purposive
and highly effective destruction of local democracy', Joe Rogaly
('Dustbin-lids to the fore', February 15) omits to mention that local
democratic government is for most voters just as unaccountable as central
government. In that light the end result is much more important than the
route by which it is reached.
Hence the 'pretty picture' which Mr Rogaly suggests is conveyed by the
mandarins, of schools run by school boards and of hospitals run by hospital
trusts is far more than superficially appealing to the consumers involved.
In many historically Labour-controlled areas there is a justified feeling of
disenfranchisement among non-Labour voters. This feeling is now in danger of
taking root at national level among those who did not vote for the present
government.
Democracy, or our use of it, is going wrong somewhere, but whether this is
the failure of the system in a structural sense or results from the
inadequacy of politicians to present viable alternatives to their electorate
is open to debate.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Personal View: Tender loving care for better workers - The
company of the future will put more emphasis on looking after human assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES HANDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What will be the shape of tomorrow's companies? Almost certainly they will
look and feel very different from today. If they do not Britain's
competitiveness will surely sink. The 1993 world competitiveness survey by
the World Economic Forum put Britain 16th out of 22 countries, with
particularly low scores for innovation, science and technology, management
and people - precisely the assets needed in a constantly changing world and
when applied intelligence is the main source of future wealth.
For one thing, companies will be much smaller: ' 1/2 x 2 x 3' is becoming
the essential formula for those who want to remain competitive in an
interconnected world - half as many people, paid twice as well (because they
keep the best), producing three times as much added value. Then repeat the
exercise; it is possible - an estimated 65 per cent of most company's
activities do not add value. No longer are so many people needed to make
things happen. Those left become crucial human capital.
It will not, however, be easy to define or describe many companies. They
will be a web of alliances, joint projects, arrangements and pacts. More
risks will be shared. Companies will have centres but rather than head
offices they will be small centres designed on the principle of 'reverse
delegation' with the centre only doing what the parts on their own cannot do
and which they, therefore, delegate to the centre. Companies will be
federations of bits and pieces, joined together in different ways for
different purposes.
As a result, it will be increasingly difficult for shareholders to know what
they are buying into, or to what sort of risks they are exposed. It will be
all the more difficult because the real assets of the business, the
intellectual assets, will still be largely unquantifiable, unless
accountancy groups come up with new measures.
In the best businesses today the market value of the business is three or
four times the tangible assets and, in a good manufacturing company, labour
costs should not be more than 10 per cent of the product price. That leaves
lots of unmeasured space. Shareholders will be more careful about long-term
money and more likely to want some money today rather than possibly more
money later.
Contrary, therefore, to most prescriptions for better corporate governance,
we may see companies edging further away from shareholders in an attempt to
give more emphasis to the long-term future of the business. Directors may
see themselves as mainly accountable to their own people who have a real
incentive to build a better future. To put it another way, when human
capital becomes more important than financial capital, it will be the human
capital which calls the tunes. This may be a gradual change but it will be
profound.
In the end, the driving motive for most senior managers is to build a
sustainable enterprise. To achieve this and to recognise their new
accountability to human capital, companies will look for ways to turn key
people into quasi-partners. Some will hope to do that by more consultation.
But ultimately partnership means money, not talk. That is likely to entail
not share option schemes, which are a form of risk-free betting, but genuine
share ownership, perhaps with double voting rights as in some continental
companies, and with substantial shares in each year's added value. This will
not be primarily an incentive for employees, rather will it be an expression
of their membership rights.
Some companies may decide to venture further down this membership route,
limiting voting rights to large investors (owning more than 1 per cent,
perhaps) or to their own people. It will always be a cautious experiment,
however, for fear of alienating the wider market which will not want to see
its rights eroded too far. The formal aim of the company would still be as
it has always been: 'to add value'. But value would no longer be determined
solely by the price of the shares, but by other measures of the long-term
health of the business - measures which would be more relevant to the
membership than to temporary, smaller investors.
To continue to add ever more value, companies will have to be 'inclusive',
building long-term relationships with customers, suppliers and the
community. But all the main constituents would then pull in one direction -
the sustainable future of the business.
Tomorrow's companies will do all this because they will need to - not
because of some ideological pressure. If they do not treat central people as
partners and members, those people - whose talents provide the intellectual
assets of the business - will be free to treat the company as a
stepping-stone.
Without the bonds of membership, companies will have to make do with 'actor
career' characters hired for projects or on short-term contracts and moving
on to other companies when the projects or contracts end. The modern
American executive is said to change jobs 10 times in a career. Modern
Britain may not be far behind. A world of such connections bodes ill for
wealth creation. Joseph Schumpeter predicted that capitalism would fail when
it ceased to draw on any sense of 'moral allegiance'. Britain faces that
danger now.
'Actors' careers' and individualist tracks also put the onus on the
individual to manage his or her life. If they choose to rent themselves to a
company, the company will milk them. If the individuals do not like the
milking they can always leave - or ask for more money to stay. That way the
' 1/2 x 2 x 3' formula translates as half as many people paid twice as well
to work three times as long. '24-7's' (24 hours a day, seven days a week)
they call them in Los Angeles. More accurately, they are cramming the
100,000 hours of a normal working life into 25 years instead of 50, which
makes for 75-hour weeks and burn-out at 45.
Milking assets to that extent makes only short-term sense. Work can become
addictive, until we lose ourselves in our busy-ness. But boring people are
wasting assets and addicted people lose perspective. A membership ethos
would encourage a company to take more care to cosset its assets, to invest
in them as well as to work them, to encourage such things as educational
terms and sabbaticals, maternity/paternity breaks, to allow people to
organise chunks of their lives in different ways, and to respect part-time
wisdom and expertise as much as full-time energy. If they do not, companies
may find that they are squeezing out most of their women, as well as some of
their men, who want a more balanced life.
The idea of membership is not the same as the life-time employment of Japan,
for the contract can be ended by either party, but it is edging that way.
The idea of a more restricted role for the temporary investor is not the
full continental European model, but it has the same vibrations.
Meanwhile the Japanese and continental Europeans are gradually loosening
their models of the company and of the capital market, becoming more like
Anglo-American examples. In an increasingly interconnected world,
evolutionary theory suggests different species tend to converge, while
retaining distinctive plumages. Given where the UK is starting from, it
would do us no harm to give evolution a push.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Arts: An artist but not a rebel / Obituary of Derek Jarman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Derek Jarman, who died on Saturday, was that rarity in cinema: an
independent film-maker who never sacrificed or hazarded his independence.
His record attests to a stubborn refusal to 'sell out': no other director in
our time has spent 20 years making acclaimed feature films without once
reaching a budget of Pounds 1m.
Yet in a movie age when the cry has been 'Is the money up on the screen?',
with Jarman the answer was always yes. In early films like Jubilee and The
Tempest, in late films like The Garden, Edward II and Wittgenstein, he
rejected star-casting and multiple locations to film with largely unknown
actors in tiny studios, abandoned warehouses or derelict country homes,
borrowed or rented and dressed up in the colours of his imagination.
The 'location' for Jarman's films was his own mind. He came to directing
from painting and designing (opera, ballet, Ken Russell's The Devils) and he
took the self-expressive spirit of the 1960s, the time of his studentship at
the Slade School of Art, into virtually all his later films. These began as
experimental shorts, shot on Super-8 and/or video to achieve Jarman's unique
early style: a dream-like, blurry staccato like paintings shimmering into
life.
Later, some of the improvisatory style and demotic working methods of these
shorts - diary-like records of friends and places Jarman loved - were
transmuted into his feature films. His first, Sebastiane, was made with
friends on a glorified working holiday in Sardinia: a gay confessio amantis
thinly disguised as the story of a Roman saint and playfully scripted in dog
Latin. This prototypical Jarman movie provoked the prototypical dual
response from viewers: delight from fans and outrage from those offended by
the male nudity, apparent plotlessness and historical/religious irreverence.
Later Jarman films brought a similar blend of gay anarchy and licensed
iconoclasm to Shakespeare (The Tempest), the Italian Renaissance
(Caravaggio), 20th-century philosophy (Wittgenstein), the Bible (The Garden)
and the English monarchy (Jubilee, Edward II).
Jarman insisted that he was no rebel: just an artist claiming the right to
survival and self-expression in a homophobic age; and the right to defend
the England he loved - that of Shakespeare, English literature and painting,
and the English countryside - by satirising the England he loathed. This,
for him, was the wasteland of new Toryism as perceived and depicted in his
anti-Thatcher broadside, The Last Of England.
A residual division of style, though, stayed in Jarman's work throughout his
career. While the free-form visual experimentation of his early shorts was
carried over into the daring effects of films like Imagining October, The
Angelic Conversation and The Last Of England, his films based on famous
texts or famous lives were more linear and accessible.
Even here, however, movie orthodoxy hardly threatened. Though the films had
scripts and professional actors and were shot in 35mm, they still startled
us with their seditious touches. Anachronism (motorbikes and pocket
calculators in Caravaggio); music-hall burlesque (Elizabeth Welch singing
'Stormy Weather' at the close of The Tempest); gay agitprop (demos and
banners in Edward II); rampant surrealism (a green Martian in Wittgenstein).
Jarman's humour and his delight in tactical aesthetic outrage gives even his
most 'serious' films the power of laughter and surprise. In his last years
he was the least self-pitying of all artists struck by Aids. His will and
stamina allowed him to carry on working long after doctors had despaired of
his health.
Even in Blue, his last, powerfully moving film, there is wit and wry
defiance as Jarman's spoken thoughts and memories play over that single,
unchanging colour on screen. Blue was for him the colour of infinity, the
colour of favourite flowers, the colour of the landscape elements he loved
(sea, sky). 'Blue', to those who knew him or his work, never seemed the
colour of his mood or emotions, nor those of his films. He was the most
affirmative iconoclast British cinema ever had.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Arts: Slave to the cult of celebrity - The portraits of star
photographer Annie Leibovitz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MCCLURE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The over-muscled torso of Sylvester Stallone, which adorns a recent cover of
Vanity Fair, neatly illustrates both the best and worst aspects of Annie
Leibovitz's portraiture. As a brash, eye-catching incentive to purchase, it
is unsurpassed. On every other level, it is a sham.
Stallone poses nude as Rodin's The Thinker, although the gushing coverline,
'Sly's Body of Art', stresses his physical, rather than any cerebral,
attributes. Inside, further pictures credit a stylist, set designer, hair
and make-up artists, plus there are honourable mentions for 'jeans by Gianni
Versace and sheets by Ralph Lauren'. This is not so much an exposition of
the actor's psyche as a highly orchestrated fashion shoot.
None of which would matter unless a major retrospective at the National
Portrait Gallery, 'Annie Leibovitz Photographs 1970-1990', did not invite us
to view such work as having artistic value. Leibovitz herself makes the
distinction between her magazine work for Vanity Fair and Rolling Stone,
which makes up the bulk of the show, and her lucrative assignments for
American Express and The Gap. These she excludes on the grounds that they
are merely advertising, but there is little difference, either pictorially
or commercially, between a photograph of John Cleese endorsing a credit card
and last month's Vanity Fair cover of Roseanne Arnold, which provided timely
publicity for the publication of the actress's autobiography.
Leibovitz has been contributing to the magazine for more than a decade,
during which time she has become court photographer to the nobility of
popular culture. Her slick, colour portraits of actors, singers and
sportsmen in mildly provocative, staged poses have resurrected the
magazine's circulation figures and have already drawn more than 1m people to
this exhibition, which is touring Europe and the US.
But in helping to foster this cult of celebrity, Leibovitz has become its
slave. Just as Norman Parkinson was limited by royal protocol, so Leibovitz
faces similar restrictions from agents employed to perpetuate their clients'
personal mythology. In a Hollywood, where publicists call the shots and
journalists are blacklisted for penning unfavourable reviews, she would be
unwise not to acquiesce.
Faced with this restraint on creativity, Leibovitz relies on a variety of
concepts to inject life into the proceedings - Clint Eastwood is bound with
ropes; Goldie Hawn perches on an elephant's trunk; Jeff Koons is daubed with
gold paint from head to toe. Elaborate props and posturing are not
necessarily the answer. Her most percipient studies, such as a defiant Ella
Fitzgerald or a world-weary Vaclav Havel, are also the least flamboyant.
In these, she follows Bill Brandt's timeless advice to 'see the subject
first. Do not try to force it to be a picture of this, that or the other
thing. Stand apart from it. Then something will happen. The subject will
reveal itself'. There is certainly revelation in Leibovitz's portraits;
though not in the way Brandt intended. Like Stallone, many of her subjects
strip off for her lens, as if bared chests can be a substitute for bared
souls.
Too often, Leibovitz seems enthralled by her subjects, willing to pander to
their outsized egos. The exhibition is littered with subjects, crying out to
be satirised, who instead inhabit irony-free zones. Even those emblems of
excess, Liberace and Donald Trump, pictured in all their glorious
ostentation, suffer only self-inflicted wounds.
In her defence, Leibovitz has suggested that 'the surface can be as
revealing as anything else and sometimes that's all there is. With some
people it's not going to get any further'. A valid point, but by allowing
her subjects so much control of the image, she only adds lustre to this
surface. (Michael Jackson even gave advice on how to light him in the most
flattering manner.) Leibovitz calls such methods collaboration; collusion
might be more accurate.
Of course, she is by no means the first photographer to contribute to the
smooth running of Hollywood's publicity machine. Angus McBean confessed to
removing freckles and blemishes from his 1930s portraits of Vivien Leigh,
but drew the line at the practices of US film studio photographers 'who
retouched all character from faces in pursuit of apparent perfection'.
It was not always thus. During the 1970s, Leibovitz's reportage for Rolling
Stone captured the seamier, less airbrushed side of that awkward decade, as
she tagged along with debauched rock stars and disgraced presidents. Her
portraits of a dissipated Mick Jagger still tingle with the demonic energy
of his stage performance. Covering the Watergate scandal, Leibovitz was
present on the White House lawn in 1974 as Richard Nixon made his final,
ignoble departure by helicopter, guards quickly rolling away the
presidential red carpet.
These memorable pictures serve as a reproach to a talent gone astray. It is
time Leibovitz withdrew her own red carpet treatment for Hollywood's elite;
the formula is wearing thin.

What I want to see is Richard Wilson (aka Victor Meldrew but now playing the
rough diamond aesthete at Klinsky's) taking that 900cc Triumph round the
reverse-banking on Westway at, say, 55mph with his visor up. In John
Mortimer's auction house series Under The Hammer we keep getting macho poser
shots of Wilson straddling the machine at rest, and footage of some
anonymous person whirling around London on it. But I suspect that, unlike
the late Ralph Richardson, Wilson is not really one of us, a genuine
motorcyclist (9.00 ITV).
Earlier, if all goes well, you can watch Torvill and Dean as they attempt to
win the Olympic Ice Dance Championship again (7.30 BBC1). Even earlier comes
the first of this year's Young Musician Of The Year Masterclasses given by
clarinettist Michael Collins (7.20 BBC2).
The last in a generally good series of Cutting Edge documentaries is a 'day
in the life of' Gatwick Airport (9.00 C4). The final episode of Middlemarch
is repeated (10.25 BBC1).

FT  21 FEB 94 / Arts: Rigoletto a clear winner - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among Nuria Espert's productions for the Royal Opera, her Rigoletto always
looked like a clear winner. Some five years on, it still does; it began its
fourth run on Saturday, expertly revived by Daniel Dooner. Ezio Frigerio's
sets loom as superbly as ever, exuding dankness and menace, lit to gloomy
perfection. I thought I remembered 'real' rain in the storm scene - none
this time; but perhaps that had been an illusion conjured up by the visible
gale-force pyrotechnics.
On the other hand, the naughty Duke and Maddalena appeared here to be
working up to a bout of toe-sucking: either that is new or we have become
newly sensitive to such possibilities. With Claire Powell's sultry, sulky
Maddalena and Francisco Araiza's ducal spiv, it seemed likely enough. It was
good to hear Araiza's lusty, forthright tenor again, after a long absence
from Covent Garden. A slight constriction on top notes suggested a passing
cold, but it mattered little, and his troubled soliloquy in Act 2 conveyed a
mature sense of loss.
Leo Nucci returns as Rigoletto, with the histrionics well controlled and a
magnificently scathing, desperate 'Cortigiani]'. His new Gilda is the Korean
soprano Young-ok Shin, pretty, touching and precociously subtle. Under
pressure the voice has (like some other far eastern sopranos) an electrical,
fast vibrato, curiously effective. Their sad last duet is perhaps too
brightly lit: that Grand Guignol exercise is better imagined than laid out
for close inspection.
There is a solid, chilly Sparafucile from Alastair Miles, and confident
support from John Dobson, David Ellis, Eric Garrett and Peter Sidhom as
various courtiers. The three principal roles will be taken by other singers
in the course of the run, as has become the way with Royal Opera revivals -
the Romanian baritone Alexandru Agache, the tenor Jerry Hadley and an
American newcomer, the soprano Maureen O'Flynn; and a different conductor,
Paul Wynne Griffiths, will lead the last two performances.
The current conductor, however, is a notable discovery. She is a 32-year-old
Australian, Simone Young. She makes her mark not by any gimmicks or
radically 'new' readings (for which Verdi's tightly built opera really
leaves no room), but by sheer professional command. There was plenty of
energy, without haste or hysteria - nor any uncertain moment; the orchestral
balance was impeccable; the singers enjoyed close, unfailing support. As the
storm progressed, the off-stage male choristers who do the wailing wind
slipped out of synch with the woodwind raindrops, but that amusing lapse was
the only one. We must hope that Berlin and Munich will leave this excellent
conductor time to visit Covent Garden often.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Monday Interview: Turning the moribund into mainstream - Ron
Brown, the US secretary of commerce, talks to Jurek Martin and Nancy Dunne
in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There used to be a faintly down-at-heel air about the commerce department.
It put out a lot of economic statistics and data about people and the
weather but it rarely appeared a big player in government when matched
against the powerhouses of treasury, state department and even, as it
developed in influence over the last 20 years, the small office of the trade
representative.
Commerce secretaries were often political hacks or comfortable businessmen
who came and went, leaving not too much of a trace behind.
To enter Ron Brown's quarters is instantly to detect a difference. They are
as stylish and smart as the secretary himself, perhaps the most elegant man
in Washington. They resemble those of a plush lobbying law firm, one of
which, the aggressive Patton, Boggs and Blow, was his home for much of the
1980s. They are the offices of a quintessential Washington insider, right
down to the fish tanks, the computer terminals and big pictures, beyond
number, of Ron Brown and his many friends, from his president on downwards.
Simply because Ron Brown was just such a person, it puzzles that he should
have opted for dear old moribund commerce when, as one of the major
architects of Bill Clinton's election victory, his selection must surely
have been wider. 'Well, I won't say I wanted to be secretary of commerce
from the day I was born, but one of the things I always noticed was that
this was a department of enormous untapped potential. Anyway, something
about me likes challenges, it was enticing. And our campaign was all about
the economy and I thought this department could have an impact on it.'
That impact was certainly seen just last week when Ron Brown stood
shoulder-to-shoulder with his president to announce triumphantly the Dollars
6bn contract for the sale of commercial jets to Saudi Arabia. He was a
serious player in administration strategies for Nafta, the Uruguay Round and
the latest fraught negotiations with Japan.
His proudest achievement so far has been the establishment of a national
export strategy, which, if European reactions to the Saudi deal are anything
to go by, already has US competitors deeply worried. Its goal is Dollars
1,000bn in exports by the end of the century, nearly double current levels,
generating, he calculates, 6m new jobs at home.
'Government should not initiate contracts,' he says. 'That is up to the
private sector, but if it makes that judgment there should be aggressive
action on government's part to help them.' And why not, he goes on, for that
is exactly what the main US trading rivals have been doing for years.
He can come over as a supersalesman (he prefers the word 'advocate"), though
this would be grossly to misread his talents. His career has been varied
enough - and only his colour makes it relatively unusual. He grew up in the
Theresa Hotel when Harlem glittered and where his father was manager. His
education was at the better private schools in the north east and by 21 he
was a commissioned army lieutenant. .
A law degree from St John's University in New York got him on board the
civil rights movement, with the Urban League. He moved on to be chief
counsel of the Senate judiciary committee under Edward Kennedy, worked for
his abortive 1980 campaign and then moved on to Patton, Boggs and Blow,
where his clients ranged from Japanese corporations to Haiti's Duvalier
family and where he began to make serious money - and some enemies. (The New
York Times came close to opposing his nomination a year ago mostly because
he had been that ultimate object of mistrust, a lobbyist).
In 1988 he managed the Rev Jesse Jackson's bid for the presidency, and he
was still seen mostly as a tool of the Kennedy-Jackson liberal axis when,
against many odds, he was elected Democratic Party national chairman early
in 1989. This induced undisguised delight among Republicans. George Will,
the conservative columnist, wrote at the time: 'Democrats are already
turning briskly to the business of losing the 1992 election and some of them
believe that the coming election of Ronald Brown as party chairman will be a
big step in that direction.'
Four years later a Democratic president was inaugurated. What he did in
those four years as party chairman - raising money, giving Democrats a sense
of purpose and ultimately uniting the many warring factions behind the man
he saw as a winner - he is now seeking to replicate in government and inside
the commerce department.
He did not have to demand a seat at the administration high policy table,
because Mr Clinton's theological belief in collegiality gave him an
automatic place. Like a good cardinal, his opinions are pretty
indistinguishable from the rest. 'We've been consistent for 13 months, we
want targeted, results-oriented trade policies.'
On Japan, this most political of operators expresses interest in Tokyo's
unfolding drama but adds that US policy prior to the summit 10 days ago
could not be determined 'to the depths of interpreting every nuance in
domestic Japanese politics.' More important was the necessity of getting
Japan to abide by its agreements - in the framework negotiations that broke
down at the summit and over Motorola's cellular phone exports.
But it has not been all guts and glory for Ron Brown. It was only a few
weeks back that he was cleared of charges that he had solicited money in
return for helping to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam, finally ended
February 3. He claims he was not 'deterred or distracted' but then says
Washington, which he knows like the back of his hand, 'is getting meaner and
worse.' Still, 'I don't feel victimised, I'm the kind of person that moves
on.' To the state department perhaps? Ron Brown also knows when to smile and
say nothing.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics and telecommunications company, will be headed
by a younger president than has been the case for some time when Hisashi
Kaneko takes over from Tadahiro Sekimoto who has been at the top for an
unusually long 14 years, writes Michiyo Nakamoto.
Kaneko, 61, has long been considered a natural successor to Sekimoto, 68,
who, as executive chairman, will concentrate his energies on activities in
the wider business community.
The new president, who is currently executive vice president, followed a
similar career path to that of his mentor, and worked for a long time on the
telecomunications
side of NEC's businesses. His rather uninspiring personal style has won him
the nickname of 'mini-Sekimoto', according to one Japanese newspaper.
Kaneko graduated from the prestigious University of Tokyo's engineering
department and joined NEC in 1956. After managing the company's Central
Research Lab, Kaneko moved to the US to become president and chief operating
officer of NEC in the US in 1989.
Kaneko takes over at a less than opportune time for NEC, which is suffering
from the economic downturn as well as increased competition, but the company
seems to have weathered the worst of the bad times.
The new president's leadership and vision will be tested in the years ahead;
NEC will be particularly pressed to develop new market areas as its
dominance in the domestic PC market is threatened from overseas.

FT  21 FEB 94 / People: Jenrette eases up at Equitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After nursing the Equitable through some of its blackest hours, Richard
Jenrette, chairman of the 135-year-old US insurance group, is easing his
grip on the reins of power and allowing a new generation of managers a
chance, writes Richard Waters.
Jenrette, 65 in April, last week gave up the chairmanship of Equitable's US
life assurance subsidiary - though he remains chairman and chief executive
of the whole group. The move allows Joseph Melone, 62, the subsidiary's
chief executive, to become chairman, in turn making room for James Benson,
47, to become president and chief operating officer.
Benson, a marketing expert who learnt the trade at Pacific Mutual Life, was
brought in less than a year ago by Melone (himself a former president of
Prudential Insurance) to drive the life business forward. Now that Equitable
has sorted out the mess in its balance sheet, Melone says it is looking to
make its capital grow 'the old-fashioned way - by making money'.
For Jenrette - a founder of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the investment bank
now owned by Equitable - the 1990s has proved a busy decade. Just months
after being thrust into the top seat, he brought in French insurer Axa as a
49 per cent shareholder in 1991 (when losses plunged to nearly Dollars 1bn)
and took the insurance group public the next year. The question now is: how
long will he stay? Last week's announcement was studiously vague on the
matter, saying only that Jenrette had 'no near-term plans to retire'.

FT  21 FEB 94 / People: Monetary institute truly European
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Though Germany's Gunter Baer, 53, the secretary-general of the European
central bank governors' committee, lost out to France's Robert Raymond in
the race for the director general's job at the newly created European
Monetary Institute, his deputy, Hanspeter Scheller, 51, has picked up the
consolation prize of heading Raymond's general secretariat.
Scheller, who started his central banking career at the Bundesbank, has been
a member of the secretariat of the Bank for International Settlements since
the 1970s. He is one of three new faces who will run the EMI when it finally
settles down in its yet to be found headquarters in Frankfurt.
The EMI has turned to the Dutch central bank for its head of monetary,
economic and statistics department. Gert Jan Hogeweg, 47, who runs the
payments systems policy department of De Nederlandsche Bank. Before that he
did a stint as the Netherlands' alternate executive director at the
International Monetary Fund between 1987 and 1991.
Meanwhile, Jim Etherington, 39, (below), who joined the Bank of England
straight from school, has been appointed head of the EMI's information and
communications systems department. He has been managing the Bank's
information technology operation servicing the policy, markets and
supervision area.
The latest clutch of appointments has filled most of the key jobs in the
EMI's top management team. It still needs to recruit a head of
administration and a head of reserve management. Filling the latter is not
felt to be particularly urgent since it is unlikely that the EMI will be
managing a large amount of reserves in the short-term.
The rash of appointments at the EMI has had a knock-on effect at the BIS.
Baer, who had been the EMI's acting director general, will take over from
Giampietro Morelli, the BIS's secretary general, when he retires in August.
Guy Noppen, Belgium's executive director at the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, joins the BIS secretariat in March and will
assume the Bank's administrative responsibilities. Meanwhile, William White,
deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, is joining the BIS and will take over
as head of the monetary and economics department when Horst Bockelmann
retires in April 1995.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Business Travel: A breath of fuggy air - Policies on smoking
and cabin freshness differ from airline to airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smoke gets in your eyes and up your nose. And so do bits of fluff, hair,
skin particles and volatile emanations from the malodorous passengers around
you. Taking a long-haul flight is more than just a matter of a comfortable
seat and gourmet food.
Airlines differ in how they treat smokers and how often they change the air
in the cabin.
On the smoking front, they tend to divide into two camps: the anti-smoking
Anglo-Saxon countries, and their former colonies; and the pro-smoking rest
of the world. On the issue of smoking in aircraft, France would appear to be
an honorary Anglo-Saxon country.
In the 'anti' corner, US carriers forbid smoking on all domestic flights.
British Airways has not allowed smoking on its domestic flights since 1988,
SAS bans smoking on flights within Scandinavia, and Singapore Airlines has
smoke-free short-haul routes on its Silk Air subsidiary.
These rules are not as strict for long-haul international flights, perhaps
because airlines recognise that it is harder for tobacco addicts to go
without for eight or 10 hours.
Many airlines have no-smoking flights only on routes where there are at
least two daily flights: smoking is banned on one, and allowed on the other.
Such flights are available from BA, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines
between Europe and Asia, and on many US carriers across the Atlantic or
Pacific.
For short-haul international flights, carriers are more divided. While SAS
still allows smoking on flights outside Scandinavia, Air France last month
banned smoking on flights of less than two hours. BA plans to prohibit
smoking on flights of less than 90 minutes from this summer: more than 400
flights a week will be affected between the UK and much of northern Europe.
Such changes of policy at BA and Air France contrast with the attitude of
German carrier Lufthansa. It experimented with no-smoking flights in 1990,
but abandoned the idea in the face of public hostility. Those in favour of
an individual's right to smoke overcame those arguing that the health and
comfort of others were more important, says the carrier.
Many Asian and south European carriers have not even experimented with
no-smoking policies, perhaps because smoking is more popular in those
regions.
Is it possible for an airline to please both supporters and opponents of
smoking? Air France is trying: it has a special smoking compartment on
flights to Japan and South Korea. Economy-class smokers sit at the back of
the aircraft, separated from other passengers by thick curtains.
While non-smokers may applaud efforts like this, they might be less pleased
by the issue of the freshness of the air itself.
Only US carriers have statistics about cabin air freshness at their
fingertips. Most other carriers contacted by the FT had to consult their
engineering departments, and often did not know precise figures.
The results of the survey show that, when it comes to air freshness, the
type of aircraft matters at least as much as who owns it.
It is not easy to change cabin air frequently. At 40,000ft, the external air
can be minus 60`C and almost completely dry. It must be heated by 80`C and
have moisture added before it is pumped into the cabin.
This all uses fuel, so the latest Boeing and Airbus aircraft, introduced
since the mid-1980s, try to cut down on the waste by recycling some warm and
relatively moist cabin air. Airlines insist that this does no harm to
passengers. The air is filtered using a mesh that catches many bacteria.
Sleeping people extract very little oxygen, so the air the second time round
should be just as capable of sustaining life as it was the first time.
Nevertheless, those who want completely fresh air circulating around them
should avoid travelling in new aircraft, such as the Boeing 747-400 and
Airbus A320, while smaller aircraft tend to change the air more frequently.
Travellers paying for the most expensive seats will get better air quality
than those with cheap tickets. The air in an aircraft flows from the front
to the back; the further forward you are, the fresher the air, unless there
are smokers in front. Moreover, with fewer passengers per square metre in
the more expensive seats, each has more fresh air.
As if that were not enough, one airline has just made the fresh air class
distinction even greater. US carrier Northwest last month banned smoking in
all first-class cabins.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Franc fares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Air travel in the African franc zone is set to become a lot more expensive.
Airlines operating in the zone plan to increase their fares by up to 70 per
cent after the January devaluation in the CFA zone. Members of the
Francophone Association of Air Transport last week approved a 60 per cent
increase in round-trip fares, a 70 per cent rise in one way fares and a 100
per cent increase in freight fares. Air France, Royal Air Maroc, Air Afrique
and Cameroon Airlines are among the carriers seeking the rises, which need
the approval of their governments.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Business Travel: High-cost connections - The price of using
cards to make phone calls from hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business travellers once had to accept extortionate hotel telephone charges
as a fact of life. Then came the calling card, enabling them to avoid hotel
rates by using freephone or special connection numbers, which credit the
charge to a phone or credit card account.
Not to be outwitted, many hotels have reacted by barring the access numbers
and placing a hefty levy - euphemistically called a 'connection fee' - on
those wanting to dial access numbers via hotel operators. Travellers
intending to spend much time on the phone should check on hotel policy. One
call could save a large part of the final bill.
In the US, where more than 100m citizens now have calling cards, most hotels
long ago caved into consumer demand and allowed calling card holders to dial
direct. The standard access charge is 75 cents. Access codes for AT&amp;T and
the other carriers are often advertised in bedrooms.
By contrast, London hotels generally still try to hold on to their extra
income from phone charges.
The Dorchester was the worst offender in a random survey of six central
London hotels, levying a Pounds 2.50 premium on any call via an 0800
freephone number. The Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch charges a Pounds 2
connection fee for all access numbers for charge cards, including 0500, 0800
and 144 for BT. The Regent's Park Hilton charges Pounds 1.50, and the
Holiday Inn at King's Cross Pounds 1.
Two of the six levy no charge. The Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane does
not bar any numbers. Better still, the Beaufort Hotel in Knightsbridge
neither bars numbers nor charges any mark-up from standard BT tariffs for
direct-dialled calls. 'We believe we are the only hotel in London to charge
guests straight BT prices, nothing extra,' it says.
BT and Mercury say there is little they can do except 'try to persuade'
hotels to charge lower fees. Holders of American Express cards in the UK
will be able to use them as phone calling cards under a deal signed by Amex
and Mercury, the UK phone company, last week.
After applying for a personal number, card holders can charge calls to their
Amex account at Mercury calling card rates - which are generally lower than
BT's but higher than US cards for transatlantic calls. Corporate card
holders are eligible immediately; all 1m Amex card holders in the UK can
apply later this year.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Management: Staff cover proves a liability: Rising insurance
costs for UK business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British businesses increasingly face an uphill task in finding insurance
cover for employees who suffer accidents or become ill through their work.
Employers' liability insurance, which is compulsory for UK companies, has
already become much more expensive in the past three years. Next year the
situation could get worse if, as expected, insurers reduce the scope of
cover offered in typical policies, because of moves by their own reinsurance
companies to restrict protection.
According to the UK risk managers association, Airmic, the issue ranks
alongside the environment and terrorism as among the most pressing facing
insurance buyers.
'It is a problem area,' says Alan Fleming, executive director of Airmic. He
estimates that employers' liability insurance can amount to 40 per cent of
overall insurance costs for some companies.
Premium rates for manual workers have risen by an average of at least 20 to
30 per cent annually in recent years, with rates rising in some cases from
perhaps 0.2 per cent to between 5 per cent and 8 per cent of payroll. The
more serious threat is that employers face even steeper increases for their
white collar workers; rates are rising from 0.01 per cent to as much as 0.3
per cent of payroll.
The background to all this is a rise in claims costs, which reflects a
number of political and social trends. New official health and safety
requirements and the greater willingness of workers, especially when
organised in trade unions, to claim damages in the courts have led to a
surge in disease claims. These now account for between 25 per cent and 40
per cent of the Pounds 500m paid each year in employers' liability claims by
UK insurance companies, compared to less than 20 per cent 10 years ago.
The picture is expected to deteriorate further as claims from victims of new
conditions - such as repetitive strain injury (RSI) and stress - come to the
courts.
A recent award of Pounds 79,000 in an RSI case involving a former Inland
Revenue typist is likely to encourage trade unions which are backing action
by other injured workers and has highlighted what James Hopper, employers'
liability specialist with Sedgwick, the insurance broker, recently qualified
as a 'potential epidemic'.
The biggest headache of all could be finding an insurer in the first place.
A number of companies have withdrawn from the market and no longer offer
'standalone' policies - and more are likely to follow suit. Reinsurers have
become concerned about the scale of potential losses following claims
stemming from the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion in 1988.
They have consequently begun to curb the traditionally unlimited cover they
offer insurance companies. Insurers now expect reinsurers to limit cover to
between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m per occurrence, when they renew their
annual policies for 1995. This means insurers may have to introduce changes
into their own contracts as they come up for renewal later this year.
What can companies do? Derek Howie, assistant liability manager for Eagle
Star, the BAT Industries subsidiary, predicts the emergence of a new 'excess
of loss' market where corporate buyers will be able to obtain cover above
the limits made available from their traditional insurers.
But risk managers, brokers and insurers expect the new combination of
circumstances to lead to greater interest in self-insurance, with many
buyers increasing the amount of risk they leave uninsured or self-insured.
Already many larger UK companies cover all claims under a certain level  -
with a limit of Pounds 100,000 typical for some large companies.
'Basically, it can allow cost savings. Companies are managing predictable
claims of a modest size themselves rather than handing over responsibility
to insurance companies,' says John Stoker, a consultant who works with
Tillinghast, the actuaries and management consultants.
Self-insurance can help cut legal bills, which add thousands of pounds to
costs. The self-insurance option is frequently accompanied by a more
pro-active approach to claims management. Companies can also reduce their
employers' liability costs by 'recognising when people have a real claim and
doing everything they can to settle it quickly,' explains Stoker. Trying to
resist all claims is like 'pushing water uphill', he comments.
Another option is to create a captive company, a specially created
subsidiary dedicated to insuring the risks of the parent and its
subsidiaries. Forming a captive insurance company can be expensive, partly
because captive managers must arrange for policies to be 'fronted' by an
insurance company licensed by the Department of Trade and Industry.
According to Hopper, this guarantee can cost between 5 per cent and 10 per
cent of the premium paid. Claims handling charges also add to the expense.
Howie at Eagle Star points out that insurers can provide valuable experience
in advising employers on the complex legal issues surrounding some claims.
Even so, self-insurance can still be an attractive option for many buyers,
especially larger companies. 'In the short term there is not a lot of money
going out,' explains Hopper.
Above all, the shrinkage in insurance cover will encourage companies to find
ways of controlling risk through improvements in management and safety
procedures.
Liz Taylor, risk manager of Harrisons and Crosfield, the conglomerate, and a
former Airmic president, recommends adoption of 'the best possible standards
of health and safety'.
The point is that if employers are unable to buy financial protection for
loss at an acceptable price, they may be forced to step up actions to
prevent losses in the first place.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Management: Fast mover in a changing world - Bessel Kok's
efforts to push Belgacom from bureaucratic leviathan to autonomous
enterprise  / Euromanager to watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bessel Kok admits that Belgacom's image was a standing joke when he took
over as chief executive of Belgium's state-owned telecommunications group at
the beginning of 1992. Delays in connecting subscribers were 'extravagant' -
some 50,000 people were waiting for telephones. The mobile telephone service
was 'lousy' and Belgacom, formerly called RTT, was seen as an unfriendly,
bureaucratic leviathan. 'That's pretty heavy as a core service problem,'
says Kok.
His task - to transform Belgacom into an autonomous enterprise, free of
direct government control - has been further complicated by European
Commission plans for complete liberalisation of ordinary telephone calls by
1998. At the same time, the cash-hungry Belgian finance ministry has started
to size up the company for privatisation, and telecoms competitors have
begun forging international alliances.
But on January 5 this year, Kok announced that Belgacom had achieved the
goals of its ambitious 1992-93 strategy: it had reduced the time taken to
connect most new customers to 20 days - and set a target of five days by the
end of this year, launched a new image, and established a modern, digital
mobile telephone network with Pacific Telesis International, a subsidiary of
PacTel, the US telecommunications group. 'Some of you didn't believe we were
going to meet this deadline,' he told journalists. 'But we have.'
Kok came to Belgacom from Swift, the global money transmission network for
banks, where he was chief executive for seven years. A dedicated chess fan
and professor of strategic management at Brussels' Flemish University, he
arrived with private-sector preconceptions about Belgacom's inefficient
bureaucracy. However, he was 'absolutely astonished' by the attitude of most
of the company's 26,000 staff.
'The company had a very strong willingness to change,' says Kok. 'It went
very deep in the organisation. And if you really analyse it, that's logical:
it isn't funny to be perceived by the majority of the public as a sleepy
organisation that doesn't listen.'
Kok's management style is direct. He began Belgacom's metamorphosis with a
letter to staff telling them 'tomorrow will not be like yesterday' and that
the old monopoly certainties were being undermined by technological advances
and pan-European liberalisation. 'As an organisation, we believe that this
is irreversible,' Kok said. 'As far as our company is concerned, we do not
believe that there will be a return to what we call the old times.'
Since Kok's arrival the group's 4m subscribers have become 'clients', whose
needs are paramount. A marketing department was set up with 100 staff and a
referendum issued to customers to find out what they thought about Belgacom.
The 60,000 who replied said the biggest problem was still the long wait for
service, from installation of a telephone to a simple directory inquiry. Kok
has moved fast to find solutions to these problems.
'Belgacom was late in the process of transformation,' he says. 'That's why
we were in a hurry. The Dutch, French, Scandinavians, even the Swiss,
started their transformation programmes earlier than we did, which was a
pity because in the late 1960s Belgacom was one of the leading operators in
Europe.'
Kok has tried the tempers of his political and boardroom bosses, some of
whom he believes were still steeped in the public sector culture. In late
1992, only 11 months into the job, his management - particularly of the
financial, personnel and mobile telephone dossiers - came under fire from
the board. Kok says he had difficulty coping with the interventionist
attitude of some directors and admits that at first he felt he had more
support from below than above.
'It was extremely difficult for me to implement immediately what I call a
private-sector model of authority and duties,' says Kok. 'In the beginning,
the board perceived its authority as going far more into operational
responsibilities than is done in the private sector.' Kok says the situation
has been 'improved but not resolved'. Certainly his position no longer seems
as precarious as it was painted 18 months ago.
He is no stranger to combat between executive and non-executive directors.
At Swift, which he joined in 1973, he struggled in vain with the
organisation's dominant bank shareholders, who resisted his proposals to
restructure the board, invest more power in the executive directors, and
expand the network to users other than banks.
At Belgacom, Kok also has to contend with the possibility that the
government may launch a premature privatisation. The finance ministry has
repeatedly hinted at partial flotation as part of its modest four-year
privatisation programme, which ends in 1996.
That is a short-term challenge which Kok could clearly do without. Although
a fast worker, he believes a hasty privatisation could do more harm than
good. As he put it in a speech in December last year: 'Privatisation should
be based on a clear decision of the government to go for it and then be
built on a scenario of careful trade-offs (between investment, social and
budgetary concerns) and, especially, appropriate timing.'
Kok's main priority now is to seek other international partners. He has
already overcome some internal opposition. His executive committee warned
him that giving Pacific Telesis a share of the mobile telephone joint
venture was 'giving the jewels away and linking up with potential
competition'. As it turned out, the two companies were able to transform
Belgium's mobile network in five months.

Steel fabricators are considering legal action against British Steel after
the company was fined Ecu32m (Pounds 24.3m) by the European Commission last
week for allegedly taking part in a cartel that rigged the market for beams
and girders.
The fabricators - which buy beams from British Steel, cut and weld them and
then erect them on building sites - have asked their representative
organisation, the British Constructional Steelwork Association, to see
whether there are grounds for legal action.
Mr Derek Tordoff, association director, said member companies were worried
that they may have paid too much for the beams between 1984 and 1990, when
the commission says a well-organised cartel was operating.
British Steel, which plans to appeal against the commission's judgment, said
the facts did not support any legal action by the fabricators.
The association hopes to discuss the issue with British Steel, which is the
only supplier in the UK of beams used in construction. It manufactures them
at its Teesside works.
Mr Tordoff stressed that the association was not trying to pick a fight with
British Steel and admitted it was in a delicate position.
The steelmaker, the association and its members have successfully worked
together to market steel frames in buildings. Last year, they were used in
62 per cent of buildings of two or more storeys compared with only 30 per
cent in 1980.
In addition, both the fabricators and British Steel are fighting steel
subsidies in Spain and Italy which are underpinning imports of fabrications
into the UK market.
Some fabricators believe they may have been paying Pounds 50 a tonne too
much for their beams from 1984 to 1990.
For a small operator using 30,000 tonnes over that period, the overpayment
would have been Pounds 1.5m.
British Steel says effective UK prices for beams rose by only 9 per cent
between 1986 and 1990, less than the rise in the retail prices index. It
said the fabricators' problems stemmed from the recession, which had caused
business to dry up after the period when the cartel was alleged to have
operated.

FT  21 FEB 94 / TUC urges rise in disabled quota
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Trades Union Congress yesterday urged the government to increase the
minimum proportion of disabled people that companies have to employ, which
is at present 3 per cent of a workforce.
It said the actual average figure was 0.8 per cent for public-sector
employers and 0.7 per cent for private companies, but that legal action was
rarely taken to enforce the quota.
It said Britain had one of the lowest percentages of disabled workers in
Europe and called for laws to combat discrimination against disabled people
trying to find work.

<TEXT>
Save &amp; Prosper, the investment house, is to cut the interest rates on its
Visa card to below 1 per cent from the beginning of March, Andrew Jack
writes.
The charge of 0.95 per cent a month, which equates to annualised interest of
13.9 per cent, is believed to be the lowest rate charged since credit cards
were launched in the late 1960s. Save &amp; Prosper caused a stir in the sector
last September when it launched its credit card at rates substantially below
the industry average.
The investment house said: 'This is to show that we react to cuts in
interest rates and are much more responsive than the larger issuers.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / Manchester prepares to receive angels: Plans to attract rich
investors to small business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 100 wealthy people will gather in Manchester this week to seek
angelic status.
They want to be 'business angels' - individuals who back small companies to
help them grow and thereby grow richer themselves. The aspiring angels hope
a local scheme will help them find businesses with potential.
Capital Access - run by Greater Manchester Business Innovation Centre - has
already enrolled 14 angels. They have so far made Pounds 2.8m of their own
money available for investment in unquoted companies under the government's
new Enterprise Investment Scheme - if suitable candidates can be found.
'This is the difficult part,' says Mr Philip Ellison, who runs the
innovation centre, 'since there appears to be no shortage of angels.' The
centre is acting as marriage broker, assessing high-risk, hightechnology
projects to select applicants for investment.
He had planned a small, private seminar for about 30 people on Wednesday to
promote the scheme. But demand forced the event's expansion to more than 100
places, surprising the sponsors - Pannell Kerr Foster, the accountancy firm,
and the Manchester office of Davies Arnold Cooper, a corporate law firm. The
scheme itself is backed by Manchester Chamber of Commerce and National
Westminster Bank, which has seconded Mr Paul Cochrane, a specialist in
risk-assessment, to work on it full-time.
He will make sure angels are rewarded for their good deeds with tax breaks.
However, Mr Cochrane warns: 'Our advice is, don't make investments to save
tax but for positive reasons, such as trying for real growth. Once in, the
taxation arrangements can be tailored for maximum benefit.'
This message will be reinforced on Wednesday by Mr Peter Cookson, one of
only two of the angels already in Capital Access willing to speak at the
seminar and the only one willing to be interviewed.
Mr Cookson, a chartered accountant, will not say how much he is worth, but
he made his money from being part of two management buy-outs. The first, in
1983, involved a Hanson subsidiary.
He says: 'The Enterprise Investment Scheme only allows 20 per cent tax
relief, compared with 40 per cent under the old Business Expansion Scheme,
which it replaces. You can invest up to Pounds 100,000 per deal, where each
deal's total investment package is below Pounds 1m. The potential tax
savings are not enough in themselves to be much of a driving force.
'The big advantage of the new rules, however, is that investors can become
involved, where they could not under BES. If you can take an active part in
growing the business, it's a way of removing some of the risk from unquoted
shares, especially if you have managerial experience.
'I will only look at companies where I can add value, such as through
advice, guidance and the benefit of having done it before. If someone just
wanted a sleeping partner, I would not be interested. I also want to like
the people involved. The other thing I shall be saying on Wednesday is only
invest what you are prepared to lose.'
Of the 14 angels, all but one want to be active. They would take minority
stakes of up to 25 per cent, or buy redeemable stock to encourage the
business they back to greater efforts so they can buy the equity back.
Most angels are likely to be fee-earning, non-executive directors. Some
deals may involve co-investment with an institution, such as a regional
venture capital fund, with the angel representing the co-investors on the
board.

FT  21 FEB 94 / East London Labour split may aid BNP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects of the far-right British National party strengthening its position
in May's London council elections have been increased by divisions among
Labour councillors in Tower Hamlets.
In September the BNP took its first local authority seat by winning a Tower
Hamlets council by-election.
It won one of the three seats in Millwall ward from Labour after fighting
its campaign on a platform of 'rights for whites'.
Mr Ted Johns, a Labour councillor in Millwall, last week resigned the Labour
whip and announced his intention to stand as a candidate for the newly
formed East London People's Alliance in the May elections.
The alliance, which has the support of Labour members unhappy about the
party's performance in the wake of the BNP by-election victory, plans to
field candidates elsewhere in Tower Hamlets.
Anti-racist organisations expect the BNP to contest about 12 of the 50 Tower
Hamlets council seats in May.
The party, which has been campaigning hard in the borough since its victory
in September, stands to benefit if the new alliance causes the Labour and
Liberal Democrat votes to be spread more thinly.
If a split in the Labour vote caused by Mr Johns's resignation enabled the
BNP to win all three Millwall seats it would, under Tower Hamlets' devolved
structure, control the Isle of Dogs Neighbourhood, which provides the
council's services in the south of the borough.
Mr Johns said yesterday he had been warned by colleagues that the East
London People's Alliance risked splitting the vote and strengthening the
BNP.
However, he blamed in-fighting in both the Labour party and the council's
controlling Liberal Democrat group since the BNP victory for causing
disillusion among electors and assisting the BNP's cause.
Mr Johns said: 'I will support whatever group has the best chance of
defeating the BNP.
'I believe the new alliance has a good chance of top-slicing support across
the parties.'
An inquiry after the by-election by Lord Lester QC, a Liberal Democrat peer,
found that leaflets produced by some of the Liberal Democrat party's
activists had pandered to racist prejudice.
Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrats accepted the findings of the inquiry earlier
this month only after being threatened with suspension from the national
party.
September's by-election took place against a background of severe racial
tension in Tower Hamlets, and community leaders say attacks on members of
the Asian community and other racially motivated incidents have increased
since then.

FT  21 FEB 94 / South-west regroups forces after military blow: A look at
three counties' efforts to diversify their defence-dominated economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month staff will move into a wisteria-clad regency building in
Chippenham, Wiltshire, as part of one initiative to tackle the biggest
challenge facing the south-west's economy - diversification away from
defence.
The south-west has been identified by the Department of Trade and Industry
as having the highest defence dependency in the country. Within that region
Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Avon are seen as highly vulnerable to cuts in
defence industries and military services.
The three counties have more than 70 military bases and Ministry of Defence
civilian centres, 45 large defence manufacturers and hundreds of suppliers.
Defence-related employment is put at 110,000 people or more than 11 per cent
of the working population. But in Wiltshire alone, 11 military bases are
closing or running down in the next few years.
Faced with this pay-off from the peace dividend, the three counties formed a
unique collaboration last year to bid jointly for European Konver funds,
which are intended to aid areas suffering from the rundown in defence
spending. The bid quoted forecasts that more than 20,000 jobs could be lost
in the three counties by the year 2000.
In December the south-west was awarded the largest single tranche of the
funds, Pounds 2.5m of the total Pounds 15.5m UK allocation. Avon,
Gloucestershire and Wiltshire won the biggest share in the south-west with a
grant of Pounds 1.3m. Mr Richard Brown, chief executive of the Western
Development Partnership, an economic forum involved in the bid, says: 'We
got the money because we had a strategy, but also because of the partnership
approach.'
The Konver money, which has to be matched locally, is now starting to be
allocated to specific projects. Among these is the Chippenham regency
building, in which a business development centre is being set up with Pounds
100,000 of European funding over two years. The centre's partners include
the county council, which helped to buy the building, Wiltshire Training and
Enterprise Council, and Workout, a charity which advises redundant MoD
staff.
In addition to training and consultancy services the centre will provide
help in the take-up of new technology. Mr Norman Hayes, of Great Western
Enterprise, one of the partners, says it will work closely with Chippenham
Technical College and in particular aims to support companies employing
fewer than 150 people. 'We want them to have the advantage of every possible
resource to adapt their products to meet market demand as they swing away
from defence,' he says.
Other Konver projects in the three counties include feasibility studies for
the reuse of redundant military bases and a business-networking scheme. One
of the most significant projects, which won a grant of Pounds 240,000, is
for a technology and innovation management team, co-ordinated by Western
Development Partnership.
Its aim is to develop a flow of technology between industry and
higher-education institutions. It will offer advice on new product
development and marketing and refer small and medium-size companies to
colleges or other institutions for help with, for example, product testing.
A team of three counsellors will tour companies, providing free advice for
up to a day.
One idea is to provide technology and innovation vouchers up to a value of
Pounds 600. Awarded at the discretion of the counsellors, companies will be
able to exchange the vouchers at colleges or research centres to meet half
the cost of specialist work and services.
The Konver funding is the first time the three counties have benefited from
any government or European-funded initiatives for economic diversification.
But, compared with the scale of the task in adapting labour skills and
encouraging companies to innovate, there is a belief that Konver is only
skimming the surface.
'The amount of money which has been won for this region is welcome but
inadequate,' says Ms Linda Skinner, director of the Centre for Innovation
and Industry at the University of the West of England in Bristol. 'We will
be pressing hard for more resources to flow.
'Our research shows that, at present, many businesses are not aware that
they are defence-dependent, particularly where they are second and third
level in a supply chain.'
Mr Adrian Kendry, of the university's research unit in defence economics,
says: 'One senses that the Konver programme is being used by the British
government as the lowest common denominator in getting involved in any
serious restructuring. While the Konver programme is laudable, it fails to
address the magnitude of what is required.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / Debate on worker democracy urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions should reopen the debate on worker democracy in British industry, Mr
Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said at the
weekend.
He said at a London conference that schemes to increase employee involvement
should cover all workers and not just union members.
He criticised the attempt made nearly 20 years ago, spearheaded by one of
his predecessors, Mr Jack Jones, to introduce union democracy by appointing
union shop stewards to company boards. 'We failed to carry the workers with
us then,' said Mr Morris. 'We did not consult them or ask who they wanted to
represent them.'
Mr Morris said that if works councils were introduced into industry they
should not be exclusively for trade unionists. He added that workers might
well elect trade unionists to works councils, but it would be up to the
unions to convince workers to join them as members.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Boardrooms pressed on standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government-sponsored guide-lines are published today which aim to increase
the professionalism of company directors.
The guidelines were commissioned by the Department of Employment last year
in response to corporate scandals and to concerns that many company boards
do not function properly.
They say chief executives need up to 25 personal attributes including
energy, imagination and openness if they are to be effective.
'I'd be surprised if too many companies were living up to these standards at
the moment,' said Mr Victor Dulewicz of the Henley Management College. 'Most
would admit there is scope for improvement.'
The draft standards, drawn up by the college and the Institute of Directors,
cover every aspect of the skills, composition and behaviour of boards of
directors.
The guidelines say directors have four primary tasks: to establish a
company's vision, mission and values; to set strategy and structure; to
supervise management; and to be responsible to stakeholders.
The standards also establish principles for chairmen to ensure that the
structure of the board is correct and is run in an efficient manner.
The guidelines are likely to meet opposition from many companies which feel
that the behaviour of boards is something that should vary from one company
to another and does not lend itself to fixed rules.
Mr John Harper, development director at the institute and co-author of the
report, said that although the standards did not hold out a promise to make
every company outstandingly successful, they offered a generally applicable
checklist against which companies could measure their performance.
Mr Harper said the lists of requirements for directors were based on the
views of hundreds of board directors interviewed over the past year. He said
that if one board member lacked certain attributes, other board members
should be found who possessed them.
The guidelines are being circulated for discussion and a final version will
be drawn up in the autumn.
The standards, which will be non-binding, are being seen as complementary to
the Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance which
has laid down guidelines on the accountability of directors of quoted
companies.

FT  21 FEB 94 / CBI attacks Clarke over complexity of finance bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is to be warned today that the regulatory
complexity of this year's finance bill will hit 'the innocent as well as the
guilty' and impose 'additional costs' on businesses.
Mr Howard Davies, the Confederation of British Industry's director-general,
has written to Mr Clarke calling for a review of the way new taxes are
drafted and enacted. He is joined by the British Chambers of Commerce.
Mr Davies says 'the massive length and the drafting complexity' of this
year's bill highlights the inadequacies of existing procedures.
'We are not complaining about the government's need to close tax loopholes
which permit abuses of the system,' Mr Davies says. 'But the regulatory
burden imposed by a bill of this magnitude hits the innocent as well as the
guilty and its complexity imposes additional costs on hard-pressed firms
whose managers' time would be better spent on more productive work.'
The Treasury rejected the CBI's criticisms. 'The bill introduced legislation
which was believed to be necessary to help business and bring about a
sustainable recovery,' it said.
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of
Commerce, said: 'We understand the need for a unified Budget but things have
got out of hand when no businessman has a chance of understanding the tax
system. Ironically, we have a 244-clause finance bill published within days
of the de-regulation bill.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / EU environment laws will 'cost companies billions'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The costs to British companies of complying with European Union
environmental policy are continuing to rise and will run into billions of
pounds, says a report published today.
Mr Adrian Wilkes, author of the report by Environmental Policy Consultants,
a London-based consultancy, says: 'A torrent of policy proposals is about to
be unleashed, presenting British business with an unprecedented challenge.'
The survey, which identifies 96 environmental policy proposals in the
pipeline, says all companies will be affected by tighter controls on
pollution, the need to use energy more efficiently and requirements to
disclose information.
The report argues that phasing out HCFCs - chemicals that deplete the
atmosphere's ozone layer - could cost the UK food industry Pounds 500m.
'Britain's political campaign to stop the momentum of Brussels policy-making
has failed,' says Mr Wilkes. Ten days ago Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the
environmental commissioner, repeated his refusal to give the UK more time to
comply with water directives.
Environmentalists yesterday attacked the report's conclusions. Mr Andrew
Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, said:
'It is the member countries and the European Council of Ministers who are
driving this regulation along - it is wrong to blame the (European)
Commission.'

Motorcycle sales should bottom out this year at 40,000 units, ending nearly
15 years of decline from the 315,000 in 1980, the Motor Cycle Industry
Association said yesterday.
The year started well with January sales rising 11.8 per cent to 2,626
compared with the corresponding month a year earlier. The figures reflect a
fundamental change in the nature of the market.
Sales of small-capacity machines including mopeds, which made up the bulk of
1980s sales, have tumbled as increasing affluence has wiped out their role
as providers of cheap utility transport.
'We cannot ignore the fact that our market is changing and becoming more
leisure-oriented,' said Mrs Monica Dickman, who chairs the industry's market
information and forecasting committee.
Industry research shows that half of all riders are now classified in the
top three socio-economic groups and that the average age of motorcyclists
has risen sharply, with more than 70 per cent aged 26 or over.
A high proportion of large-capacity machines costing Pounds 5,000 or more is
partially compensating dealers financially for sharply reduced sales.

FT  21 FEB 94 / SIB wants pensions change: 'Cooling-off' period of 14 days
proposed for transfer schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'cooling-off' period is likely to be introduced in sales of personal
pensions to people transferring out of employers' schemes. The proposal
follows recommendations being drawn up by the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief watchdog.
The 'period of reflection' would mean that there would be a delay of at
least 14 days between a customer taking the decision to transfer a lump sum,
and the sum itself being transferred.
The recommendations draw on the consultation paper published by SIB last
year about cancellation rights. They also build on the standards set out in
the enforcement guidance issued in 1992 by Lautro, the self-regulating
organisation for the life assurance industry, and Fimbra, the
self-regulating organisation for independent financial advisers.
An interim statement from the network of committees advising SIB on measures
to encourage better standards of selling in pension transfer cases is
expected in a week's time. But a full statement will not come until the
proposals have been approved by SIB's board at its meeting in March.
The work was started because of concern about the mis-selling of pension
transfers. A pilot study last year found evidence of widespread
non-compliance with regulators' standards.
SIB's steering group, which is made up of regulators, meets today to discuss
recommendations from a working party. These will then go later in the week
to the advisory committee chaired by Sir Douglas Wass, a former permanent
secretary at the Treasury.
They include plans for the regulators to authorise methods of analysing
transfer details in order to ensure greater standardisation of the systems
used in these complex calculations.
There are also likely to be measures to ensure that regulators are in a
better position to know which of the organisations they regulate are
carrying out pension transfers.
This could mean that special permission from the regulator would be required
to carry out pension transfer business. Some of those involved in the work
believe that the special permission requirement should apply to any business
dealing with occupational schemes.

FT  21 FEB 94 / GMB urges police to 'feel collars'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The GMB general union has urged the Serious Fraud Office to investigate
companies that have profited by persuading people to transfer into private
pension plans while disregarding a legal requirement to give best advice.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary, said he was writing to the SFO calling
for an investigation. He said: 'They should start at the top. The fat-cat
directors of the insurance companies knew what was going on. They set up the
personal-pension plans, they organised the commission systems, they failed
to train the salesmen properly, and they failed to operate proper
supervision.'
He told a weekend conference in Epsom, Surrey, that it was time for the
police to become involved. He said that 'millions of people have been
connned out of thousands of pounds each' by insurance company sales staff
peddling 'second-rate' personal pensions.
Police should enter the boardrooms of companies involved, he said, and 'feel
a few collars'. He criticised the composition of the steering group set up
by the Securities and Investments Board in December to try to establish how
many people were worse off. No trade union or consumer representatives were
included in the group.
People who had been made redundant had proved easy targets for the insurance
companies, he said. 'Almost no one can calculate how much their existing
pension will be worth when they retire. So we are all easy prey to a
salesman with a plausible line in patter.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / Sharp increase in van financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharp increases have been recorded in the number of used and new commercial
vehicles being bought on hire purchase, providing a clear pointer to
returning confidence among small businesses, John Griffiths writes.
Statistics from HPI, the credit-monitoring organisation, show that finance
agreements in January on new light commercials jumped 77.2 per cent last
month on a year-on-year basis. Finance agreements on new trucks rose by 63.8
per cent on January last year.
Finance agreements on used light commercials, mainly Ford Transit-type panel
vans and those based on cars, rose by 46.7 per cent and on used trucks by 63
per cent.
The increases in finance deals are well in excess of those for the new light
commercial vehicle market as a whole, indicating that bigger operators have
yet to start replacing their fleets on a large scale. Total sales last month
of new panel vans rose by 12 per cent compared with a year ago, but those of
new light vans were down 12 per cent.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Barclays says recovery can withstand tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery is strong enough to withstand April's tax rises, says Barclays
Bank, in spite of last week's poor economic statistics.
In an upbeat economic review published today, Barclays says interest rates
are close to their low point and are unlikely to go below 5 per cent.
Mr Alan Davies, Barclays' chief economist, says: 'There has been little
general appreciation of just how far the economy has moved away from the
recession.'
He says recent data 'should not detract from the fact that the overall
recovery has been stronger than expected a year ago. Despite some
disappointment with last week's statistics, the balance of evidence still
suggests strengthening demand and output.'
Barclays predicts growth in UK gross domestic product of 2.7 per cent this
year, rising to 2.9 per cent in 1995. Inflation is forecast to reach 3.2 per
cent by the end of this year and 4.2 per cent by the end of 1995.
Unemployment is expected to fall to 2.55m by the end of this year.
Mr Davies says resilient consumer spending and an improvement in the
corporate sector's financial position point to a strengthening recovery.
Also, 'UK exporters are well placed to build on the resilient performance of
the past year'.
Barclays' view of the prospects for the developed economies is the most
optimistic for three years. Mr Davies says: 'Growth will be somewhat
stronger in 1994, with the continuing upturn in the United States being
joined by recoveries in Japan and Europe in response to lower interest
rates.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / Manufacturing jobs 'continue to fall'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of jobs in manufacturing is continuing to fall and the outlook
continues to look uncertain, says a report on employment trends in the last
quarter of 1993.
The survey, published today by the AEEU engineering and electrical union and
based on information from the union's local offices, found only one company
in the survey with job vacancies in the period while 15 per cent made
redundancies.
Mr Bill Jordan, AEEU president, said: 'Our survey shows employers are acting
nervously while talking about confidence in the recovery. Our members are
fighting for this recovery. It is time the employers started to do the
same.'
Over the whole of last year one-in-five companies in the AEEU survey
reported redundancies compared with one in 25 with vacancies.
The survey also found a fall in the number of companies reporting good
prospects for orders. They dropped to 17.6 per cent in the fourth quarter,
down from 27.8 per cent in the previous three months.
The survey sample of 413 companies covered more than 40,000 employees.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Names begin long journey through courts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court will this week consider the first of 38 legal actions by
loss-making Names which would have been settled in Lloyd's unsuccessful
Pounds 900m offer.
The case is being brought by 366 Names - the individuals whose assets have
traditionally supported the insurance market - who were members of Pulbrook
syndicate 334 and lost Pounds 44m in the 1985 year of account. It will start
on Wednesday and is expected to last four weeks. The Names are suing the
Pulbrook agency, which managed the syndicate and is now part of the Merrett
Group, and 11 separate members' agents who placed them on the syndicate.
The syndicate specialised in 'long-tail' insurance business in which claims
often emerge many years after inception of the policy. It had a stamp
capacity - the amount of premiums it can accept under Lloyd's rules - of
Pounds 22.2m.
The syndicate has a large exposure to pollution which accounts for 76 per
cent of all its reserves. Chatset, the firm which analyses the results of
the Lloyd's market, says the syndicate's losses could reach more than Pounds
120m, or about Pounds 60,000 for every Pounds 10,000 committed by each of
its Names.
The court is also set to rule this week in a case by two Names alleging
negligence by members' agents in the selection of syndicates. The case - in
which Mr Justice Gatehouse will give judgment - is one of a number launched
by individual Names outside action groups. Mr David Tiplady, one of two
solicitors involved in the case, said it 'could open the gate for other
cases'.
Also this week Mr Justice Cresswell will begin a review of the timetabling
and other aspects of litigation planned by Names. He took over
responsibility for the cases following the appointment of Mr Justice Saville
to the Court of Appeal in January.
The biggest legal action by Names - involving 3,000 Gooda Walker Names -
will begin on April 26. Some 1,950 Feltrim Names expect their case to come
to court in October.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Ulster talks 'will not wait' for DUP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments yesterday insisted that neither Sinn Fein
nor the hardline Democratic Unionist party will be allowed to hold up the
next phase of talks on the future of Northern Ireland agreed at the weekend
by the two countries' prime ministers.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he believed there were
'still grounds for reasonable hope' that Sinn Fein would respond positively
to the Downing Street peace declaration. But he stressed that talks - to be
based on the document - would not wait for its decision. He added: 'We are
ready to go at any time.'
His suggestion that Mr Ian Paisley's DUP would also be unable to veto
political progress was immediately backed by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland secretary.
Sir Patrick said: 'We should not permit the process to be halted by the
action of those who are eligible to join in but who say, 'No we are not
coming'.' The DUP has refused to join the talks unless the British
government abandons the Downing Street declaration.
Mr Reynolds, speaking on BBC television, said his meeting on Saturday with
Mr John Major, the prime minister, had allayed concerns that future talks
might be narrowly based on an internal political settlement in Ulster.
Mr Reynolds said both sides now had a clearly agreed starting point for the
next talks, which would embrace the so-called three-stranded process. He
said he believed the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party,
which has not yet committed itself to the talks, would be 'content and
happy' with the outcome of the weekend talks.
It is understood that the SDLP, in an unpublicised session, met Sir Patrick
last week to discuss his 'check-list' of ideas for political progress which
have been submitted to Dublin.
Although London has, in return for assurances about the scope of the talks,
persuaded Dublin to commit itself to pressing on with them, both governments
will maintain a low-key approach at least until after Sinn Fein's annual
conference outside Dublin next weekend.
The next inter-governmental conference is scheduled for March 10.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Lilley faces call to kill welfare state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Adam Smith Institute, the think-tank that pioneered Thatcherite policies
in the 1980s, plans to put Mr Peter Lilley, the rightwing social security
secretary, on the spot next week by calling for the end of the welfare
state.
The Conservative party's leading free-market campaigners are planning an
assault on its welfare state policies, believing ministers have lost the
will to carry through their long-term review of public spending.
The institute will argue that a full range of benefits - such as
unemployment and invalidity allowances - should be privatised and handled by
insurance companies.
It also calls on the government to push ahead with plans to allow more
people to opt out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps). It
proposes that the government should borrow money on the international debt
market so that it can pay more people to quit the scheme as soon as
possible.
Department of Social Security officials yesterday sought to distance Mr
Lilley from some of the institute's 'unworkable proposals' which they fear
could embarrass the government before the local and European elections.
The institute's pamphlet, written by its president Mr Madsen Pirie, is
likely to give a new impetus to the hard core of Tory backbenchers who are
increasingly frustrated at what they see as the timidity with which the
government is pursuing Thatcherite reforms.
A leading member of the Thatcherite 92 Group said: 'Many Tory MPs will be
sympathetic to the institute's call for the end of the welfare state. We
would like Mr Lilley to speed up his review of social security spending.'
Another backbencher dismissed government concerns about the timing of a
controversial document before the local and European elections in May and
June. 'We should not stop thinking about the future just because there are
difficult elections ahead' he said.
Mr Lilley is understood to believe that borrowing money now to help people
contract out of Serps has an attraction because the government could repay
the loan in 20 or 30 years time with the larger sums that had been saved.
However, he is concerned about the problem of paying high interest rates on
short-term borrowings of capital that could only be paid back over decades.
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, recently said that the fundamental
review of public spending initiated last year by Mr Michael Portillo, the
chief secretary to the Treasury, had not had a strong enough impact on the
last Budget.
Another rightwing Tory MP claimed yesterday that Mr Portillo's review of
areas such as Home Office spending had not been pushed through strongly
enough. He said the chief secretary had called for a sweeping reassessment
only to find substantial funds had been granted for prison building.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Labour to urge broader role for private finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party will today argue that private finance should be extended
beyond transport and infrastructure in a consultative paper on
public-private partnerships.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor and one of the authors of the new plan,
said the party had 'stolen a march on the Tories' by calling for an
extension of private finance to hospitals, education and inner-city
projects.
The plan is set out in a Labour document called Financing Infrastructure
Investment - Promoting a Partnership between Public and Private Finance.
Labour has long called for private investment for transport infrastructure
projects.
Its latest policy for a public-private partnership is intended to replace
its traditional stance of support for the remaining state-owned
corporations.
Labour's paper says: 'Britain badly needs capital investment across the
whole range of our infrastructure, from the railways to childcare
facilities.
'One potent way of providing it is through promoting a partnership between
public and private finance.'
Mr Brown believes it has proved difficult in practice to bring the elements
together. He will argue today that the government must lead in promoting
partnership between public and private sectors.
The document says: 'We are consulting on a way of setting appropriate profit
performance measures for such bodies.'
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary and another of the
document's authors, said: 'What the paper does is take Treasury rules by the
scruff of the neck and give them a very firm shake in order to open up the
possibility of much greater investment in public enterprise and public
services.'
The document was criticised by Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrats' Treasury
spokesman, who accused Labour of joining the Tories in hoping that private
finance would rescue them from tough decisions on tax and spending.
Everyone, including the Liberal Democrats, wanted more private capital to go
into public transport, schools and hospitals, Mr Beith said.
'But at the end of the day you cannot duck the need for significant public
finance, because many of the vital projects cannot produce a commercial
return, and others require a Treasury guarantee because the private sector
simply does not want the level of risk involved.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / Seeking a safe grave for deadly remains: George Graham
assesses an international tussle over how to dispose of spent uranium
acceptably
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weighed against the hundreds of tonnes of plutonium and bomb-grade uranium
now being recovered from nuclear reactors and missiles around the world,
17.5 tonnes of highly enriched uranium from a few dozen European research
reactors might seem small.
But a five-year gap, during which the US stopped taking back the spent HEU
it had supplied to these reactors, has created a crisis with ramifications
far beyond the world of nuclear research.
The row over spent fuel has its origins in a bargain struck by the US, in
the 1950s, and renewed in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. To
discourage other countries from embarking on nuclear bomb research, the US
would help them to benefit from non-military applications of nuclear
technology, such as the production of medical isotopes or neutron-scattering
investigations of the structure of metals or ceramics.
To keep highly enriched uranium, which fuels some research reactors and
which could be used to make a nuclear bomb, in safe hands, the US agreed to
take back the used fuel that it had supplied.
In 1978, it went a step further, with the Reduced Enrichment for Research
and Test Reactors programme, or RERTR, under which operators of reactors
were encouraged to convert from HEU to low-enriched uranium which could not
be directly used for bombs.
RERTR has had considerable success, and only four European research reactors
have not begun at least to convert to LEU. 'It's one of the unsung victories
of non-proliferation,' says Mr Alan Kuperman of the Nuclear Control
Institute, a Washington anti-proliferation group.
In 1988, however, the US left European reactor operators in the lurch when
it stopped accepting spent HEU, after a law suit brought by the Sierra Club,
a San Francisco-based ecology group, had challenged the environmental
safeguards surrounding the disposal of the fuel.
The US State Department pressed hard for a resumption of the spent fuel
programme.
'A breakdown of the international consensus on conversion of research and
test reactors to LEU, and a return to an HEU fuel economy, would undermine
15 years of intensive US non-proliferation efforts on this matter and
substantially reduce the ability of the US to influence nuclear policy in
bilateral and international fora,' Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of
state, warned.
But the US Energy Department let the standstill on accepting spent fuel drag
on until last summer, when Mrs Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary, announced a
new three-part policy. This comprised:
A special waiver of environmental review requirements for reactors facing a
real emergency.
An accelerated environmental assessment to allow the US to take back a
limited amount of spent fuel from reactors facing near-term difficulties.
A full environmental impact statement to allow the US to resume taking back
all the spent HEU it has supplied, and to take back spent LEU for a 10-year
period as an incentive to more reactors to convert from HEU to LEU.
The environmental assessment, due to be completed by the end of next month,
proposes the acceptance of 448 spent fuel elements from reactors in Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland,
for storage at the Energy Department's Savannah River facility in South
Carolina.
The nine reactors face a variety of problems that mean they cannot wait
until the longer environmental impact statement, covering the acceptance of
about 15,000 fuel elements, has been completed at the end of 1995. Some have
simply run out of storage space for spent fuel; others face regulatory
constraints.
They could be pushed into abandoning the RERTR programme and converting back
to HEU, or could be forced to shut down.
Two operators, Germany's GKSS and Belgium's SCK/CEN, have already resorted
to shipping spent HEU for reprocessing at the UK Atomic Energy Authority's
Dounreay plant, in Scotland.
Although Mrs O'Leary gave emergency clearance for SCK/CEN last year, the
Belgian reactor chose Dounreay.
US officials say they have no qualms about the physical safety of Dounreay
but they worry that reprocessing, which the US itself abandoned in 1988,
would perpetuate the use of HEU.
The Belgian plant cannot convert to LEU for technical reasons involving the
level of neutron flux it requires, but is frustrated at the difficulties of
dealing with the US as a supplier of fuel.
'We prefer to continue to be supplied by the US but, if these
discontinuities persist, we may have to look to other suppliers, including
Russia,' warns Dr Carl Malbrain, director general of SCK/CEN.
GKSS has converted to LEU, which cannot be reprocessed, but has told the US
that it has so little faith in its long-term reliability that it may shift
back to HEU so that it can continue to use Dounreay.
For many plants, however, converting back is not even an option, because the
Dounreay plant has to send back the resulting reprocessed fuel and
radioactive waste to the country of origin.
This rules out countries such as Denmark and Austria, which do not use
nuclear power and so have no plan for long-term storage of highly
radioactive waste.
'We are extremely dependent on a solution that is basically doing what we
were doing for the last 20 years,' says Dr Klaus Singer, director of the
Risoe reactor in Denmark.
European reactor operators say there has been a noticeable improvement since
the Clinton administration took over in the US at the beginning of 1993,
though they are unsure as to whether this is due to new people and policies
or because the problem had become so serious that it could no longer be
avoided.
They were encouraged by a meeting in Washington 10 days ago about the
short-term acceptance of their spent fuel, but many doubt whether the
longer-term environmental impact statement will be completed on time in
1995.
'It may take longer, like everything the Department of Energy has dealt with
so far. That's why there is a mixture of optimism and pessimism: there is no
reason for not being optimistic about the long-term outcome, but it will
take time,' says Dr Singer.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Venezuela bank head named as depositors fume

<TEXT>
The Venezuela government yesterday named Mr Gustavo Roosen, president of the
country's national oil company PDVSA, to head its intervention board at
Banco Latino, the second-largest Venezuelan bank, which failed last month.
He will have to face the increasingly militant demands of depositors seeking
access to their funds and try to carry out a government plan to re-float the
bank.
Mr Roosen's term as head of PDVSA, one of the world's largest oil companies,
was about to expire. President Rafael Caldera, who took office on February
2, has not yet named a successor.
Before he took the top job at PDVSA, Mr Roosen was education minister and a
senior executive at Empresas Polar, one of the world's largest beer
producers.
The appointment of Mr Roosen, a respected manager, represents a positive
step for the new administration, which is facing a spate of economic,
financial and social problems.
However, still with the unfolding banking crisis, Mr Caldera is also
grappling with political opposition to his efforts to replace the
superintendent of banks and the head of the deposit guarantee fund (Fogade).
The failure of Banco Latino sent has shock waves through Venezuela's
financial system. The government has had to use scarce financial resources
to repay many small depositors at Banco Latino and support other banks that
suffered from unusually large withdrawals in the wake of the Banco Latino
closure on January 14.
The government said last week that four other financial institutions had
received large sums of official financial assistance due to liquidity
problems.
Although neither the government nor the banks will say so publicly, this
amounts to a technical intervention in the institutions, which include three
commercial banks and another financial entity.

FT  21 FEB 94 / US tackles N-fuel dispute with Europeans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is seeking to resolve a nuclear fuel dispute that has shaken its
relations with operators of European reactors and has threatened the
country's credibility in nuclear non-proliferation negotiations due next
year, reports George Graham in Washington.
After five years of foot-dragging by successive US administrations, a draft
Department of Energy report has recommended that the US should immediately
take back spent nuclear fuel from nine European research reactors, some of
which could be forced to shut if they were unable to dispose of some of
their used fuel.
The US stopped taking back the fuel in 1988. In the view of Europeans, it
thus reneged on a decades-old bargain by which the European research
reactors agreed to convert from high-enriched uranium, which could be used
to make bombs, to low-enriched uranium.
If the US were seen not to be keeping its side of the nuclear bargain, that
could seriously weaken its efforts to persuade other countries to renew the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is due to be reviewed at an
international conference next year.
US and European officials say they are confident that remaining objections
by some environmentalists - and from the state of South Carolina, where the
spent fuel would end up - can be resolved by the end of March under an
accelerated procedure to assess the environmental consequences.
'In general, we are feeling very confident that we will be able to initiate
the spent fuel acceptance that is proposed in the environmental assessment,'
says Mr Charles Head of the US Energy Department.
This would allow shipment of up to 448 fuel elements to begin this summer
after a five-year gap, relieving the reactor operators' short-term problems.
However, a longer-term solution will require the completion of a full
environmental impact statement. This is a bureaucratic obstacle course
expected to drag on at least until the end of 1995.
Meanwhile, some reactor operators are growing increasingly irritated at US
unreliability. 'They haven't kept to any time limits,' complains Dr Klaus
Singer, director of Denmark's Risoe reactor.

US President Bill Clinton and Mr John Major, UK prime minister, are to meet
next Monday in Pittsburgh, in a gesture to the time spent by Mr Major's
father and grandfather in that area.
The two will travel back together from western Pennsylvania to Washington.
Mr Major will then spend the night at the White House, as the first foreign
leader to be invited to do so since Mr Clinton took office.
'I know the president is looking forward to it,' a White House official
said.
The arrangements for Mr Major's visit are seen as an effort to smooth over
the apparent rift between the US and the UK.
Besides differences of political philosophy between Mr Clinton and Mr Major,
their two governments have appeared at odds over Bosnia.
Also, friction was exacerbated by the Clinton administration's recent
decision to allow Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, to visit the US this
month.
Mr Major's father, Tom Ball, sailed from Liverpool to Philadelphia in the
1880s with his father, a master builder who worked at the Carnegie steel
works in the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains.

FT  21 FEB 94 / China political repression 'increasing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Asia Watch, the international human rights group, has accused China of
increasing political repression throughout the country, especially in Tibet
where most recent arrests have taken place.
A 664-page report documents more than 200 arrests of dissidents in 1993 and
is certain to intensify pressure on China at a sensitive moment in its
dealings with the West over human rights issues.
The report coincides with a heightened campaign by international human
rights organisations to block renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation
trading status in the US.
President Bill Clinton, who has called for 'overall, significant
improvement' in China's human rights behaviour, is due to decide by June
whether to renew the MFN status.
China is also under pressure at the current session in Geneva of the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights. This is in spite of its recent efforts
to counter international criticism by releasing well known dissidents.
Mr Sidney Jones, executive director of the US-based Asia Watch, called at
the weekend for 'continued pressure' on China on human rights issues. His
statement reflected concerns that the US is moving towards MFN renewal
without securing substantial concessions.
'There is clear evidence such pressure has been effective in the past,' he
said. 'Any move now to abandon that pressure would send a terrible signal to
Beijing - open season on peaceful dissent.'
Asia Watch said its lengthy report, entitled Detained in China and Tibet,
'shows clearly that political repression is increasing, not decreasing, and
that it extends to virtually every province in China and throughout the
Tibetan plateau.'
Among specific Asia Watch criticisms were:
1993 was the 'worst' year for political arrests since the crackdown that
followed the 1989 Tiananmen massacre with 250 cases, compared with last
year's release of 37 dissidents.
80 per cent of the new political arrests occurred in Tibet, where the
authorities embarked on an 'intensified' campaign of repression against
Buddhist monks and nuns involved in pro-independence activities.
The number of people detained for 'peaceful political and religious
activities' is far higher than that 3,317 figure given by China as the
number of sentenced 'counter-revolutionaries'. The authorities say there are
'no political prisoners in China'.
Chinese standards of justice remain abysmally low by international
standards, with limited prospects of a fair trial for those accused of
'counter-revolutionary crime'.
Torture is widely practised both to secure 'confessions' and to maintain
control in China's extensive prison and labour-camp system.
Asia Watch said 'a most pressing and immediate need' was to secure regular
access for organisations like the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) to work for better treatment of those in detention.
It also called for more determined international efforts to uphold Article
12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 'ensure that no one is
arbitrarily detained in the first place'.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Mobile phone companies win in Pakistan crisis

   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistani businessmen are traditionally inclined to blame political turmoil
for their sufferings and commercial difficulties. But political infighting
and uncertainty bring the reverse results for the country's two mobile
telephone companies.
Mobile phones, previously an important status symbol for Pakistani
politicians, have become invaluable political tools for times of crisis when
politicians have to outsmart their rivals.
Next Wednesday's vote of no confidence against Mr Sabir Shah, Chief Minister
of the North West Frontier Province, has put politicians at loggerheads.
However, the phone companies are expecting a 15 to 20 per cent increase in
revenues. The move to oust Mr Shah has the support of Ms Benazir Bhutto,
prime minister, and may end with the chief minister's downfall. Mr Shah is
backed by the Moslem League party of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the opposition leader.
Tempers have been running high. Mr Sharif's supporters have warned of an
armed confrontation and some have urged their followers to physically resist
any move to replace the Shah government. Both sides have accused each other
of 'horse-trading' and efforts to bribe MPs to make them change sides.
'Mobile phones help to minimise horse-trading. Members of the house can be
taken away to safe places. They can still keep in touch with friends, but
its much harder for anyone to approach them and offer money,' says an
opposition MP in Islamabad. 'Every political being wants a mobile phone.
They feel that it can't be tapped. They feel secure about it,' says Mr
Iftikhar Gillani, another opposition MP.
However, mobile phones remain beyond the reach of ordinary Pakistanis. The
two companies - Paktel and Instaphone provide a service to only 25,000
clients - a tiny proportion in a population of 120m.
Charging between Rs1,000 (Pounds 22.50) and Rs2,000 in a flat fee allowing
up to 450 minutes of free airtime per month, the mobile companies are almost
three times as expensive as the conventional phone network. But costs are
not deterring new investors from entering the market - a third phone company
is expected soon.

<TEXT>
Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, has arrived back in the colony after
an official visit to Australia to be promptly greeted by warnings from China
about his plans for political reform.
The criticism from Beijing came as a prelude to an important week for Mr
Patten and his proposals for democratic reform in Hong Kong.
The first of two bills enshrining his plans for limited democracy in Hong
Kong will be voted on in the Legislative Council (LegCo) on Wednesday. On
Friday, he is expected to publish a second, more controversial, bill which
provides for more democracy.
Alongside the publication of his second bill, the government is also
expected to issue an official account of the failed negotiations between
Britain and China on the issue of Hong Kong's political development. These
negotiations ended last November after 17 rounds of talks had failed to
produce any agreement.
On Wednesday, LegCo is likely to pass Mr Patten's first bill unamended,
government officials believe.

Elections in the East Malaysia state of Sabah have precipitated a battle
between local politicians and the federal government led by Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister.
In the weekend elections, the locally based Sabah Unity Party (PBS) narrowly
defeated Dr Mahathir's National Front coalition, winning 25 seats in the
48-seat state assembly. But when Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the leader of
the PBS and Sabah chief minister for the last nine years, went to be sworn
in for another five-year term, he was forbidden entry to the governor's
mansion.
At first the governor, a federal government appointee, was said to be unsure
of who to appoint chief minister. He was then said to be sick and
unavailable to carry out his duties.
The PBS said there was a plot to deny the party its position as leader of
Sabah's government. Sabah is one of only two states in the Malaysian
federation which is not aligned with the National Front. Dr Mahathir has
made no secret of his antipathy towards the PBS and to Mr Pairin in
particular.
Last night, almost 24 four hours after the result was announced, Mr Pairin
was still waiting outside the locked gates of the governor's mansion. The
governor announced that a swearing-in ceremony would take place on Monday,
but did not say who was to be appointed chief minister.
Meanwhile, Dr Mahathir said he had received reports that Mr Pairin had
locked up several elected PBS members of the assembly for fear that they
would defect to the National Front. 'They should be given the right to
decide which party to support,' said Dr Mahathir.
The prime minister said the police might be forced to intervene if the
members were being forcibly detained.
The weekend's events mark another chapter in the colourful and often chaotic
politics of Sabah, the former British North Borneo. The PBS has accused the
National Front of money politics on a massive scale.
'Money was virtually being thrown from helicopters and distributed freely in
coffee shops,' said Mr Pairin of the National Front's campaign.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Japan tyre production suffers sharp fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tyre production in Japan, the world's second largest market, last year
experienced its worst decline since the second world war.
The manufacturers' plight was exacerbated by poor demand, falling prices,
and a deteriorating product mix as consumers bought cheaper tyres, according
to the Japan Automobile Tire Manufacturers' Association (Jatma).
The industry is suffering from rapidly falling demand in the domestic car
manufacturers' market as well as the replacement market. Production fell
from 166m units to 150m units.
Tyre shipments to domestic vehicle constructors fell 12.1 per cent to 50m
units last year. The fall mirrors a 10.2 per cent drop in Japanese vehicle
production last year, according to recent data released by the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Japanese vehicle exports collapsed
11.5 per cent last year. Jatma said automotive makers had also been
particularly aggressive in driving down tyre prices.
The domestic replacement tyre market also plummeted from 67.6m to 60.9m
units. The association added that mass merchandisers, which aggressively
discount prices, had increased their share to nearly 20 per cent of the
replacement market.
Imports have also been adding to the Japanese industry's troubles. Although
imports fell about 5 per cent to slightly less than 14m units, foreign
manufacturers increased their share of the market which dropped 9.8 per
cent.
The US was the largest importer in 1992 with 5m units, followed by Australia
with 1.97m units, Taiwan with 1.2m units and Korea with 1m units. Japanese
tyre exports fell only 1.2 per cent from 37.4m to 37m, in spite of the
strong yen.
Mr Akira Suzuki, Jatma's executive director, said no plants had closed over
the last 12 months, but extended maintenance periods had cut operating rates
from more than 90 per cent in 1992 to just over 80 per cent last year.
He expected Japanese companies to increase manufacturing capacity in
south-east Asia where costs are lower and demand is rising sharply.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Tough decisions lie ahead for Kuwaitis: Oil prices are weak
and parliament is strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With oil prices near a five-year low, an unfamiliar sound is emanating from
the Gulf states: the creak of tightening belts.
Saudi Arabia began this year pledging to cut government spending by a fifth.
Oman said it must trim its budget by 10 per cent. Qatar is cutting where it
can. In recent weeks, Kuwait has joined in. Kuwait's finance minister,
central bank governor and others have all signalled the need for big cuts in
state spending.
Each Gulf government faces a tough task, since either cutting spending or
raising revenues through higher fees on state-provided services (income
taxes in the Gulf are politically inconceivable) would mark the first time
in recent history that these 'oil rich' kingdoms, emirates and sheikhdoms
have had to face eroding the panoply of benefits each offers their
nationals.
Kuwait's task, however, is perhaps the stiffest since unlike its neighbours
the government has an elected parliament to deal with. And it already
appears that the opposition-dominated National Assembly is in no mood to
fall easily in line with the government's austerity calls.
Such calls have been issuing with increasing shrillness from Kuwaiti
policymakers - a measure partly of the worsening outlook for state finances,
but partly also of the government's appreciation that, for the first time in
its experience, it must persuade a strong and recalcitrant parliament. Mr
Nasser al-Rodhan, the finance minister, has recently begun using such
uncharacteristic Kuwaiti words as 'urgent reforms' and 'sacrifices'.
The reason for such calls is plain enough. Kuwait had already budgeted for a
KD1.2bn (Pounds 2.7bn) fiscal deficit for 1993-94 before oil prices
weakened. In January, however, Mr al-Rodhan revealed that at the midpoint of
Kuwait's June-July fiscal year, the state had already reached 67 per cent of
the budgeted deficit. Worse, soft crude prices forced the government to
revise its calculus for oil revenues - 89 per cent of state income - from
1.74m barrels per day of oil sold at an average Dollars 15 a barrel, to 2m
barrels a day sold at Dollars 10.50 a barrel.
This implies a big cut in revenues, though since the official budget
includes neither defence spending nor investment income, it is impossible
accurately to forecast the budgetary gap for 1993-94. However, senior
officials say they expect Kuwait to manage this deficit from its own
resources, partly through domestic treasury bill sales and partly from
overseas investment income.
Kuwait's overseas holdings were slashed from just under Dollars 100bn before
the Gulf war to nearer Dollars 35bn today, in a fire-sale to finance the
war's costs. But the remaining holdings earned a return of around 20 per
cent in 1993, thanks largely to bullish world equity markets. 'Last year our
assets grew at a rate more than enough to pay for the deficit,' says Mr Ali
Rashid al-Badr, managing director of the Kuwait Investment Authority.
But problems lie ahead. Kuwait cannot rely on continued buoyancy in world
equity markets any more than on a sharp recovery in crude prices. But state
spending will rise in
1994-95 as Kuwait starts repaying principal on the Dollars 5.5bn syndicated
loan taken out after the Gulf war, adding Dollars 2.7bn to annual outlays.
Under such additional pressure, Kuwait apparently has little option but to
cut spending elsewhere, or to raise revenues. Either would mean impinging on
the high salaries, subsidised services and other comforts which put Kuwait
among the most padded welfare states in the world.
More than 95 per cent of employed Kuwaitis, for instance, work in the public
sector. Salaries, accordingly, devour 52 per cent of government spending.
Healthcare, power, petrol, water and telephone calls are so heavily
subsidised as to be virtually free. But senior government figures believe
this is unsustainable. Sheikh Salem al-Sabah, the central bank governor,
says: 'Kuwaitis will have to suffer over the next two to three years - we
have no choice.'
The problem will be convincing Kuwait's National Assembly, which, through a
combination of its own industriousness and the diminished authority of the
ruling al-Sabah family since the Gulf war, has become the most powerful in
the state's history. It has already passed laws mandating parliamentary
scrutiny of some state investments, has investigated allegations of
corruption and mismanagement in Kuwait's Spanish investments and is seeking
further to expand its powers of veto and supervision.
Government budget proposals will have to be approved by the National
Assembly in spring. But talk of cuts and other radical solutions to Kuwait's
economic straits is unlikely to win much sympathy. The government has begun
to air such notions as privatisation and direct foreign investment, even in
the country's strategic oil industry. But MPs see privatisation largely as a
process likely to cost Kuwaitis jobs. Talk of even limited foreign
investment in the banking sector was met earlier this month with instinctive
cries of 'neocolonialism' among MPs.
As for the need to cut spending, or raise state revenues, few MPs seem to
consider this message has got across to most Kuwaitis, and fewer show much
inclination to be associated with such unpopular decisions. 'There's not yet
the feeling we must do anything, certainly not that we should make
sacrifices,' says Mr Abdulla al-Nibari, an opposition MP. He also echoes a
widely held view that a government associated with alleged fraud and
mismanagement in the state's multi-billion-dollar investments would find
itself on shaky ground if it tried to persuade Kuwaitis to cut their living
standards.
A tough and perhaps immobilising struggle between the government and the
assembly is therefore in prospect. With this in sight, many leaders of
Kuwaiti society, particularly senior members of Kuwait's main merchant
families, have been lobbying the ruling family to shake up the system and
pre-empt a debilitating political impasse. In private consultations with
Sheikh Saad al-Sabah, the prime minister and crown prince, they are
understood to have expressed disappointment with his apparent inability to
impose himself on either his cabinet colleagues or parliament itself.
The next step in what promises to be an intricate ballet by Kuwait's
cautious ruling family, its dogged parliament, anxious economic policymakers
and some increasingly frustrated merchants may well be a cabinet shake-up.
Kuwait newspapers quoted 'highly informed sources' earlier this month as
saying the 16-member cabinet would be shuffled after the present holy month
of Ramadan to enable some much needed 'quick decision-making'.
All of this is bound to be persuading Kuwait's equally financially pressed
neighbours that the last thing they need on top of cash flow problems is an
elected parliament.

end of the year.
The move was announced at the weekend by Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the finance
minister.
It is the latest step in a reform programme designed to attract foreign
investment, restore confidence among aid donors and revive growth. Earlier
in the week, in an interview in Nairobi with the Financial Times, the
minister said that the government hoped to remove all foreign exchange
controls by the end of the year.
But Mr Mudavadi warned that economic growth would be hard hit by the
country's drought. President Daniel arap Moi has appealed for international
help for a Dollars 60m (Pounds 41m) programme to feed about a fifth of
Kenya's 26m people.
In his statement lifting the local borrowing restrictions, the minister
said: 'Commercial banks will be expected to exercise their prudential credit
policy in assessing the viability of each borrower.'
The statement also allowed unlimited borrowing by Kenyans resident abroad to
finance investment in Kenya. This would include working capital provided
interest charged did not exceed two percentage points above Libor (London
inter-bank offered rate).
Kenyans with foreign exchange earnings, including non-export earnings, may
now open foreign currency accounts with banks in Kenya and exporters may
hold wholly-foreign retention accounts.
Previously, exporters were allowed to hold 50 per cent of their earnings in
hard currency. Mr Mudavadi said existing retention accounts would be
converted to resident foreign currency accounts but exporters were still
required to surrender proceeds within 90 days of receiving them.
The International Monetary Fund has told Sudan it has launched the process
to terminate its IMF membership, Reuter reports from Khartoum.
The government-owned al-Ingaz al-Watani newspaper yesterday reported that
Sudan had, however, been given the chance to answer before a final decision
was taken.
The finance minister, Mr Abdalla Hassan Ahmad, said the fund's technical
experts would meet soon to consider Sudan's response. Sudan would be the
first country to be thrown out of the fund since it was created shortly
after the second world war.

SOUTH KOREA
South Koreans have expressed concern about US press coverage of the North
Korean nuclear issue, which at times has been alarmist - such as a detailed
scenario for a Second Korean War published in the New York Times early this
month. Mr Han Soon-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, privately
protested about the sensational reporting to US officials when he visited
Washington last week.
In an interpretation that reflects traditional anti-US sentiments, some
Korean media have suggested that the US press reports are part of a campaign
by 'American hardliners' to raise tensions on the Korean peninsula. Their
goal is to persuade Seoul to buy more US weapons, such as the Patriot
missiles that Washington recently announced would be sent to South Korea.
'If a war occurs on the peninsula, the Koreans' survival would be at stake.
But a war here would have little effect on the destiny of America across the
ocean and would rather serve to boost the sagging business of the US defence
industry,' said the national Yonhap news agency.
That view was also reflected in a cartoon in Hankuk Ilbo following North
Korea's announcement last week that it would accept renewed international
nuclear inspections. It shows customs official waving down a truck bearing
Patriot missiles from the US. 'Please stop. North Korea has accepted nuclear
inspections,' says the guard. 'Gee, now where am I going to sell them?'
replies the driver.
'No one can deny that there has been a disparity between Korea and the US in
the perception of the North Korean nuclear issue,' said Dong-Ah Ilbo. 'The
US has been dealing with the problem from a standpoint of global strategy
aimed at ensuring the stability of the nuclear non-proliferation system.
Korea has been handling the issue as a special condition within the
framework of relations between the two Koreas.'
Chosun Ilbo pointed out that differences between Seoul and Washington also
rest on the South Korean perception that it has been sidelined during the
negotiations on the nuclear issue, which have focused on contacts between
North Korea and the US.
POLAND AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC
In stark contrast to the hue and cry of the press in Austria, Hungary and
Bulgaria about Bosnia, Poland and the Czech Republic have been almost silent
this week over Nato's ultimatum on air strikes. As the Nato deadline neared,
only the Gazeta Wyborcza, a Polish daily read by around 5m Poles, devoted a
commentary to the subject. The columnist noted that the threat to use force
meant that the 'western world was beginning to rebuild its political,
military and moral credibility'. The paper added that Russia was fighting to
retain credibility as a regional power in the Balkans. 'After being
completely eliminated from the Middle East and after eliminating itself, for
lack of money, from the third world, Moscow is now concentrating on
organising a sphere of influence in its closest neighbourhood,' it said.
This, according to the writer, would include Serbia.
Gazeta Wyborcza adds that the Nato threat, if followed through, would be the
alliance's first military action since its formation in 1949. It would also
mean that Nato would be extending its sphere of influence to Bosnia, a
welcome precedent for Poland, which wants to be covered by Nato's umbrella.
While most Czech newspapers approved with reservations Nato's ultimatum,
domestic interest has focused on the contrasting views of President Vaclav
Havel, who strongly supported Nato's decision, and Prime Minister Vaclav
Klaus, who was cool towards Nato involvement. Mr Klaus expressed fears about
foreign intervention, warned of rising violence and said he was 'fully
convinced' that Nato would not make air strikes against Serb positions.
As with most things, Czech concerns tend to be predominantly parochial,
explaining the considerable coverage given to the dispute.
In an article headlined The Protracted Malaise of Foreign Policy the
independent daily Mlada Fronta Denes argued 'the Czech state cannot afford
differences of opinion between its president and premier on the possible
bombardment of a not-so-remote European country'.
The left-wing Rude Pravo warned that subsequent attempts to present the
difference as merely one of emphasis could only put into question the
reliability of official pronouncements on important issues. And the
right-wing Telegraf said Mr Klaus's approach had done the Czech Republic no
good. 'Keeping a certain distance from the conflict does not improve, to say
the least, the Czech Republic's reputation abroad,' the paper said.
SWEDEN
The ski-boot is on the other foot, and it hurts. While Norway revels noisily
in the glory of staging the winter Olympics in Lillehammer - and the
repeated triumphs of Norwegian athletes - neighbouring Sweden is feeling
more than a little put out. As the elder of the Nordic countries (Stockholm
ruled Norway until 1905), Sweden is unused to seeing its smaller cousins
dominate the international limelight. It bowed gracefully last autumn when
Norway brought Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation together for
their historic peace agreement, but magnanimity has been wearing thin over
the past week as Norway has stacked up gold medal after gold medal while
Sweden has so far won none.
A pained reporter for Dagens Nyheter, the biggest selling morning newspaper,
bewailed that the relegation of Sweden's Pernilla 'Pillan' Wiberg to fourth
place in the Super-G slalom had deprived him of the chance to write about
'the girl who was to lift us out of the Norwegian vale of tears that
Lillehammer signifies for us Swedes'. Expressen, a tabloid, put it more
bluntly: 'Swedes only cheer when a Norwegian falls down,' it said,
introducing an article by an ethnologist analysing why Sweden was doing so
badly.
Under a front-page picture in Friday's Dagens Nyheter of a failed Swedish
cross-country skier wistfully watching Norwegian Bjorn Daehlie collect his
gold medal, reporter Ake Ekdahl, his tongue only slightly in his cheek,
pointed the finger of blame at Prime Minister Carl Bildt. 'Bildt knew last
autumn,' said the headline as Ekdahl revealed that the government was warned
months ago of the coming humiliation of the 'blue and gold flag' but did
nothing about it. The message was that Sweden should spend more on training
its sportsmen and women.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An agreement ending Yemen's seven-month political crisis was signed in
Jordan yesterday with the aim of averting civil war and the collapse of
Yemen's fragile unification between north and south.
The agreement was signed by Yemen's two main leaders, President Ali Abdullah
Saleh and Vice President Ali Salem al-Biedh, but Jordan's King Hussein had
to literally force the two rivals to shake hands.
The crisis began in August 1993 when Mr Biedh left the capital, Sana'a, in
the north for his political base, Aden, in the former South Yemen.
Frustrated by what he saw as a centralisation of power in the north, a lack
of security in the country and mismanagement of the economy, he threatened
to reverse the 1990 union between the two former Yemens unless the
government adopted a programme of national reform.
The document signed in Amman goes some way to meeting Mr Biedh's demands but
diplomats in Sana'a were not confident it would hold.
King Hussein's mediation in the dispute is being portrayed in Amman as a
boost to Jordan's standing in the Arab world after the marginalisation which
followed the Gulf war in 1990. The ceremony was witnessed by dignitaries
including Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, in
the largest political gathering in Amman since the 1987 Arab League summit.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Nigeria to face debt arrears pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British government officials are expected to express concern about Nigeria's
growing external debt arrears, in talks in London today with Mr Kalu Kalu,
the country's finance minister.
Arrears on Nigeria's Dollars 28bn (Pounds 19bn) external debt exceed Dollars
6bn and are expected to reach Dollars 8.5bn by the end of this year. The
military government's decision to revalue the naira in last January's budget
and reintroduce an import licensing system has deepened the rift with the
International Monetary Fund. Most creditors now rule out an early policy
agreement with the Fund, on which debt rescheduling would be conditional.
Mr Kalu, who arrived in London at the weekend, is on a 10-day visit to
London, Washington and Paris in an attempt to restore confidence in General
Sani Abacha's regime.
Gen Abacha dropped plans for a handover to an elected civilian government,
prompting western governments to introduce limited sanctions, including visa
restrictions.
During his meetings Mr Kalu will try to convince officials that Nigeria will
keep its promise to remove the budget deficit, and that government controls
on the economy will be relaxed by the middle of this year.
He is also likely to point out that the decline in oil prices has wiped at
least 30 per cent off Nigeria's export earnings in the past 12 months.
Western creditors were dismayed when the 1994 budget pegged interest rates
well below inflation, centralised the allocation of foreign exchange and
fixed the exchange rate at twice its market value.
Over half Nigeria's external debt and nearly all the arrears are owed to the
Paris Club, which has linked debt relief to economic policies approved by
the the IMF.
Economists have raised doubts about the forecast balanced budget which makes
no provision for servicing domestic debt, which officials estimate at N370bn
(Pounds 11.5bn).
Mr Kalu, who as finance minister in 1986 argued strongly for economic
reforms based on a market-determined exchange rate, has put his reputation
at stake since his appointment to the ministry by General Abacha.
Most observers saw the budget as incompatible with the private views of Mr
Kalu, who has worked for the World Bank. Many fear that control of policy
making is in the hands of a clique of populist politicians who oppose Mr
Kalu's prescription for economic deregulation.

The murder of 15 African National Congress election campaigners at the
weekend cast a shadow over preparations for South Africa's first all-race
poll, while constitutional negotiations aimed at averting a right-wing
election boycott appeared to have foundered.
An important session of multi-party constitutional talks will go ahead today
to pass final amendments to the 1993 constitution in an effort to
accommodate the right wing by strengthening the powers of regional
governments and creating the possibility of an Afrikaner homeland after the
elections.
The African National Congress is to hold last-minute meetings with two of
the three members of the right-wing Freedom Alliance - the government of the
black homeland of Bophuthatswana and the Afrikaner Volksfront - before
today's session, but negotiators were not optimistic.
They said it appeared that the Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi would not accept the amendments, and prospects for persuading the
other two groups to contest elections were also slim, though some moderate
members of each group might split from their hardline leaders. This would
weaken the right politically, but might not substantially affect right-wing
opposition to elections.
The risks of failure were highlighted when two 12-year-olds, 10 teenagers
and three young adults were shot and stabbed to death on Saturday before an
ANC voter-education drive in the rural Natal village of Creighton. Local ANC
chairman Harry Gwala blamed supporters of Chief Buthelezi, who is
campaigning for a boycott of the election.
In a fighting speech yesterday to some 20,000 supporters the chief told his
supporters they might have to die for their beliefs. He vowed never to
submit to ANC dominance, saying an ANC government would oppress his people
more cruelly than the white apartheid government had done. 'It is far more
noble to resist evil and die if necessary for what you believe in than to
live in chains,' he said.
Chief Buthelezi is not alone in his opposition. Mr Lucas Mangope, leader of
the Bophuthatswana homeland, warned in an address on Saturday that he would
accept nothing less than self-determination for his Batswana tribe.
'If this means an intensification of the long-running campaign to. . .
topple my government then we will fight fire with fire,' he said.
Mr Mangope and Chief Buthelezi have joined forces in the Freedom Alliance
with white conservatives including former army chief Constand Viljoen's
Afrikaner Volksfront. The Afrikaans newspaper Rapport said yesterday it had
documents detailing AVF plans for a civil war if the election goes ahead,
although the AVF said these were not genuine.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spanish government and regional authorities face crucial talks this week on
the future of a Japanese-controlled car plant in the southern town of
Linares, where roughly half the population took to the streets in a protest
at the weekend.
The threatened closure of Santana Motor, a subsidiary of Suzuki making
four-wheel-drive vehicles, could become a big political issue four months
before regional elections in Andalucia, a stronghold of the country's ruling
Socialists and home territory of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister.
The demonstration on Saturday, involving an estimated 25,000 to 30,000
townspeople, was provoked by Santana's announcement that it was seeking
protection from creditors after heavy losses.
The Santana plant employs 2,400 and is the only large factory in the area
since the disappearance of the town's mining. About 60 per cent of the
Linares people are reckoned to depend on it.
Mr Juan Manuel Eguigaray, industry minister, is to meet management today.
Suzuki, which owns about 80 per cent of the company, said it was willing to
plough in Pts5.27bn (Pounds 25.4m) to cover losses from the start of last
year, but no more. The Madrid stock exchange commission suspended trading in
Santana shares on Friday.
Unions blamed the Socialist regional authorities, the Madrid government and
Suzuki. They accused the company of 'blackmail' and of using the workforce
as hostages to obtain subsidies.

<TEXT>
Support for Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has fallen below
50 per cent for the first time since he took office last March, according to
a poll published yesterday, reports John Ridding in Paris.
The IFOP poll, in the weekly Journal du Dimanche, showed the percentage of
voters satisfied with Mr Balladur had fallen by nine points to 47 per cent
over the past month. The proportion of dissatisfied voters increased by 10
points to 43 per cent.
This followed other polls of the past few weeks which have shown a decline
from an unusually high approval of more than 60 per cent. They appear to
reflect concerns about the government's failure to curb the rise in
unemployment, as well as issues such as the fishermen's strike this month.
Political analysts pointed out that support for Mr Balladur remains high,
compared with previous French prime ministers and his international
counterparts.
The decline in his popularity has, however, given heart to political
opponents. Mr Michel Rocard, Socialist party leader, who trails Mr Balladur
in the polls, said the political left would be in a position to challenge
the prime minister in presidential elections due in May next year. Mr
Balladur has also faced criticism within the coalition government over the
economy.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Dutch propose first tax on mobile phones

<TEXT>
The Netherlands is set to become the first country in the world to levy a
special tax on mobile telephones.
The Dutch government is proposing to impose a 7.5 per cent tax on the
profits of companies operating new digital cellular networks, when licences
are issued this year.
The tax has been approved by the Dutch cabinet over objections from the
business community, but it has still to be endorsed by parliament. If it
passes, the two operators of networks built to the pan-European digital GSM
standard will be obliged to pay the tax.
The GSM tax may be taken as a precedent for similar levies elsewhere. The
practice of auctioning cellular mobile licences is well established but, as
mobile telephony moves into the mass consumer market, the medium-term
revenue potential of a special tax is considerable.
The Dutch government argues that the tax will be fair because it plans to
allow only two GSM operators. These are KPN, the state post and
telecommunications company which is slated for privatisation in June, and a
second, private-sector operator which will be chosen in the second half of
1994. The government considered, but rejected, a proposal to charge each
operator an up-front fee of about Fl 500m (Pounds 172m).
Greece, with GDP barely a quarter that of the Netherlands, two years ago
raised the equivalent of Pounds 110m each for two GSM licences. The US
expects to raise more than Dollars 10bn next year in an auction of licences
for Personal Communications Services, a new cellular technology.
The Dutch levy would be on pre-tax profits. Payments would be
tax-deductible, taking the effective rate down to about 5 per cent. There
would be no immediate revenue because it would take operators a few years to
achieve profitability.
The proposed tax, devised by the Dutch Finance Ministry, has been attacked
by KPN and business groups as a 'penalty on innovation' when the Netherlands
is already behind other western European countries in the introduction of
GSM networks. It has also been criticised by the Labour party, the junior
partner in the governing coalition, and by the right-wing Liberals.
However, the prospect of the tax does not appear to have deterred potential
bidders. KPN expects to launch its network in July and competition for the
second licence will be fierce. The three main Dutch banks - ABN Amro, ING
and Rabobank - are expected to put in bids with local and international
telecoms partners.
The second operator is unlikely to get its own GSM network off the ground
before 1995, but KPN will be required to open its network to its competitor
while this second network is being built.

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's engineering industry will face its worst labour conflict in more
than 10 years if employers persist with their demands for a pay freeze and
an end to holiday bonuses, Mr Klaus Zwickel, president of the IG Metall
union, warned at the weekend.
The union had enough reserves to fund stoppages for several weeks, despite
the cost of DM41m (Pounds 16.1m) a week for every 100,000 people called out,
he said.
Bracing members for selective strikes, expected to start in the second week
of March, Mr Zwickel said talks could resume only if employers tabled a firm
new offer.
However, industry officials showed no signs of obliging. Mr Dieter Kirchner,
chief executive of the Gesamtmetall employers' association, said he no
longer believed a peaceful settlement was possible. IG Metall had removed
the prospect by demanding the employers should surrender their position as a
precondition for further talks, he added.
The union's national leadership is due to meet in Frankfurt today to select
the region in which to call the first strike ballot. The old industrial
heartland of North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria, Hesse and the northern part of
Baden-Wurttemberg, are among the most likely targets.
The choice will depend on the union's chances of causing maximum national
disruption by cutting off supplies of parts and equipment for factories
elsewhere, and regional leaders' reports on the likelihood of winning
maximum backing in a ballot. Strike action requires a 75 per cent Yes vote.
Despite the apparent inevitability of stoppages, observers suggest the
conflict will be short-lived, although bitter. Employers have warned they
will resort to lock-outs at non-striking factories affected by stoppages
elsewhere.
If no negotiated solution is found in the period between the ballot and the
start of strikes, industry observers expect the two sides to agree to
binding arbitration sooner rather than later.
Both sides have already shown considerable flexibility. The union has
backtracked on original claims for wage rises of up to 6 per cent, while
employers have relaxed their insistence on the scrapping of holiday bonuses,
worth some 75 per cent of a month's pay.
The main difficulty has arisen over the issue of how workers should be paid
for working flexible hours - between 30 and 40 hours a week according to
individual factories' needs.
Although both sides have already accepted this in principle as the most
suitable means of slowing the rate of job cuts, Gesamtmetall claims the
union's demands will raise hourly pay rates and unit labour costs.
The employers justified their original proposals, based on a nil pay
increase, with claims that German wages were making the whole industry
uncompetitive.
Labour costs in the automotive industry, for example, are now almost double
those in the UK.
Although the figures are not strictly comparable, since social contributions
account for 43 per cent of German wage bills compared with 27 per cent in
Britain, such disparities are blamed for the wave of engineering job cuts,
running at around 30,000 a month.
The most damaging engineering strike in recent history was in 1984, when IG
Metall led stoppages for several weeks in pursuit of reduced working time.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl today faces one of the greatest challenges of his
long career in German politics: to persuade his own Christian Democratic
Union to shake off a mood of deep pessimism and believe that it can win the
general election in October.
The odds are against him when some 1,000 delegates assemble in Hamburg for
the three-day party conference to launch an eight-month marathon election
campaign. The CDU is trailing behind the rival Social Democratic party (SPD)
in the opinion polls, and Mr Kohl's own popularity stands even lower.
The latest poll by the Allensbach institute put the CDU and the Christian
Social Union (CSU), its Bavarian sister party, on a combined 35.1 per cent
in both halves of the country, against 40.9 per cent for the SPD. As for the
chancellor's personal rating, it stood at 26 per cent last week, against 35
per cent for Mr Rudolf Scharping, the youthful challenger leading the SPD.
A large majority of electors now expects a change of government in October,
and even in the ruling parties there is no majority in favour of maintaining
the current coalition between CDU, CSU and the liberal Free Democratic party
(FDP).
Reports from local party organisers around the country suggest gloom about
Mr Kohl's prospects, not only for re-election as chancellor in eight months,
but also for the CDU to stage a comeback in a string of local and state
polls over the intervening months.
Yet Mr Kohl is clearly intending to rely on his own irrepressible
self-confidence, and an attitude of extraordinary calm and composure, to
shrug off all fears of defeat.
In two interviews last week, he showed a refusal to pay attention to the
polls, or to national pessimism about the economic recession and rising
unemployment.
The Allensbach opinion poll also showed one other key trend in Mr Kohl's
favour: voters are starting to drift back to the main parties - both SPD and
CDU - from the protest parties. The extreme right-wing Republicans showed a
drop in support of almost half, from 4.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent, and the
Greens showed a fall from 10.2 per cent to 9 per cent. The SPD was up four
percentage points on the previous poll in December, and the CDU by two
points.
In spite of a large grumbling minority within the CDU about Mr Kohl's lack
of direction in his leadership, and his own unpopularity, no one expects any
serious attempt at a coup against him at the party conference.
The official aim is to endorse a new basic political programme for the
party, its first new draft since 1978, and in particular, the first for a
unified Germany.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Disputes on details may hinder EU enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Concern is growing that negotiations to bring Austria, Sweden, Finland and
Norway into the European Union by next January could sink into a quagmire of
detail, during the final stretch of ministerial talks starting today in
Brussels.
The two-day talks between foreign ministers of the 12 and the four
applicants will be followed by marathon negotiations over February 25-28,
and probably a third attempt in early March.
Unless a deal is finalised by the second week of March, the European
Parliament will be unable to examine the accession treaty and the referenda
all four candidates have promised their voters could be blown off course.
In spite of some softening by both sides on central issues such as
agriculture and regional subsidies, tough bargaining on secondary issues and
on money is spreading pessimism among negotiators.
Mr Esko Aho, the Finnish prime minister, said on Friday that EU prime
ministers' support for enlargement had not percolated down to the
negotiating table.
One EU negotiator said at the weekend it was becoming 'more and more
difficult to get a deal within the Union,' especially on how much money the
relatively rich candidates should put into the EU budget, on fishing rights,
and on subsidies to Nordic and Alpine farmers and the thinly populated
Arctic regions of Sweden, Norway and Finland.
Spain is leading attempts to get the new members' net financial
contributions to the EU funnelled into regional aid for southern member
states. But the European Commission's plan to set the four's net EU charges
at a modest Ecu1.7bn (Pounds 1.3bn) is building resistance to a solution on
agriculture and regional aid that the four applicants could sell to their
voters.
Attitudes are hardening inside the 12, moreover, because Sweden says it can
pay only 40 per cent of its estimated annual Ecu765m net contribution in the
first three years of membership, while Austria too wants to phase in its net
Ecu752m payments.
Spain, with support from the UK, wants guarantees that EU expansion will not
dilute the existing rules enabling alliances within the 12 to block measures
affecting their national interests.
Nevertheless, negotiators expect early progress on issues such as
restrictions on buying holiday homes in the candidate countries, on scaling
down Nordic alcohol monopolies, and on Nordic duty-free regimes.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Defiant Serbs drink toast to Russia: Soldiers were confident
Nato deadline would pass without air strikes

Bosnian Serb forces, coolly defiant to the last, laid plans for campfire
barbecues and night skiing on the hills around Sarajevo yesterday, confident
Nato's deadline would pass without air strikes on their remaining guns, AP
reports from Pale.
'We want to make it easier for Nato planes to spot us,' joked a Serb officer
as he outlined plans for roasting oxen and lambs over fires on Mount
Trebevic, overlooking Sarajevo.
Hundreds of Serbs chanting 'Greater Serbia' and 'Long Live Russia' gave a
heroes' welcome to their Orthodox Slav brothers - Russian peacekeepers en
route to Sarajevo - as they arrived in this Bosnian Serb stronghold, about
10 miles to the south-east.
Home-made brandy, bread and salt were passed in traditional welcome as
soldiers and Serbs alike exulted. 'We feel safe now, because they're our
brothers,' said a 15-year-old Serb girl, weeping with joy. 'Everybody here
feels the same.'
It was a Russian pledge last Thursday to bring the 400 peacekeepers to
Sarajevo that enabled Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to
promise to withdraw the heavy guns that have besieged and bombarded the
Bosnian capital for almost two years.
Mr Karadzic himself was among the crowd shaking hands with the Russian
soldiers, who held out three fingers in the traditional Serb victory sign.
Children clambered over the trucks and armoured personnel carriers in the
67-vehicle Russian convoy, saluting the soldiers.
The Bosnian Serb Olympics, being held in memory of the Sarajevo Olympics 10
years ago, scheduled night skiing on the slopes of Mount Jahorina just five
hours before Nato's ultimatum expired at midnight GMT.
In Grbavica, a Serb-held section of southern Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb forces
showed no fear of Nato bombs.
'We are not afraid. we can fight back their infantry attacks with our
7.62-calibre automatic rifles, which are not supposed to be under UN
control,' said Second Lt Danko Przulj, speaking in a bunker built in what
used to be a heating plant.
His bunker is only 70 yards from Bosnian government troop positions across
the Miljacka river that flows through Sarajevo. From two loopholes, the
buildings housing Sarajevo defenders could be clearly seen.
'The latest ceasefire has been respected by both sides,' said Lt Przulj. 'It
was never as quiet as it has been in the past 10 days.'
Grbavica streets saw heavy fighting between former neighbours in May 1992,
early into Sarajevo's 22-month siege. Damaged buildings stand in mute
testimony to destroyed friendship and joint life in multi-ethnic Sarajevo.
Black plastic covers about 50 feet high hang like curtains between
buildings, shielding residents from the government snipers who residents
claimed have killed many Grbavica civilians.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Roar of jets amplifies Nato threat

   AVIANO AIR BASE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In a huge hangar at Aviano, a northern Italian frontline air base for Nato
operations over Bosnia, the defence ministers of France, Italy, the
Netherlands, the UK and the US yesterday approved final plans for attack
missions over Sarajevo. The ministers met just hours before the UN and Nato
commanders decided early today that air strikes were not necessary 'at this
stage'.
Throughout the day, the ministers spoke of 'comforting signs' of Serb
compliance with the UN ultimatum. But they also made it clear their
determination to use force if necessary.
On the timing of any attack mission, the ministers have been cautious.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said verification on the ground
was essential and it would not be possible to know if the Serbs had properly
complied with the withdrawal requirements precisely at midnight.
This suggested that commanders on the ground were being given discretion to
check the positions of weapons and that any military action would be delayed
for some hours - if not considerably longer.
The threat to use force was emphasised by the thunderous roar of US F-16 and
F-18 jets as they took off for reconnaissance missions over the war zone
before and during the ministers' press conference yesterday afternoon.
Mr Walter Perry, in his first important overseas mission since becoming US
defence secretary, said he was fully satisfied by Nato's combat-readiness.
He also said the rules of engagement had been agreed among the US allies.
The US is supplying just over half the 226 combat and support aircraft
involved in the Bosnian operations.
However, he admitted that bad weather over Sarajevo was 'a significant
handicap'. For the past month operations have been limited and some of the
pilots here have said in private that with poor visibility, precision
operations are difficult despite the technology available.
Mr Perry himself said that even if weather was a limiting factor this would
not stop Nato action. In a communique after their meeting, held with Nato
commanders and a representative of UN forces in former Yugoslavia, the
ministers stated their determination 'to support actions to end the
slaughter of innocent civilians in Sarajevo and reinvigorate the peace
negotiations'.
The ministers refused to be drawn on whether the Serbs had abused the spirit
of their agreement to withdraw by concentrating their heavy weapons in
strategic sites or in areas which were heavily populated - thus complicating
any combat mission by Nato. However, they said UN forces on the spot would
be able to take control of those Serb weapons which were not in the
designated places, and they would also have the authority to disable them.
The operations are being co-ordinated by Admiral Michael Boorda, the
commander of Nato's southern flank, from his headquarters outside Naples.
The Italians as neighbours of former Yugoslavia have been excluded from any
combat role, but yesterday Mr Fabbio Fabri, defence minister, said Italy
would put all its resources at the disposal of Nato forces. He also played
down the threat of an attack or terrorist operations by Serb extremists
against Italy.
The peculiar nature of the war on western Europe's doorstep was highlighted
in Aviano by the big Sunday crowds which gathered to see the activity at the
air base. Many families with children watched as US jets, fully loaded with
bombs and missiles, took off and landed. These aircraft with the same
ordnance could be in action within hours and were less than 30 minutes'
flying time away from Sarajevo.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Moscow 'cannot follow' the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Britain's leading political scientists has sharply attacked
expectations that the former Soviet Union could become a fully fledged
market economy, arguing that it does not have the legal and cultural
infrastructure which allowed such a development in the west.
In a pamphlet published today, Dr John Gray of Oxford University claims that
western governments are mistaken to think that Russia will converge smoothly
on a western model of economic development.
In particular, he attacks recent attempts by economists such as Dr Jeffrey
Sachs to transform the Soviet economy by means of 'shock therapy'.
These countries, he says, 'lack almost entirely the legal and institutional
infrastructure of the market on which economic take-off was based'. But he
also argues that these legal and institutional structures cannot be created
quickly by policymakers.
He argues that such institutions are 'human practices that always come
deeply embedded in matrices of cultural tradition'. They 'are like natural
languages in that it is their very nature to be plural and diverse.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / Peace hopes rise in Karabakh conflict: Moscow brings
together Armenia and Azerbaijan

<TEXT>
A breakthrough in the five-year-old conflict over Nagorno Karabakh, the
Armenian-dominated enclave in Azerbaijan, may be in sight. This follows a
Russian-arranged ceasefire agreed at the weekend and a proposal for a
meeting of leaders of the two warring neighbours early next month.
The Azeri leadership said in the capital, Baku, yesterday that defence
ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia had agreed in Moscow with General Pavel
Grachev, Russian defence minister, on an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal
of the forces of both sides to predetermined positions.
A complete withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azerbaijan would depend on
further negotiations.
The agreement came after further fierce fighting between Armenian and Azeri
forces in the region of Kelbadjar on the borders of Nagorno Karabakh.
Armenian forces now occupy 25 per cent of Azeri territory on both sides of
the Karabakh enclave and more than 1m Azeris have been made refugees, most
of them living in tents around Baku.
In an interview yesterday Azeri President Haydar Aliev was cautious, saying
that 'there have been many ceasefires - the important question is the total
withdrawal of the Armenians from our territory and then we can talk about
Nagorno Karabakh.'
Mr Aliev, the former Communist party leader of Azerbaijan who returned to
power last year in a bloodless coup, said that Nagorno Karabakh, which has
declared its independence, must be recognised as part of Azerbaijan.
'After that, discussions on its status are open,' he said. 'We can agree to
many kinds of status and as president I guarantee all rights to the
Armenians living there.'
Mr Vafa Gulizade, the presidential adviser on foreign affairs, said that
'the most important thing about this agreement is that it is guaranteed by
the Russians. The Russians can force the Armenians to withdraw if they want,
because Armenia is entirely dependent on Russia for its survival.'
The two neighbouring countries, whose hostilities have escalated since the
Armenian parliament declared Nagorno Karabakh part of Armenia four years
ago, are now both members of the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent
States.
Both, especially Armenia, remain closely tied to the Russian economy.
However, Azerbaijan possesses very large oil reserves in the Caspian Sea. A
contract with a western consortium of oil companies, led by British
Petroleum, but with the probable participation of the Russian state oil
company Lukoil, is expected to be signed shortly.
Mr Aliev is due to arrive in London tomorrow for talks with Mr John Major,
the prime minister.
He said the talks aimed at 'bringing about a better understanding in the
west of Azerbaijan's position, especially on Nagorno Karabakh.'

Weary of war and broken promises, Sarajevans shrugged in resignation
yesterday as word spread that not all Serb siege guns would be surrendered
by midnight in accordance with the Nato ultimatum, Reuter reports from
Sarajevo.
'I haven't had high hopes since day one of the ultimatum,' said Alen
Becirbegovic, 22, a soldier in the Moslem-led Bosnian army. 'The Nato threat
wasn't strong enough. The Serbs outwitted Nato and the United Nations.'
'What's left of these weapons should be bombed,' said 27-year-old Anis
Mehic, a student. 'Ultimatums should be carried out in full measure.
Otherwise we are just spinning in small circles.'
The weather lifted in Sarajevo yesterday after several days of snow and the
streets were crowded with people pulling sledges loaded with jerry cans of
water, relief parcels and firewood scrounged from the city's supply of
shell-blasted buildings.
As residents trudged down snowy lanes, Nato jets roared overhead taking
advantage of clearing skies for last-minute reconnaissance flights.

Mr Arkady Volsky, chief of a Russian industrialists' and entrepreneurs'
union, called at the weekend for western capital to support what he called
the new government's attempts to restore 'basic organisation' to the economy
in order to continue reforms.
Mr Volsky, a close associate of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister,
who has called for 'non-monetary' means to fight inflation and more state
intervention in the economy, denied Russia lacked the right political and
economic conditions to receive large-scale financial assistance.
He also called for 'international compensation' to Russia for 'billions of
dollars' it had lost because of its adherence to sanctions against the
former Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya.
Mr Chernomyrdin has continued to issue conflicting signals about the
intentions of his new economic team of former industrial managers. 'They are
scared of being blamed for fuelling inflation. They do not know what to do.
They have made promises but no decisions,' said one reformer still in the
government.
On Friday, Mr Chernomyrdin signed a document bringing closer a controversial
monetary union with neighbouring Belarus. Although the terms of the proposed
union have yet to be made public, this project will inevitably mean
increased pressure on Russia's finances.
In an attempt to lessen the burden of neighbouring republics, Russia last
year cut energy supplies to the Commonwealth of Independent States by 40 per
cent for oil and 25 per cent for gas, according to official figures
published yesterday.
Mr Chernomyrdin also reassured Ukraine that Russia had no desire to take
back the Crimean peninsula after Crimea's new president, who has promised a
referendum on reunification with Russia, asked a former Russian deputy
premier to head his government.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Romania acts against pyramid craze: Branch closure hinders
efforts to keep money pouring in to controversial scheme
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Romanian authorities have taken public measures against Caritas, the
money-spinning pyramid scheme, for the first time in its 22-month existence.
The scheme's branch at Snagov, outside Bucharest, was open for just eight
days before local authorities found a reason to close it last week. Caritas,
which at its peak last year attracted some Dollars 1bn (Pounds 685m) in
deposits from a total of 4m Romanians, did not have a legal lease on its
premises, they said.
The move foils a bid by Mr Ion Stoica, the head of Caritas, to keep money
coming into the scheme by opening new branches around the country.
Mr Stoica was forced to move further afield after investor confidence in the
Transylvanian town of Cluj, where he founded his 'society for mutual help',
evaporated when the scheme stopped making regular payments in the autumn.
Since then only a handful of the hundreds of thousands who were promised a
seven-fold return on their money in three months have received their
'winnings'.
Many have been left penniless after investing their life's savings in the
scheme in the hope of protecting themselves against annual inflation of 300
per cent and rising poverty.
Mr Stoica, on the other hand, is believed to have collected Dollars 100m in
commissions alone.
Press reports of poverty-stricken investors and warnings from President Ion
Iliescu have not been enough to kill off the Caritas craze.
Thousands of naive and desperate Romanians have continued to put cash into
new branches or in the many other similar schemes which have sprung up in
its wake.
At Snagov, some 5,600 investors sank the equivalent of Dollars 840,000 into
the Caritas branch within just four days of its opening, according to
company ledgers examined by financial police.
Many said depositing early would increase their chance of winning. 'I was
one of the first in Cluj and I won 500,000 lei (Pounds 231),' one factory
worker said. 'That's why I'm here again at the beginning.'
Others had lost money in Cluj but, spurred on by Mr Stoica's promise to
relaunch the scheme in Bucharest, now hoped to become winners.
Mr Stoica's promise was relayed to the country in a half-hour interview on
state-controlled television aired at prime time which would have cost
Dollars 20,000 if run as a commercial. Free advertising time is just one of
the many favours Mr Stoica has enjoyed on the way to amassing his fortune.
In Cluj, Caritas enjoyed the patronage of the mayor, Mr Gheorghe Funar, who
is also president of the Romanian parliament's largest nationalist party.
Caritas, which was given offices in the town's sports stadium, boomed after
Mr Funar endorsed it alongside Mr Stoica on television and at rallies.
'Donations' from the scheme paid for the mayor's grandiose public works
schemes.
Mr Funar's party is now negotiating with the ruling party to form a new
governing coalition. In recent weeks, local authorities in other towns have
closed down smaller rival pyramid schemes and arrested organisers on grounds
of fraud and embezzlement.
But Mr Stoica, who says he has a list of MPs and other senior officials who
have profited from Caritas, remains free.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Kozyrev warns east Europe about Nato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's deputy prime minister and Moscow's special
envoy to the former Yugoslavia, brokers agreements in Sarajevo, Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, travels around eastern Europe.
Fresh from long talks with Greek officials, who continue to prevent oil
deliveries reaching neighbouring Macedonia, Mr Kozyrev yesterday met Mr
Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, travels to Budapest today, and
arrives in Warsaw tomorrow.
The agenda is clear. The Russians want to explain Moscow's role in
Bosnia-Hercegovina. But they also want to tell Prague, Budapest and Warsaw
that Nato's Partnership for Peace could be jeopardised if Nato launches air
strikes on Sarajevo.
The Partnership for Peace envisages closer military co-operation, but no
eventual membership or any kind of security guarantee for the countries of
eastern Europe Against this background of growing Russian involvement in the
Bosnian crisis, military strategists believe that if the US does not play a
role in reaching a negotiated political settlement, a new balance of power
will emerge in Europe with Russia playing a more dominant role at the
expense of the east Europeans.
Czech President Vaclav Havel has repeatedly said the Bosnian war has exposed
Europe's inability to deal with the post-cold war era: the western response
may encourage future nationalists and populists in eastern Europe capable of
exploiting divisions among European capitals.
'Kozyrev will be told what the Czechs think,' a senior military strategist
said. 'Mr Klaus, who has no illusions about the European Union, will tell
Moscow that Prague will deal with Russia, but on its own terms.'
In Budapest, diplomats are very disappointed with Nato's stance on Bosnia.
'We allowed them to fly Awacs over our territory. Then they simply gave the
impression they expected us to allow them to fly Awacs over Hungary for the
air strikes without any kind of proper consultation. We refused,' a
Hungarian diplomat said. 'Yet when we ask for a decent Partnership for
Peace, the door is only half opened.'
Moscow may be grateful for Hungary's refusal. But Budapest had its own
motives: the fate of the 450,000-strong ethnic Hungarian minority in Serbia.
'We would be pleased if Kozyrev could exert pressure on Serbia to recognise
the rights of the minority and ensure their safety,' the diplomat said. 'But
it should be the west which should shore up our democratic structures, while
Russia would probably want something in return if it helped us.' That might
involve Hungary's easing sanctions on Serbia, which Budapest would be loath
to concede.
Mr Kozyrev's trip to Warsaw will be even more delicate. The Poles have not
forgotten how President Boris Yeltsin last year said he opposed Poland
asking for Nato membership. 'Sometimes you think that Moscow does not
realise that we are an independent sovereign country,' a Polish Foreign
Ministry official said then.
Yet the Russian leadership, with Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, head of the
far-right Russian Liberal Democratic party, in the background, realise that
the longer the west fails to live up to its promises and commitments for the
countries of eastern Europe, the greater the chance for feeding anti-western
sentiments within eastern Europe itself.
'We are extremely fortunate eastern Europe is stable, little thanks to us,'
a UK military expert said. 'The Bosnian crisis has shown eastern Europe the
weaknesses of western governments. They worry that if Washington does not
pull its weight in Bosnia, Russia could fill that vacuum, return to haunt
eastern Europe, and even turn the region into a cordon sanitaire. Remember,
Russia still has an imperial itch.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / Russia arranges Karabakh ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A breakthrough in the five-year-old conflict over Nagorno Karabakh, the
Armenian-dominated enclave in Azerbaijan, may be in sight after a
Russian-arranged ceasefire was agreed this weekend. Leaders of the two
warring neighbours may meet early next month.
The Azeri leadership said in the capital Baku yesterday that the defence
ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia had agreed in Moscow with General Pavel
Grachev, Russian defence minister, on an immediate ceasefire and a
withdrawal of the forces of both sides to predetermined positions.
A complete withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azerbaijan would depend on
further negotiations. The agreement followed fierce fighting between
Armenians and Azeris in the region of Kelbadjar.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Mirror group lifts bid for Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consortium backed by Mirror Group Newspapers yesterday increased its bid
for Newspaper Publishing, owners of The Independent and Independent on
Sunday, in an effort to gain a majority stake in the company.
The bid was raised from 261.6p to 350p a share, matching the sum paid
earlier this month by Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland,
for 24.99 per cent of the company. The increased bid values Newspaper
Publishing at Pounds 73.65m.
The consortium controls nearly 48 per cent of Newspaper Publishing and hopes
the new offer will enable it to secure more than 50 per cent. Apart from
MGN, the consortium includes Newspaper Publishing's two largest existing
shareholders, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, and a group which
founded the newspapers, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor in chief.
Newspaper Publishing said yesterday a committee of the board made up of
independent directors would discuss the improved bid today and there would
be a full board meeting on Thursday.
The consortium hoped the offer would be recommended 'with a view to ending
as soon as possible the present damaging uncertainty about the company's
future'. It said the independent directors had indicated the price was
acceptable. However it said its offer would be formally rejected because it
would not undertake to maintain the offer, on the same terms, in the event
of the bid being referred to, and cleared by, the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is considering a
request from the consortium that it should be allowed to acquire a
controlling interest without an MMC inquiry. He could agree to this if he is
satisfied the newspapers are not economic as a going concern; he has set a
deadline of March 3 for comment on the proposal.
Mr O'Reilly could now attempt to increase his stake beyond 24.99 per cent -
25 per cent is the trigger for an MMC referral - on the grounds that an
inquiry is now, in any case, under consideration.
It is understood Mr O'Reilly has been told by the independent directors the
consortium bid will ultimately succeed if he fails to make a full bid.
Merely raising his stake to 30 per cent would not solve the company's
problems long term, he has been told.
The National Union of Journalists' branch at the newspapers said it could
still not support the MGN consortium bid because of the 'likely loss of up
to 250 jobs and the destruction of editorial independence'.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Postal workers reject productivity deal: Union fears Royal
Mail may now impose changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's postal workers have decisively rejected a national productivity
plan to improve the Royal Mail's efficiency and make it more commercial in
preparation for its eventual privatisation.
In a secret postal ballot they voted against the deal, against the advice of
their union, the Union of Communication Workers.
Only 33,194 supported the productivity plan, while 37,667 rejected it. A
total of 71,444 union members out of 128,874 returned completed ballot
papers.
Union leaders, deeply embarrassed by the rejection, are today due to meet
Royal Mail executives to discuss what they can do next. Mr Alan Johnson, the
UCW's general secretary, said yesterday: 'We need a period of calm
reflection.'
At national level, the UCW leadership has been working very closely with the
Post Office to make the organisation more commercial. The union's national
leadership has been willing to co-operate with the introduction of more
flexible working practices in sorting offices and mail delivery. The
productivity deal would have created a framework for local deals to
introduce more flexible shift patterns and working practices in sorting
offices.
In the aftermath of the unexpected defeat, union officials fear the Royal
Mail management may impose changes without union consent, in breach of
national agreements with the UCW. This could involve the unilateral
withdrawal by management of a number of interim productivity agreements
which came into force six years ago. UCW leaders are concerned that as a
result of the deal's defeat the Royal Mail will also refuse to negotiate any
further on the introduction of a shorter working week.
Mr Johnson said initial reports from the union's branches around the country
suggested many postal workers had found the proposed productivity scheme
'too complicated and half-baked'. The UCW hopes more talks can improve the
deal to make it more attractive.
Under the negotiated deal that was rejected, nearly half the postal workers
would have benefited financially from an increase in minimum pay rates. On
top of the basic 1.5 per cent pay rise, they would have received a further
1.5 to 1.6 per cent by agreeing to the productivity changes.
This would have ensured that the lowest paid workers in the Royal Mail
received an increase in their basic pay of twice the current rate of
inflation.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Nato lifts threat of early air strikes: UN finds substantial
withdrawal of Serb guns - West warns ultimatum remains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, ROBERT GRAHAM and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, AVIANO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tension over Bosnia eased early today as the United Nations said Nato air
strikes against the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo were unnecessary 'at this
stage'.
But western officials warned that the threat of air strikes remained unless
the Serbs continued to observe the Nato ultimatum issued earlier this month.
Soon after the deadline for ending the Serb artillery siege of the Bosnian
capital expired at midnight, the UN said there had been substantial
withdrawal or regrouping of the Serb heavy weapons.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy in former Yugoslavia, said: 'On the
basis of the information available to me, and pending further verification,
I have decided that it is not necessary at this stage for me to request Nato
to use air power.'
In Washington, the White House said all Bosnian Serb heavy guns around
Sarajevo had been neutralised 'or soon should be'. As a result, UN and Nato
commanders had concluded no air strikes were necessary 'at this time', a
senior official said.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said there had been effective
compliance with the Nato demand to remove heavy weapons more than 20km from
Sarajevo or put them under UN control under pain of air strikes. 'Nato's
resolve to end the shelling of Sarajevo does not end today,' he added. 'We
shall continue to verify compliance. . . We will remain vigilant.'
The military threat receded after the Nato alliance had assembled in Italy
and the Adriatic Sea the largest forces of air power since the Gulf war.
The Moslem-led Bosnian government yesterday urged Nato to go ahead with air
strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. It accused the UN of conniving with the
Serbs to avert air strikes.
In a bid to reassure the Moslems, General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander
in Bosnia, warned that if there were any breaches of the Nato ultimatum, 'I
will have no hesitation in calling air strikes'.
In relaxed remarks before the deadline, Gen Rose appeared concerned to
defuse tension. Asked where he would be at the midnight deadline, he told
reporters: 'In bed.'
Pentagon officials said that poor weather made it difficult to determine
immediately how many guns might still be within 20km of Sarajevo. Air
strikes were unlikely to be ordered before a complete assessment could be
made in the daylight today, they added.
But US officials warned that the Nato ultimatum was open-ended, and that air
strikes could be launched at any time if the Serbs did not continue to
comply. They also said western allies would this week discuss expanding the
Sarajevo ultimatum to ease the plight of other besieged Bosnian cities.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the 'next step is to
consider whether other places in Bosnia should have a comparable treatment',
including the towns of Srbrenica and Gorazde.
Shortly before the midnight deadline, 400 Russian UN peacekeeping troops
moved into Sarajevo to act as a buffer between Moslem-led forces in the
capital and the Serbs who have been besieging the city for 22 months. The
soldiers, in a convoy of 70 armoured vehicles, trucks and jeeps, were moved
from Croatia and will be followed by another 400 men from Russia.
Mr Worner thanked Russia for its role in Bosnia in the past few days, when
it lent its weight to secure Bosnian Serb agreement to withdraw heavy
weapons. 'The just and lasting peace that we must now try to achieve in
Bosnia involves close Russian involvement,' he added. 'We all must try to
maintain the momentum and reflect on further steps.'
President Bill Clinton phoned Russian president Boris Yeltsin yesterday and
told him he was encouraged by Serb efforts to comply with the Nato
ultimatum, a US official said.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's deputy foreign minister and Moscow's special
envoy in former Yugoslavia, warned earlier that Nato's Partnership for Peace
agreements with former Warsaw Pact states in eastern Europe could be one
casualty of any air strike. 'The point here is not air strikes; it is
peace,' he said.
As the west seeks ways to capitalise on the ceasefire around Sarajevo and
move the peace process forward, Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary,
will today hold talks with Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart. Senior
officials from the European Union, the US, Russia and the UN are due to meet
tomorrow in Bonn.
Mr Christopher said that finding a settlement which met the reasonable
requirements of the Bosnian Moslems was a high priority, and that the
apparent success of Nato's new resolve over Sarajevo would boost peace
talks.
Removal of the Serb artillery eases but does not end the siege of Sarajevo
and its 380,000 inhabitants. Serb forces still control all access to the
city, although UN troops are monitoring the latest ceasefire, which has
restored some degree of normality.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Financial markets braced for further turbulence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International financial markets look set for another bout of turbulence
today after the sell-off that caused heavy falls in US and European bond and
equity markets late last Friday.
One senior marketmaker in UK equities said yesterday that the FT-SE 100, the
London market's leading stocks, could probably be marked down by as much as
60 points at the opening to try to head off any attempted selling by the big
institutions.
He said that 3,355 on the FT-SE 100 would be a benchmark for market
sentiment: 'If it closes above 3,355 we should stabilise.' The FT-SE 100
closed at 3,382.6 last Friday. Wall Street is closed today - Presidents'
Day.
Last week's sell-off came as bond dealers took fright at talk of
exceptionally heavy selling of international bonds by some big US hedge
funds, which are involved in aggressive short-term trading but seek to
offset exposure to changes in market rates. This was compounded by worries
about what Mr Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, will say to
Congress tomorrow in a review of monetary policy.
Asian centres will provide the first pointers to international market
performance today. In Tokyo, shares edged lower in thin morning trading,
with the Nikkei average down 18 at midday. Hong Kong stocks were sharply
down in early trade.
Mr Nick Knight, analyst at Nomura, the stockbroker, said: 'The Hong Kong
market is a critical and sensitive indicator of US money flows. If Hong Kong
is down 200 points we'll have a manageable fall in London but if it is
significantly larger than that, then it could be serious.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / Civil service fast-stream entry system reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is reviewing one of the cornerstones of the British civil
service, the fast-stream entry system that assures a glittering career for
an elite of young high-flyers.
The Cabinet Office said yesterday that the review 'would look at the
strategic question of whether the civil service needs a fast-stream system
at all'.
For nearly 140 years the fast stream has picked out a small group of civil
servants at the start of their careers and virtually ensured that they are
Whitehall mandarins about 20 years later.
The system has been regularly attacked for ensuring that the civil service
is run by a like-minded group of white, middle-class males educated at
Oxford and Cambridge universities.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, said in a parliamentary
written answer that the review would be completed by June.
The review follows calls from inside and outside Whitehall for changes to
the top structure of the civil service to bring it into line with the
management reforms of the past six years.
The creation of executive agencies to deliver central government services
has led ministers to look for private-sector skills in those who run them.
A recent Whitehall report into career management said that the fast-stream
system 'could encourage the worst aspects of elitism and, without care,
might perpetuate a set of skills more suitable to the past than the future'.
Mr John Garrett, Labour MP for Norwich South and a former member of the
Commons Treasury and civil service committee, said the announcement was the
first time ministers had admitted that the system needed changing.
'A crack has appeared in the facade,' he added. He said that civil service
reforms could have a big impact on elite career management in the private
sector.
Cabinet Office staff were more reserved about the announcement. An official
said: 'It shows we are a good, sensible employer, and this is a regular
review of whether our recruitment is up to best practice.'
The fast-stream system is administered by Recruitment and Assessment
Services, on behalf of the Civil Service Commissioners.

<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never have I felt so glad to return to London as I did last weekend. Good
old England; praise God for Naffshire. How snug things seemed. Comforting.
Familiar. A government of tired incompetents lecturing an electorate of
(mainly) idiots on how to comport themselves. Another Tory scandal.
Decrepitude. Banality.
I am a surprisingly simple soul: always highly amiable, a boon in office or
home. But I was in such a depressed state when I returned from Delhi last
weekend that I almost fell to the ground at Heathrow and kissed Naffshire's
sod, so pleased was I to be back.
I had not been to India before. I was there only briefly. But I was outraged
by what I saw - filth, pollution and poverty on a scale hard to stomach;
people milling wretchedly; the degradation of humanity on an eye-popping
scale.
I had to keep rubbing my eyes, for India seemed a parody of a country, so
unreal, so far off-course, that I felt I had strayed into a time-kink from
the middle of the next century, when population pressures will be exacting a
dreadful price for our inability to control our breeding.
By coincidence I was reading, while in Delhi, Aldous Huxley's Brave New
World Revisited. It was published in 1959, as Huxley's second opinion on the
phantasmagoric prophesies contained in his novel, Brave New World, written
in 1931.
I would guess that for every 1,000 who have read Brave New World, only a
handful have read Brave New World Revisited. You should try it, especially
if you have just handed a small boy, only five or six years old, one of
India's Untouchables, a few rupees in a Delhi street and have watched his
scabbed little face light up with a smile of disbelief.
Huxley was much exercised by over-population. This was not the space age but
the age of over-population. In the Brave New World of his fable, he wrote,
the problem of human numbers in relation to natural resources had been
effectively solved. But in the real world the problem was 'becoming graver
and more formidable with every passing year. It is against this grim
biological background that all the political, economic, cultural and
psychological dramas of our time are being played out.'
That quote is from the first chapter of Brave New World Revisited. It is in
the second chapter that Huxley really let rip, and he did so by venturing
into areas that are simply not discussed today.
In his Brave New World, he said, eugenics and dysgenics were practised
systematically: Betas, Alphas and even Alpha-pluses out of one set of
laboratory bottles; biologically inferior, almost sub-human, creatures from
another set.
In the real world, we did nothing systematic about our breeding. 'But in our
random and unregulated way we are not only over-populating our planet, we
are also, it would seem, making sure that these greater numbers shall be of
biologically poorer quality . . . Under the conditions now prevailing, every
advance in medicine will tend to be offset by a corresponding advance in the
survival rates of individuals cursed by some genetic insufficiency.'
Result: no improvement, or perhaps a deterioration, in average health
standards, and perhaps a decline in average intelligence. Going further,
Huxley quoted a Dr WH Sheldon as claiming that it was 'the fashion in some
academic circles to assure students that the alarm over differential
birth-rates is unfounded; that these problems are merely economic, or merely
educational, or merely religious, or merely cultural or something . . . This
is Pollyanna optimism. Reproductive delinquency is biological and basic.'
What chilled me especially as I stared through the windows of my tourist
coach in Delhi was Huxley's conclusion. 'What,' he asked, 'about the
congenitally insufficient organisms, whom our medicine and our social
services now preserve so that they may propagate their kind? . . . the
wholesale transmission to our descendants of the results of unfavourable
mutations, and the progressive contamination of the genetic pool from which
members of our species will have to draw, (is) obviously bad.'
Huxley didn't have any answers. But at least he asked the questions. Where
have those questions gone? Why have they been purged? Why the great silence?
I believe I know the answer. I think we have grown afraid. The thing that is
frightening us most is the sight of our own teeming shadows.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Private vices and publication: The fashion for posthumous
attacks on public figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The debunking biography is high fashion. Publishers now love nothing more
than a book which will prove that cherished public idols have not only feet
of clay, but are brittle through and through. Or rather, were brittle. Such
biographies could never survive the English laws on defamation, were it not
for the fact that dead men cannot sue.
This week Sir Stephen Spender, happily still with us, managed, through legal
action, to cause the pulping of an ostensible work of fiction which appeared
to be based on alleged homosexual relationships in his youth. But it must
irk Sir Stephen that he cannot guarantee his posthumous reputation. I am
prepared to bet that the temporarily stymied publisher of the fiction will
gleefully reprint the book immediately upon the poet's death, with a slogan
such as 'The book Sir Stephen Spender banned]'
This week two further examples of the genre have been serialised in the
newspapers. One is Roald Dahl, by Jeremy Treglown, to be published by Faber
and Faber in March. The other is John Arlott, a Memoir, by Timothy Arlott,
published by Andre Deutsch next Tuesday. Dahl, whose books for children give
more pleasure to their young readers than almost any other such writer since
the days of the Brothers Grimm, is portrayed by Jeremy Treglown as selfish,
ruthless and heartless.
In one episode Dahl is said to have fed his daughter a sleeping pill,
apparently so that he would be safe to have a telephone conversation with
one of his mistresses. Unfortunately for Dahl, the potion did not take
effect, his daughter overheard the conversation, and challenged her father.
The author, according to his biographer then addressed his daughter thus:
'You've always been trouble, you've always been a nosy little bitch. I want
you to get out of this house now.'
I am certainly not going to fault Treglown's research, still less his
motives. But will Willy Wonka's chocolate factory ever seem the same? At the
least, the product might taste a little more bitter.
The case of the Arlott biography is more poignant. The subject was one of
Britain's best loved broadcasters. His reputation was of a kind gentle and
generous man. The author who manages to drill a few holes in this picture is
John Arlott's son. Tim Arlott gives credit to his father where he believes
credit is due, but is ruthlessly honest about the great cricket
commentator's late years, describing him as: 'a selfish, demanding, limited
and impossible old man.'
I suspect that the majority of men become selfish, demanding and impossible
in their old age, unless they have managed to do so earlier. But some of the
stories that Timothy tells about his father are chilling nonetheless.
Perhaps there are some who will read Arlott junior's book and not be able to
recall the old boy's wonderfully generous commentaries. But I imagine that
for most of us, the revelations will seem insignificant compared to the
pleasure we gained from the outward manifestation of John Arlott's
character. Above all, none of it means that he was one whit a lesser man as
a professional; he managed never to inflict the darker side of his character
on to the public who adored him.
While I am sure that this will be the common reaction to young Arlott's
revelations, it is strange that such licence is not now being given to our
politicians. Most people seem to believe that Stephen Milligan's strange and
entirely solitary sexual practices would have rendered him unsuitable for
high office. Few people have said that it is an absurdity beyond measure
that another Conservative MP should have felt compelled to resign junior
office because he sent love poems to an assistant.
If we approved of what a politician did before we knew of his private vices,
we should continue to vote for him and his policies. If we did not like his
policies then we should never give our support, no matter how saintly his
private life. As has been said before, civilised society cannot survive
without a certain amount of hypocrisy.
Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Private View: Sibyl of an age of anxiety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liz Greene, a Jungian psychotherapist, talks about the age of Aquarius
She was poised, a beautiful sibyl, under her own painting of a church hewn
from the rock in old Cappadocia. Her dark feline eyes were highlighted with
ochre, and there were long scratches on her bare forearms. Two fluffy
Burmese cats skidded about the floor.
In the centre of the contemporary-elegant room stood a bust of the emperor
Hadrian. Dionysiac masks grinned from the walls. Cretan snake-goddesses and
steatopygous figurines adorned the mantelpiece; a three-eyed Mexican cat
with human paws guarded the fireplace. We were in the house of Liz Greene,
doctor of psychology, Jungian analyst and scholar of astrology.
Dr Greene had been hesitant about this visit. Now she sat, quiet and
composed, on the edge of the sofa, occasionally leaning forward to light
another cigarette.
I asked her: Is the world suffering from Pre-Millennial Tension?
'Yes, certainly. But I call it collective anxiety. There is certainly an
enormous amount of it around.'
What is the anxiety about?
'I think you can only partly explain it by millennial fantasies - we have
very funny ideas about millennia. I think it is deeper than that. There are,
it seems to me, very profound changes taking place in people's perception of
reality.'
World-views, she said, had a finite span. 'And the world-view which we have
been relying on, the scientific world view, is showing serious signs of
wear.'
Why should we notice that?
'We still have a collective psyche. We are still plugged into, if you like,
a unified life which I think all human beings share. There is something
which connects us. It lies behind mass movements and the appearance, for
example, of the same mythologies in different parts of the world.'
Meanwhile, the 2,000-year-old moral fabric of Christianity was 'falling to
bits'.
Liz Greene speaks slowly and softly, like a sleepwalker, in a gentle
American accent acquired from a childhood in New Jersey. She went to
university in Boston and Los Angeles then, having an English father and
feeling culturally European, moved to England 20 years ago.
Was this pressure for change coming from humanity or from some cosmic or
divine force? They could not be separated, she replied. Psychology might use
neutral language 'but I don't see a lot of difference between what Jung
called 'the collective unconscious' and what religion calls God.'
Scientific knowledge prevented us from going back to the ancient world of
myth. We had lost something en route. 'You see a tremendous reaching out for
answers. People are desperate for something that will make the anxiety go
away.'
So they come to psychotherapists?
'They come to us, to astrologers, to priests, to fundamentalist religion, to
political ideology - they come to isms.'
Collective anxiety and cosmic pressure might just be inventions of the
psychiatric industry, I said: if not Pre-Millennial Tension, then
Post-Copernican Depression.
'That's an attitude one can take,' she said. 'I don't think it helps a lot.
It's like blaming advertising for something becoming popular.'
I had read a feminist theory that collective anxiety is a men's crisis. Was
the gender war, if such it be, a symptom?
Greene said she understood the idea but did not subscribe to it. 'I think
it's a symptom of scapegoating, the most characteristic manifestation of
anxiety.' She mentioned Germany and the Jews. 'It's particularly ugly but
very human.' Talk of gender wars bred hatred and made the problem worse.
I pointed to the pagan images around her room and asked if the occult played
some part in her worldview.
'The objects are here because I like them. The images of ancient gods are
symbols, not actualities and are imaged beautifully. That's why I collect
them, not because they are altars at which I sacrifice black chickens.' She
smiled suddenly, her mouth describing a great V. 'It has nothing to do with
magic or witchcraft. I mean, astrology was never occult.'
As everyone ought to know, our equinoctial point is shifting out of Pisces
into Aquarius. The Age of Aquarius starts about now, give or take 50 to 70
years depending on which star you pick.
Astrological shifts coincide with changes in religious beliefs, attitudes
and values, Greene said. Aquarius, being a collective type of sign, is
appropriate for conglomerate activity such as the European Union,
multinational companies, even superstores.
Are you saying there is a causal connection?
'No. I don't think that we are being made to do anything because it's the
Age of Aquarius. There isn't an 'out there' and an 'in here'. They're part
of the same thing. So planetary patterns do seem to synchronise with changes
that take place in individuals and collectives.'
She said there was a Uranus-Pluto conjunction, portending upheaval, in the
1960s. People may have been demonstrating in Paris, I objected, but what
upheavals were there in Indonesia or among Eskimos?
'I am not a world historian. You would expect to find something happening
but it would only happen within the structure that Indonesians or Eskimos
built.'
Orthodox scientists scream bloody murder about this kind of thing.
'That's their problem, not mine.' Now she actually laughed.
Liz Greene can afford to laugh. Probably half the world, including Ronald
Reagan, consults horoscopes. Nor are all modern scientists hostile. The
French researcher Michel Gauquelin is reported to have found compelling
statistical evidence of zodiacal congruity among individuals.
Does it matter how it works?
'Of course I would like to know, but I'm not going to lose sleep over it.'
Do you expect the link to be discovered one day?
'Yes, I think it will. But I suspect it's going to require an opening up of
the scientific frame of reference for measurement.'
Liz Greene sometimes uses astrology to help her identify the probable crisis
points in her patients' lives. I asked if she was not worried she would
impose her unorthodox beliefs on vulnerable clients.
'Of course I'm concerned with that. I think any intelligent therapist is.'
That was why responsible analysts underwent analysis.
It may be just another symptom of our anxious transition to Aquarius that
psychotherapy has come in for a lot of stick. Therapists have been accused
of feeding off their clients, encouraging selfishness, even breaking up
families. I asked Liz Greene if she was aware of it.
'Well, I'm aware of Fay Weldon.' She laughed again. Weldon is bringing out a
novel, Affliction, based on the story of her husband's defection to a female
analyst. Greene was not sympathetic. 'He probably had a great many other
reasons for going. I think he heard what he'd been waiting to hear.'
Nor did people go to analysts casually, except perhaps in the Woody Allen
world, she said. It was too expensive for that, both emotionally and
financially.
How far should one person poke inside the personality of another?
'As much as the person needs. But I think the psyche limits itself. I think
we all have a kind of inner sanity which tells us when something is not
functioning properly and when it's OK.'
Is not introspection an unhealthy substitute for what used to be extrovert
worship of some deity?
'I don't think it's a substitute and I certainly wouldn't call it unhealthy.
But as we can no longer find God 'out there' it's not a bad idea to find
something like it inside, to discover some kind of inner morality or
integrity or ideal which is worth living for.'
Beneath the inner distress, she said, was something 'more intelligent than
the person is on the conscious level'.
What we used to call 'the soul'?
'Yes, if you like.'
Is psychotherapy a voyage of self-discovery for you as well?
'Certainly. I find people quite miraculous. My sense of - if you like - the
'soul' keeps getting reaffirmed every time I work with someone. You see
something mysterious and remarkable coming alive in them.'
Liz Greene studied stage and costume design but found the actors more
interesting than the plays. She also suffered a crisis at university and
problems with relationships. She would not tell me more.
I asked for her star sign. It is Virgo.
So your account of the world is one that suits your temperament?
'Of course it suits me or I wouldn't espouse it.'
You don't claim any more for it than that?
'I could be wrong.'
About the collective anxiety?
'I could be wrong about all of it. I can only tell you what I have observed.
I draw the conclusions that fit my frame of reference.
'Whether it's absolute truth I haven't the foggiest idea. But it is a very
rich and meaningful frame of reference, not only to me but has been for
4,000 years to minds far better equipped than mine. I'm in good company.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / The old Italian way to pacify Ireland: Max Wilkinson
considers a 16th century solution to the long-running conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I dreamed a dream of how to end the killing in Northern Ireland. No matter.
John Major is also sleepwalking: uncertain from one day to the next whether
he is talking to the bosses of the terrorists. And Gerry Adams is far away
in the land of nod if he thinks that easy victories on American TV can
sanctify murder or disguise the growing ascendancy of protestant gunmen.
Let us hope that both are dancing to a tune we cannot hear and that Ireland
will one day awaken to its harmony. Meanwhile, here is a different dream. It
begins with the ghost of Machiavelli, asking briskly: 'Why do you English
stay in Northern Ireland: for profit, sentiment, for glory or because you
fear the contagion of a religious war? Which side do you support? If
neither, why do you give them both money?' The spirit of that prince of
civil servants began to fade.
'Stay,' I cried. 'Everyone except our government knows that these are the
right questions. But how shall we answer?' He returned into focus, with the
sardonic smile which so irritated Lorenzo de' Medici.
'I have written,' he replied, 'That a foreign power cannot succeed by
generosity alone; for the people's gratitude is fickle. A liberal rule must
be tempered by severity. Hannibal, for example, avoided insurrection because
his fine qualities included extreme brutality . . .'
'No doubt, no doubt' I said, 'But we abandoned even the mildest torture
decades ago after The Sunday Times discovered that prisoners were being made
to stand against a wall . . .Yes, we have tried locking up all suspects,
including the innocent. But as you said in 1513, that sort of thing foments
unrest.'
'And you no longer exact tribute from their lands,' he mused.
'No,' I replied. 'English settlers were once rapacious. There was hunger and
oppression. But now the province is part of our kingdom, just like Kent or
Wales. The people there get the same benefits as in Great Britain even
though they generate less wealth.'
'So you must pay . . '
'Yes, Pounds 3,200m a year, plus another Pounds 400m for an army to stop
them killing each other. That is about Pounds 43 a week per head.'
Machiavelli looked puzzled, so I explained: 'We give every person in
Northern Ireland the equivalent of a 20kg sack of silver each year.'
His lip curled: 'You are much loved for this?'
'No. Powerful Americans believe the Irish are still enslaved and send them
money for explosives. The Irish think state benefits are theirs by right (as
people do in England). The protestants fear we will take away their
privileges, and the catholics grumble because so many cannot find work.
'You pay them even if they do not work?'
'Of course. Especially if they do not work.'
'Including the terrorists?'
'Perhaps, if they have no work.'
'Few successful rulers have paid rebels who kill their own soldiers,' he
said.
'But we are a democracy.'
'Nevertheless, your rulers must force both sides to understand how much is
being paid and exact conditions for the money. This cannot be done, you
agree, so long as Northern Ireland is treated like your Kent. Perhaps the
province could be given a kind of independence. The protestants should then
be warned that the grant will be cut unless they behave, and the catholics
would see that if they were to join the Republic they would be very much
poorer.'
'We tried this.'
'You must be more ruthless. And this time get rid of the terrorists. Kill or
imprison all that you prudently can. Bribe the rest. Give very large bribes
to the leaders; then they will control their comrades and inform on any who
break ranks. This will be much cheaper than paying Pounds 400m to your
soldiers. Of course these payments must be disguised: perhaps as a
rehabilitation fund run by Norwegians.'
'But this is totally unacceptable.'
'Then keep your dreams,' he said and faded into the dawn.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Books: In search of Pan and the people of Thrace (1) -
Michael Thompson-Noel fails to keep up with Fiona Pitt-Kethley
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE PAN PRINCIPLE by Fiona Pitt-Kethley
Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 16.99, 315 pages
A DRY SHIP TO THE MOUNTAINS by Daniel Farson Michael Joseph Pounds 15.99,
246 pages
Her Baedeker in hand and her knickers round her ankles, Fiona Pitt-Kethley
travelled to Greece to research the god Pan and the places where he was
worshipped. Not a bad idea. Probably worth a travel book. Start in Arcadia,
Pan's undisputed birthplace, and carry on from there. Temples and
mountain-tops, ceremonies in sordid caves. How extremely jolly. A bit of
ancient sex, too, which could hardly harm one's sales.
But be warned: The Pan Principle is not a book for an elderly aunt about to
embark on a Swan Hellenic cruise of Greece and her islands, for it is
stuffed with sex - modern sex, always with strangers, sometimes satisfactory
yet sometimes, as in life, grubbily inorgasmic. The reason for this is that
Ms Pitt-Kethley, excessively fond of a bonk, has sauced the tale of her
journeyings with kiss-and-tell accounts of all the sexual rompings she
enjoyed along the way.
Nothing wrong with that, of course. She is not a pornographer. She just has
these needs, and is a fastidious reporter - describing, for example, with
detachment and insouciance, which colour condom she chose for which Greek
member.
And it is refreshing, at least initially, to encounter someone not prepared
to don the wan garb of the average travel writer - sick-making lyricism,
dishonest romanticism and egregious selectivity. Nine-tenths of this planet
is in a god-awful mess, but you would never guess it from most travel books.
At least Pitt-Kethley is honest. But the mind starts to wander as she
grapples with yet another native. First there is Spiros the accountant, with
whom she groans and sags in a pied-a-terre in Pyrgos. Spiros has his own
condoms, a brand called STOP, and, being an accountant, is so extremely
cautious that he uses a rubber band to hold the thing in place.
Next is Giovanni, an attractive museum guard with whom Pitt-Kethley couples
on the marble floor of the archaeological museum in Naples during one of her
trips home. (Do not bother to try it: it proved excessively painful.) Then
Nick, a physics lecturer; Demetrios, all foreplay; Georgios the biker, who
bites her, rather thuggishly. And so on and so forth.
A few stray males escape Pitt-Kethley's clasp, including two boys, hardly
old enough to be driving, who pick her up in a van between Stamata and
Marathon. They are soon all over her, but they do not get a jump - mainly,
she tells us primly, because she cannot stomach acne.
Occasionally, Pitt-Kethley offers us an anthropological insight. 'In Greece,
as in England,' she confides, 'the men are predominantly homosexual by
inclination.' And although there are plenty of good-looking men in Athens
and elsewhere, there is something wrong with Greek male bodies. Greek men
hate to walk, she says; they drive everywhere, which atrophies their legs.
She is equally sharp on Greek pollution, which is 'slowly but surely
damaging every outdoor work of art.' And sharp, too, on Greek officialdom.
In Delphi's tourist office she encounters a woman who is remarkably
proficient at not giving information in several languages, which leads the
author to observe that she has never yet heard any expression of regret for
Greek ignorance voiced by a Greek.
What with all the sex, Pitt-Kethley's search for the ithyphallic Pan, the
master of diverse roles, who was revived, in Edwardian times, as a figure
representing raw sex and the subconscious in all its power, is often lost
sight of, though she has her moments as a travel writer, not least when
describing the people of the tiny village of Ano Karyes, on Mount Lykaion,
one of the most beautiful and mysterious of Greek mountains, from the top of
which you can see all the mountain ranges of the Peloponnese.
Twenty years ago, unknown to most of the world, the people of Ano Karyes
decided to restart the Lykaian Games, which had a pedigree almost as
honourable as that of the Olympic Games. There are only 27 people left
living in Ano Karyes, but their passion for conservation is so inspiring,
says Pitt-Kethley, that since meeting them she has often wished they were
running the whole country.
In a ruminative finale, Pitt-Kethley concludes that Pan is dead in most of
Greece - dead of pollution and the self-created problems in which Greece
wallows. But she adds, not convincingly, that he is alive elsewhere, at
least for the time being.
After the exuberance and knowingness of Pitt-Kethley, Daniel Farson's A Dry
Ship to the Mountains sits tamely in the hand. Farson sets out to complete
his father's 1929 attempt to cross the Klukhor pass in the Caucasus on
horseback. At the age of 64, this great-nephew of Bram Stoker imagined he
would take a jolly cruise down the Volga and then an idyllic ride across the
mountains. That is not how things turned out.
He writes fairly charmingly. Trouble is, I read him immediately after
rolling with Pitt-Kethley. Every time Farson met a new male character, I at
once started wondering how he would rate in bed. The suspense was all but
fatal.

THE RENAISSANCE PRINT by David Landau and Peter Parshall
Yale University Press
Pounds 45, 433 pages
The Renaissance print, north and south of the Alps, has largely been taken
for granted by art historians unless, as with Mantegna's engravings and
Durer's woodcuts, it is a significant part of an artist's oeuvre and
necessary to the completion of a monograph. Few have ever considered it as
art in its own right, both woven into painting and drawing, and standing
apart from them; nor have they enquired into its mass manufacture and
marketing, nor the artists to whom its technical development was a matter of
ardent intellectual and aesthetic concern.
David Landau, editor of Print Quarterly, and Peter Parshall, Professor of
art history at Portland, Oregon, have sought to remedy this, and with ten
years research have produced a book that covers the subject for a century or
so, from the print's first burgeoning in Flanders in the 1460s, to its
exploitation for the mechanical reproduction of Raphael's imagery, and from
the first crude woodblock to the elegant chiaroscuros of Ugo da Carpi and
Beccafumi.
Their approach is encyclopedic; we learn of the expanding manufacture of
paper from flax, as the market for wool declined and that for linen grew; we
learn of paper merchants at a Frankfurt fair, of inks from vine yeast or
burnt pitch, of printing presses established all along the Rhine and into
the Netherlands and Swabia, of family workshops in which wives and daughters
played their part and the works of other printmakers were sold, of networks
and of agents, and of Hungary as a source of copper for the plates; we are
even told of the use of prints as objects of portable and private devotion,
and of their enjoyment in privacy when the market proliferated into erotica
and pornography, not just in illustrating the illicit loves of gods, but
more directly - and the authors make their point with Raimondi's print of a
nude woman at pleasure with a ladies' comforter.
It is at an engaging pace at the beginning that we absorb the exciting basic
facts and glimpse Renaissance Europe feverishly exploiting a new commerce so
important to their prestige that such artists as Lucas Cranach and Urs Graf
may have been driven to falsify the dates of their prints so as to lay claim
to primacy in technical invention, but the pace is not sustained. The
complexities of the material defy the continuous text with which the authors
bind it, and like 18th century connoisseurs who know all the facts and are
fecund with ideas, but cannot organise either into a logical format, they
lose their grasp, and on recovery insert the material almost at random.
From page 65, not under his own name, but with the heading The Development
of a Tonal System, we have six pages devoted to the vexed matter of
Mantegna's prints; a little more appears on page 100, and another five full
pages are hidden in the subsequent chapter devoted to Marcantonio Raimondi
and Raphael; yet in these three passages the explanation of Mantegna's
techniques is far from clear, nor is the question of authenticity
satisfactorily addressed. Durer provides an even more continuous leitmotiv,
running right through the book - very late we learn that he gave his prints
in barter and payment, even as tips, and are treated to a discussion of
their financial worth and even of the coins that he carried in his purse -
but nowhere in the list of contents is he mentioned (nor is Mantegna),
though his compatriots Altdorfer, the Hopfers and Lutzelburger are.
The list of contents is one of the book's worst offences; with a confusion
of typefaces erratic in their relation to the importance of the subject, a
meaningless mixture of capitals and lower case, and absurd crowding, it is
inadequate, misleading and damnably unhelpful, and the serious reader
intending to use the book for reference must first set to the task of making
his own list, with cross-references. An editor should have seen to this, and
he should also have shaken the authors by the scruff; too often they write
carelessly, their grammar slovenly - 'there are only a couple of his plates
known' is typical, and 'more importantly' and other confusions of adjective
and adverb are a common irritant. No editor should have allowed to pass into
print the fuzzy thinking of the brief paragraph on Marcantonio and
Parmigianino in which appear 'almost certainly,' 'most scholars now agree
that,' 'more probably,' 'it is not unlikely that,'/'This is not improbable,
and it is also possible that,' 'would have been,' 'conceivably,' and
'probably rehearsed.'
A decade of labour by two diligent scholars does not of itself result in a
good book, particularly when they cannot spell (martial for marshal), cannot
write with any style that eases the reader through their torrent of
material, and are so jack-in-the-box with its presentation. The design of
the book is a disgrace - with a rigid spine its pages never lie flat, and of
the twin columns of small print, the inner invariably slides into the
gutter; crudely patched with little illustrations, few pages are comfortable
to the eye; and the sub-headings that mark the text's crucial shifts from
north to south of the Alps are too small to be seen when rifling swiftly
through the pages, as one must.
All this is more than irksome, for so absorbing a survey of so wide a field,
learned, technical, perceptive, and full of sudden and illuminating
insights, must be regarded as the most important work on the subject for
many years - certainly within my lifetime - but it could have been so much
more immediately useful had its publishers insisted on its being, not some
four hundred pages to be read as literature (with some four hundred
illustrations), but a stout reference book. We shall all use it as a
reference book, and every time we do so, we shall curse the press that
printed it.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Books: Poet hobbled by passion - The work of Stephen
Spender, 85 this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOLPHINS by Stephen Spender Faber and Faber Pounds 12.99 (Pounds 5.99
paperback) 46 pages
This month, the great cultural monument that is Sir Stephen Spender will be
85 years of age. It is now more than 30 years since the death of Louis
MacNeice, 20 since the deaths of WH Auden and C. Day Lewis and 10 since that
of Christopher Isherwood. Spender, the last surviving member of that
much-memorialised generation of the 1930s, has survived them all - and he
continues to write and review regularly to this day.
The poetry, however, has come very slowly. His last full collection, The
Generous Days, was published in 1971; his Collected Poems of 1985, though
containing some new works (including notable elegies to MacNeice and Auden)
was largely a re-presentation - often drastically re-worked  - of older
material.
In 'Worldsworth', the best poem of his new collection, Dolphins, he records
his first brush with poetry. In 1916 the Spenders were obliged to leave
their home on the cliffs near Sheringham, Norfolk after two stray German
bombs fell nearby. The family decamped to a farmhouse near Lake Derwentwater
and it was there that Spender, then seven years old, heard his father
reading Wordsworth in the garden. The vocabulary and the cadences of
romanticism became a life-long passion and it is a passion that has both
enriched and hobbled his poetry.
'Worldsworth' is just one of several autobiographical poems in this short
collection. Another, 'Air Raid', captures a moment in 1941 when a bomb, that
'unreasoning fury from an enemy's vision of life', destroys the outer walls
of a house, turning what had once been private and inside - a bath, a
wardrobe, books, the telephone - into a public spectacle. All that "tender
sensitive life" has been thrown away.
Variants upon this observation are the over-riding theme of the collection,
no matter how widely it may seem to range in subject matter  - from memories
of the first and second world wars, through elegies for dead friends, to a
long poem which examines the explosive relationship between Rimbaud and
Verlaine. What can be preserved of the intensities of the inner life in a
world that seems hell bent on its own annihilation? The poet, according to
Spender, acts as a mediator between the uniquely private self and the world
outside us. There is a lived, shared reality which is both general to
everyone and unique to each person, and it is poetry's task to describe it.
Unfortunately Spender's abilities in this book are rarely equal to his
vision. 'Air Raid' collapses at the end into cliche and verbal redundancy;
many of the other poems seem too casually written, as if they are little
more than notebook jottings. Only in the Wordsworthian blank verse of
'Worldsworth' do we find a sustained and excellent piece of writing from
beginning to end.
Sir Stephen Spender, cultural ambassador plenipotentiary, the memorialiser
of himself and his famous generation, journalist, editor, essayist,
university teacher and literary critic seems to have spent so much time
clinking glasses across tables and lurching from glittering lunch to equally
glittering dinner (anyone who doubts this should read his Journals
1939-1983) that it is a wonder he has had the time - or the powers of
concentration - to write any good poetry at all. The fact is, of course,
that he has written a little. But most critics would agree that he has not
achieved his life-long ambition to be a great poet. His more enduring
achievements have been elsewhere: as a writer of prose, for example, (an
autobiography, World within World, is his masterpiece). Here he has found a
way with words that is much more subtle, flexible and assured than most of
his poetry ever manages to be, marred as it so often is by a peculiar
stiffness and Shelleyan rhetoric. As a spokesman for liberal values, no
matter how hopelessly privileged the spokesman may at times seem to be,
Spender has also made his mark: to argue for the sacredness of the
individual and his impulses is, after all, one of the finest fruits of the
romantic movement.

IN THE TRAIL OF ODYSSEUS by Marianna Koromila
Michael Russell Pounds 14.95, 150 pages
Patrick Leigh Fermor's services to our understanding and love of Greece
extend beyond his magnificent travel books. His translation of The Cretan
Runner, for instance - the war memoir of George Psychoundakis, one of Leigh
Fermor's irregulars during the German Occupation - gave us one of the most
fascinating books about Crete. Now he has introduced the English edition of
another memoir by an 'ordinary' Greek. Like The Cretan Runner, In the Trail
of Odysseus is a surprise and a delight.
It is the life story of Yiankos Danielopoulos, who was born in merchant
prosperity in a small port on the Black Sea in 1899 and died in contented
poverty 88 years later on his small farm on Mt Hymettos near Athens. Yiankos
apparently wrote a version of autobiography in old age, which was then put
together and skilfully placed in context by Marianna Koromila.
It has been fluently translated by Nigel Clive and Leigh Fermor contributes
an introduction in his inimitable style. ('On the right a beech-forest
wavered inland to the foothills of the Great Balkan Range, and on the left,
beyond a steep tumble of rocks and a troop of cormorants, a sweep of green
water fled away to the skyline. It was getting dark; light snow began
fluttering down and suddenly revelation came . . .')
The interest, and indeed the importance, of this book is that it calls from
the shadows the least-known members of the Greek diaspora - the three
million Greeks of the Black Sea, before the dramas of this century drove
most of them back home to the Mediterranean.
These Greeks (can we call them Thracians?) of the Danube Delta, the Crimea,
Odessa, the Caucasus, Rostov-on-the-Don, etc., have never enjoyed the
attention which has rightly been given to their compatriots in Egypt or Asia
Minor. Here at last we have a portrait of a vigorous and thriving society of
traders and sailors, a picture of a bygone age in which villagers dance on
red-hot coals at the Feast of St Panteleimon, the children are all sent off
by sailing boat to school in Constantinople, and drunken Cossacks drown in
the cellars they have flooded with looted wine.
But Yiankos' life was to be one of repeated crisis and disruption, as he
suffered - with remarkable ebullience - the consequences of the Balkan Wars,
the first world war, the 1917 Soviet Revolution and its aftermath, the 1929
Crash, the second world war, and Yalta. Again and again he built up a
business and a home, whether in Constanza or Galatz or Rostov or the Sea of
Azov or Novorosisk or Constanza (again) or Bucharest, only to lose it all
and have to move on.
He changed nationality twice and profession 13 times and he was seven times
a refugee. He was a money changer, he owned a cafe and then a grocery store,
he was director of a state confectionery shop in Romania, and he finished up
a farmer in Attica. He survived the Bulgarians and their 'ethnic cleansing'
of Thracians in 1914, the Anarchists in 1917, the Bolsheviks in 1924, the
Iron Guard in 1940, the Stalinists in 1948. He made friends with the German
invaders in 1940 and with their Soviet successors in 1945. Always he
observed the golden rule of Greeks abroad - keep out of local politics.
In the end, says Koromila, not too fancifully, he followed the guidance of
Tiresias to Odysseus - to take an oar and to travel inland to the point
where the oar is thought by the locals to be a spade, and there to make his
home. In 1950 Yiankos brought his family back to the Mediterranean, as
refugees.
All of this is engrossing, but I am a little worried about Koromila's
insistence that Homer specifically set The Odyssey in the Black Sea, with
the Sirens in the Sea of Marmara and Hades located in the Cimmerian
Bosphorus at the foot of the Caucasus. This is surely an absurdly literal
interpretation of a great poetic myth - and anyhow, Odysseus was aiming for
Ithaca, which lies in the other direction. Does this explain why this
otherwise splendid slim volume is disgracefully devoid of a proper map?

GAZA FIRST:
THE SECRET NORWAY CHANNEL TO PEACE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PLO
by Jane Corbin Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 213 pages
Rarely is a journalist's coup quite so comprehensive as the one scored last
September by Jane Corbin. Within hours of Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime
minister, and Yassir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, shaking hands on the lawn of the White House, Corbin's account
of the secret negotiations which led to the deal was being screened by BBC
Panorama.
She has now attempted to flesh out her inevitably rather impressionistic
account with a more detailed narrative. The format, however, is similar and
the book has the accelerating pace of a political thriller.
The cast of characters - the Norwegian expediters, the Israeli amateurs and
later the professionals, and the senior PLO figures - occupy centre stage.
Their personal chemistry, swings of emotion, suspicions, eating habits,
dress styles and largely successful attempts to avoid media attention are
minutely chronicled.
So Terje Rod Larsen ( 'dresses with casual insouciance') and Mona Juul
('something wild and mysterious about her') are the Norwegian 'golden
couple' at the heart of the negotiations who sometimes exchange
'surreptitious glances of dismay'. Abu Ala is 'the Palestinian banker,
though no terrorist himself', who flies into occasional rages and must
always be given the biggest bedroom, while Uri Savir, the leading Israeli
negotiator, on his second day in Norway wanders about in jeans and T-shirt
asking: 'Where am I? Who am I? What am I doing here?'.
There is rather less detail on the actual substance of the negotiations, in
part because the process is continuing, but also because of the ambiguity
required by both sides in order in order to clinch an agreement which could
be sold to their domestic constituencies. Mutual recognition by Israel and
the PLO, implicit since the Madrid conference in 1991, was the explicit
achievement of the Oslo agreement. All the really contentious issues, such
as the future of Israeli settlements, the status of Jerusalem, and the right
of Palestinian refugees to return to their own state, have been shelved.
The resolution of those problems will depend on people who did not benefit
from the unique atmosphere created at the Norway meetings. Arafat is now
back at the centre of world attention, but also subject to greater
international scrutiny, while the deeply cautious Rabin is juggling his
every word against the stability of his coalition government.
The sudden death last month of Johan Joergen Holst, the Norwegian foreign
minister, tragically illustrated the enormous physical and emotional strains
imposed on his small team. They emerge as the true heroes. The others have
yet to prove that they are as selflessly and courageously committed to a
just and lasting peace.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: Picasso put in perspective - This week saw the opening
of one of the most memorable exhibitions ever mounted by the Tate Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There have been many exhibitions of the work of Picasso the sculptor - most
notably the pioneering study undertaken for the Arts Council by Roland
Penrose in 1967, with the active co-operation of Picasso himself, then 86.
That, too, was shown at the Tate. But between that and this present exercise
there lies a profound difference.
Picasso: Painter/Sculptor is the first exhibition of such scale and
definitive ambition to take as its subject not either aspect as a distinct,
if complementary, practice, but rather each as necessary to the other, each
feeding off the other and integral to the one, constant, creative activity.
Picasso turned to sculpture for the first time, so far as is known, around
1906, a moment of transition that saw him moving from the sweeter symbolism
of his early career, blue and rose, to something much more raw and radical.
Now, in these gently modelled heads of his mistress and companion of those
early years, Fernande Olivier, we see him quietly looking sideways at his
contemporaries, Rodin, Maillol, Brancusi and Matisse. We also clearly see in
the paintings and drawings around us that he is looking back to the radical
pictorial devices of Cezanne, and to the formal simplicity and energy of
primitive Iberian and tribal sculpture.
And yet he remains entirely himself. Already, with the Demoiselles
d'Avignon, that savage precursor of cubism, in gestation and the simple
monumental heads and figures spread all about us, his own formal resolution
of his several interests begins to declare itself in all its revolutionary
confidence and authority.
The work of this first room and period alone makes the point for the entire
exhibition, as we move from the early sculptural nudes and heads to the
first extraordinary essays into cubism. And for the first time the point is
made, and made forcibly, that cubism was not simply an exercise in reforming
and reworking the idea of rendering space and form on a plane surface.
Rather it is the essential, albeit mutually contradictory, interdependence
of the flat and the round, the real and the proposed, that is being explored
and celebrated.
By 1909 and the Head of a Woman (Fernande), with its faceted, disrupted,
almost pictorial surfaces that would yet flatten and deny its own undeniable
mass and physical presence, we have what is still one of the most remarkable
and truly revolutionary works of the century. To confront it is to be thrown
straight back to the cubist drawings and paintings to which it relates. And
they again, by the very mass and weight, space and light that they conjure
up on the flat surface, throw us back directly to the sculpture.
Picasso was not always engaged with sculpture through that long career, but
it is now clear that there was a sculptural potential or possibility in
whatever he did. Whenever he was directly so engaged, the sculpture he
produced was always keyed closely in to whatever else was in hand, used
directly to clarify the painterly preoccupation.
But to use the distinction 'painterly' at all is almost to mistake the
point, for it is rather the artist's preoccupation that was ever to be
clarified, indifferently in terms of paint or clay, ink or paper, pot or
plaster as appropriate.
Here are two late cubist still-lifes of 1914, a glass on a shelf, a knife, a
scrap of newsprint, a piece of cheese, a decorative border - only one is
cobbled together of wood and fabric all painted up, and its glass a flat
piece of wood, its wine a neat pictorial trick. Again, in 1919, a
still-life, guitar and mirror, is set up at an open window at Saint-Raphael,
and a maquette of folded paper devised as its actual subject.
So the game goes on down the years - inside and outside, the modelled form,
the flat illusion, the painted surface that bespeaks the form, the form that
confounds itself.
Still-life is perhaps the key to it, if we take the term in the broadest
sense: the model, the cat, the pots and flowers, all the paraphernalia and
detritus of studio practice, the accumulation of work against the wall,
half-finished, half-forgotten. And constantly the work itself is fed back
into the work, the work of art as its own still life, as familiar in paint
as in the round - the woman's head, goat's skull, bottle, guitar.
How various the man is. Picasso was born in 1881. He embarked upon his
cubist adventure before he was 30 and he continued active into the 1970s.
And yet there are still those who would deny the worth of his achievement,
who consider him no more than a skilful and mischievous fraud. No one would
deny Picasso the mischief, but fraud, never. Given such full retrospective
scope as now, the quality of his transforming imagination and his technical
mastery alike are manifest in everything he did, as clear in every touch of
paint on a surface as in every twist or fold of paper, or pinch of clay or
plaster. A natural painter, an instinctive sculptor, his standing as the
commanding artist of our century is obvious and inescapable.
This exhibition has been selected and introduced by Elizabeth Cowling and
John Golding, and beautifully judged and installed. They have produced one
of those rare shows, sure to live on long in the memory.
Tate Gallery, Millbank SW1, until May 8: sponsored by Ernst &amp; Young.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: Passion meets corruption and farce - Andrew St George
finds provincial theatre very much alive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Leeds, there is a fine new Death of a Salesman; at Manchester a weak new
play called The Lodger, and at Birmingham a welcome revival of The Atheist's
Tragedy.
Arthur Miller began writing Salesman (1949) in a wood shack he built in
Connecticut. He called the first draft The Inside of His Head. The West
Yorkshire Playhouse has a fine production directed by Matthew Warchus which
catches the passion and the pose of Miller's original.
As employment in the 1990s becomes less secure, Willy Loman is back in
fashion: it is absurd to expect loyalty from an employer when money is the
real issue.
Ken Stott finds a way through the part of Loman making him admirable and
contemptible, stupid to think that good individual work will be valued by an
institution. His is a good performance, knotty on his own, yet pliable with
others. Ellie Haddington plays Linda superbly: strong, uncomplaining and
baffled by what is slowly killing her husband. A fine performance like this
shifts the play towards Linda, making it her story too.
Warchus uses an open set crossed by events from Loman's past which still
seem real and have an effect: inside his head is just right. The second half
is inside the house looking out, making the wide stage into an intimate
family space.
Further south, we reach the bedsit suburbs of The Lodger at The Royal
Exchange Theatre, Manchester. The play won the 1992 Mobil play writing
competition run by the Royal Exchange. It is written by Simon Burke, an
accomplished television writer. This play suits itself to the literary
prize: it has sex, drugs, police corruption and romance in committee-winning
equilibrium, wrapped in a producer-friendly small cast.
Detective Constable Wise has a mortgage to pay and a room to rent. He takes
in Lois, who uses the DC's back bedroom for immoral purposes. Then Lois's
pimp turns up from King's Cross, and they go back into business. Finally,
enter DC Reed, Wise's colleague, who discovers what the ironically named
Wise has failed to do: the truth about Lois. Domestic violence ensues.
The strongest aspect of the production is Julian McGowan's fine set. It lays
out the twilight bedsit world as a fluorescent ground plan, like the glowing
ruins of an old domestic settlement worn down to the foundations. The walls
light up as the action moves.
The two principals, Julia Ford (Lois) and Philip Jackson (Wise) conjure a
workable relationship from the script. In the programme Burke describes the
play as 'indeed nasty brutish and short'; good to have Burke on Hobbes, but
it should be more of all three.
Machiavelli is the philosopher of choice at Birmingham Rep's otiose
production of Cyril Tourneur's Atheist's Tragedy (c. 1606-11). This ripping
revenge horror is carried by the excellent Gerard Murphy as the scheming
D'Amville. This is an unusual play, bravely staged and worth seeing for
Murphy alone.
Seen as a whole, this piece of Jacobean horror runs of sophisticated lines;
watching it is like seeing a proof of Chaos Theory in the theatre where a
small event changes the whole picture.
The play is so wild, careening from terror to farce in a single leap, that
Anthony Clark's direction is caught flat- footed. There is an unnecessary
X-Rated brothel scene, and some sub-Hamlet goings-on in a graveyard which
slip out of control.
Tourneur's characters here represent nothing more than themselves, instead
of the viewpoints he meant them for. Their semi-modern costumes leave them
midway between Renaissance swagger and Cowardly poise.
The farce and horror mix uneasily: 'Draw out mine eyeballs and make envious
fortune play at tennis with them.' The latinate language is straight from
Jonson and the sentiment direct from Shakespeare: 'Our own constructions are
the authors of our misery.'

This year's two retrospectives are devoted to Erich Von Stroheim and Sophia
Loren: strange - nay mind-boggling - bedfellows. Erich's is the face louring
from the posters with monocle, army cap and interrogation-room stare.
Sophia's is the face with sunripe pout and cascading Mediterranean locks.
The twinning is surely symbolic. Put Prussian strictness with Mediterranean
hedonism and what do you get? Something like the 44th Berlin Filmfestspiele
itself. The festival, like most of world cinema today, is caught between
pleasure-principle picturegoing and the old ethic of art through pain.
Nowhere is the tension greater than in the two main movie-marathons, both
French.
Jacques Rivette's six-hour, two-part Jeanne La Pucelle was shown within the
same 24 hours as Alain Resnais's 4 3/4 -hour, two-film diptych Smoking and
No Smoking, based on Alan Ayckbourn's play cycle Intimate Exchanges.
Both films flirt with avant-gardism while simultaneously wooing le grand
public. Rivette's epic passes Joan of Arc's story through the deconstruction
machine: no windy heroics, much blending of Brechtian tableaux with
Bressonian line-delivery. (Never let the voice range beyond one octave.) But
the film is still a surprising dollop of colour, accessibility and class
performances from the hitherto hermetic Rivette.
Resnais, 30 years after Marienbad, is still exploring the paradoxes of time
and memory. But this time it is 'Last Year In Hutton Buscel'. Here in
Ayckbourn's twee north-east English town (Scarborough by another name, but
all conjured on a soundstage), a headmaster (Pierre Arditti) and his wife
(Sabine Azema) and six other characters (all played by Arditti and Azema)
play Musical Destinies with a story scripted for multiple-choice
developments. Now she runs off with the gardener; now she doesn't. Now he
falls in love with the daily help; now he doesn't. Resnais/Ayckbourn keep
pressing that narrative rewind button.
I thought Rivette won the Old French Masters prizefight. Resnais keeps
dancing over the same stretch of canvas until interest yields to tedium. But
Rivette, boxing clever with history, makes his Joan (superbly played by
Sandrine Bonnaire) both a myth-glamourised icon and a modern girl fighting
for sexual-political equality. The film is accurate, it claims, to every dot
and comma of researched history. Hence no doubt its teasing rhythm,
alternating a quotidian banality of bills and meals and social minutiae with
the horrors and heroisms of war.
Shown in the noncompetitive Panorama section, Rivette's film is not in the
running for prizes. The favourite Golden Bear challengers so far are
Krszystof Kieslowski's Three Colours White and Tomas Gutierrez Alea's
Strawberry And Chocolate from Cuba.
The Polish film is part two of Kieslowski's tricouleur trilogy, tackling
'Equality' after his Blue dealt with 'Liberty.' (You need a computer to keep
up with all the diptychs, trilogies and films fleuves of modern cinema). For
a movie called White this comedy is bracingly black. It is very funny about
life in 'liberated' Eastern Europe, where the Warsovian hero (Zbiegniew
Zamachowski), scheming to lure his estranged French girlfriend over from
Paris, can buy anything on the markets of the New Capitalism from used cars
to dead bodies. All come in handy as the plot shifts gear all the way from
gentle romance to cynical overdrive.
Strawberry And Chocolate is also free with the gear-shift. For romance, here
is one-sided gay passion between young Diego (Jorge Perrugorria), an artist
whose high-camp manners and high-risk artworks attract the attentions of the
State, and the 'straight' young Communist David (Vladimir Cruz) sent in to
sound him out or set him right. For cynicism, here are buckets of witty
scorn thrown over the prejudices and repressive edicts of Castro's Cuba.
But Berlin has long been the cinematic capital of gay liberation. The most
fanfared American competition entry here is Philadelphia, with
Oscar-nominated Tom Hanks fighting Aids and homophobia from a Hollywood
hospital bed. Also rallying to the demo have been Zero Patience ('first ever
Aids musical'), Grief (almost first ever Aids comedy), Go Fire (no Aids, but
lots of lesbians) and Coming Out Under Fire and One Nation Under God
(gayness and anti-gayness in America and points East).
Moral: a city with the world's most famous fallen Wall knows all about
barriers between people and how to deal with them. Ironically, the one
barrier Berlin is still struggling to demolish, cinematically, is that
between East and West. Every year the festival proclaims its chief loyalty
to Europe, especially the neglected movie cultures of the former East; then
it exasperates everyone by filling the cinemas with films from the US.
This has two effects. It gives Berlin a schizoid personality: paying lip
service to Our Art while showcasing Their Entertainment. And it allows
Hollywood bounce and professionalism to expose the inadequacies of much
modern Euro-fare.
Who wants to sit through another dog-eared, chain-smoking French policier
even when lent spurious novelty value by a bisexual woman sleuth (Anemone in
Tonie Marshall's Pas Tres Catholique); or a damp-squib German satire about
film-making (Reinhard Munster's Back To Square One); or another Russian
movie attempting to revive the stylistic ghost of Tarkovsky (Aleksandr
Sokurov's Whispering Pages)?
Even Asia, regular miracle-worker at recent Euro-festivals, has failed to
deliver the goods at Berlin '94. Try China-Hong Kong's Competition-opener
Sparkling Fox, a sort of reject Aesop fable hijacked by the Orient, or
Japan's 800 Two-Lap Runners, all about the existential tremors of school
track-racing.
By contrast America, even outside the Competition, gave us DW Pennebaker's
humming docu-feature about the Clinton presidential campaign The War Room;
Francois Girard's massively witty mock-biopic 32 Short Films About Glenn
Gould, a sort of musicological Citizen Kane; and my favourite fringe lunacy
at Berlin to date, the documentary Tigrero.
Though this has a Finnish director, Miko Kaurismaki, the stars, story and
inspiration all come from across the Atlantic. We watch US film-makers Sam
Fuller and Jim Jarmusch revisit the Brazilian jungle where Sam, 40 years
ago, shot footage for an aborted John Wayne movie, the eponymous Tigrero.
Scratching around for memories and survivors, their double act plays like a
lost-in-the-forest version of Waiting For Godot. Jarmusch is droll and
deadpan; Fuller is crackpot and garrulous; the scenery is surreal; and the
Indians stand around wondering what has hit them and how long the Mad People
from Hollywood are staying. At Berlin, as far as many of us in this jungle
are concerned, they can stay indefinitely.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: All change at Arts Council - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT

<TEXT>
Anthony Everitt, who resigned yesterday as secretary general of the Arts
Council with one year of his contract still to run, has done the wise thing.
It is unlikely that Lord Gowrie, who takes over as chairman on April 1,
would have wanted his contract renewed. Everitt can now depart on the same
day as Lord Palumbo, and an era will come to an end.
The two men can be proud of the money they squeezed out of the government
over the years; less happy about the initiatives they launched which tended
to flounder or cause uproar. It was not specifically the fracas over the
London orchestras' funding which prompted Everitt's decision, but the
debacle came to symbolise indecisiveness at the top.
Significantly, all four men concerned with trying to create a super
orchestra - Lord Palumbo, Everitt, music director Ken Baird, and head of the
music panel Bryan Magee - are going or gone. Five Council members are also
due to retire. Grey Gowrie has a clear playing field in terms of personnel
and no obvious organisational nightmares. Everitt, who is returning to his
old life as a journalist, commented ruefully yesterday that, after spending
all this time in committees working out new structures, his successor can
enjoy himself with the arts.
Thoughts naturally turn to his successor. It is unlikely that his deputy
Mary Allen will rise to the post. The front runners must be Colin Tweedy,
who has run ABSA for over ten years and earned a bigger job; Timothy Mason,
once boss of the Scottish Arts Council and now licking the London Arts Board
into shape; and Mike Elliott of West Midland Arts, with Clive Priestley,
management consultant turned arts lover, as outsider.
It looked nasty on Wednesday night as the crowd pressed round the building.
A security guard tried to calm things with a megaphone, but with little
success. Tempers were frayed; there was real anger.
The disgruntled throng was the Friends of the Tate being forbidden entry to
the Picasso exhibition. The Tate had completely misjudged the numbers
anxious to see the show at the members' private evening. Six thousand turned
up; the gates had to be closed and hundreds went away frustrated. Millbank
was locked solid and became a no go area for taxis.
The Picasso show could be the most successful in the Tate's history. On the
first day paid admissions exceeded 3,500, which suggests a total attendance
approaching 300,000. Only the 1976 Constable exhibition, which attracted
313,000, is likely to prove more popular.
Don't phone Alan Ayckbourn over the next few days: the nation's most
performed living playwright is setting the week aside to create his 47nd
play. At the moment it is shaping up as a work of Hitchcockian menace, but
that could change. His last play started as a time travel comedy and then
turned nasty.
Ayckbourn was in Rome this week, which was a surprise since he hates
travelling and rarely leaves Scarborough. But as Montblanc, the luxury pen
people, was awarding him Dollars 25,000 as the European winner of its annual
culture prize, he made the trip. The money goes straight into his special
cause, the removal of his theatre, the Stephen Joseph Theatre in the Round,
from its cramped premises in a former school into a refurbished 1930s Odeon
cinema.
With luck the new theatre will open in the heart of Scarborough next spring.
There will be a small studio space seating up to 200, and a bigger area,
seating 400, and still in-the-round. The project costs Pounds 4.3m.
Ayckbourn has raised Pounds 2.4m and is not proud. 'We want one big sponsor
and will sell the name. I'm quite happy for it to be called after Mrs
Toshiba's granny'.
Ayckbourn has no wish to concentrate all his energies as artistic director
of the theatre. 'I've got at present two or three ideas banging around in my
head.' The plays will still flow. But fund raising is his current
pre-occupation. 'It's hard to prime the rusty Yorkshire pump. When I
approach local businessmen they say 'if its going to be that good, why are
you doing it here?''.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: Anti-abortionists linked to theft of 'The Scream'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The theft of Norway's most famous work of art took a bizarre twist this week
when two ex-communicated, anti-abortion activist priests from the country's
state Lutheran church hinted they may be connected to the crime.
Edvard Munch's 'The Scream' was stolen last Saturday from Norway's National
Gallery in Oslo. The painting had been moved to the first floor of the
gallery to allow easier access to a collection of Munch's emotionally
charged works during a special exhibition coinciding with the Lillehammer
Winter Olympics.
The theft, which took less than one minute and was filmed by video
surveillance cameras, has deeply embarrassed the government and caused a
public outcry in Norway over lax security of the country's art treasures.
On Thursday an anonymous fax linked to Borre Knudsen and Ludvig Nessa, the
two former priests, was sent to the Norwegian press. It showed a drawing of
a foetus with a woman, echoing 'The Scream', and asked the question: 'Which
is of greater value a child or a painting?'
Knudsen, interviewed on NRK national radio, said he would be willing to
steal 'The Scream' to promote his views. He suggested Munch's painting could
be recovered if the controversial anti-abortion film The Silent Scream was
shown on national television.
The investigation continues but many are sceptical about the activists'
connection to the theft and believe the pair may have sought to link
themselves to the theft in a ploy to gain media attention during the Winter
Olympics.
